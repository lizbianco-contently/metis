Madam President, for weeks Americans old and young have \nbeen speaking out against the Republican plan to kill Medicare. It is \nnot just Democrats. Republicans have been speaking out against it too.\n  Newt Gingrich called it a radical plan and ``right-wing social \nengineering.'' Several Republican Senators have similarly spoken out, \ncalling it what it really is, a plan that would shatter a cornerstone \nof our society and break our promise to the elderly and to the sick.\n  Last night, though, the most important voices were heard. American \nvoters had their first chance to do something about it. They went to \nthe polls and resoundingly rejected that plan and the candidate who ran \non that plan's promise to dismantle Medicare.\n  In a special congressional election in upstate New York, the \nRepublican plan to kill Medicare was the No. 1 issue. It was the No. 2 \nissue. It was the No. 3 issue. It is what the voters most cared about \nand were most scared about, as well they should be.\n  Here is what it would do: It would turn over seniors' health to \nprofit-hungry insurance companies. It would let bureaucrats decide what \ntests and treatments seniors get. It would ask seniors to pay more for \ntheir health care in exchange for fewer benefits. That is a bad deal \nall around.\n  What is telling is not just that the voters rejected this plan, it is \nthat the Republican candidate pushing the Republican plan to kill \nMedicare was rejected in a very Republican district.\n\n[[Page S3290]]\n\nThe district, which stretches from Buffalo to Rochester, has been in \nRepublican hands for four decades. It produced influential Republicans \nsuch as Jack Kemp, whom I served in Congress with. He served in the \nCabinet. He ran on the Presidential ticket as a vice presidential \ncandidate.\n  Last night's special election was held to replace a Republican \nCongressman who won that seat by a 3-to-1 margin. John McCain won the \ndistrict in 2008. George W. Bush won the district 4 years earlier. Last \nyear's Republican candidate for Governor in New York lost in a \nlandslide. But he won big in that district. That is how conservative it \nis.\n  Democrats in Congress and even some candid Republicans know the \nRepublican plan to kill Medicare is irresponsible and indefensible. \nLast night voters showed the country and the Congress that they know it \ntoo.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/25/senate-section/article/S3290-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, sometime today or tomorrow, Senate \nDemocrats will have an opportunity to show what kind of future they \nbelieve in. They can vote for one of the Republican plans to get our \nNation's finances under control, each of which involves the kind of \ntough choices we will need to make to bring down our deficits and debt, \nor they can vote on the President's plan, which continues the \nunsustainable status quo. A vote to preserve our very way of life or \nthrow it in jeopardy.\n  It is interesting; when the President first announced his budget, \nmost people panned it as tepid and irresponsible. The Washington Post \nsummed it up pretty well by saying the President punted. Yet Senate \nDemocrats embraced it.\n  The senior Senator from New York said the President's budget should \nhave bipartisan support.\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee gave the President, ``good \ngrades for a beginning.''\n  Other Democrat Senators called the President's budget ``a step in the \nright direction'' . . . ``an important step forward''. . . ``a good \nstart'' . . . and ``a credible blueprint.''\n  One even described it as ``wise.''\n  That was then. How about today? Well, if we are to believe the news \nreports, every single Democrat in the Senate now plans to vote against \nthe President's budget. They do not even want to use it as a starting \npoint. Why? We got the answer earlier this week from Senator Schumer, \nwhen he indicated that Democrats now believe avoiding this debate \naltogether helps them in the next election.\n  In other words, they think it is better not to keep track of our \nNation's finances at all than to support any plan that does. So much so \nthat they are about to reject a budget that even they embraced a few \nmonths ago. They will vote against every budget that comes to the \nfloor, including the President's.\n  Six weeks after the Democrat cochairman of the President's own debt \ncommission told us that our Nation's deficits and debt are like a \ncancer that threatens to destroy America from within, Democrats are \nready to call it a work period without supporting any of the proposals \nthat have been made, without producing anything of their own.\n  Nothing. That is their answer to this crisis.\n  Their focus is on an election that is still almost 2 years away.\n  I think it is a mistake. At a moment when our debts and deficits \nthreaten the very future of our Nation, Democrats have no excuse for \nproposing no vision of their own. There is no defense.\n  Washington is currently on pace to spend about $1.6 trillion more \nthan it takes in this year, three times the biggest deficit we ever had \nbefore President Obama took office.\n  Members of the President's own Cabinet admitted last week that \nMedicare is in need of urgent reform if we want to preserve it for \nfuture generations.\n  Congressman Ryan has shown courage by proposing a budget that would \ntackle these problems.\n  Democrats are showing none by ignoring our problems altogether. This \nis the contrast Americans will see in the Senate this week. More than 2 \nyears have passed since Democrats have produced a budget of their own. \nThis is a complete and total abdication of their responsibilities. And \nthere is no excuse for it. We have an obligation to come up with a \nplan. Democrats are officially abdicating that responsibility this \nweek.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/25/senate-section/article/S3290-3", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, in the course of our lives, one of the \nmost difficult moments we face is to say goodbye to a parent. No matter \nhow old we are or how old they are or even how long they've struggled \nwith illness and infirmity, when you lose your mother or father, you \nare reminded again what it means to be someone's child, and it hits you \nright in the gut just how much you depend on your mother and father. It \nis difficult, and it has been particularly difficult for the O'Brien \nfamily of Marshfield Hills, MA, which just this month lost their \npatriarch, Edward Lawrence O'Brien, who was an extraordinary blessing \nto his family, and his friends, but also to the country he loved, which \nhe served in the U.S. Navy. And his passing is a profound loss to us \nall.\n  Ed leaves behind his loving wife Marge, his brother Gene, 6 devoted \nchildren and 17 adoring grandchildren. His son Drew has served the \npeople of Massachusetts as my State director for almost a decade, \nliving the spirit of public service that Ed instilled and inspired in \nall of his family. Ed was, to borrow a phrase Tip O'Neill liked so \nmuch, ``a beautiful person,'' and I enjoyed meeting him on several \noccasions. Our last meeting will be with me forever, when I had the \nprivilege of presenting him with his World War II medals for his \nservice in the Pacific. He was so content and had such a great smile on \nhis face, a twinkle in his eye which never deserted him even as he \nbravely battled and accepted the illness that would take him from his \nfamily after 86 years extraordinarily well-lived.\n  Ed served proudly in the Navy during World War II, including the \ninvasion of Okinawa. He embodied what we now know as ``The Greatest \nGeneration'' of Americans who defended America and saved democracy for \nthe world. He earned numerous decorations, including the Combat Action \nRibbon, the Asiatic Pacific Campaign Medal with a silver star and a \nbronze star, and the European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal.\n  Ed was a patriot who stood by his country and his family with equal \nmeasures of devotion. Indeed, the mass lovingly put together by his \nfamily told the story of a man who loved his friends, who loved his \nfamily, who loved his God--the God who, in the words of the old Irish \nhymn he enjoyed so, was his vision, his battle shield, his sword for \nthe fight, his dignity and his delight. In his eulogy for his father, \nDrew O'Brien offered great comfort to all who mourned with him, \nespecially Ed and Marge's 17 grandchildren. ``For the rest of your \nlife,'' Drew told them, ``carry him with you in your heart--never \nforget the love he offered, the lessons he taught, the stories he told \nor the fun that you had with him.''\n  Drew's eulogy is a wonderful tribute to a father's legacy and a son's \nenduring love and today I would like to share it with my colleagues in \nthe U.S. Senate by having it printed in the Congressional Record. And \nwith that request, I would also like to--on behalf of\n\n[[Page S3291]]\n\nmy entire office and all those who know and love Drew--again extend our \ndeepest sympathies and condolences to the entire O'Brien family: \nMichael O'Brien, his wife Kathryn and their children, Michael, Caroline \nand Elizabeth; Jim O'Brien, his wife Irene and their children, Johanna \nand Theresa; Kevin O'Brien, his wife Rozilyn and their children, \nDaniel, Christopher, Sean and Julia; Joanne O'Brien Hudson, her husband \nRichard and their children, Mary, Anne and Meaghan; Lawrence O'Brien, \nhis wife Patty Roper and their children, Siobhan, Rachel and Kate; and \nDrew O'Brien, wife Michelle Consalvo and their children, Natalie and \nMatthew.\n  And to Drew, I would also like to say that, having lost my own father \nnow 11 years ago this summer, please know that while the hurt of the \nloss never goes away, with the passage of time you remember the good \nmoments and the best lessons more and more. You'll always look up and \nsee your Dad proudly looking over you. And because Drew is such a gift \nto all of us, I also wish to thank Ed and Margaret, his dearest \n``Margie,'' for the extraordinary family they created, nurtured and \nloved. And to Ed O'Brien, this great Navy man now at rest on still \nwaters in heaven, I bid you ``fair winds and following seas.''\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the eulogy by Drew \nO'Brien be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         In Remembrance of Dad\n\n                    (By Drew O'Brien, May 16, 2011)\n\n       My family and I want to thank everyone who is here with us \n     this morning, and all who came through MacDonald's yesterday \n     for participating in these celebrations of Dad's life. I \n     think I speak for everybody when I say it was overwhelming in \n     its comfort. Thank you so much.\n       For my brothers--Michael, Kevin, Jim, Lawrence, our sister \n     Joanne and me--a special thank you has to go out to each of \n     our spouses and our families. Kim, Lyn, Irene, Rick, Patty \n     and Michelle. You were all so patient and supportive when we \n     had to stop the clock of our everyday lives to help Dad. Dad \n     loved and cherished each of you, and I know he recognized and \n     appreciated the sacrifice you made.\n       There are people, too many to list, who have helped us and \n     Dad over the past few months, in hospitals all around \n     Massachusetts. They are owed a personal debt of gratitude \n     that simply cannot be repaid. But they deserve our \n     recognition this morning. Thank you to all of them.\n       We are here this morning to celebrate and honor the long \n     and blessed life of Edward Lawrence O'Brien, just eight days \n     shy of his 85th birthday.\n       How to do that with brevity, simplicity and accuracy?\n       In a word: love.\n       He was all about the love.\n       He loved his garden. He loved to take a ride in the car \n     with Mom on a nice Sunday afternoon, usually after an early \n     Sunday dinner--which he also loved. He loved his Irish \n     heritage deeply and he loved his still-ongoing genealogy \n     project. He loved to go flounder fishing right off the South \n     Shore here. He loved to go camping--loved a good campfire and \n     loved it when we were all around it. He loved to travel--and \n     he and Mom traveled a lot in his long retirement. He loved a \n     nice hot cup of tea, and he loved a glass of cold beer. \n     Sometimes two. He loved newspapers, especially his Patriot \n     Ledger. He loved crossword puzzles. He loved a good spy \n     novel--Robert Ludlum and John LeCarre. He loved jazz and big \n     band music. He loved Brooklyn, his hometown. He loved Bishop \n     Loughlin High School there. He loved the University of \n     Missouri. He loved the United States Navy. He loved Liberty \n     Mutual, where he spent so much of his life. He loved to watch \n     TV shows and movies, and was one of the first people I knew \n     to get a TiVo. He amassed a video collection that would make \n     most production houses either envious, or initiate a lawsuit. \n     He loved to get underneath a car and change the oil or fix \n     the brakes. He loved to watch a good basketball game and, \n     back in the day, he played a pretty good one too. He loved \n     his yard, his grass and his flowers--and he knew that a rainy \n     day in May was good for them, and we need to remember that on \n     this rainy day in May. Inside that yard on Idylwilde Circle \n     was a house he loved. For a kid from Brooklyn, it was almost \n     a dream come true.\n       I say ``almost'' because it's what he put in that house \n     that made the dream come true. His two big loves: his family \n     and his faith.\n       We can't talk about family without talking about Mom. He \n     called her Marge, sometimes Margie. He loved her so much and \n     was so devoted to her. For nearly 57 years, they were side by \n     side in marriage, and they were rarely apart. Together they \n     made a home for us that, despite the occasional adolescent \n     chaos, inspired a love and devotion that we all hold for each \n     other still and have extended to our own families. Together \n     they are the best examples of parents you could ever ask for \n     or imagine. Thank you, Mom and Dad.\n       My brothers and sister know that the finest way to honor \n     Dad's life is to bring comfort and love to Mom in the days \n     ahead. I know we will all do that and do that together.\n       All six of us know how much Dad loved us and how devoted he \n     was to us and he showed it in many different ways. He was the \n     one who taught you how to throw the ball, ride the bike or \n     shoot the basket. He fixed the dollhouses, ``fine tuned'' the \n     science projects--usually long after we had gone to sleep, \n     and quietly replaced the windows broken by either a stray \n     elbow or a stray basketball. He pushed us in school, steered \n     us towards college, was always there to talk about issues at \n     work and shaped us into the men and woman we all are today. \n     We are all blessed and fortunate to call him our Dad.\n       For almost twenty-six years he was Grandpa--his favorite \n     role in life. All seventeen of his grandchildren are here \n     this morning--he loved you, found excitement and joy in you \n     and the things you did and thought you were the greatest \n     things to walk the earth. Take comfort today in the fact that \n     he knew how much you loved him. For the rest of your life, \n     carry him with you in your heart--never forget the love he \n     offered, the lessons he taught, the stories he told or the \n     fun that you had with him.\n       Dad's brother, our Uncle Gene, is here today with us, along \n     with his family. Uncle Gene knew Dad longer than anyone and \n     his sense of loss is profound and sad in ways that many of us \n     simply might not understand. Thank you Uncle Gene for loving \n     Dad so much and for so long.\n       And thank you to all our cousins and relatives who came--\n     many from long distances--to be with us to honor Dad today.\n       Dad's other big love in life is the reason we are all \n     gathered together this morning at Saint Christine's: his \n     faith. This church was a very important part of our lives \n     growing up--in many ways an extension of our own home. All of \n     us here this morning can draw comfort and strength in the \n     fact that Dad believed very deeply in God, and that he \n     practiced that belief every day--not just in attending daily \n     Mass, but in everything he did. He believed deeply in the \n     Rite of the Eucharist--the very Mass we celebrate this \n     morning. Most important of all, he believed deeply in the \n     Resurrection and in Eternal Life. His faith was a special \n     gift. That gift is still here and all of us can find comfort \n     and solace and inspiration in it.\n       I'd like to leave you with one final thought this morning.\n       In addition to being all about the love, many of you know \n     that Dad was all about the conversation. We've all heard it \n     so much these past days--how friendly he was, how nice he was \n     to talk to. He had what the Irish call the ``gift of gab.'' \n     And he was well-known and beloved for it.\n       He'd smile at and talk to people anywhere he was--the post \n     office, the bank, the grocery store, the waiting room at the \n     dentist's office, South Station, outside of church, inside of \n     church--did not matter if you were a neighbor, or a complete \n     stranger. It is an amazing attribute and it is not lost on me \n     that perhaps the wrong person in the family got involved in \n     politics.\n       Admittedly, it could get a little exasperating. You'd be on \n     your way with him somewhere, usually under some timeline, \n     you'd turn around and he wouldn't be there. He was back at \n     the last intersection asking the bike courier where he went \n     to school and what he was going to do with his life. And \n     questions were not the end of it, there was always an \n     ``advice-dispensing'' component as well--``you should go to \n     UMass'' or ``you should try Harvard Extension'' or ``you \n     should try and get yourself some office experience.'' It was \n     classic Dad.\n       One gray morning last December, I arrived at work early and \n     decided to run some Christmas errands. We knew Dad was sick, \n     and I was worried and sad. As I walked down Washington Street \n     in Boston, I found myself saying hello to the morning \n     commuters, hurrying in the cold to get from the T station to \n     their offices. Complete strangers. A few looked at me like I \n     was insane, but most of them smiled back, said ``good \n     morning'' and I even got an occasional ``Merry Christmas.'' \n     It felt good. It lifted my spirits. And I understood.\n       It was Dad. It was his spirit. It was his love. It was his \n     faith.\n       And that same spirit and love and faith of his--they are \n     all here with us today and will be every day.\n       In the days ahead, take a moment to say hello to someone \n     you don't know. And when you do, think of my Dad--his spirit, \n     his love, his faith.\n       God Bless you Dad. We love you and we miss you and we will \n     never forget you. Rest in peace.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S3292]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/25/senate-section/article/S3292-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3292-S3293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                              PATRIOT ACT\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I know Senator Blumenthal \nis coming to speak and Senator Kerry ended a little bit early. I wish \nto get up for a couple minutes now, and when Senator Blumenthal comes \nin I will yield to him because he has some time reserved.\n  I wish to talk this morning a little bit about the procedure and what \nwe have gone through, in terms of the PATRIOT Act.\n  I am very discouraged to see the path we are headed down in terms of \nthe PATRIOT Act. I was in the Congress, as the Presiding Officer knows, \nwhen we voted almost 10 years ago on the PATRIOT Act. It was a sad \noccasion then because it was right after 9/11 and that horrible tragedy \nhad happened to our country. But we rushed, in a very big way, to move \nforward with a piece of legislation, the so-called PATRIOT Act. That \nact ended up being something I think many of us regret.\n  I wish to read a short passage from the Washington Post at the time, \nwhich I think showed the haste in which we acted, where we infringed on \nour constitutional rights, and I think the Post says it all. They \nnoted:\n\n       Members of both parties complained they had no idea what \n     they were voting on, were fearful that aspects of the . . . \n     bill went too far--yet voted for it anyway.\n\n  I can tell you that, at the time, that is the way it was. We were on \nthe floor, we had the vote, and nobody knew what was in the bill. I \nremember one Congressman waiving a copy of the bill, saying there is \nonly one copy on the floor and it is hot off the Xerox machine. So it \nis unfortunate we moved so quickly, with so much haste.\n  Almost 10 years later, we have not had the debate we need to have on \nthis piece of legislation. The greatest deliberative body has not \nweighed in with amendments. We have not moved forward in a serious way \nto try to tackle this piece of legislation that is so important to our \ncountry, important to our freedom, and important to our liberty.\n  What are the problems we should be dealing with? Just very quickly--I \nknow my colleague, Senator Blumenthal, is here, so I will quickly move \non. But two things have happened that indicate we have some serious \nproblems with the PATRIOT Act. No. 1, in March of 2007, the inspector \ngeneral of the Department of Justice, in a report concluded that ``the \nFBI engaged in serious misuse of national security letter authority.'' \nThe report also said that ``in many instances, the FBI's misuse of \nnational security letters violated NSL statutes, Attorney General \nguidelines, or the FBI's own internal policies.''\n  So there we have an inspector general telling us that the executive \nbranch, with the piece of legislation, moved way beyond where they \nshould. That is something we should take a hard look at. I have an \namendment, and I know others do, on that.\n  There have also been courts that have looked at parts of the PATRIOT \nAct and found that act to be unconstitutional. It is incumbent upon us, \nwhen we have a ruling such as that, to look at it and offer amendments \nand try to make changes.\n  I harken back to what I remember reflecting on, on that day when we \npassed the act. Benjamin Franklin--talking about our precious freedom \nand liberty--said this, and I will paraphrase. He said something along \nthese lines: Those who would sacrifice liberty for security deserve \nneither. So that is where we are today.\n  The so-called PATRIOT Act was enacted nearly a decade ago. Hastily \npassed by a Congress left reeling in the wake of a devastating \nterrorist attack on our Nation. Its supporters described it as a way to \nprotect our Nation from similar attacks in the future. But this far-\nreaching piece of legislation went much farther than that. The PATRIOT \nAct's most enduring legacy is this: It gave the Federal Government the \npower to undermine the constitutional right to privacy of law-abiding \ncitizens.\n  I was a Member of the House of Representatives at the time. One of \nonly 66 Members to vote against passing the PATRIOT Act. It was an \nunpopular vote at the time. But when the details of the new law were \nexamined, its breaches on our civil liberties became clearer. And the \ntruth came out. As I have said, the Washington Post noted, ``members of \nboth parties complained they had no idea what they were voting on, were \nfearful that aspects of the . . . bill went too far--yet voted for it \nanyway.''\n  I also voted against the reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act in 2006, \nas well as the FISA Amendments Act of 2008. In February, I once again \nopposed the extension of three controversial provisions of the PATRIOT \nAct: roving wiretaps . . . government access to ``any tangible items'' \nsuch as library and business records . . . and the surveillance of \ntargets who are not connected to an identified terrorist group.\n  Back in 2001, I said on the House floor that I was ``unable to \nsupport this bill because it does not strike the right balance between \nprotecting our liberties and providing for the security of our \ncitizens.''\n  I went on to explain that ``the saving grace here is that the sunset \nprovision forces us to come back and to look at these issues again when \nheads are cooler and when we are not in the heat of battle.''\n  And that is exactly what we should do. To govern in a post-9/11 \nworld, we have to strike a delicate balance: We must prevent the \nterrorist actions of some, without infringing on the constitutional \nguarantees of the vast many. We are failing to strike that balance \ntoday by forcing reauthorizations of the PATRIOT Act without \nscrutinizing the long-term ramifications of the law.\n  Voting for the PATRIOT Act in the shadow of the 9/11 attacks was \njustifiable for many; that horrific day created an unparalleled sense \nof urgency. Today, we are once again up against a sense of urgency to \nrenew the controversial provisions of the law set to expire this week.\n  But it's no longer due to a recent attack. Instead, the urgency has \nbeen created by the false argument that our Nation will be more \nvulnerable to attack if we dare to let the provisions expire.\n  Let's be honest in this debate--not act hastily out of false fears. \nEven if the provisions expire, the sunsets contain an exception for \nongoing investigations. And the government can continue to use those \nprovisions beyond this week.\n  Perhaps the real fear is that the time it would take for real debate \nmight postpone our Memorial Day recess. We were promised a real debate \non this reauthorization, and we should have it!\n  With a decade of hindsight, more voices from very different places on \nthe political spectrum agree--the entire law bears scrutiny and debate. \nWe can no longer neglect our duty. It is our responsibility to review \nthe full scope of a law with such serious constitutional challenges \nbefore rushing to reauthorize it, again.\n  I have filed two amendments that I hope the Senate will consider and \nvote on.\n  The first is very simple. It extends the expiring provisions until \nSeptember so that we can have a real, substantive debate and an open \namendment process. This is what we thought the 3-month extension passed \nin February was intended to do, but adequate floor time was never \nscheduled and we have been extremely limited in our ability to offer \namendments.\n  This is by no means an ideal solution. In fact, I voted against the \nshort-term extension in February. But if our options are an extension \nuntil September and an extension until 2015, I am willing to accept the \nlesser of two evils. I thank Senator Merkley for cosponsoring this \namendment.\n  The second amendment I have filed would reinstate a sunset provision \nfor national security letters. This provision was in Senator Leahy's \nbill that was reported out of his committee and is in his amendment, \nbut I feel strongly that it should also be considered as a stand-alone \nbecause of the importance of this issue.\n  National security letters do not require a court order. They are a \nform of administrative subpoena issued by FBI agents and other \nofficials. A March 2007 report by the Department of Justice inspector \ngeneral ``concluded that the FBI engaged in serious misuse of NSL \nauthority.''\n  It also said that ``in many instances, the FBI's misuse of national \nsecurity letters violated NSL statutes, Attorney General guidelines, or \nthe FBI's own internal policies.''\n  I believe that there must be a sunset provision for NSLs to ensure \nthat Congress periodically reevaluates this\n\n[[Page S3293]]\n\npower and is certain that it is not being abused.\n  I have also signed on as a cosponsor to several of my colleagues' \namendments. Let me just comment briefly about some of these.\n  In addition to my NSL amendment, I cosponsored Senator Paul's \namendment that prohibits any officer or employee of the United States \nfrom issuing an NSL unless a FISA court judge finds that probable cause \nexists to issue the NSL. This would bring NSLs into compliance with the \nplain text of fourth amendment.\n  I am pleased to join Senators Mark Udall and Paul on an amendment \nthat would eliminate the possibility of ``John Doe'' roving wiretaps \nthat identify neither the person nor the phone to be wiretapped. This \nwould protect innocent Americans from unnecessary surveillance and was \npart of the JUSTICE Act that I cosponsored in the last Congress.\n  I have also cosponsored Mark Udall's amendment that would direct the \nattorney general to only delegate the authority for approving ``lone \nwolf'' surveillance to the deputy attorney general. It would also \nrequire the attorney general to provide notice to Congress of \napplications for ``lone wolf'' surveillance.\n  Finally, with Senator Sanders, I have cosponsored an amendment that \nexempts libraries and bookstores from section 215 orders and NSLs. A \nsimilar amendment passed the House 287-238 in the 2005 PATRIOT Act \ndebate, but was later dropped in conference.\n  The ACLU, the American Booksellers Association, the American Library \nAssociation, and the Campaign for Reader Privacy all support this \namendment.\n  All of these amendments are designed to protect the civil liberties \nof all Americans and each deserves a full debate on the floor and an \nup-or-down vote by the Members of this body. Failing to do so is once \nagain failing to provide the adequate time and consideration of this \nfar-reaching legislation.\n  As a former Federal prosecutor and New Mexico's attorney general, I \nam familiar with the needs of law enforcement to pursue suspects and a \nstrong supporter of law enforcement. But I also believe that our \nConstitution must be guarded against encroachment, even in the name of \nsecurity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, last week I came to the Senate floor to \ntalk about the crushing burden of debt that will soon be coming our way \nbecause of government spending, mainly driven by entitlement programs. \nI noted that our unfunded liabilities in Medicare and Social Security \nare over $40 trillion. In fact, last week we received the reports from \nthe Medicare and Social Security trustees which noted that Medicare is \nalready running a cash deficit of about $46 billion. Social Security is \nrunning a cash deficit of about $32 billion.\n  For those who think we do not need to do anything because the so-\ncalled trust funds are not going to be in trouble until some point into \nthe future, I think the important point to remember is that the trust \nfunds and the IOUs that are the trust funds are not an economic asset \nthat can pay cash benefits. At some point there is either going to have \nto be a massive tax increase, a huge reduction in benefits, or an \nincredible amount of additional borrowing.\n  What we project will happen with Social Security at some point in the \nfuture is that there will be about a 20, 25 percent reduction in \nbenefits when we hit that wall, which suggests we ought to be taking \nsteps right now to avoid that. The important point is, when we start \nseeing cash deficits where the payroll taxes that are coming in no \nlonger exceed the amount of benefits they are paying out but, rather, \nare running deficits, that also adds to the overall deficit we are \ndealing with as a country.\n  We do not have the luxury of time. We cannot afford to wait. This is \nan issue that is upon us. Social Security and Medicare reforms are \nissues that need to be undertaken. If we do not do that, as I mentioned \nlast week as well, we will see enormous increases in the amount of debt \nand the amount of deficits as a percentage of our GDP.\n  In fact, in the year 2035, if we do not change our ways, the amount \nof government spending--and this is under the current projection, which \nI believe is very conservative, and probably these numbers could be \nmuch worse--would comprise 35.2 percent of GDP. Government spending \nwould comprise 35.2 percent of GDP, which is 60 percent higher than the \nhistorical average. The historical average of what the Federal \nGovernment spent as a percentage of our entire economic output for the \nlast 40 years has been 20.6 percent. This year it is over 24 percent. \nIf we stay on this current trajectory, as I said, in the year 2035, \nbased on what I believe are very conservative assumptions--and this \ncould be much worse than that--we would be looking at over 35 percent \nof our entire economy spent just on the Federal Government.\n  As I said, that is 60 percent higher than the historical average. In \nthe same year, deficits would be about 16 percent of GDP, and debt to \nGDP would be 185 percent. We would actually have a cumulative debt that \nis almost twice the size of our entire economic output, our entire GDP \nfor that year.\n  These are more than just numbers for economists to look at; these \nhave real impacts in real time. They affect people across the country \ntoday. I wanted to point out again, as I have mentioned in the past, \nthe study done by economists Rhinehardt and Rogoff, which took a good \nlook at countries, and particularly developed countries, that have \nacquired or accumulated the sort of debt level we are looking at in \nthis country and the impact that has had on their economies. And in \ntheir analysis and their study, they came to the conclusion that when \nyou reach a certain level of debt to GDP--in this case, 90 percent debt \nto GDP--you lose 1 percentage point of economic growth. In other words, \neconomic growth will be 1 percentage point less than it would otherwise \nbe because of that high GDP debt level the country is sustaining. They \nsay that is at 90 percent. If we look at where we are today debt to \nGDP, we are about 93 to 94 percent. According to the White House's own \neconomist, every time you lose a percentage point of economic growth, \nit costs you about 1 million jobs.\n\n  So having the kind of debt level we are carrying today creates a \ncloud over our economy, reduces economic growth, and reduces jobs. It \nis costing us job creation in our economy, which I think is what most \nof us believe we should be focused on, and if we are going to focus on \njobs, we have to say there is a correlation between spending, debt, and \njobs. I believe the sooner we acknowledge that, the quicker we address \nthat, the better off we will all be and the sooner we will see the \neconomy start to recover and expand and create jobs again. That is the \nimpact that is happening now, and it only gets worse if changes aren't \nmade.\n  When the government borrows money, obviously there is an impact in \nthe private economy: there is less money for private companies and \nindividuals to invest in equipment, plants, housing, and training. It \ncrowds out these investments and instead allocates money--spends \nmoney--on less efficient, less necessary, duplicative, and oftentimes \ndownright wasteful programs and projects.\n  If we don't get our arms around this level of spending and debt, it \nalso means higher interest rates for individuals who want to borrow to \nbuy a home.\n  It is clear to individuals and businesses across the country--even if \nit isn't clear to everyone here in Congress--that the government cannot \ncontinue to spend ever-increasing amounts of money without raising \ntaxes. That creates uncertainty among individuals and businesses across \nthis country and acts as a disincentive for them to invest. So because \nyou have\n\n[[Page S3294]]\n\nuncertainty about what the impact of all this spending and debt will \nhave on future taxes, a lot of capital continues to sit on the side \nlines not being deployed, not being put to work. That is happening \nsimply because there is this uncertainty about what is going to happen \nand whether Washington is serious about getting this spending and debt \nissue under control and focusing on the fiscal problems we have as a \nnation.\n  I mentioned last week that Social Security benefits would \nautomatically be cut by over 20 percent if that program is not \nreformed. This is not the result of the House-passed budget, contrary \nto what many are saying. This is the result of the current situation we \nface today with Social Security. Likewise, according to the alternative \nscenario of Medicare's own actuaries, the health care bill that was \npassed last year would lead to significant numbers of providers \nbecoming unprofitable and who would, presumably, stop providing \nservices if health care costs are not contained.\n  This assumes we don't have a debt crisis. The former Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, said recently that the odds of a debt \ncrisis happening in the next 2 to 3 years are about 50 percent. So if \nyou take that analysis and you take what Standard & Poor's has said \nabout America's credit rating--they have warned of a possible downgrade \nin the U.S. credit rating in the next 2 to 3 years if serious changes \naren't made--I think you can see why there is such a cloud hanging over \nour economy right now.\n  Some believe this debt crisis may not occur for a few years down the \nroad. But I think one thing we know for sure is that it is coming. It \nis predictable. We don't know exactly when, but we know it is coming \nbecause you cannot continue to have these types of signals, this kind \nof not only anecdotal information but hard data describing the current \nstate of our economy, the current state of Federal spending, the amount \nof debt to GDP we are continuing to increase year over year, and not \nbelieve we will have some significant and measurable impacts on our \neconomy.\n  That is why it is so important that we take the steps necessary to \navert this crisis. If we don't, we know what will happen. As our debt \nburden increases, investors from around the world are going to \nincreasingly demand higher yields to lend us money, and that will \nfurther exacerbate our deficits. Interest alone will consume increasing \namounts of our revenue until we can no longer pay our bills.\n  We have seen this happen in countries around the world. We know the \nmagnitude of the actions those governments have had to take in response \nto debt crises in other places around the world.\n  Greece, for example, was forced to take loans out from the \nInternational Monetary Fund and has had to impose a variety of \nausterity measures. These austerity measures have included laying off \npublic sector employees, cutting their pay, freezing their pay for many \nyears at a time, a 2-percent increase in their VAT tax--they have a \nvalue-added tax in that country--and a 10-percent increase in other \ntaxes. They have also made dramatic cuts to pension programs and \nreforms to entitlement programs as well. Yet they are still paying, \nafter all of that, very high interest rates. The yield on 2-year debt \nis over 24 percent in Greece.\n  In Ireland, they had to implement austerity measures of more than 9 \npercent of GDP--9 percent of their entire economy. In the United \nStates, if you were to translate that into the impact it would have on \nour economy, that is the equivalent of raising taxes and cutting \nspending by $1.3 trillion in 1 year--an astounding amount. But that \nwasn't enough. They are looking to implement another austerity plan of \ntax increases and spending cuts. That one is estimated to cost the \naverage family in Ireland $5,800 a year.\n  Those are the types of measures that have been forced upon, imposed \nupon some of these other countries around the world because they have \nseen the debt crisis we are trying to avoid in this country. At the \nsame time, after having taken all these austerity measures, they have \nseen massive contractions in their economy, because we all know what \nhappens when you start raising taxes and you create the amount of \neconomic uncertainty I described earlier. It becomes very difficult for \nsmall businesses to invest and to create jobs. So, not surprisingly, \nyou see these austerity measures leading to violence, protests, and \ngeneral discontent. It appears now that Greece is seriously considering \nat least a technical default on some of their debt.\n  So that is, I guess, a picture of what our future will look like \nabsent changes. We will have a shrinking economy, fewer government \nservices, and dramatically higher taxes. That is what the experiences \nhave been in some of these countries I just mentioned, and that is what \nwe are headed toward absent serious, meaningful action in getting our \nspending and debt and our entitlement programs under control.\n  There is no reason to go down this path. The Senate will have the \nopportunity over the course of the next few months, at least, I hope, \nto vote on legislation that will start to address not only the near-\nterm issues of discretionary spending and capping that and capping it \ninto the future, in the near term and midterm, but also address the \nissue of entitlement reform. As I mentioned earlier, we cannot solve \nthe debt problem, the fiscal problem, and the crisis our country faces \nwithout taking on the issue of entitlement programs. If we don't, our \nfuture will look like that of Greece and Ireland.\n  Today, we will vote--today or tomorrow; I am not sure exactly when--\non a series of budget proposals which are, in each and every case \nsomebody's attempt to address this issue. We saw the House of \nRepresentatives act on a budget earlier this year--the so-called Ryan \nBudget--which they passed. We will get a chance to vote on that in the \nSenate. We have a couple of our colleagues on the Republican side who \nhave come up with their own ideas about budgets and what we might do to \naddress this fiscal crisis. We are going to vote on the proposal the \nPresident put forward, which is completely inadequate to the challenge. \nIn fact, it increases spending over 10 years, dramatically increases \ndebt, and dramatically increases taxes, which would have an incredibly \ndetrimental impact on the economy. That is what the President put \nforward. We will vote on that today as well. Having said that, all \nthese votes--although they are, I suppose you could argue, important in \nsome respects--are going to end up being more symbolic votes because I \ndon't think any of them will get the necessary votes in the Senate to \npass.\n\n  What is ironic about the debate on budgets this week is that the only \nbudget we are not voting on is a Senate budget. We have not had a \nbudget now in the Senate for 756 days. This government spends $3.8 \ntrillion a year, and yet it has been 756 days since the Senate has \npassed a budget. So we have a couple of our Republican colleagues who \nare putting forward alternatives, we have the House that has put \nforward an alternative, but the Democratic majority here in the Senate \nhas not, for 756 days, moved to bring a budget to the floor so we can \nhave a debate and vote upon the fiscal priorities for this country and \nhow we are going to spend $3.8 trillion of the American people's tax \nmoney. That is a stunning development. I am on the Budget Committee in \nthe Senate, and we have yet to even have a markup, and I don't \nanticipate we will in the near future.\n  Having said that, we cannot afford to wait to take on this Nation's \nfiscal challenges. I hope that, absent action on a budget here in the \nSenate, these discussions that are occurring right now between the Vice \nPresident and Senate leaders will yield a result that will enable us to \nat least move forward and address these fiscal issues, but it doesn't \nnegate the responsibility we have as Senators to put forward a budget \nand to debate that budget.\n  Ironically, we are going to vote on the budget passed by the House of \nRepresentatives. I don't know this for a fact, but I have heard this is \nthe case, that it will be the first time ever that the Senate will vote \non a budget passed by the other body--in particular, by the other body \nwhen it is controlled by the other political party. This will be the \nfirst time in history. I think the Democratic leader wants to do that \nto make some political point, but I think we all know that our not \npassing a budget or at least debating a budget here in the Senate is a \ncomplete abdication of the responsibilities we have\n\n[[Page S3295]]\n\nas Senators to be good fiscal stewards of American tax dollars.\n  I would just close again today by saying we have seen our future. You \ncan look at what is happening in Greece, you can look at what is \nhappening in Ireland, and you can look at the types of austerity \nmeasures imposed by outside entities who have said: You make these \nchanges or you are not going to continue to get IMF funding, for \nexample. And even after all that, you are still looking at these \ninterest rates in the 20-percent range, you are looking at economies \nthat continue to contract rather than expand and grow. We need to \ncreate the conditions here that will enable our economy to grow and to \ncreate jobs, and it starts with getting Federal spending and debt under \ncontrol.\n  One final point I will make, and this has to do with an issue that \npertains to my State of South Dakota, but I think it ties into the \nbroader point I am making about the economic uncertainty that is being \ncreated out there today for businesses.\n  There was a piece of legislation that passed a little over a year ago \nhere--the Credit CARD Act--which put in statute a number of changes \nwith regard to subprime credit card companies. That is all fine and \ngood. I voted against it. We have companies in South Dakota that play \nby the rules, they have abided by the laws, and they are a heavily \nregulated industry. Yet Congress decided--over my objections--to move \nforward with legislation that would change the rules by which they \nplay.\n  Well, that was all fine and good, but when it came time to implement \nthose regulations, the Federal Reserve decided the statutory framework \nthat was created wasn't quite good enough. So the initial regulations \nthat were out there--this company reacted to those and tried to adapt \nits business model, but the Fed decided that wasn't good enough, so \nthey took regulatory steps that went beyond what the statute had called \nfor and made it even more difficult.\n  We predicted this at the time--we said: This is going to cost jobs in \nour State of South Dakota. Well, just this last week that particular \ncompany announced they are closing their operation in Spearfish, SD. \nThat will impact 330 jobs in a town of about 10,000 people. \nIncidentally, the mayor of that city worked for this company. And there \nis a story here from the Rapid City Journal which describes the \neconomic impact of these job losses and what it will mean to that \ncommunity and to the entire area.\n  I can't help but think this is just another example of regulatory \noverreach, of regulatory agencies deciding they know best and going \nabove and beyond what Congress called for in terms of legislative \nrequirements and the legislative intent and taking regulations beyond \nthat. So we have real-world impacts on people out there as a result of \ndecisions made here in Washington, DC, and when we tried to make these \narguments to the regulators, they couldn't have been less concerned \nabout jobs. We said this is going to cost us jobs.\n  This is just the beginning, by the way. There is another location in \nHuron, SD; Dakota Dunes, SD; and Sioux Falls, SD, and I think this is \njust the tip of the iceberg of what we will see in terms of job losses \ncaused by regulatory overreach because a Federal agency decided they \nknew best and went above and beyond what even the U.S. Congress said \nwith regard to this particular issue.\n  These are, again, real-life examples of decisions made here in \nWashington, DC, and the impacts they have in the real world. I hope we \ncan put policies in place here that will encourage economic growth and \njob creation, not hinder it, not inhibit it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/25/senate-section/article/S3295-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3295-S3296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MEDICARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I rise today to talk about the proposed \nMedicare reform. I have found the debate to be fascinating because it \nis proceeding as if there had been no changes to Medicare recently. \nAnyone telling you that there have been no changes is not being \nstraightforward. Sweeping changes to our Medicare system were debated \nand they were passed in the most partisan way possible--only Democrats \nvoted for them--and they were signed into law by President Obama. The \nPresident's new law already puts this fundamental health care program \nin significant jeopardy.\n  Some may come down to the floor, some may rise and say: Mike, you are \nall wrong about this. They will want you to believe that the $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion in cuts to Medicare in the new health care law will actually \nextend the Medicare program. But in reality the health care law is not \ngiving new life to this program at all. The Congressional Budget Office \nreports that Medicare will be insolvent in 2020, 9 years from now. Yes, \nthat is right, complete insolvency in 9 years. That is the current plan \nvoted on and signed into law by the President.\n  That analysis does not even account for the $\\1/2\\ trillion cuts in \nMedicare to fund the health care law.\n  Don't believe me? We have consulted the experts. The experts say the \nhealth care law counts, or attempts to count, the same dollar twice. \nThe Medicare Actuary says these cuts ``cannot be simultaneously used to \nfinance other Federal outlays (such as the coverage expansions under \nthe health care law) and to extend the trust fund.''\n  This can only mean either the new health care law does not have \nenough funding, to the tune of $\\1/2\\ trillion or, in the alternative, \nMedicare is in more serious jeopardy than even the trustees' report \npoints out, in jeopardy of becoming insolvent much sooner than the \nexperts predict.\n  So I stand here today and I tell you if you are 56 years old or \nyounger and you are thinking about the day when you apply for your \nMedicare benefits, the experts say--sorry, you are out of luck. Under \nthe current law of the land, that is the case. Again I point out that \nthe President's health care reform was passed on the most partisan of \nvotes--it did not get a single Republican vote--and every Medicare \nbeneficiary will be impacted by the cuts to this program.\n  If you are out there saying: Mike, I want to protect the poor, all I \ncan tell you is the President's plan does not do that. If you are \nsaying: But, Mike, I want to protect the middle class, all I can tell \nyou is that the President's plan does not do that.\n  What do we get out of that? According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, complete insolvency in 9 years. You see, the President's reform \nis founded upon the unrealistic assumption that doctors will continue \nproviding the same services to patients with a 30-percent cut in a \nMedicare Program that is not covering their costs today. I just had \ndoctors in my office saying: Mike, we cannot continue to provide \nMedicare services if that cut occurs. Yet that is the current law of \nthe land.\n  By comparison, one of the plans we may vote on this week protects \nMedicare beneficiaries over 55 by saying: Look, we are going to hold \nyou harmless. Your benefits will not be changed at all. The plan says \nlet's fix this physician payment formula so they do not have the 30-\npercent cut so access for Medicare patients can continue. The plan says \nlet's protect those who are especially deserving of our support, those \nwho are below 150 percent of the poverty level and truly cannot afford \nthe health care they need.\n  You are probably saying: Mike, what plan is that? The plan I am \ntalking about is Paul Ryan's plan. You tell me which sounds more severe \nin its approach, a plan that puts government bureaucrats in charge of \ncontrolling health care costs, robs Medicare of any potential savings \nto start a new entitlement, and in 9 years brings bankruptcy to \nMedicare, or a plan that empowers patients to choose their own unique \nplan, ensures Medicare savings are reinvested into the Medicare \nProgram, and preserves Medicare by bringing costs back to sustainable \nlevels, which is the Ryan plan?\n  I want to be clear that there are some things about this plan I would \nlove to debate and change. For example, perhaps we could devise an \nincremental transition within the Medicare proposal. Maybe we need to \nevaluate if the medical savings accounts for those most in need should \nbe indexed to something better than the general inflation rate. Maybe \nthose below a severe poverty line should be exempted entirely. Perhaps \nsome of the tax reform, including elimination of certain tax \ndeductions, needs to be revisited.\n\n[[Page S3296]]\n\n  We will have the opportunity to debate and make improvements, but \nonly if we vote to proceed to the bill. But you know what, arms are \ngoing to be broken all over the place here this week to make sure that \ndoes not happen, because this is not a serious attempt to try to fix \nthe problem. This is all about messaging for campaigns and political \nconsequences. The reality is no plan is going to get enough votes. I \nwill stand here and I will observe those arms getting broken. We will \nneed orthopedic surgeons on the Senate floor to fix them.\n  Sadly, passage was never the intention here. These plans were \nscheduled for votes purely for the sake of messaging an important \nprogram that provides health care for seniors that by the Congressional \nBudget Office's definition will be insolvent in 9 short years. These \nvotes are not designed to fix this problem. These votes, I guarantee, \nare all about political fodder for next year's election season.\n  I believe this is not what we were elected to do on the Senate floor. \nThese antics are what rightfully embolden those who say Congress is \nincapable of solving these very hard problems. As the Senator from \nSouth Dakota indicated, today we mark 756 days since the Senate passed \na budget. As a former Governor I cannot imagine going to the people of \nthe great State of Nebraska and saying: You know, I have been thinking \nabout it, we will not be doing a budget this year. I would be looking \nfor a new State to live in.\n  Well, 756 days, and this week we are not even making a serious \nattempt to deal with it. With a deficit exceeding $14 trillion, our \nNation needs something greater than political symbolic votes which we \nall know will fail. Maybe, just maybe, we can muster the courage to \ntake seriously our responsibility to seniors and to all Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak to my \ncolleagues as in morning business for 30 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/25/senate-section/article/S3296-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3296-S3298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, on February 14 President Obama \ndelivered his budget to the Congress. I often describe to my \nconstituents that Washington is an island surrounded by reality. \nNowhere is this more apparent than with President Obama's February 14 \nbudget. In presenting and defending his budget, President Obama and his \nstaff have said his budget ``lives within our means'' and that ``it \nwill not add to the debt,'' and that ``we are not going to spend any \nmore money than we are taking in.''\n  Obviously all you have to do is study the budget and you come to the \nconclusion that these astonishing statements do not equal the facts. \nThe Congressional Budget Office recently projected the deficit for \nfiscal year 2011, the year we are in, will exceed $1.5 trillion. This \nis on top of a $1 trillion-plus deficit in 2009 and 2010. Today, of \nevery dollar spent, more than 40 cents is borrowed. Our country is on \nan unsustainable path. But you would not realize that by looking at the \nPresident's budget proposal. It does not recognize the serious fiscal \ncrisis our country faces. What it represents is the status quo.\n  Over the 10-year period, President Obama's budget adds more than $10 \ntrillion in publicly held debt and $14 trillion in gross debt. Does \nthat sound like on February 14 he put before us a budget such that we \nare going to live within our means and not spend any more than we take \nin?\n  During this period of time, going up to 2021, debt held by the public \nwould reach 87 percent of GDP, compared to a 50-year average of 35 \npercent. According to the Congressional Budget Office, ``If those \ntrends were continued beyond 2021, the resulting path of the Federal \ndebt would be unsustainable.''\n  In fact, CBO estimated that by the year 2040, under President Obama's \nbudget, debt held by the public would be 117 percent. Is this the \nbudget the Senate Democrats will support? Is this the fiscal path we \nare going to endorse? While President Obama claims we are living within \nour means, the smallest annual deficit will be $748 billion. His budget \ndoes not even begin to put our country on the right path. The final 3 \nyears of his budget have annual deficits totaling over $1 trillion.\n\n  As former Comptroller General David Walker has stated, our country \nwas founded on principles such as limited government, individual \nliberty, and fiscal responsibility.\n  The President's budget falls short on each of these three principles. \nIt increases spending. It grows government as a percentage of our \neconomy. It is clearly fiscally irresponsible, and because of the \nlegacy of deficits and debt it creates, it will undoubtedly infringe \nupon the liberties of future generations.\n  In 2006, then-Senator Obama argued against raising the debt limit. He \nbelieved, at that time, the very need to raise the debt limit was a \nsign of leadership failure. By his own standard then, President Obama \nis not living up to his standard. So is that leadership failure? Would \nhe admit that today? His ``no'' vote in that year was to make a point \nabout needing to get serious about fiscal discipline. We are in the \nthird year of President Obama's Presidency. We are in the midst of the \nthird consecutive year of $1 trillion of annual deficit. Deficits have \ngotten larger, not smaller.\n  Of course, I recognize many of my Democratic colleagues will come to \nthe floor and argue they support the policies President Obama put forth \nin a speech later on--I guess in April--at George Washington \nUniversity. Unfortunately, for the Democrats, the leader of their party \ndoesn't deliver speeches in legislative text. Speeches alone aren't \ngoing to solve the big problems we face in this Nation. We need serious \nsolutions to our country's very serious problems. We need real \nleadership. The future generations of this country deserve no less, and \nthat is what House budget Chairman Ryan has offered. That is what our \ncolleagues on our side of the aisle, such as Senator Toomey and Senator \nPaul, are going to offer to the Senate.\n  What have the Democrats offered to address the looming fiscal crisis? \nThe answer is no resolution at all. So I have a blank page, \nrepresenting the fact that they have no plan whatsoever. Are they going \nto allow a debate so they can offer their ideas to address our fiscal \ncalamities? We just heard the Senator from Nebraska postulate that is \nnot going to happen; that we are having a series of votes, but they are \nfor show, not for real. The American people have sent 53 Democratic \nSenators to Washington. A budget can pass the Senate with just 51 \nvotes. It doesn't take the supermajority 60 votes that so many issues \non the floor require if we are going to get to finality. So far, we can \nsee they have shirked their responsibility--nothing.\n  It has been more than 750 days since Senate Democrats offered a \nbudget. What is the delay? I want to ask them: Where is your budget? I \nsuppose they will argue that our Nation's fiscal situation doesn't \nrequire a budget or, perhaps, they have simply run out of ideas to \naddress our deficits and our debt.\n  ADM Mike Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said \nearlier this year that our debt--meaning our national debt, our \naccumulative debt--is the greatest threat to our national security. \nSurely, the Senate Democratic leadership would want to put an honest \nplan forward to address that threat. They don't even want to debate a \nbudget.\n  This exercise is on a motion to proceed to a number of budgets, none \nof which were written by the Democratic majority. I guess they intend \nto vote against proceeding. They don't even want to debate a budget. \nWell, by this time, most of the time in the last 35 years, we have had \na budget through the Senate. Instead of leading, they would rather \ndemagogue the serious efforts put forth by Republicans. They are not \ngoing to stand and defend the defenseless budget their President \nsubmitted to Congress just 3 months ago. They are not going to write \ntheir own budget. It is still blank. They are not even going to vote to \nallow debate on budgets that were drafted by others. So are we \nwitnessing a leadership failure similar to the one Senator Obama \nreferred to in 2006, in his speech on the Senate floor? The Democratic \nmajority would rather demagogue Medicare than produce and defend their \nown budget.\n  I presume there will be a lot of speeches in this town today, with\n\n[[Page S3297]]\n\nDemocrats hitting their chests saying: We ran an election in New York \nState yesterday based upon the fact that Republicans want to kill \nMedicare. Well, I wish to put forth the fact that if we do nothing, as \nthe trustees have said recently, there isn't going to be any Medicare \nin 9 years. I can put forth ample evidence that ObamaCare puts Medicare \non a path to the rationing of care and reducing the number of doctors \nwho are going to take Medicare patients. Already, Medicare is on a path \nto destruction if we don't intervene and do something about it. The \nsooner we intervene, the better. We ought to be intervening now in a \nbipartisan way instead of all the talk about partisanship and \ndestroying it. There are some people in this Congress who know Medicare \nis a problem and the sooner we deal with it, the easier it will be to \ndeal with it.\n  Medicare is a very important part of America's social fabric. It was \nintended to be that in 1966, and it is still that today. I intend to \nwork to make sure it stays as a part of our social fabric. It is a \ncommitment made to seniors today, and it is a commitment made to people \nwho are not yet seniors today. It is a commitment made to all for the \nfuture. So it is very important that we, as stewards of the Medicare \nProgram, take serious our charge to make sure it remains for future \nseniors.\n  With that in mind, I come to the floor to call out the most dangerous \nthreat to the Medicare Program we face on the floor this week. Let's be \nclear. It is not the budget resolution authored by Congressman Paul \nRyan and passed by the House of Representatives. The most serious \nthreat to the Medicare Program this week is those who propose to do \nnothing or offer no plan whatsoever for saving Medicare. Doing nothing \nis the most serious threat to Medicare. For all the talk about killing \nMedicare as we know it, the Democrats' do-nothing budget I have held up \nso often--the do-nothing budget--is the surest way to kill Medicare as \nwe know it.\n  The folks coming to the Senate floor with nothing in their hands but \ncriticism of these budget resolutions are irresponsible. By attacking \nthe House budget resolution while proposing absolutely nothing, the \nDemocrats are plunging their collective heads into the sand such as \nthese ostriches sometimes are described as doing--ostriches acting as \nthough everything with Medicare is fine and that doing nothing is a \nviable option.\n  Let's look at the facts. Last week, the CMS Actuary--and this is a \nprofessional person. He is not a political person but the President's \nActuary--submitted his annual report on the fiscal health of the \nMedicare Program. Frankly, his conclusions are very disturbing. The \nActuary confirms that the Medicare Program is already contributing to \nthe Federal deficit. It is spending more than it takes in, and it will \ncontinue to do so throughout the coming decade. The Actuary found--this \nprofessional person, this person that is the President's Actuary--found \nthat Medicare will run out of money by the year 2024--5 years faster \nthan his projection last year. For the sixth straight year, the report \nissued a funding warning showing that the Medicare Program is taking a \ndisproportionate share of its funding from general revenue, thus \ncrowding out programs such as defense and education. The situation is \nonly going to get worse.\n  In 1965, when Medicare was created, baby boomers retiring today were \nthen just teenagers. Today, we have 10,000 baby boomers retiring every \nday, with fewer and fewer workers paying into Medicare to support these \nadditional retirees. The average couple turning 65 today paid over \n$109,000 into Medicare over their lifetime but will receive over \n$343,000 in benefits. Stop to think of that. Everybody wonders why \nMedicare might be in trouble today. The average person retiring today \nhas paid in $109,000 but will receive about $343,000 in benefits. That \njust does not add up as a sustainable program. Anybody who says we \ndon't have to do anything about Medicare and it will take care of \nitself--well, we can see how misleading that is.\n  When Medicare was created in 1966, the average American lived to be \nage 70. Today, thanks to incredible advances in medical care, the \naverage American lives to be 79. These are the facts. So now, knowing \nthese facts, is the time for Congress to recognize the reality of \nMedicare's fiscal crisis--and not just recognize it but recognize it \nand then do something about it.\n  Put simply, Medicare is unsustainable without serious, thoughtful \naction. This blank sheet of paper, a budget not being offered, is not a \nserious, thoughtful action. To say otherwise is to ignore the facts and \nto stick your head in the sand.\n  The Ryan budget, as it relates to Medicare, has had much discussion \nlately. It is simply a blueprint. Even if this page were filled in, a \nbudget never becomes law; it never goes to the President of the United \nStates. It is a discipline for the Congress of the United States. It \ndoes not become law. So anybody who says voting for a budget is voting \nto do something to Medicare is crazy. Actual policy, as we know, is \ngoing to be determined by other committees, other than the Budget \nCommittee. In the House, it is most often the Ways and Means Committee. \nIn the Senate, it is the Senate Finance Committee. Those are the \ncommittees that write the bill and that can say what is happening or \nnot happening to Medicare. Anyone telling the public that if this \nbudget blueprint is adopted, it will be a law doesn't understand how \nthe legislative process works.\n  But this vote isn't even about a budget blueprint. The debate we are \nhaving is about a simple motion on whether we ought to even debate a \nbudget. If the Democrats were willing to proceed to an honest and open \ndebate, we could talk about where we want to go with the Medicare \nProgram at that time. If the Democrats were willing to proceed to an \nhonest and open debate, we could debate steps to save the program. If \nthe Democrats were willing to proceed to an honest and open debate, we \ncould have amendments to improve the resolution as offered. Of course, \nthe Democrats are not willing to proceed to an open and honest debate.\n  I agree that changing the nature of Medicare is a significant step. \nRequiring people who are 10 years away from retirement to expect to pay \nmore for their health care in retirement is a significant change in \npolicy. It should be thoughtfully considered, however, in the context \nof Medicare's serious fiscal difficulties. They aren't going to go \naway.\n  Describing this policy as ending Medicare for seniors is \nirresponsible and factually false. People who engage in this type of \ndemagoguery are endangering coverage for the very people whom they \nclaim to support because they continue to propose nothing. Where is the \nDemocrats' bill? So far, this is it: a blank piece of paper, producing \nnothing.\n  I have great respect for the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. \nI know he has tried to produce a budget. But, apparently, his \nleadership thinks that demagoguing Republican budgets is far more \npolitically profitable than standing behind one of their own plans, so \nthey have squashed all his efforts to produce a budget. Even though we \nknow the Democrats have turned into ostriches when it comes to saving \nMedicare, we are fortunate to have a record over the past several years \nto examine.\n  So let's look at ObamaCare, passed solely in a partisan vote in 2010. \nIt took a little more than $500 billion right out of the Medicare \nProgram to fund a new entitlement. So Medicare is in trouble. Take away \n$500 billion from it, and start up a new program. Does that sound \nfiscally responsible? I have no doubt some folks may come to the floor \nto argue that the Medicare savings extended the life of the Medicare \nProgram. But every reputable source that has analyzed that claim has \nappropriately tagged it as double counting.\n  The CMS Actuary, whom I referred to in the past, today continues to \ncall some of the productivity cuts made by the Democrats in their \nhealth care reform bill unsustainable and unrealistic. And I say--he \ndoes not say it--I say it is going to bring rationing. So down the \nroad, what sort of health care are seniors going to have? It is not \ngoing to be what they know today.\n  Of course, we all know the Democrats failed to resolve the \nsustainable growth rate problem, which is a formula for doctors' \nreimbursement, so the problem of physician payments continues to haunt \nthe fiscal future of Medicare. If we do not do anything this year,\n\n[[Page S3298]]\n\nMedicare physicians will face a 30-percent pay cut. Imagine that. Today \nmany Medicare patients already are being denied the care and personal \nchoice they deserve because the AMA, the American Medical Association, \nhas said one in three primary doctors is limiting Medicare patients, \nand more than one in eight of those doctors is forced to deny Medicare \npatients altogether.\n  Our seniors already face the pain of a broken Medicare system. Yet \nthe Democrats remain ostriches with their heads in the sand because \nthey have no Medicare solutions they want to offer.\n  Perhaps I am being too hard on the Democrats. President Obama--\nperhaps speaking for the Democrats or perhaps not--has put an option on \nthe table for addressing Medicare spending. He did it in a speech at \nGeorge Washington University on December 13. Of course, we will not be \nable to vote on that here today because, as Senator McConnell said \nyesterday, you cannot vote for a speech. But at least we should \nconsider the option the President put on the table.\n  In his speech, President Obama suggested we should control costs in \nMedicare by tasking the Independent Payment Advisory Board that was set \nup under ObamaCare to do even more than what we proposed a year and a \nhalf ago when the bill was passed.\n  You might ask, What is the Independent Payment Advisory Board in \nObamaCare? Well, it was created by the Democrats' health care bill. It \nis a 15-member panel of unelected advisers who would make binding \nrecommendations on how to reduce Medicare spending when spending is \nprojected to exceed a certain level. Effectively, their recommendations \nhave the force of law without congressional intervention to replace the \ncuts they might suggest and that under the law would take a 60-percent \nmajority. And you know it is very difficult to get 60 votes in this \nbody for any one thing.\n  That law says the board cannot make decisions that directly relate to \npremiums, deductibles, or copayments that Medicare beneficiaries pay. \nIt says the board cannot change the eligibility criteria for Medicare \nbenefits. So then, what can the board do, you may ask? Well, it is \ngoing to zero in on provider payments, doctor payments.\n  I want to repeat a statistic I quoted earlier because after the \npayment review board gets done, you are going to have more than the one \nin three primary doctors not taking Medicare patients that presently is \nthe situation. We have one out of eight doctors denying Medicare \npatients altogether. In other words, they are not going to see Medicare \npatients; and that is today. It is going to get worse when this payment \nreview board gets done.\n  According to the Joint Economic Committee, today Medicare allows \nmedical providers to collect 89 percent of the cost of services \nprovided to seniors. Under the President's proposal, by 2022, Medicare \nproviders will only be allowed to collect 66 percent of the cost of \nservices provided to seniors. Reductions will clearly restrict seniors' \naccess to quality health care.\n  Let me sum up what we do know about the Democrats' actions on \nMedicare because it is already on a path to destruction. So, of course, \nI get a little bit upset when I hear people on the other side of the \naisle saying Republicans want to do away with Medicare, when it is part \nof the social fabric of America and we want to keep it as part of the \nsocial fabric of America and we want to do it not only because it is a \nFederal program, but we want to do it because it is tied in with a lot \nof corporate retirement health plans where it becomes a primary payer \nand the corporate health plan becomes a secondary or additional payer.\n  I sum up by saying, they have enacted already $500 billion worth of \ncuts to fund a new entitlement called ObamaCare. Many of those cuts are \ndescribed by the independent CMS Actuary as unsustainable. They have \nyet to find a way to fix the doctor reimbursement formula called the \nsustainable growth rate. And still, the President has proposed further \nreducing payments to providers.\n  Of course, what is that going to do for seniors in America? It is \ngoing to reduce access. This will make it harder for seniors to find \nproviders willing to treat them. This will drive some providers out of \nthe business of providing services to seniors. In other words, they \ncannot afford it.\n  There is one simple word to describe this approach, and it is a word \nI do not take lightly. The word is ``rationing'' of health care for \nseniors in America. It may not be direct overt rationing, but you have \nto have your head buried very deeply in the sand not to realize that is \ngoing to be the outcome of policies already put in place by this \nPresident through ObamaCare. And then they want to accuse us of \ndestroying Medicare?\n  So I get back to what today's debate is all about. I think we ought \nto seriously be having a legitimate floor debate rather than a series \nof political show votes today. I will vote for the Senate to begin \ndebate on the Ryan budget and the other Republican budgets as they are \noffered because I do not have a chance to vote on anything from that \nside of the aisle because, see, it is a blank sheet of paper. There is \nnothing there that the majority party--not the minority party; they are \nthe majority party--has suggested. I will vote to begin debate, not \nthat I support any of their budgets in their entirety. I will vote to \nbegin debate because our fiscal situation demands serious efforts or \ngiving serious considerations, and in no area, as I have made clear in \nmy remarks today, is this more critical than in Medicare because \nMedicare is on a path to bankruptcy.\n  People who support the Medicare Program and care about those who will \ncount on that program today and for many years to come are willing to \nput serious plans on the table for debate. It is our responsibility to \nensure Medicare's survival for future seniors. Doing nothing is worse \nfor Medicare. The surest way to kill Medicare as we know it is the \nDemocrats' do-nothing plan. Demagoguery is irresponsible. So I would \nsuggest: Pull your head out of the sand and join a real debate to save \nMedicare for the future.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, 50 years ago on this day, President \nJohn F. Kennedy addressed a joint session of Congress, and he presented \nto our Nation a bold challenge. He said:\n\n       I believe that this nation should commit itself to \n     achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a \n     man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth.\n\n  It was and remains a memorable challenge. To meet it would require \nlong-term commitment and unprecedented resources. It had great risk, \nand it had no simple solution. But President Kennedy put his faith in \nthe talent and dedication and discipline of America. He believed his \nchallenge could mobilize our country to meet this challenge and \nsucceed. And he was right.\n  President Kennedy's goal to put a man on the Moon and return him \nsafely in 10 years was clear, was direct, and was accountable. The \nresult was a vast mobilization of public and private resources that \ncollaborated in innovative ways to achieve that singular purpose. And \nwe did.\n  I come to the floor today to call for a similar challenge to reform \nour health care delivery system. While the goal now is different, the \nurgency and the need to mobilize both public and private sectors toward \na common and vital purpose is the same. Our massive budget deficit \nposes a real threat to our economic and national security. The Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff identified it the other day as the single \ngreatest threat to our national security, our Nation's debt.\n  There is also common ground that the skyrocketing costs in our health \ncare system are at the heart of our Nation's fiscal problem. I do not \nagree much with Congressman Paul Ryan, but we do agree on that point. \nHe has said if we are to be honest about our debt and deficit, at its \nheart is a health care problem. So now is the time for our country to \nset out a clear challenge, as President Kennedy did, that will address \nour health care cost problem.\n  That challenge must stand on two facts: One fact is that our health \ncare cost problem is a system-wide problem. Republican proposals to end \nMedicare as we know it fundamentally misdiagnose the problem. Most \neverybody in America knows it does not matter who our insurer is, \nwhether we are insured by Medicare or Medicaid, the VA or TRICARE, \nUnited or Blue Cross, in the last decade, costs across all insurers \nhave gone through the roof. Indeed, just today in the news, Secretary \nGates is reported to have said--about his Defense Department budget--\neverybody knows we are being eaten alive by health care. We have a \nsystem-wide health care cost problem, not a Medicare problem.\n  Health care expenditures are nearly 18 percent of our gross domestic \nproduct. The next least efficient country in the world spends only 12 \npercent of its GDP on health care. We would have to go far down the \nlist of our competitor nations before we find a country that has as \npoor health outcomes as America has, even though we spend vastly more \nfor our care. We have a system-wide health care cost problem and a \nsystem-wide health care quality problem.\n  The second fact is, the health care cost problem and the health care \nquality problem are related. We have at our disposal an array of health \ncare reforms that will reduce the cost of health care while improving \nthe quality of health care. These types of reforms--new models of care \ncoordination, quality improvements in hospitals, paying for quality not \nquantity to our physicians, and reducing overhead costs in the system--\nall have one liability; that is, they do not lend themselves easily to \nestimates of cost savings. Because of this, there is less attention \nthan there should be to the great potential of these reforms. Bowles \nand Simpson, Domenici and Rivlin have all conceded this in our Budget \nCommittee hearings.\n  The promise of these reforms is immense. The President's own Council \nof Economic Advisers has stated that 5 percent of GDP can be taken out \nof our health care system without hurting the quality of care. That is \nabout $700 billion a year. The New England Health Care Institute said \nit is $850 billion a year. The Lewin Group has estimated the potential \nsavings at $1 trillion a year, a figure echoed by former Bush Treasury \nSecretary O'Neill. The savings are there, and they are considerable.\n  The question is, How do we get at them? Well, let's first look at the \naffordable care act that we passed. The affordable care act's delivery \nsystem reforms provide many of the tools that we need to drive down \ncosts and improve the quality of care.\n  As we were working on that bill, I had a regular meeting in my office \nof experts from around the country, from the business community, from \nthe labor community, from the NGO community, who really were dialed in \nto the delivery system reform problem in this country.\n  We met regularly, we met early in the morning, and every time we \nasked the same question: What more can we put in this bill to make sure \nit has the tools to get these reforms done? By the time that bill \npassed, we were in agreement that everything we could want was in that \nbill.\n\n  It provides a tool box with five major strategies we need to deploy. \nThe first is quality improvement, which will save the cost of medical \nerrors, of misdiagnosis, of disjointed and uncoordinated care.\n  The clearest and simplest example is reducing hospital-acquired \ninfections which affect nearly 1 in every 20 hospitalized patients in \nthe United States. They cost us about $2.5 billion in unnecessary \nhealth costs every year.\n  The tens of thousands of deaths that are associated with these \nhospital-acquired infections are tragic. It is made all the more so by \nthe fact that they are essentially preventable. Simple reforms, such as \nfollowing a checklist of basic instructions--washing hands with soap, \ncleaning a patient's skin with antiseptic, placing sterile drapes over \nthe patient--result in huge reductions in rates of infection and in \ncosts.\n  So, first, quality improvement. The second strategy is prevention. \nThe most inexpensive way to deal with disease is to prevent it in the \nfirst place. More than 90 percent of cervical cancer, for instance, is \ncurable if the disease is detected early through Pap smears.\n  The third strategy is payment reform. We must pay doctors for better \noutcomes, not for how many tests and procedures they order. Rhode \nIsland has a promising ``medical home'' primary care payment strategy \nalready underway.\n  The fourth strategy is simplifying administrative processes to reduce \noverhead costs. The insurance industry in this country has developed a \nmassive bureaucracy dedicated to delaying and denying payments to \ndoctors and to hospitals.\n  So to fight back, the doctors and the hospitals have had to hire \ntheir own billing departments and expensive consultants. All of that, \nthe entire war over payments between insurers and hospitals and \ndoctors, adds zero health care value. It only drives up costs.\n  Finally, the fifth strategy is a robust, secure health information \ninfrastructure. Health information technology was, years ago, estimated \nby the Rand Corporation to save $81 billion a year. Savings may very \nwell be higher as the system builds itself out. Not only is a robust \nhealth information infrastructure a good end in itself, but those four \nother delivery system strategies are empowered and advanced and \nexpanded by robust health information infrastructure.\n  These five delivery system reform strategies hold the promise to \ndeliver the enormous savings we need to extract from our health care \nsystem, and to do so in the most humane way, by improving the quality \nof care. The debate we need to have on our health care cost problem \nmust focus on delivery system reform, on how we can implement these \ndelivery system reforms from the recent health care reform bill as \nquickly and as effectively as possible.\n  This is what brings me back to President Kennedy's speech on space \nexploration. President Kennedy did not say: I am going to see to it \nthat America bends the curve of space exploration. Had he said that, \nthe speech would have been consigned to oblivion, and we would likely \nnot have put a man on the Moon on time. Instead, he made a memorable \nchallenge with a clear objective: Put a man on the Moon, bring\n\n[[Page S3300]]\n\nhim back safely, within a decade. Everybody could know whether that had \nbeen done. It was a clear and accountable purpose, and it galvanized \nthe entire Federal bureaucracy toward that common purpose.\n  We can and must do the same with health care delivery system reform. \nWe can and must have a clear challenge to strive toward.\n  It is not enough to talk about bending some health care cost curve. \nOur country has the talent and discipline to accomplish extraordinary \nthings. We can significantly bring down costs in our health care \nsystem. I notice that the junior Senator from Minnesota has just taken \nthe chair in the Chamber. Minnesota knows well what can be accomplished \nthrough these kinds of delivery system reforms because companies such \nas Mayo, Gundersen Lutheran in Wisconsin, Intermountain in Utah, and \nKaiser in California are all doing this kind of work effectively \nalready. We can significantly bring down costs in our health care \nsystem. We don't have to be last or the least efficient country in the \nworld in providing health care to our people. We can do this while \nimproving the quality and the experience of health care for Americans.\n  I will conclude by saying that tackling these issues won't be easy. \nBut to go back to President Kennedy's speech, he said:\n\n       We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other \n     things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard. \n     . . .\n\n  I urge my colleagues and the administration--we cannot afford to \nfail. Let's raise the stakes. Set a hard challenge. The future of our \nNation's fiscal health certainly depends on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n\n\n                           Missouri Disaster\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, this is a place that runs on words. \nThe Senate is a place where there is always a great deal of speeches \ngiven and words spoken. Every once in a while, something comes along in \nlife when words are completely inadequate. What happened in my State in \nthe last few days is very difficult to express in words. I did want to \ntake a few moments to recognize an incredible occurrence in the \nsouthwest portion of my State.\n  Having been there all day yesterday and arriving very early in the \nmorning and spending time with the people of Joplin--with Missourians \nwho have come to Joplin from every corner of our State, with Federal \nofficials, I do want to take a short amount of time to recognize the \ntragedy and to rejoice in the response.\n  So many parts of this response, in fact, are the kinds of things we \nshould celebrate. But the loss of life is staggering. An F-5 tornado, \nwe now know, is the strongest tornado classification--in fact, this is \nthe most devastating tornado we have had in this country in almost 60 \nyears. The loss of life is staggering--122 lives. It is, unfortunately, \na reality that that toll will probably continue to rise--I hope only \nslightly--in the coming days. But yesterday, there were another five or \nsix confirmed deaths.\n  The loss of property--over 8,000 buildings were damaged; 2,000 homes \nare gone. When I say gone, I mean gone. I have responded to many \nnatural disasters in Missouri during my time as a public official--a \nlot of tornadoes and flooding. I have never observed a scene that even \ncomes close to what I observed yesterday. Walking among the rubble, you \nrealize that what you are walking through is people's lives that have \nbeen spread far and wide, and that, in many ways, cannot be recovered, \ncannot be made exactly as they were before. From the air, the swathe of \ndamage was incredible. We were able to get up there--because the \nweather finally cooperated--to look at the damage from the air. \nGovernor Nixon and Mr. Fugate, the Administrator of FEMA, and I, with \nother officials, went up in helicopters yesterday morning. As you look \ndown upon Joplin, from the air it looks like a stave mill. Through the \nmiddle of Joplin, miles and miles long and wide, surrounded by green, \nit looks like a massive amount of toothpicks. The trees are all gone. \nMany hundred-year-old trees are lying on their sides. The trees--what \nis left standing of them--have most of the bark ripped off by the force \nof the wind that swept through Joplin shortly before 6 p.m. on Sunday \nevening.\n  The emotional toll of this devastation is one you can't calculate. \nBut you see it on people's faces. What I observed yesterday was friends \nand neighbors who were standing by hoping for a miracle, and \nfirefighters dug under the rubble at the Walmart hoping they would find \nsomeone there who was alive. I witnessed other people going through the \nrubble of their homes. In talking to them, I think the initial reaction \nfor the people of Joplin was intense gratitude that they were alive. \nNow it is being replaced with the reality of their loss and what they \nhave lost--from schools, to churches, to a hospital that employs over \n2,000 people in a community of just 50,000. This is an incredible loss. \nBut the pain is palpable on these people's faces, and that is why it is \nso important that we don't lose sight of what they are going to need \nover the coming weeks, months and, yes, even years.\n  The response I witnessed, in terms of what was on the ground, was \nremarkable--from Federal, State, first responders in local communities, \nand obviously the officials of Joplin, Missouri, all working together \nseamlessly as a team. The Federal Government--unlike many disasters \nwhere they wait several weeks to declare a disaster--obviously \nunderstood that the flexibility and the immediacy of the response was \nincredibly important in this instance, and they declared a disaster \nwithin 18 hours. FEMA had people on the ground. Within 12 hours, the \nNational Guard deployed. They had National Guardsmen there before \nmidnight. Since that moment on, more and more people have been \nresponding with more and more assets to help the people of Joplin and \nthe recovery effort.\n  I want to call out particularly the fire chief in Joplin and the city \nmanager there who have done remarkable work. The fire chief lost his \nhome. As I walked through the firehouse going to the command center, I \nheard barking in one of the rooms. I said, ``Is that a K-9 unit?'' They \nsaid, ``No, the fire chief is living here with his family because his \nhome is gone. That is his dog.'' So as he lost his home, he obviously \nhad to turn to the important job of initially fighting fires, and then, \nobviously, participating in an unprecedented effort of search and \nrescue over the following 48 hours.\n  I am very proud of our National Guard. We have over 200 guardsmen \nthere as we speak. They have done, as always, remarkable work. I talked \nto one man who had just finished duty in Poplar Bluff, with the \nflooding, and immediately came over to help in Joplin with the tornado \nresponse and recovery.\n  The State of Missouri Governor Nixon has been on the ground for much \nof the last 72 hours, along with his team. He is bringing his cabinet \nheads to Joplin to work on various parts of this over the next 48 \nhours, along with subcabinet members from the Federal Government, \nhousing, HHS, to be of assistance.\n  Let me take a minute to talk about the first responders. I am so \nproud of the police and firefighters I encountered yesterday. I am so \nproud of these men and women. As I looked around, I realized there were \nsearch and rescue teams from every corner of our State. Task Force 1 \nfrom central Missouri and almost 100 Kansas City firefighters were \nthere. I had an opportunity to visit with many of them as they were \nattempting a rescue on the scene yesterday afternoon. At 3 o'clock in \nthe morning--yesterday morning--a caravan from St. Louis of over 100 \nfirefighters and all of their equipment and assets rolled down I-44 to \nget to Joplin to help their brothers and sisters, in terms of this \neffort. St. Francis County, Camden County--you name it--from all over \nthe State, police and firefighters and public safety officials \nresponded to Joplin.\n  Frankly, people need to realize that the assets spread all over \nJoplin today, the emergency vehicles, K-9 units, HAZMAT teams, mobile \nrescue units that allow people to do very difficult rescues in very \ndifficult circumstances--the vast majority of those assets were bought \nwith Federal dollars. The vast majority of that equipment that came to \nthese Missouri departments came from Federal grants. A lot of these \nguys worked without sleep for days. As I talked to them and\n\n[[Page S3301]]\n\nthanked them, it was almost as though they resented being thanked \nbecause, to them, this is what they do.\n  I tell you, one thing yesterday gave me was an incredible passion to \nfight for these folks' pensions and salaries. These are not the people \nwho are causing economic chaos in this country. These are not the \npeople who deserve to be diminished in public discussions about what \nthey receive for their work. These are the best we have, and they \ndeserve every dime of pension they have bargained and fought for.\n  I am so proud of Joplin for its response. This is a community of \ngreat faith. This is a community that will come together, as a lot of \nMidwest communities do in circumstances when their neighbors are in \ntrouble. Everywhere I have gone--in fact, our phones are ringing off \nthe hook--people are saying: What do we need to do to help Missourians?\n  The most important thing people can do right now is give blood, \ndonate to the Salvation Army and Red Cross, and wait to hear from the \nofficials from Joplin about when volunteers are needed. Right now, too \nmany volunteers swarming into Joplin could cause more problems than it \ncould solve. People need to check with the local Red Cross in Ozarks, \nand they need to check in with the city Web site. When there is a call \nfor volunteers, it will go out, and those volunteers will be needed. \nBut for now, the most important thing people can do is give money and \nblood.\n  The other thing I think we can do for all of the people who lost \ntheir lives in this tragedy is to have a plan when there is a tornado \nwarning. Many families--and I think we are guilty of it in the Midwest \nmaybe more so than other places in the country because we hear sirens \nand tornado warnings a lot. I grew up with that in Missouri. I will be \nhonest, I probably have never taken it seriously enough. But that will \nnot happen again in my life. My family will have a plan. My family will \nknow where to go and what to do if, in fact, there is a tornado \nwarning. Don't ever assume a tornado warning is not serious. These \nsirens rang at approximately 5:17 in the afternoon, and the tornado \ntouched ground at approximately 5:41. So there was 20 minutes there.\n  By the way, the weather people here deserve a great deal of credit. \nNobody visually sighted this tornado. It was all done through radar. \nThe fact that they were able to identify this tornado and make that \nwarning 20 minutes ahead of time was very important. I cannot imagine \nthe loss of life we would have had if it hadn't been for that 20-minute \nwarning. Having said that, there were people who were not taking it \nseriously. There were people who didn't know exactly where to go or \nwhat to do. So, please, have a plan for your families as a tribute to \nall those who lost loved ones in Joplin on Sunday night.\n  We will survive this, with God's grace and determination. Joplin will \nroar back because of the values that are held so dearly in that part of \nour State--in fact, in our entire country.\n  We will come together, and we will do this. But make no mistake about \nit, the satellite cameras are going to pack up sometime in the next 48 \nhours. All those satellite trucks are going to go back from where they \ncame. This will fade from the front pages. Just like the junior Member \nfrom Minnesota who is presiding right now, at the point in time the \nbridge collapsed, there was a great deal of attention, and then the \nattention goes away.\n  In this instance, we are going to need to sustain the support to this \ncommunity far beyond the headlines, far beyond the satellite trucks \ngoing home. We have to get these schools open in September. We have to \nget this hospital rebuilt. We have to make sure this community is not \nleft stranded without the assistance it needs.\n  There is no question that we have to be careful about the way we \nspend Federal money. But with all due respect to Congressman Cantor, I \nhave a hard time believing that if this were in his congressional \ndistrict, he would be talking about how additional disaster relief \nwould not be available unless we found some other program from which to \ntake it. It must be available. This cannot be a political football. We \nmust provide the assistance. That is what Federal tax dollars are for, \nto provide assistance when there is no assistance available for \ncommunities and for States because of the wrath of Mother Nature. We \nmust be there for them. We all must stand with Joplin. All of America \nmust stand with Joplin. And we will.\n  My heart goes out to the families for their losses. I congratulate \nthe people of Joplin for their response. I say ``bless you'' to all \nthose first responders. Through the greatest tragedy sometimes comes \nthe greatest strength.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate the fine remarks of my \nfriend from Missouri. Seeing the damage that was done by the tornadoes \nin Alabama, they have far exceeded anything I have seen before. I \nappreciate more than most the damage and difficulties the people of \nMissouri are going through. I know there will be emergency funding for \nthat. There is a legitimate question as to whether we ought to not find \nthat emergency spending someplace in our budget where it can be \nrecovered that is not so important. But I know we will process that as \nwe go forward.\n\n\n                       Unsustainable Budget Path\n\n  I truly believe our Nation is facing an economic crisis, but it's not \nso much what I believe but what every expert we have heard from \nbelieves and has testified to. Mr. Erskine Bowles, who cochaired the \ndebt commission, who was appointed by President Obama, said, along with \nSenator Alan Simpson, his cochair, in a written statement to the Budget \nCommittee, that this Nation has never faced such a predictable economic \ncrisis. In other words, the deficit levels we are operating with are so \nhigh and they create such danger to the economy that we have to get off \nthis path. Every expert has said we are on an unsustainable path.\n  Many people have thought the problem we are dealing with today places \na burden on our children and our grandchildren; therefore, it has \nremoved to some degree the immediacy of the problem. But that is not \nwhat Mr. Bowles said. In his testimony before the Budget Committee just \na month or two ago, he said that we could have a financial crisis. When \nasked by the chairman when, he said 2 years, maybe less, maybe more. \nSenator Simpson said it could be 1 year.\n  We are taking a risk with the American economy. This has been echoed \nby Moody's bond ratings, and it has been echoed by S, which warned \nthat our debt rating for our government debt could be downgraded. Alan \nGreenspan has made similar comments. Alice Rivlin, former OMB Director \nunder President Clinton, made those comments. Pete Domenici, who \ncochaired a debt commission with Alice Rivlin, former chairman of the \nBudget Committee in the Senate, said to us with real passion: I have \nnever been so afraid for my country. That is what Pete Domenici said.\n  We know we have to take action, and now we are heading today to 756 \ndays since the Senate has passed a budget. We have not passed a budget. \nI say with confidence that in terms of a real, long-term threat to the \nAmerican future, this Nation has never had a greater danger financially \nand in terms of debt because the problems we face are more severe than \neven in the nineties when we turned our business around and in 3 years \nbalanced the budget. It is going to be harder to do it now.\n  We went through World War II. We borrowed money. But we had a \nvibrant, growing economy and growing population, and we promptly moved \nour way through that, and growth took care of us. But we cannot expect \nthat the level of growth that according to the experts we can \nreasonably predict will be sufficient to get our house in order.\n  When you do not have enough money and the course you are on is \nunsustainable, you need to develop a plan that puts you on a \nsustainable path. How simple is that? That is grownup talk. How do you \ndo it? What is our mechanism in the Congress?\n  This is a budget. This is title II, section 271 through et seq, and \nit has the Budget Act. We passed a Budget Act. It is law. Clever \nCongress did not put any penalties on it, so we can violate it and not \ngo to jail. We do not have to personally pay fines. But it represented \na serious commitment by a previous Congress that we needed a budget. \nThey\n\n[[Page S3302]]\n\nalso made as part of that budget law that it could be passed with a \nsimple majority so it could not be filibustered. That was one of the \nreasons budgets sometimes failed to be passed. At a time when they were \nthinking about the future, they said: Let's make the budget passable by \na simple majority. It also has a timeline in it. It says the Congress \nmust pass a budget by April 15. We are long past that date--long past \nit. Are we going on to a third year now without a budget?\n  Mr. President, 1,000 days without a budget while our country is on a \ndebt path unsustainable to a degree that threatens the future of \nAmerica economically--yes, that is where we are heading.\n  People say: Surely, Jeff, that is not so. Surely there is some plan.\n  There is not any plan--not a plan to pass a budget. What there is a \nplan to do is not pass a budget. It is irresponsible. It is unwise. It \nis dangerous for our future because we are on a certain path, a \npredictable path, as the debt commission told us, to financial ruin. \nOur debt-to-GDP ratio will reach 100 percent by September 30 of this \nyear. That is above the level that economic experts tell us puts our \ncountry at risk. Indeed, when we passed a 90 percent debt-to-GDP ratio, \neconomists Rhinehardt and Rogoff, who completed a massive study of \nnational defaults of economies around the world by sovereign states, \nwarned that at that level you reduce the growth in the economy by at \nleast 1 percent of GDP. The average was higher than that. They said on \na median level, it is 1 percent of GDP, and they used that number--1 \npercent growth that we don't get. Well, some think we may not get 2 \npercent growth this year. Would we have gotten 3? If we get 1, would we \nhave gotten 2? One percent growth in GDP is a large thing in an economy \nthe size of ours. It increases tax revenue significantly. It increases \njobs. According to experts, 1 percent of GDP growth means 1 million \nmore jobs. A decline of 1 percent in our economy represents a loss of 1 \nmillion jobs. This is not a little-bitty matter.\n  On Monday, I objected. I realized what is going on in the Senate, \nthat there is no plan to deal with this situation, that there is a \ngimmicked-up scheme to bring up a series of budget votes that the \nmajority leader knows will not pass. Indeed, he intends to bring up a \nvote on a budget that he and all his colleagues intend to vote \nagainst--the most responsible one out there, the House budget, passed \nby the Republican House. That is what they want to bring up for a vote \nand vote against. But the Budget Act does not say bring up a House \nbudget. It says each House--the Senate and the House--should bring up \nits own budget and pass it on the floor. It should go to committee. \nNone of the budgets we will be voting on have gone through committee. \nWe have had no markups in committee. We never even had a markup on the \nbudget. Why? What is this? What is going on?\n  Let me share with my colleagues why we are not having a legitimate \nprocess to produce a budget at the most critical financial time in our \nhistory. It is about politics. Does that surprise anyone? This is what \nDemocratic staffers were quoted as saying in a Wall Street Journal \narticle a few days ago. What did they say about it? Did they say: We \nhave a plan to solve America's future. Did they say: We have a plan to \nreduce our debt and get us on a sound path. Did they say: We understand \nthe future of the country is endangered by unsustainable debt growth. \nNo, they did not say that. This is what they said:\n\n       As a political matter, Senate Democratic strategists say \n     there may be little benefit in producing a budget that would \n     inevitably include unpopular items.\n\n  They do not want to produce an honest budget, a budget that would \nmake a difference, because it would have some unpopular items in it. I \nask, is that responsible leadership? I suggest it is not.\n  It goes on:\n\n       Many Democrats believe a recent House GOP proposal to \n     overhaul Medicare is proving to be unpopular and has given \n     Democrats a political advantage. They are loath to give that \n     up by proposing higher taxes . . .\n\n  What does that mean? It means their budget, if they produce one, \nwould call for higher taxes, and they do not want to do it. They do not \nwant to propose a budget that reduces spending. They do not want to \nproduce a budget that has higher taxes. Why? Because they are playing \npolitics rather than serving a national interest. That is just plain as \nday. I wish it were not so, but there is no other explanation for why \nthis Senate preparing to go into recess Friday for Memorial Day without \nhaving even commenced hearings on a budget.\n  This is what they decided to do. I am quoting from the article:\n\n       Senate Democrats plan to hold a vote on the Ryan plan--\n\n  The House budget--\n\n     hoping to force GOP senators to cast a vote on the Medicare \n     overhaul that could prove politically difficult.\n\n  Give me a break. Is that what it is all about? Is that what we are \nhere for? It is not what many of my Democratic colleagues tell me. They \ntell me they know we are on an unsustainable path and we have to do \nsomething. But why are we going through this charade, to bring up one, \ntwo, three budgets and vote them all down and then say: Well, we tried. \nMaybe we will have some secret talks over here and we will plop \nsomething down right before some emergency date and demand everybody \nvote for it, not having a chance to read it. Is that what the process \nis going to be instead of an open process where the Budget Committee \nhas open hearings, amendments are offered, a budget is voted out of \ncommittee, it comes to the floor, and there is a guaranteed 50 hours of \ndebate? But the process comes to an end. The Budget Act states that we \ncannot filibuster it. There is only limited time of debate, but there \nis an opportunity to debate, an opportunity to offer amendments.\n  We are told Senator Reid does not want his members to have to take \ntough votes. None of us like to take tough votes. None of us likes to \ntake tough votes. Isn't that what we are paid for here? Isn't that why \nthey send us--to vote on important, tough issues that impact the future \nof our Nation? I am telling you, we are so far off path it is stunning \nto me.\n\n  I quoted his staffer earlier, but what about Senator Reid himself, \nthe Democratic leader of the Senate? Anybody who has worked with \nSenator Reid likes him, and I enjoy working with him. I respect him. I \nknow he has a difficult job, but at some point one has to stand and \nlead. He is not leading and neither is President Obama. But this is \nwhat Senator Reid said just a few days ago--I think Friday.\n\n       There is no need to have a Democratic budget, in my \n     opinion.\n\n  Well, there is a need, a statutory legal requirement that we send a \nbudget out of the Senate.\n  Then, he said:\n\n       It would be foolish for us to do a budget at this stage.\n\n  Why does he say it would be foolish? I think my good friend, Senator \nReid, has taken his eye off the national interest. He has taken his eye \noff the crisis our country faces, and he has his eye on politics. He \nmeans it would be foolish politically. He has a scheme, and this is \nwhat his scheme is. He is going to bring up the House budget--the Ryan \nplan. In all honesty, it is the only plan I have seen in my time in the \nSenate that comes close to providing a long-term alteration of the \nunsustainable fiscal path we are on. It deals with it. It makes some \ntough choices, but they are not unbearable and I think most of them \nwill actually work.\n  It is not perfect. I don't promise that I would vote for everything \nin it. But it is a historic plan to put America on a sustainable \nfinancial course. I thought they could have reduced spending more in \nsome areas, frankly. But it puts us on a sustainable course. It was \nproduced by the House Budget Committee. They had public hearings, the \ncommittee voted on it, they brought it to the floor, and it passed in \nthe House of Representatives, in the way the Congress of the United \nStates is supposed to operate.\n  What does our leader in the Senate and his colleagues who support him \ndo? They make a decision to do something political, not responsible. \nThey are not putting forth the vision they have for the future, but \nthey are going to bring up the Ryan budget so they can all vote against \nit. I don't think that is responsible. I don't think it is responsible \nat all.\n  I am not going to participate in this scheme to have a series of \nvotes. Count me out. I am not supporting it. I am not going to give my \nconsent to it.\n\n[[Page S3303]]\n\nThat is the way I see it and I don't think that it makes sense. If I \ndid, I would change my mind. But as I see it, it makes no sense for me \nto, in any way, consent to a process that is designed to fail. The \nwhole process is designed to fail. With a simple majority in the \nSenate, our Democratic colleagues can pass any piece of legislation. \nThey have 53 Members. They can win the vote. If they put up a good \nbudget, they might have some Republicans--maybe all the Republicans, if \nwe reached a bipartisan agreement. But there is nothing close to that. \nWe have not approached this in any realistic way, and I am concerned \nthat we are off track.\n  Senator Schumer, who once headed the Democratic Senatorial Campaign \nCommittee--he designed all that--is a Senator who is considered to be a \nguru of politics around here. He is good, and there is nothing wrong \nwith being a smart politician. But at some point politics goes too far. \nThis is what he said on May 23 regarding the Ryan budget.\n\n       We will exhibit this issue as an example of why we need to \n     keep the Senate Democratic in order to counter House \n     Republicans. We will point to this week and say the \n     Republicans tried to end Medicare but a Democratic majority \n     stopped it in the Senate. It is that simple.\n\n  That is an open statement of raw politics. Where is the national \ninterest? Where is the response to Mr. Bowles, a leading Democrat, to \nAlice Rivlin, a leading Democrat, and their principled cries that we do \nsomething about the debt crisis we now find ourselves in? Nowhere.\n  My colleagues want to go home, and they intend to go home--go home \nFriday. Our soldiers are out there, and they are not getting to come \nhome from Iraq and Afghanistan. They are going down roads where bombs \nmight be planted and they are putting their lives at risk. They do not \nget to come home. Their business isn't finished yet. But we plan to go \nhome, apparently, not having done anything but having gone through a \npolitical exercise that is an embarrassment to the Senate at a critical \ntime in our Nation's financial history--a very critical time.\n  President Obama utterly ignored, in his completely irresponsible \nbudget, the fiscal commission that he himself created to seek a \nnational consensus on funding. I have to say the President's budget is \nnowhere close to what is necessary to avoid our fiscal nightmare. That \nis not a Jeff Sessions quote. That is a quote from Erskine Bowles, who \ncochaired the Commission, when he saw the President's budget plan that \nwas submitted a couple months ago. He said it is nowhere close to where \nthe Administration will have to go to avoid our Nation's fiscal \nnightmare.\n  So that is what the President has done, and the Senate has done \nnothing. They will not even hold a markup and propose a plan. Why? They \nthink it is politically unwise. They think they can gain more \npolitically by refusing to produce a budget, by attacking the House \nMembers who produced a budget--as they are required to by law--that is \nhonest and would make a huge long-term difference in America. It would \nput us on a sustainable path, not leave us on an unsustainable path.\n  I will conclude with a quote from the preamble to the fiscal \ncommission's debt report. This is what they wrote to us. Remember now, \nSenator Reid's plan is to bring up the House budget and have all his \nMembers vote it down so they can attack Republicans for having the \naudacity to propose any changes in Medicare--and not even in the 10 \nyears of the budget. It is the outyears they are complaining about, and \nit is not law. Any change will not become law until it passes both \nHouses of Congress. But it is a vision that could work to make Medicare \nsound and actually save it.\n  They think they can scare people by saying we are going to end \nMedicare, so they are going to vote on it. That vote, in the minds of \nour Democratic politicians, shows that they are defending Medicare and \nthat all the Republicans oppose Medicare. But the American people are \ngetting too smart for that. I don't believe they are going to buy that \nstory any longer. They know Medicare is on an unsustainable path and \nthat it cannot continue.\n  The Medicare actuaries and trustees have reported today that it is \ngoing to go bankrupt a number of years sooner than was originally \nexpected. But this is what the debt commission said about the need to \nhave a plan to fix our future:\n\n       In the weeks and months to come, countless advocacy groups \n     and special interests will try mightily through expensive, \n     dramatic, and heart-wrenching media assaults to exempt \n     themselves from the shared sacrifice and common purpose. The \n     national interest, not the special interests, must prevail. \n     We urge leaders and citizens with principled concerns about \n     any of our recommendations to follow what we call the Becerra \n     Rule: Don't shoot down an idea without offering a better idea \n     in its place.\n\n  Isn't that a reasonable request--don't shoot down an idea unless you \nare prepared to present a better one in its place? That is exactly the \nopposite of what our Democratic leadership is proposing. They are \nproposing to bring up a budget they say they do not like. They are \ngoing to vote it down without producing anything in its place. That is \nnot responsible leadership, it is not respectful of the budget process, \nwhich is required by law, and it is not in the national interest. It is \nnot in the national interest.\n  Yes, we are going to have to deal with tough issues. We find \nourselves in a fix, a deeper hole than we should ever have been in, and \nthe American people punished Congressmen and Senators last year because \nthey were unhappy, and they were right to be. There is no way any \nMember of this Congress can stand before their constituents and justify \na deficit this year of $1.6 trillion and defend or justify a spending \nprogram in which 40 percent of every $1 we spend this year is borrowed. \nHow can that possibly be called sanity? It is insanity. That is why \nevery one of these people is telling us we have to change and why \nPIMCO, the largest bond company in the world, has said they are not \nbuying any more American debt. They believe we need to get serious and \nmake some serious changes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 20 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  I will just wrap up by saying that is why I think the process planned \nfor this week is unacceptable and I do not intend to support it.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2 p.m. \ntoday, Senator Paul be recognized for up to 1 hour for debate only; \nthat following Senator Paul's remarks, the Senate then proceed to a \nperiod of morning business for debate only until 5 p.m., with the time \nequally divided between the two leaders or their designees; further, \nthat the final 5 minutes be reserved for the majority leader or his \ndesignee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object and I will \nobject at this time and would like to review that unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, under the unanimous consent request \npropounded by the Senator from Oregon, I will remove my objection. I \nwill not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I and Senator \nCantwell be recognized now as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Oil and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, Senator Cantwell and I were joined on May \n11 by 15 other Senators who wrote to the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission to request that agency, which has a key role in consumer \nprotection, take immediate action to impose position limits on crude \noil futures. We asked that they would act by Monday, May 23.\n  Position limits are limits on the number of contracts that a \nfinancial speculator can buy or sell at any given time. It is extremely \nimportant that consumers have this protection so we do not see these \nspeculators increasingly dominate the market. As the Presiding Officer \nknows, we have a lot of folks who need gas to get to work and\n\n[[Page S3304]]\n\nget to school. We have trucking companies that depend on affordable \nfuel. We have restaurants that need fuel. They are all getting \nclobbered today.\n  Financial speculators who do not buy oil or consume oil are \nconstantly pulling more of the oil out of the commodities market. What \nis so troubling about the approach of this key agency is they pretty \nmuch said they are not going to do anything soon. We have no sense of \nurgency. It is not a priority for them to try to tackle this issue. In \nfact, they are not even going to use their interim authority. They will \nnot even use the interim authority they said they were going to use \nlast year to protect the consumer at this crucial time.\n  This is particularly unfortunate because somehow they have reached \nthe judgment that the only thing they ought to be moving on is to try \nto set limits as they relate to commodities generally. I can tell you, \nmy phone is not ringing off the hook about the question of cocoa \nprices. The American people are not up in arms about what is going on \nin the cocoa market today. They are concerned about the fact they are \ngetting clobbered on gas pricing. The fact is, 40 percent of the oil \nfutures market is now dominated by financial speculators, and it is way \npast time for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to act to tamp \ndown excess speculation and its impact on higher prices.\n  Senator Cantwell serves with me on the Senate Energy Committee. She \nhas been a leader on this issue. She has constantly tried to blow the \nwhistle on this practice of speculation. It is not the only reason \ngasoline prices are so high, but it clearly is a significant factor. If \nthe financial speculators are taking so much of the oil and future oil \nout of the market to essentially hold this dominant position, that \nmeans there is going to be fewer opportunities for that person who is \ntrying to get gas at the pump, the person who runs the restaurant, the \ntrucking company, and why it is so important that we have position \nlimits.\n  This is a crucial consumer issue. The Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission's refusal to act quickly is especially upsetting because \nthis agency knows better. They know better. Yet they wrote to Senator \nCantwell and me and Senator Collins and colleagues that they were not \ngoing to do much of anything anytime soon.\n  In January of 2010, after holding three public meetings on fuel \nprices, the agency proposed to set position limits on four key energy \ncommodities: crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and heating oil. At the \ntime, crude was around $75 a barrel.\n  Congress was so concerned about the need to control financial \nspeculation that it expanded the agency's authority to set speculation \nlimits last July as part of the financial reform legislation. That \nlegislation specifically directed the agency to set limits on \nnonagricultural commodities such as crude oil within 180 days of \nenactment. That date has long passed. So rather than getting started on \ncrucial protections for American consumers and businesses, the agency \nwithdrew its January 2010 position limit proposal for energy \ncommodities and basically started all over. It is inexplicable, in my \nview, that they would not even use their interim authority to take \nsteps to help the consumer who is certainly going to be concerned about \ngasoline prices as we move into this Memorial Day weekend.\n  This past January, instead of issuing a final rule within the 180 \ndays called for by the financial reform legislation, they issued \nanother proposed rule. While it is certainly true Congress gave the \nagency expanded authority to set limits on multiple speculation \nholdings in the financial reform bill and not just future contracts, \nthe result is there is not any limits at all. That is the bottom line \nfor the consumer today.\n  Under the schedule proposed by the agency in January's recent \nproposed rule, final position limits are not going to be imposed until \nthe first quarter of 2012, almost a year from now. That is what it is \ngoing to take based on the signals the agency is sending today, and at \nleast one of the Commissioners at the agency, Bart Chilton, has pointed \nout that this is really contrary to the deadlines in the financial \nreform law.\n  We know most Americans walking on Main Street have not heard of the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission, but that certainly does not \ndiminish its role in overseeing the commodities markets. That is why I \nhave been pleased to join with Senator Cantwell and other colleagues to \ncontinue to press this agency to get out of the regulatory swamp and \ntake steps to go to bat for the consumer and wring the excess \nspeculation out of the oil market sooner rather than later. The agency \nwas directed by the Congress to set speculation limits on more than two \ndozen commodities.\n  As I have indicated, I am sure setting position limits on commodities \nsuch as cocoa is important, but cocoa is not driving the American \neconomy the way oil is every single day. Americans use about 19 million \nbarrels of oil a day, and two-thirds of the price of a gallon of gas is \nthe cost of the crude oil used to make it. So setting limits on \nspeculation on crude oil is going to have an impact on the price at the \npump. The American people and our economy cannot afford to pay the \nhundreds of millions of dollars a month in additional fuel prices that \ncome out of their wallets while they wait for the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission to act. The agency ought to get about doing what it \nproposed more than 16 months ago, and that is rein in speculation, the \nspeculation that is driving up the prices at the pump. The agency ought \nto do it now, before more Americans face financial hardship.\n  The country is obviously entering into the peak summer driving \nseason. That is why I and Senator Cantwell and Senator Collins urged \nthe agency to move, and move now. I wanted to outline the agency's \nhistory of foot dragging.\n  I see we are joined now by Senator Cantwell, who has been our leader \nin this cause. I say to my colleague, I so appreciate her leadership. \nThis most recent response that we received from the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission shows once again no sense of urgency, no sense of \npriority, not even a willingness to use the interim authority that they \ncould use to go to bat for the American consumer.\n  I want it understood I am going to do everything I can to be the \nSenator's partner in this cause until we get these position limits set \nand get these basic protections that our consumers deserve.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor now that Senator Cantwell is here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon for his \nstalwart attention to energy markets and to the concern that many west \ncoast residents have over high energy costs. Senator Wyden has long \nbeen a vocal critic of what's happened in some electricity markets, and \ntrying to figure out what has happened with the oil markets and why the \nwest coast pays higher gas prices than any place in the country. We \nstill wanted to know why. People say we were an isolated market, and \nthat is why we were paying the highest gas prices. Then Hurricane \nKatrina hit and our prices still went up, even though we were \nsupposedly an isolated market.\n  So Senator Wyden has long been a person coming to the Senate, \nfighting for the consumer, saying we should not be gouged by higher \nprices on energy.\n  Energy is the lifeblood of any economy. We know what manipulation \nlooks like in the Northwest because we saw it with Enron. When our \nelectricity markets were manipulated, everybody said it was the \nenvironmentalists not allowing us to construct new generating \nfacilities. Well, when we finally exposed the audiotapes, we realized \nthat it was just pure market manipulation. In fact, what we found out \nis that people were taking the futures market and basically making \nplays in the futures market while they also had the ability to affect \nthe physical supply market and spot prices for electricity. So by \ncombining those schemes with different things such as ``Get Shorty'' \nand ``Fat Boy'' and all of these names they came up with, Enron was \nable to convince utilities and various customers that the supply was \ntight and that they were going to have to pay more for electricity in \nthe future and consequently they ought to keep paying these high \nprices. Well, thanks to a lot of hard work by a lot of individuals and \nultimately the Department\n\n[[Page S3305]]\n\nof Justice, the Enron schemes were called for what they were--just out-\nand-out market manipulation.\n  My colleague, Senator Wyden and I, screamed loudly about that \nsituation and said we wished the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \nwould have acted a lot sooner on that issue, and if they would have \nacted sooner, we would have saved a lot of jobs in the Northwest. We \nwould have saved a lot of industries. A lot of people lost their jobs, \ntheir retirement, their homes over those high electricity prices.\n  Thank God the result was such that we were able to pass new \nlegislation in 2005, making it a Federal crime for anybody to \nmanipulate natural gas or oil markets. I should say FERC has used that \nauthority over the last several years to recoup millions of dollars \nfrom violations by industry officials who continued to perpetrate the \nsame kind of scheme of going into the futures market and holding \npositions in the futures market and then taking physical supply and \nbeing able to affect the physical supply and demand.\n  So this is something that is amazing to us from the west coast. I \nknow my colleagues, including Senator Feinstein, Senator Boxer, Senator \nMurray, and I have all been on the same page. Senator Merkley has been \na loud voice on this issue. We have been through this nightmare. That \nis why I have to say first and foremost that we find it appalling that \nsomeone would propose H.R. 1, or the Ryan budget, that would take away \npolicing ability from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on the \ntype of activity that would allow them to properly regulate these \nmarkets.\n  We saw what happened. What we are so appalled about is it seems as \nthough it is now happening again in the oil markets. In fact, we see \ntoday on the front page of the New York Times ``U.S. Suit Sees \nManipulation of Oil Trades.'' So the commodities commission is finally \nsaying now: Yes, we are looking at this case. And it should be no \nsurprise what they actually see because it is the same shenanigans that \nhappened in electricity, the same shenanigans that happened in natural \ngas, and, yes, the same shenanigans are happening in the oil markets.\n  That is the commodity agency that says in this case there was a close \nrelationship between the physical oil price and the price of the \nfinancial futures which moved in parallel. So basically what happened \nis that in the oil futures market, these individual companies and \ntraders took large positions. In fact, their positions were so big--and \nthat is what Senator Wyden has just described. If this agency would \ncome in and set position limits, people wouldn't be able to come in and \nmove the market in such a significant way. But at the same time, it is \nalleged that these companies actually had millions of barrels of \nphysical crude oil and they actually had no commercial use for the oil. \nSo here we have people buying the physical supply--again, to manipulate \nand help tie it into the futures market--when they don't have any \ncommercial need for it. That is why it is so important to have the CFTC \ndo its job and to interpret who are legitimate hedgers, such as \nairlines, farmers, people who actually need the physical supply, \njuxtaposed to these large institutions that are just coming in and \nmoving the market.\n  So what is amazing is that at one point in time, what they had as far \nas physical supply--for somebody who didn't even have a commercial use, \nat least according to this New York Times article--was two-thirds of \nthe excess barrels available at Cushing. So here is somebody who had \nthe physical supply and was controlling two-thirds of marginal oil \nsupply and then controlling the futures market. So they were basically \nmaking money on the upside and they were making money on the downside. \nThat is what the CFTC is alleging in its case. I think it is one of the \nfirst cases in which a small group of traders are being charged in the \npotential role of manipulation of gas prices.\n  I don't have to tell the Presiding Officer how critically important \nthis is. I have been home recently and paid $4 a gallon for gasoline. \nMany people are starting what is soon going to be the summer driving \nseason, and they are outraged at the price of gasoline. It is hurting \nour economy. People who have to commute to work every day, people whose \nbusinesses depend on reasonable fuel costs are getting gouged with \nthese prices, and we have Federal regulators who need to be more \naggressive at investigating these cases.\n  I will say I am very happy the Obama administration and the \nDepartment of Justice appointed a task force. That is exactly what we \nneed. We need every Federal agency that has oversight of these markets, \nwhether it is the physical market with the FTC or the CFTC and the \ncommodities market, to work together with the Department of Justice to \nmake sure these schemes are not continued to be perpetrated on the \nAmerican public.\n  Our economy is too important to have this kind of activity continue \nto wreak the kind of havoc it has on our system. When we think about \nit, it is not as if we don't know what the scheme is. We have seen it \ntime and time again with these other energy markets. So the question is \nwhether we are going to be aggressive and make sure the CFTC has the \ntools it needs, which means not cutting its funding as the Ryan budget \nor H.R. 1 wants to do, and that it actually takes seriously its role \nand responsibility and starts setting position limits, starts the day-\nto-day activity, because the value Senator Wyden and I are down here \ntalking about, instead of this case that now is going to be \ninvestigated--how many days, months, and years did we live with the \npotential of higher fuel costs?\n  If this case is correct, how many days did we live with the higher \ncost, and how long will the investigation take, versus if the CFTC was \nactually implementing the law and the rules we gave them and enforcing \nposition limits? It would be policing the market on a day-to-day basis \nand preventing consumers from paying one dime or one penny more than \nthey needed to pay for high fuel costs.\n  It used to be that these oil markets were for legitimate hedgers.\n  My colleague and I represent a very robust agricultural community. We \ngrow lots of different products in the Northwest, probably over 200 \ndifferent agricultural products. We depend on the commodities markets \nto hedge for the future. But that market was created, after the Dust \nBowl devastated so many farmers, to give them a chance to legitimately \nhedge. Now, all of a sudden, it has been captured by these large \nfinancial institution players. It used to be that those who really \nneeded to hedge, such as farmers and airlines, controlled 70 percent of \nthe market. Now they are only 30 percent of the market. Seventy percent \nof the market is these large players, just as was described in this \narticle--people who are out there basically using their financial \nweight to move the market in a direction that then they can sell on the \nfutures market and benefit from it. It is outrageous. It is outrageous \nthat our economy has to put up with this, that individuals have to put \nup with this.\n  I know my colleague from Oregon and I are going to be out here, and \nwe are going to be loud and consistent until we have the rules and \nregulations in place to make sure these markets are properly policed. \nWe don't have to wait another day. We don't have to wait 1 more day. \nThe commodities commission could be doing this job. They don't need \nanother legislative bill from us. They don't need another vote from \nanybody on the commission. They can use their emergency authority. They \ncan implement these rules today and help consumers save on high fuel \nprices.\n  So I hope my colleagues will help us in this effort to bring up the \nissues and make sure the American public understands what is going on \nso we can bring the pressure to bear on getting proper regulation in \nplace.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Would my colleague yield for a question?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Yes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. My colleague has made a very eloquent case with respect to \nhow this hammers the people who need oil on a daily basis--farmers and \ntruckers and restaurants. The Senator from Washington juxtaposed their \nposition compared to the speculators. Those people have a lot higher \ntax rate, for example, than do the speculators. So there is one \nadvantage after another that the speculators have over the people about \nwhom my colleague and I are concerned.\n  Is it the understanding of my colleague that the next best step to \nhelp\n\n[[Page S3306]]\n\nthose people and small businesses who need oil on a daily basis is to \nget the CFTC out of the regulatory swamp and to enact these position \nlimits?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Well, when we are paying $4 a gallon for gasoline, we \nare affecting and impacting everybody who moves a product for business \nor anybody who commutes to work for any kind of distance. I know my \ncolleague has probably heard, as I have, from a lot of small businesses \nthat when fuel costs become the second largest expense, it is hard for \nthem to continue to do business.\n  So my colleague is right. The CFTC could basically address this by \njust implementing the authority we gave them under the financial \nregulatory reform legislation we passed. That is all they have to do. \nNow, I would say to them that they already have the emergency \nauthority. They have so many tools at their disposal.\n  I am glad they are investigating this case. I think this case is \nilluminating of the type of scheme that might include the details which \nare so familiar to my colleague and me of prior schemes and how people \nwork them. But I would say that an investigation of these schemes is \nonly going to go so far in helping the American consumer. If they take \nanother 6 to 8 months to investigate these schemes, a lot of people are \ngoing to lose their jobs. So why not implement the rules they have \nright now, put them in place so we can protect consumers, and certainly \ndon't pass legislation here in the Senate or in the House that is going \nto take away the ability to stop the kinds of activities that drive up \nhigher gas prices by manipulation.\n  We want enforcement, we want it now, we want protection of consumers, \nand we will continue to be vocal about this issue. I thank my colleague \nfrom Oregon for joining me today to talk about this issue.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague. I think it is critically important \nthat the Senate know we are going to keep the heat on, on this issue. \nSenator Cantwell and I have tried to point out that the agency is \ndragging its feet. They could use their existing authority. We think \nthe kind of shellacking the American consumers and our small businesses \nare taking is not right. We are going to continue this fight until they \nget the consumer protections they deserve.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, as you well know, I come to the floor \neach week with a doctor's second opinion, and it specifically relates \nto the health care law, the law that was passed now over a year ago, \nwith many promises made by the President, one of which was that if you \nlike your coverage, you can keep it. We now know that is not the case, \nas he had promised. He also talked about this driving down the cost of \nhealth care. We have seen the cost of health care going up.\n  Last week, I came to the Senate floor and talked about something that \nis not known very well. It is a part of this law. It is called the so-\ncalled Independent Payment Advisory Board. I gave five specifics as to \nproblems with this board. So today I wish to give another five \nspecifics, and I think these are things every single American needs to \nknow about the mandates that are part of this health care law and what \nis going to happen to them as more and more components and parts of \nthis health care law are implemented.\n  People refer to this board as ``IPAB''--not ``iPod'' but ``IPAB''--\nand it stands for the so-called Independent Payment Advisory Board. But \nI will tell you, this is a Washington board. It is not independent. I \nbelieve it is going to be very harmful in terms of the health of the \nAmerican people.\n  This board often goes unnoticed, and one of the reasons is it \nactually does not become operational until after the 2012 elections, \nuntil 2013. But it is an extremely powerful and extremely dangerous \npart of the President's health care law. It is a Washington board. It \nempowers 15 unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats, 15 full-time \nWashington bureaucrats, who will decide how Medicare's dollars are \nspent. These Washington bureaucrats will use basically price controls, \nand they will use price controls to ration medical care and services \nall across the country.\n  You remember, Mr. President, when then-Speaker of the House Nancy \nPelosi said first you had to pass the bill before you got to find out \nwhat was in it? Well, now, as more and more Americans learn about this \nrationing board, they will again voice their opposition to the \nPresident's health care law.\n  I will tell you, I want to pick up today where I left off last week. \nI want to share with the American people an additional five things they \nneed to know about this board.\n  The No. 1 thing today is the President wants to keep this board under \nthe radar. He and his administration simply want to disguise the long-\nterm impact this board's price controls will have on our seniors on \nMedicare. If he does so successfully, the patients on Medicare will be \nthe big losers.\n  He wants to promise the American people that the board will achieve \ngreat Medicare savings, but he does not want to explain to the American \npeople exactly what those Medicare cuts will do and how the American \npeople will ultimately pay the price in their health care.\n  The President and Washington Democrats have historically supported \npolicies giving government the power to set health care prices. Make no \nmistake, the President is using this Washington board as a Trojan horse \nto accomplish that goal. This is exactly why this board is not going to \nbe set up until after the 2012 elections. The American people will not \nface the true impact of this board and the cuts it is going to have on \ntheir loved ones until after the Presidential election next year. The \nPresident's plan depends entirely on keeping the true purpose of this \nrationing board well below the radar.\n  Here is a second concern; that is, the opposition to the President's \npayment advisory board, interestingly enough, is bipartisan. Even \nmembers of the President's own Party know that creating a Washington \nboard to cut Medicare payments and ration medical services is bad \npolicy when it comes to our seniors.\n  Even Representative Pete Stark of California, the ranking member of \nthe House Ways and Means Health Subcommittee, said in an April 19, \n2011, New York Times article:\n\n       In its effort to limit the growth of Medicare spending, the \n     board is likely to set inadequate payment rates for health \n     care providers, which could endanger patient care.\n\n  There you have a statement by a member with ranking stature of the \nDemocratic Party in the House.\n  Now let's take a look at what someone else said. She announced her \nsupport for legislation which would repeal the President's Payment \nAdvisory Board. This is Representative Allyson Schwartz of \nPennsylvania. Actually, she is a strong champion for the health care \nlaw. She is also vice chairman of the New Democrat Coalition. She had a \nstatement that came out on April 15, 2011--income tax day--saying:\n\n       Congress is a representative body and must assume \n     responsibility for legislating sound health care policy for \n     Medicare beneficiaries, including those policies related to \n     payment systems. Abdicating this responsibility . . . \n     undermines our ability to represent our constituents. . . . I \n     cannot condone the implementation of a flawed policy that \n     will risk beneficiary access to care.\n\n  Third, the President's payment advisory board sets prices and it \ngives Washington more power, not patients. In most cases, Medicare \npayments to doctors--and Members of the Senate from both parties \nunderstand this--are already well below market rates. That is why \ndoctors often limit the number of Medicare patients they see. In more \nsevere cases, doctors stop treating new Medicare patients.\n  Allowing a rationing board unlimited power to control Medicare prices \nis only going to drive Medicare payments lower, and it is going to \ndrive more doctors away from seeing Medicare patients. My concern is \nthe prices are going to be driven so low by this rationing board that \nthe government will force doctors, hospitals, and other medical \nproviders to stop offering any care to Medicare patients.\n\n[[Page S3307]]\n\n  Random and punishing cuts to Medicare provider payments will not make \nthis program any more efficient. It will not make people's health care \nbetter. But it will reduce the supply of medical care to our seniors on \nMedicare.\n  The Washington board's ability to set prices gives it unprecedented \ncontrol over personal medical decisions, and that is wrong. Those \ndecisions should be left to the patient and his or her doctor alone, \nwithout the interference of 15 Washington bureaucrats.\n  No Washington bureaucrat should ever have the right to stand between \na patient and his or her doctor. At its core, the debate about the \nPresident's Independent Payment Advisory Board centers around a few \nquestions: Do the American people want a Washington board of unelected \npeople whom they do not know making their personal health care choices \nfor them or do they want to have the freedom and choice to make their \nown health care decisions? Do they want Members of Congress, the people \nwhom they send to Washington, to be able and to be held accountable--do \nthey want those Members of Congress to explain exactly what spending \ncuts are being discussed and need to be made to ensure Medicare's \nsolvency?\n  As we know, we all heard just last week, Medicare is going to be \nbankrupt even 5 years faster than it had been thought in the past. \nInterestingly enough--this is No. 4--President Obama doubled down on \nthis, on the President's Independent Payment Advisory Board.\n  In his April 15 spending speech to the Nation, he doubled down on his \ncommitment to this Washington rationing board. In the speech, he said \nhe actually wants to give the Board more power to slash Medicare \npayments to providers. Apparently, expanding his rationing board is one \nof the only tangible proposals that the President has to reform \nMedicare and reduce the debt.\n  The American people sent us to confront our financial and fiscal \ncrisis head on and to come up with solutions to solve the problem. They \ndid not send us to cower behind boards and commissions and empty \npromises. They asked us to come to Washington with the courage, the \nstrength, and the political will--the political will--to make tough \nspending decisions. Rather than stand up to the challenge, the \nPresident chose to go all in, placing his bet on 15 bureaucrats yet to \nbe identified.\n  He asked the American people to trust him that this rationing board \nwill squeeze out Medicare savings, at the same time, not impacting--he \nsays--our seniors' access to medical care. But I do not think this is a \nbet our Nation's seniors should take or should be willing to take.\n  Finally, No. 5, members of my party, the Republicans, are working to \nrepeal the President's Independent Payment Advisory Board. Senate \nRepublicans are taking a stand against this rationing board, against \nmore government control. Senator John Cornyn of Texas has introduced S. \n668. It is the Health Care Bureaucrats Elimination Act. This bill \nrepeals the President's Independent Payment Advisory Board, ensuring \nMedicare patients can get the care they need from the doctor they \nchoose. I am proud to be a cosponsor, an original cosponsor of this \npiece of legislation.\n  That is why I come to you again on the floor with a doctor's second \nopinion, as somebody who, for a quarter of a century in Wyoming, has \ntaken care of patients on Medicare--many patients on Medicare--to \nprovide a doctor's second opinion that this health care law is bad for \nthose patients. It is bad for providers, the nurses, and doctors who \ntake care of those patients, and it is bad for the taxpayers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am glad I was on the floor to hear the \ndistinguished Senator from Wyoming's comments about the Independent \nPayment Advisory Board, which is Washington, DC, gobbledegook, which \ntranslates into a rationing board which is going to limit seniors' \naccess to care, as he so ably described. I appreciate him talking about \nthat. It is a topic I will raise in a moment as part of my remarks. But \nI wish to express my appreciation to him for his remarks.\n  My larger concern is about our budget, the Federal budget. As one of \nour colleagues across the aisle told the media this week, he said he \nlooks forward to voting on the Republican budget. That may seem a \nlittle odd because this is the Senate and, actually, the Senate does \nnot have a budget. The Budget Committee on which I serve has not met to \nconsider a proposal by the chairman of the Budget Committee and we have \nnot had a chance to offer amendments to vote on it and then for it to \ncome to the Senate floor so we would have a Senate budget to vote on.\n  Of course, what he was talking about is, he is looking forward to \nvoting on the House budget. But I would say the Senate has not \nconsidered a budget for 750-plus days. No family, no business, no one \nin America, certainly no State can operate in this sort of fiscally \nirresponsible manner, only the Federal Government.\n  Now where are we? We are spending 43 cents out of every $1 in \nborrowed money--borrowed from our kids and grandkids. The fact is, a \nnewborn baby, born into this world today, inherits $46,000 in debt \nbecause we have not had the courage to meet this challenge as we must.\n  My colleague also said that is going to be one of the defining issues \nof 2012, which, by the way, is an election year. I guess what he means \nis, this is going to be an election issue. I think he is right but not \nfor the reasons he suggested.\n  First, I wish to refresh everyone's memory. It was just in December \nof last year that the President's own bipartisan fiscal debt commission \ngave us a report, and truly a blueprint, for what I think would be a \nresponsible start to dealing with this debt crisis we find ourselves \nconfronted with.\n  That report--again a bipartisan report--proposed $4 trillion in \ndeficit reduction over 10 years. The report said: Federal health care \nspending represents our single largest fiscal challenge over the long \nrun. As the baby boomers--people such as me and the Presiding Officer--\nretire and get older, health care costs will grow faster than the \neconomy. Federal health care spending threatens to balloon.\n  As if on cue, the Medicare trustees issued a report just this last \nmonth with even a starker warning. Medicare's trust fund will be \ninsolvent in 2024--about 13 years from now--and the gap between the \npromises Medicare has made to seniors and its funding--or ability to \nfund or pay for those services--is about $24 trillion. That is the so-\ncalled unfunded liability of Medicare.\n  Those estimates are, according to the Chief Actuary, an optimistic \nscenario, although it is hard to be optimistic about a $24 trillion \nunfunded liability. But we also know there have been other ominous \nwarnings both here at home and around the world. The International \nMonetary Fund, in a working paper last month, noted our potential debt \ncrisis.\n  The S rating agency downgraded its outlook for American debt--in \nother words, our ability to repay those bills--from stable to negative. \nPIMCO, the world's largest bondholder, no longer is purchasing American \nbonds, choosing to purchase other types of investment. That ought to be \na warning to us.\n  If we needed any reminder, even the Chinese Communist Party has given \nan earful to visiting Senators about our debt, of which they happen to \nown about $1 trillion. But they are worried about the value of their \nown investment and, hence, as Admiral Mullen said, we ought to realize \nthat because of that situation, debt is the single largest national \nsecurity issue facing America today.\n  Despite these ominous warnings and even reports from the President's \nown fiscal commission and a bipartisan one at that, the majority--\nSenator Reid--our friends across the aisle, simply are not taking the \nfiscal situation seriously. In fact, the majority leader was quoted \nrecently saying: It would be foolish, foolish for the leadership of the \nother party that controls the agenda on the floor and in committees, it \nwould be foolish for them to propose a budget.\n  The White House has shown twice this year so far that it is not truly \nserious about fiscal discipline. In February, the President proposed a \nbudget that completely ignored his own deficit commission. It had $8.7 \ntrillion in new spending, $1.6 trillion in new taxes, and an additional \n$13 trillion in debt.\n\n[[Page S3308]]\n\n  At the time the President released his proposed budget, there were a \nnumber of my colleagues who were very impressed by it. Some called it \nresponsible, others credible, others said it was a balanced approach, a \ngood blueprint, a step forward, a careful evaluation, a solid starting \npoint, and many other compliments as well. President Obama was so \npleased with his budget proposal that he called it ``our Sputnik \nmoment.'' But, of course, we know his Sputnik failed to launch. None of \nmy colleagues who heaped praise on the President's proposal were \nwilling to pass a budget resolution or even take up one and have it be \nconsidered and voted on.\n  So President Obama tried again in another big speech in April, when \nhe was finally brought, unwillingly, to the debate on our budget and on \nour debt crisis. In that speech at Georgetown in April, he called for \nhigher taxes as well as automatic tax increases that would kick in if \ncertain conditions were met. He called for deeper cuts in defense \nspending. He invented a new 12-year budget window to disguise the large \ndeficits that would otherwise appear if it were the traditional 10-year \nbudget window.\n  Then the President, I think beneath the dignity of his office, \nverbally abused the very people who had the courage to propose an \nalternative. Then, of course, we have heard the attacks he started, \nwhich have continued, the false attacks that Republicans want to ``end \nMedicare as we know it.'' Well, I will say Republicans do not want to \nend Medicare as we know it. That is an intentional falsehood. That is a \nlie. Republicans do not want to end Medicare as we know it. We are \nsimply trying to inject some cold, hard reality, as observed by the \nPresident's own debt commission, by the Medicare trustees, and everyone \nelse who has taken a responsible look at the problem.\n  What is that reality? Well, the reality is that Medicare as we know \nit will end unless we do something to fix it and to save it. My \ncolleagues want to talk about ending Medicare as we know it. They have \nshort memories because it was these very same colleagues who took $\\1/\n2\\ trillion out of Medicare to fund ObamaCare. They injected the \nrationing commission that my colleague from Wyoming just got through \ntalking about and which I will mention again in a moment.\n  Many seniors found out, as a result of the health care bill that \npassed only along a party-line vote--only Democratic votes in the \nSenate--that many seniors have already lost their access to Medicare \nAdvantage.\n  Other retirees are seeing that their former employers have canceled \ntheir health care plans and found themselves dropped into the Medicare \nsystem. It has never been explained to me how we can possibly cut $\\1/\n2\\ trillion out of Medicare which, as I said earlier, already has $24 \ntrillion in unfunded liabilities. So we are exacerbating--we are making \nthose liabilities worse, not better--to fund a new entitlement program.\n  I would ask: Who has changed Medicare? Who has made it impossible for \nus to continue, under the present course, to keep that promise to our \nseniors? Why is it so important that we work together to try to come up \nwith a solution to fix it? Just when we think the debate could not \nstoop any lower and people could not act any more irresponsibly, we are \nconfronted with political ads already about Republicans rolling a \nsenior off a cliff in a wheelchair.\n  I know the American people are smart enough to figure that out. They \nrealize this is just an attack ad, and they are smart enough to look at \nthe substance. But what we need is a real debate and a discussion and \ntry to work together to try to solve our problems, not just sort of \n``gotcha'' politics, the sort of thing people have come to loathe about \nCongress and Washington, DC--not people working together to solve \nproblems but people playing ``gotcha'' and focusing only on the next \nelection, not on the next generation.\n  My colleague from Wyoming talked about the Independent Payment \nAdvisory Board, and I realize that is a mouthful. But it is \nbureaucratese, Washington speak, for an unelected, unaccountable group \nof bureaucrats--15 of them--appointed who will actually have the job of \ncutting payments to doctors and hospitals, which will have the \npractical impact of limiting seniors' access to Medicare benefits. What \ngood is providing coverage to our seniors if they can't find a doctor \nor hospital to treat them?\n\n  Well, this is good old-fashioned--I should say bad old-fashioned--\nprice controls, and they don't work. We have seen that already in \nMedicare. In my State of Texas alone, about a third of the doctors \nalready limit their new Medicare patients, according to the Texas \nMedical Association. So if you live in the rural parts of the State, it \nis hard to find a doctor. We know the price controls of this rationing \nboard will make this trend worse and accelerate it, leading to longer \nwait times and harder-to-access treatment.\n  If the board forces our seniors to wait longer for the life-saving \ntreatments they need, does that change Medicare as we know it? Well, it \nsurely changes Medicare as people have come to expect it and deserve \nit. Yet the President has done nothing but double down on this \nrationing board. You heard in the speech he made in April--the one I \nreferred to a moment ago--at Georgetown. He said we are going to \nextract, in the first 10 years another $\\1/2\\ trillion in savings from \nMedicare, and in the second 10 years, another $1 trillion--$1.5 \ntrillion sucked out of Medicare. I have to ask, what do you think that \nis going to do to people's access to a doctor and a hospital?\n  That is the President's framework. It is not a budget. It is not the \nnumbers we are accustomed to considering and voting on, but that is his \nproposal. If the President's proposal to cut $1.5 trillion out of \nMedicare in the next 2 decades doesn't change Medicare as we know it, \nthen I don't know what does.\n  We know the House of Representatives has labored mightily to produce \na budget--the so-called Ryan plan. Many colleagues on the other side \nrelish the fact that they have stood back and waited for House \nRepublicans to act responsibly to try to wrestle with these problems \nand confront them, to tell the truth to the American people about the \nproblem, and then they tried their dead level best to meet those \nchallenges and deal with them like responsible adults. What did they \nget? A kick in the teeth--attack ads on TV.\n  Well, this will allow us, under the House proposal, to fix Medicare \nand to save it. Right now, it is on the road to bankruptcy and oblivion \nand, for the reasons I have observed, and others, it will not work. \nThere are some on our side of the aisle who may have some problems with \nthe details of the proposed House budget. But the responsible answer to \nthat is, let's take up and pass a budget in the Senate and give \nSenators on the Budget Committee an opportunity to offer amendments \nthat would improve it, if they can, and then bring it to the Senate \nfloor and do what we get paid for--take on these hard problems, \nconfront them, debate them, and then make the best decisions we can on \nbehalf of the people we work for in our States and across the country.\n  I think some elements of the House budget have an awful lot of \nappeal. In fact, we have seen, based on the experience with Medicare \nPart D, the prescription drug plan we passed earlier in the last \ndecade, by injecting some market forces and competition and \ntransparency, we can bring down prices and increase the quality of \nservices. In fact, the Medicare prescription drug plan has come in 46 \npercent below what it was originally expected to cost. That is an \nexample we can learn from and can begin to implement in trying to bring \ndown costs and yet not ration access to care.\n  Indeed, the premium support model is advocated by many Democrats and \nRepublicans and is similar to how the Federal Government provides \nhealth insurance for Federal employees, including Members of Congress. \nIf it is good enough for Congress, why isn't it good enough to consider \nfor American seniors? Do Republicans want to ``change Medicare as we \nknow it''? We want to save it, we want to fix it, and we want it to be \nthere as a promise that we can keep, as opposed to one we cannot keep, \nbecause it is on a path to bankruptcy and oblivion.\n  Our friends across the aisle say: No, trust us, we are from the \ngovernment, we will fix it. The way they want to do it is with \nDraconian cuts to doctors and hospitals that will limit people's access \nto health care. We believe the\n\n[[Page S3309]]\n\ntransparency and choice and competition that has worked in Medicare \nAdvantage and the prescription drug program can work here as well. If \npeople disagree with me, I respect their right to do that. But why \naren't we having a responsible debate on the floor and voting on a \nbudget, as opposed to the irresponsible rhetoric, attack ads, and the \ncampaign already begun for 2012? I am talking about from the White \nHouse to the Congress.\n  I think some of my colleagues firmly believe in their heart of \nhearts--they have been listening to political consultants, and they say \nthe way to win the next election is to scare the living daylights out \nof our seniors. I think that is irresponsible. People should resist the \ntemptation to do that to win an election and keep their job. Indeed, I \nfind myself in agreement with some of the comments made by President \nObama himself last summer. He said:\n\n       We're not going to be able to do anything about any of \n     these entitlements if what we do is characterized--whatever \n     proposals are put out there--as the other party is being \n     irresponsible; the other party is trying to hurt our seniors; \n     or the other party is doing X, Y, Z.\n\n  I agree with that, but that is not what we are hearing across the \naisle and on the airwaves of America. That was the President's message \nin 2010. It obviously has changed since 2012, since he began his own \npersonal attack on the only responsible budget proposal that has been \nmade in April.\n  Unfortunately, I think it is a prematurely begun election campaign \nfor 2012. It is an abdication of our responsibility to engage in this \nsort of ``gotcha'' politics, without trying to take on and confront the \nproblem. I don't think it is responsible to try to scare seniors for \npolitical points. But also I don't think Republicans should allow \nourselves to be merely punching bags and let the other side negatively \ncharacterize our motives or the seriousness of the problem our country \nfaces.\n  What we need is to resist the temptation to engage in this sort of \ngamesmanship and to try to do our dead level best to fulfill our oath \nand do our job as representatives of the American people. I think they \nwould welcome that. But all we have seen so far is the attacks and the \n``gotcha'' politics, which I think will do nothing but earn their \ncontempt, and deservedly so. We can do better and we need to try.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the budget. I have \nlong believed we need to get serious about the deficit. I have been \nlistening to my colleagues across the aisle, and I believe we have to \nbe responsible in the way we do it. That is why a year ago I was one of \na handful of Senators who fought for the creation of the fiscal debt \ncommission. In fact, a number of us came together and said we are going \nto get this debt commission or we won't vote for the debt ceiling \nincrease. As a result, while we could not get the statutory fiscal debt \ncommission, we got the debt commission. A lot of people thought it \nwould result in a report that would sit on a dusty shelf, but it has \nbeen well received, and it is the blueprint for a group of Senators who \nare negotiating a bipartisan plan for the budget.\n  Like everybody, I don't agree with every single recommendation in \nthat report. But I have, in fact, supported the bipartisan effort. I \nthink there are a lot of good things in that report and a very strong \nway to reduce the debt in the long term.\n  This week, we are scheduled to vote on the Ryan budget. If it wasn't \nalready crystal clear, this vote will show that a comprehensive \nsolution to our fiscal challenges cannot be achieved by drawing \nideological lines in the sand.\n  When the Ryan budget was first rolled out, some hailed it as \ncourageous. But I have to ask how it can be called ``courageous'' when \nit protects the $4 billion a year we give to oil companies, it fails to \naddress some of the military defense spending that even Secretary Gates \nhas said could be cut. Instead the House passed its budgets on the \nbacks of the middle class and seniors. In Minnesota, we don't call that \ncourageous.\n  Before we get into the policy, we should step back and look at the \nnumbers. According to the CBO, our debt is currently projected to reach \n67 percent of GDP in 2022, but under the Ryan plan debt would actually \nreach 70 percent of GDP by 2022.\n  So despite $4.3 trillion in drastic and painful cuts--two-thirds of \nwhich would come on the backs of the middle class--the plan barely \nreduces deficits at all over the next decade.\n  Despite the fact that the budget doesn't achieve what it sets out to \naccomplish in deficit reduction, leaders in the House continue to try \nto frame the debate in terms of numbers. That is because when you take \ntheir plan to the American people and ask them, ``Are these your \npriorities?'' and, ``are these your values?'' the resounding answer is, \n``no.'' The American people want a reasonable, bipartisan plan that \naddresses our serious challenges. That House Ryan budget is not the \nanswer. What this debate boils down to is not where we need to get but \nhow we will get there.\n  I believe we need to reduce this debt. I believe we can reduce that \n$4 trillion in the next 10 years. I believe there is a much better way \nto do it than what we have seen in the Ryan budget.\n  It may look like this plan to end Medicare that they passed in the \nHouse is reducing health care costs, but it only does so by ending \nMedicare as we know it.\n  This plan would gradually replace Medicare with a system of vouchers \nthat seniors could use to help buy private health insurance. This would \nput private companies in control of health benefits and cause seniors \nto pay more for their health care or get fewer benefits.\n  Because the voucher will fail to keep pace with increases in the cost \nof health care, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that seniors \nand the disabled would pay sharply more for Medicare coverage under the \nRyan plan--an average of $6,359 more in the first year, more than \ndouble the cost under current law.\n  Defenders of this plan say it won't affect anyone who is over 55 and \nthat Medicare will be available for them. Unfortunately, this isn't \ntrue. The Ryan plan would repeal the part of the health care reform law \nthat closes the Medicare prescription drug ``doughnut hole.'' This is \nthe gap in coverage where seniors have to pay all of the costs of their \nprescription drugs. Currently, that number is a little over $3,600. \nThis would mean seniors would have to pay much more out of pocket for \nprescription drugs. In Minnesota, that would cost our seniors $40 \nmillion in 2012 in additional drug costs alone.\n  I believe we must do all we can to rein in health care costs. \nMinnesota has always been a leader in providing low-cost, high-quality \nhealth care, and I believe we can be an example of how we can reduce \nhealth care spending, while still delivering excellent care to \npatients.\n  For instance, if the spending per patient with chronic diseases \neverywhere in the country mirrored the efficient level of spending in \nthe Mayo Clinic's home region of Rochester, MN, Medicare could have \nsaved $50 billion over 5 years. Medicare could have saved $50 billion \nover 5 years by using the Mayo model--some of the highest quality \nhealth care in the world. So, yes, there are ways we can better deliver \nhealth care not only for less cost but also for better results.\n  Medicare must continue to institute further reforms including the \ncreation of the accountable care organizations, reductions in payments \nto hospitals with high readmission rates, bundled payments, and a focus \non fraud. These reforms are meant to incentivize doctors and hospitals \nto provide high-quality, efficient care.\n  The radical changes to Medicare that are proposed in the Ryan budget \nare not solutions to our long-term debt. There is a way to get the \ncountry on a better fiscal path, one where you are not doing it on the \nbacks of our seniors. You would think that if you were going to take \nsuch a drastic step as any Medicare as we know it, you would put most \nof the savings toward deficit reduction. Instead, the Ryan budget uses \nits $4.3 trillion in savings for $4.2 trillion in tax breaks that would \ndisproportionately go to the wealthiest\n\n[[Page S3310]]\n\nAmericans. Again, instead of putting that money into deficit savings, \nit disproportionately puts the money in the pockets of the wealthiest \nAmericans. At the same time the House Republican budget is \ndisproportionately targeting seniors and the middle class, it leaves \nthe Pentagon--which makes up 20 percent of the budget--virtually \nuntouched. Defense Secretary Gates himself has mapped out several smart \ncuts and alternatives we can make to the Defense budget to save a net \n$78 billion over the next 5 years. In the spirit of shared sacrifice, I \nagree we should include commonsense cuts to defense spending to reduce \nthe Federal budget.\n\n  Those are just some of the ideas. This basically comes down to value. \nLook what we can save. We can save $240 million--$240 million--simply \nby negotiating prescription drug costs under Medicare Part D--$240 \nmillion over 10 years. We can save $4 billion annually--that is $40 \nbillion over 10 years--by taking away the tax breaks of the oil \ncompanies. We can save $78 billion with the defense cuts I just \ndiscussed. We can bring the tax rates back to the Clinton levels for \npeople making over $1 million. Even if we set it at $1 million, we save \n$360 million over 10 years. That is real money. That is a budget that \nis based on values that protect the middle class.\n  When I talk to the people of my State, they want a plan that has \nshared sacrifice, that is reasonable, and that is bipartisan. They want \na balanced and reasonable approach. They want us to come together on a \nplan that will strengthen our country. I look forward to continuing to \nwork across the aisle to make this happen. Unfortunately, that is not \nwhat this Ryan budget is about.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Change of Course in Afghanistan\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to call for a change of \ncourse in Afghanistan. On May 1, a targeted strike by U.S. forces \nachieved a central goal of the war that began in Afghanistan nearly a \ndecade ago.\n  The death of Osama bin Laden by no means ends the threat posed by al-\nQaida or other terrorist groups. However, bin Laden's death provides an \nopportunity for Congress and the White House to assess a new strategy \nfor keeping America safe and defending our interests around the world.\n  Today, I am calling for three changes to our strategy in Afghanistan. \nFirst, we must begin handing responsibility over to Afghan forces and \nbring most of our troops home by the end of next year. Second, we \nshould focus on fighting terrorism, not nation building. Third, our \nefforts to keep America safe from terrorism should center on where most \nterrorist threats come from, Pakistan.\n  The United States should not be doing the work the Afghans should be \ndoing for themselves. The Afghans need to stand up and take \nresponsibility for the security of their own country.\n  The President has announced this July will mark the beginning of a \ntransition of security responsibility to Afghan forces. However, in my \nview, the transition plan is too slow. We need to begin handing \nresponsibility of security to Afghan forces immediately and aim to have \nmost U.S. combat troops out of Afghanistan by the end of next year.\n  We should leave behind only a small force necessary to hunt down and \nkill terrorists in Afghanistan and help the Afghan military perform \ntheir duties.\n  We Americans are fortunate to have the best military in the world. \nThese brave men and women continue to do everything we ask of them. \nThey have spent almost 10 years fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. Many \nof our troops have spent multiple years deployed overseas, hiking over \nfrigid mountains, traversing hot deserts with heavy loads on their \nbacks, and spending years apart from their families. But we don't hear \nthese troops complain. These Americans continue to serve and to fight \nand to die for a country we all love.\n  Seeing these troops in action during my visit to Afghanistan last \nyear was truly remarkable, very impressive. Their unwavering commitment \nhas come, however, at a great price. As of today, 1,219 troops have \nbeen killed in Afghanistan, 11,411 have been wounded, 9 Montanans have \ndied, and 50 Montanans have been wounded fighting in Afghanistan.\n  These Montanans hail from small towns such as Hungry Horse, Darby, \nShepherd, and Troy. Behind each of these fallen warriors are dozens of \nbroken hearts in their families and communities. Thousands more will \nsuffer their entire lives with post-traumatic stress disorder or \ntraumatic brain injuries that have thus far gone undetected.\n  These brave troops continue to fight because we ask them to and \nbecause they love their country. I receive letters from their families \nall the time, like this one from Janice Roberts from Malta, MT. Janice \nwrites:\n\n       Our 27-year-old son is being sent on a third combat \n     deployment to Afghanistan. This is his second ordeal in less \n     than a year. Our son has not even recovered emotionally or \n     mentally from the last two deployments. Truthfully, the only \n     people who care about what is happening to our young troops \n     are the military families.\n\n  This letter is a reminder we have a sacred obligation to our troops \nand their families. Any mission we ask them to accomplish must be \nvital--absolutely vital--to America's national security.\n  It is time we demand the Afghans shoulder more of the load. Afghan \npolice forces stand at 285,000. In 2010, the Afghan National Security \nForce grew by 70,000. We have spent 10 years training them. It is time \nfor the Afghans to do the job we have trained them to do.\n  As we draw down in Afghanistan, the Afghans will have to step up. As \nwe withdraw, they will have the task of governing their own country. \nThe Afghans will develop Afghan solutions to Afghan problems, and that \nis the way it needs to be.\n  Second, we need to invest more in killing terrorists and less on \nnation building. The raid that killed bin Laden relied on years of \nperseverance by intelligence officers, expensive surveillance \ntechnology, and the best special operations forces on Earth. We need to \ncontinue to make investments in these capabilities to see that other \nterrorists face the same fate as bin Laden.\n  As we invest more in counterterrorism capabilities, we do so knowing \nfull well we are facing enormous challenges at home. The U.S. \nGovernment's total debt exceeds $14 trillion.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for another 5 \nminutes, and I will not ask for another extension.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank my good friend for being so helpful.\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ADM Mike Mullen, described \nthe U.S. debt as the ``biggest national security threat.'' Since \nSeptember 11, 2001, we have spent over $1.2 trillion in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Just think of that--$1.2 trillion. Every month we spend \n$10 billion in Afghanistan. This is roughly $1 out of every $7 we spend \non defense. This level of spending is simply not sustainable. We should \nfocus on the core mission that led us to Afghanistan to begin with, and \nthat is keeping America safe from terrorism.\n  Finally, and most important, our fight against global terrorism must \nbegin to focus on Pakistan. In 2008, then-CIA Director Michael Hayden \nsaid:\n\n       Let me be very clear today. Virtually every major terrorist \n     threat that my agency is aware of has threads back to the \n     tribal areas of Pakistan.\n\n  A State Department report last summer reiterated this assessment and \nfound that ``al-Qaida's core in Pakistan remained the most formidable \nterrorist organization targeting the U.S. homeland.''\n  We have invested enormous sums to build an effective partnership with \nPakistan to fight terrorism. Since 2002, the United States has provided \nover $18 billion in foreign assistance to Pakistan--the highest of any \nother country in 2009 except Iraq and Afghanistan. Yet it is no secret \nthat Pakistan plays a double game. Osama bin Laden's hideout location \nraises serious questions.\n\n  I recently called upon Secretary of Defense Gates and Secretary \nClinton to\n\n[[Page S3311]]\n\ntake a hard look at whether Pakistan is doing enough to find and kill \nterrorists in its own country. I will not support providing funding to \nPakistan until I view this assessment. I am gravely concerned about the \ncommitment of Pakistan's military intelligence services to fighting \nterrorism.\n  During a visit to Pakistan last year, I made it clear to President \nZardari and General Kayani that Pakistan must do more to eliminate safe \nhavens within their own borders. We cannot accept excuses; we need \nresults. Without progress in Pakistan, we cannot succeed in \nAfghanistan. But the sad irony is that our large troop presence in \nAfghanistan actually makes it harder to press Pakistan to crack down on \nterrorists and militants.\n  Most of the fuel, food, and ammunition for our troops in Afghanistan \nis imported through Pakistan. As long as we depend on the Port of \nKarachi for our supplies, we have limited leverage on Pakistan to force \nan end to this deadly double game. To effectively defend our Nation \nagainst terrorism, we need to begin withdrawing from Afghanistan and \nfocus more on Pakistan.\n  Our military can do almost anything we ask it to do, but it can't do \neverything. To meet the growing challenges around the world, we need to \nstart bringing our troops home from Afghanistan this July and complete \nthe withdrawal by the end of next year. We need to work together to \nmake the 21st century the American century--to focus on jobs, improving \neducation, rebuilding roads and bridges, and making the American \neconomy the best place to do business in the world.\n  The death of Osama bin Laden marks a turning point in history. We \nmust take advantage of this opportunity to chart a new course in \nAfghanistan. I salute the brave men and women who made this day \npossible and who continue to serve overseas.\n  My thoughts are with the hundreds of Montanans serving in the Armed \nForces. May God bless America and may He keep our brave troops safe.\n  Mr. President, I again thank my friend for yielding me time, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nKentucky is recognized for 1 hour.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak about the \nPATRIOT Act. I think it is a shame we are not going to be debating or \nhaving any votes on this act, particularly since it was promised by our \nleadership.\n  I would like at this time to yield the floor to my good friend, the \nSenator from New Mexico, if he would like to make a few remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, let me just say to my \ncolleague from Kentucky, Senator Paul, I very much appreciate his \nyielding a little time, and I am looking forward to hearing some of his \nstatements on the PATRIOT Act. I know this is an issue that is close to \nhis heart.\n  I served with his father in the House, and I know he was very \npassionate on this issue. I know it is an issue on which the Senator \nfrom Kentucky campaigned and about which he has great passion, and he \nhas brought that passion to the Senate floor. So I very much appreciate \nthat and would like to work with him.\n  First of all, when we call it the PATRIOT Act, I put that in quotes \nand call it the so-called ``PATRIOT Act.'' This is not a patriot act. \nPatriots stand up for the Constitution. Patriots stand up for the \nfreedoms and liberty that are embodied in the Constitution. I think \ntrue patriots, when they are public servants, stand up and do what is \nright, even if it is unpopular.\n  One of the things I talked about a little earlier today was how the \nPATRIOT Act became law. I was over in the House of Representatives, \nserving with the father of the Senator from Kentucky, and I remember \nwell what happened on 9/11 when the planes went into the Twin Towers in \nNew York, and then shortly after a plane was coming into the Pentagon \nin Washington, and how we were all horrified at this incident and what \nhad happened. What transpired on this legislation, this bill that later \nbecame law, the so-called PATRIOT Act, is everybody became so concerned \nthat they decided we, the institution, the Congress, could not debate \nit; we had to just pass legislation we had not even read. So we did not \nhave committee hearings. We did not bring in all the people who \nnormally would be brought into the process, who understand the \nConstitution. We didn't do any of that. Within a matter of weeks after \n9/11, we brought a bill to the floor of the House of Representatives \nwithout the normal preparation, and basically everybody was told we \njust need to pass this.\n\n  I remember one Senator--one Representative at the time--waving a \npiece of paper and saying: There is only one copy of this on the floor, \nand it is hot off the press. He had a piece of paper from the Xerox \nmachine that was still hot. Those were the circumstances in which we \nvoted, and that is how we got the so-called PATRIOT Act.\n  What has happened since then? Senator Baucus, my colleague here from \nMontana, talked about the capture of Osama bin Laden. We have been in \nAfghanistan, we displaced the Taliban government, we eliminated the \ntraining camps, we decimated al-Qaida, we captured bin Laden. We have \ndone all these things, but one thing we have not done is come back and \nrevisit the PATRIOT Act, taken a really hard look at it to say is it \nworking or is it not and allow all the Senators here the opportunity to \noffer amendments.\n  I know the Senator from Kentucky has several amendments he would like \nto offer. I have an amendment that really focuses on what has happened \nhere today--in the last couple of days. We had an extension. We thought \nwe were going to have debate. Because of the gridlock and everything \nthat goes on here, we got jammed up. My amendment would say, let's not \nextend this for 4 years without open debate. It would say, let's take 3 \nmonths, do another extension, and really focus on the idea that when \nthat 3 months is up, we are going to be allowed the time to have \ndebate, to have discussion, to have very knowledgeable individuals who \nserve on the Judiciary Committee--I believe the Presiding Officer \nserves on the Judiciary Committee, others serve on the Judiciary \nCommittee and have the expertise--with all that expertise come to the \nfloor. I am on an amendment with Senator Leahy which is a good, solid \namendment that has to do with various aspects. I hope we can get that \nto the floor. We all have amendments, but we are jammed up in this \nprocess now. The amendment I would propose is that rather than 4 years, \nfor 3 months what we do is organize ourselves so we can come back, we \ncan have the debate, we can have an open amendment process and then \nmove on to whatever we move on to. But at least the Senate will have \nworked its will.\n  We are told over and over--and I always heard it in my civics class--\nthat the Senate is the greatest deliberative body. If we are a great \ndeliberative body, we have not focused that deliberation on one of the \nmost important aspects of our society; that is, our liberty and our \nfreedom that is enshrined in the Constitution.\n  I find it a little ironic, in a way, the contrast we have today with \nthe situation in the Middle East. We have many of these countries where \nthe people of those countries are striving for more freedom, striving \nfor more democracy, and we are supporting that effort. President Obama \nand many Members of the Senate, many Members of Congress are saying we \nthink this is a good idea, that there is a striving for more freedom. \nBut here on the floor of the Senate, we are not willing to analyze what \nthis so-called PATRIOT Act has done to our freedom in the United \nStates.\n  This is not just my view. There are some independent views as to why \nthe PATRIOT Act needs to be examined, why the PATRIOT Act needs this \nopen debate, needs deliberation. In March of 2007, the Justice \nDepartment inspector general came out and took a look at the PATRIOT \nAct process and the national security letters. As the Senator from \nKentucky knows, a national security letter doesn't have court \nsupervision. The FBI can issue a national security letter--an official \nin the FBI--without that kind of supervision. The inspector general \nconcluded there was some serious abuse within the Department of Justice \nas to how the FBI and other officials were using national security \nletters. I put that information from an inspector general in the Record \nearlier this morning. It highlights serious problems. We have not\n\n[[Page S3312]]\n\nlooked at that. We have not debated that. We have not allowed \namendments on that national security letter. I think the Senator from \nKentucky has one on that, which he is going to be talking about in a \nlittle bit.\n  Second, an independent branch of our government--the courts--has \nlooked at the PATRIOT Act. Several courts have found provisions of the \nPATRIOT Act unconstitutional in terms of the fourth amendment, in terms \nof the first amendment, and many of those decisions are working their \nway up through the courts. It is only prudent that we, as the Senate, \ntake a look at those rulings, analyze what the courts are saying, and \nthen come back to this so-called PATRIOT Act and see whether we need to \nmake changes based on what the courts have told us. We have those \nrulings. We have not taken a look at them.\n  We are at a point where we need deliberation. I very much appreciate \nthe Senator from Kentucky speaking out on this issue.\n  Benjamin Franklin used to talk about our freedom and liberty that was \nin the Constitution, and I am paraphrasing here, but he would say that \nthose who would sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither. That is \na very powerful statement by one of the Founders of our democracy.\n  With that, I thank the Senator from Kentucky for yielding me time, \nand I look forward to hearing his comments on the floor and look \nforward to working with him so we can get an open, deliberative process \nhere that will really serve America and move us toward the deliberative \nprocess I think we all want.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has the floor.\n  Mr. PAUL. I thank the Senator for his comments. I think what this \nshows is that it is a bipartisan effort that says we should protect our \nConstitution. Those on the left and those on the right who believe in \nthe Constitution believe it should be protected. That brings together \nsome of us who may not necessarily agree on all other issues, but when \nit comes to the Constitution, when it comes to the basic Bill of \nRights, we are concerned both on the right and left, on the Democratic \nand the Republican side. The problem is that those of us who are \nconcerned with the Constitution are in the minority of both sides, so \nwe are being quieted down, we are being told to sit quietly in the back \nof the room and don't make waves. We want to have a debate over the \nPATRIOT Act because we are concerned about our liberties. We are all \nconcerned about terrorism too, but we don't think you have to give up \nyour liberties in order to combat terrorism.\n  On February 15, we extended the PATRIOT Act for 90 days. During that \ntime and on the Senate floor on February 15, we were promised a week of \ndebate, and we were promised an open amendment process. We are now \namidst a process where we will have no debate and no amendments. Do we \nfear terrorism so much that we will not have debate? Do we fear \nterrorism so much that we throw out our Constitution and are unwilling \nand afraid to debate our Constitution? I think it is a sad day that we \ncan't do that. Are Senators afraid to vote on the issues of the day, \nafraid to debate the Constitution, afraid to have an open forum and \ndebate whether the PATRIOT Act is constitutional? I think this does a \ngreat disservice to the voters.\n\n  They talk about this being the world's most deliberative body. We are \nunwilling to deliberate. We are unwilling to have questions broached as \nto whether the PATRIOT Act is unconstitutional. We have had 99 days \nsince we extended it, 43 days in session, and we have had 56 votes. \nWhat does that mean in the context of things? We are setting a record \nfor the least amount of votes ever to occur in the Senate. There are \nsome important questions we should be debating, but unless it is a \nforgone conclusion, unless they have counted the votes and decided the \noutcome before we have the debate, we are precluded from debating.\n  Wendell Phillips, the great abolitionist, wrote, ``Eternal vigilance \nis the price of liberty.'' The PATRIOT Act is a perfect example of how \na lack of vigilance leads to loss of liberty.\n  In the aftermath of 9/11, we amended the Constitution with the \nPATRIOT Act. You say: Whoa, we didn't have an amendment to the \nConstitution, did we? We did not do it the way we are supposed to, but \nwe did in reality amend the Constitution with the PATRIOT Act. How did \nthis happen? We were fearful. Mr. President, 9/11 had happened, and we \nwanted to stop terrorism. All of us want that, but do we have to give \nup our constitutional liberties in order to do that?\n  How did the PATRIOT Act change the Constitution? How did the PATRIOT \nAct change the fourth amendment? In the fourth amendment, it says:\n\n       The right of the people to be secure in their persons, \n     houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches \n     and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall \n     issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or \n     affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be \n     searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\n\n  The PATRIOT Act changed this. The PATRIOT Act changed the standard \nfrom probable cause, which is a longstanding position and standard \nwithin the courts which limits the police from coming into your house \nunless there is probable cause that you have either committed a crime \nor are in the act of committing a crime--we changed this to a standard \nwe now call relevance. But that is changing the Constitution.\n  How do you change the Constitution by majority vote? It is supposed \nto be a supermajority in both bodies. Then it is to go back and be \nratified by three-fourths of the States. It is supposed to be difficult \nto change the Constitution, difficult to amend the Constitution. Why? \nBecause we thought some of these rights were so important that we \nshould not allow a majority to change them. Those of us who own guns \nand believe in gun ownership think the second amendment is protected \nfrom a simple majority taking away the second amendment. Likewise, the \nfirst amendment--those of us who prize the ability of the press to \nprint and to respond and to hold beliefs, however unpopular, those of \nus who wish to have a country in which religion is not hampered and we \ncan say what we believe and not have it hampered by the government, we \ndon't believe a majority should take away these rights.\n  But a majority did take away part of the fourth amendment because we \nchanged the standard of the fourth amendment from probable cause to \nrelevance. So if they want to look at your records, they just have to \nsay it is relevant. They don't have to say you are a terrorist. They \ndon't have to say you are a foreigner. They don't have to say you are \nconspiring with anyone. They just have to say they have some interest \nin your library records.\n  How often is this going on? There is something called suspicious \nactivity reports. Some of this was started before the PATRIOT Act, some \nof it is separate from the PATRIOT Act, but much of it was emboldened \nby the PATRIOT Act. The suspicious activity reports are where your bank \nspies on you. You may not know this is happening, you may not even know \nif they have spied on you, and they probably won't tell you. But if you \nmade a transaction that involved more than $5,000, you could well have \nbeen spied on by your bank and reported to the government.\n  Some people say: I am not doing anything wrong; I don't care if they \nlook at my records. Here is the thing: If you look at my visa bill, you \ncan tell what doctors I go to. If I see a psychiatrist and I don't want \neverybody to know it, that may be on my Visa bill these days. What \nmagazines I read is on my Visa bill, what books I order from Amazon or \nanother bookseller from the Internet, whether I drink alcohol, whether \nI gamble. There is a lot about your life that is involved in your \nfinancial records, and I think they do deserve protection and we do \ndeserve a standard where we don't say, well, it might be relevant, or, \nwe might just want to troll through all these records to see if anybody \nmight be committing a crime.\n  This one is even worse than many of the other aspects because the \nsuspicious activity reports do not begin with the government asking any \nquestions. They tell your bank to watch you. Your bank is to watch you \nand to watch all of your transactions and to report to the government. \nSo they have force.\n  You say: Maybe they are only reporting terrorists. Since 2001, since \n9/11, 8\n\n[[Page S3313]]\n\nmillion suspicious activity reports--8 million--have been filed. Over 1 \nmillion of these are filed a year. The thing is, you could well ask for \na Freedom of Information Act inquiry and ask whether you have been \ninvestigated by your government for your transactions.\n  My point is this is an invasion of your privacy. It does not have any \njudicial restraint upon it. And the other thing is, it may not even be \ngood for finding terrorists. It may be they are getting so much \ninformation they cannot even read or listen to all the information. It \nis kind of like what they are doing at the airports. Because they \ninsist everybody be searched and everybody be patted down, we are \npatting down 6-year-olds. A little girl in my town--her dad is a \nphysician and practiced with me at my same practice--was patted down \nwhere they are putting their hands inside her pants. This is absurd--6-\nyear-old girls.\n  The thing is, by doing that, they are wasting time on people who will \nnot be attacking us and spending less time on people who will be \nattacking us. It is the same with banking records. If they are looking \nat your banking records, they do not have the time to spend looking at \nrecords of people who possibly would be attacking us. Eight million \nrecords have been looked at--no judge's order, no judicial review. This \none is not even reviewed by anybody in government. They are giving this \npower carte blanche to banks, and they are telling the banks: If you do \nnot spy on your customer, you will be fined. They estimate that $7 \nbillion a year is spent by banks complying with this order to spy on \ntheir customers.\n  The thing is, we are having trouble in our economy. The banks are \nstruggling. The economy is struggling. We are having trouble with jobs. \nAnd yet we are going to add $7 billion of costs onto the banks to spy \non their customers.\n  Might there be an occasion where a bank transfer or bank activity \ncould be a terrorist activity? Yes. If we are investigating those, \nlet's ask for a warrant. You say: It will be too slow. We never get it. \nWarrants are almost never denied. There is a special court set up for \nthe investigation of intelligence. It is called the FISA Court. It has \nbeen around since the 1970s. Before the PATRIOT Act, the FISA Court \nnever turned down a warrant.\n  You say: These people are awful; we have to get them off the street. \nIt doesn't matter, I don't want any restraint; I just want it done.\n  Unfortunately, that has been the attitude of the people up here and a \nmajority of people after 9/11. The people were so frightened that they \nsaid: Do anything, I don't care.\n  The problem with that attitude is, even if you want to argue that has \nnot been abused yet, what happens when people are elected to your \ngovernment who decide they do not like your religion or you believe in \na certain kind of marriage, and you want to say this and they want to \ninvestigate you? There is no step to stop that. There is no step to \nsay: Your church believes in this unorthodox belief or this belief that \nwe do not call politically correct or it is no longer acceptable, but \nwe want to investigate the banking records of the church and see if we \ncan take away their IRS number or tax exemption. If you do not have any \nrestraint to these activities, someday we will get a government that \nhas no restraint and then goes forward to say: We want to get that \nchurch shut down because that church is saying something we disagree \nwith or these people are reading these books we do not like.\n  This goes across the party aisle. The Library Association is \nconcerned with this also, that people's books are being looked at. \nThink about it. Do you want the government to know what books you read? \nDo you want to be on a watchlist because of the books you read?\n  They say: Oh, there are provisions. We have made provisions. That \nwill not happen.\n  The only way you have a real provision or protection is if you have \nprocedural steps that say someone must review this before it happens.\n  If we have someone who we think is terrible and they need to be off \nthe streets, if they are accused of rape, accused of murder, accused of \nrobbery, accused of the most heinous crimes we can think of, and it is \n2 in the morning, we call a judge and we get a warrant. It is almost \nnever turned down. But it is one step removed from the police breaking \ndown every door of every person they suspect and not having any kind of \ndiscussion with someone who has a level head, who is not part of the \ninvestigation.\n  Many up here will say we are in grave danger. If the PATRIOT Act \nexpires, all things could happen and terrorism could break loose. What \nthey are arguing, though, is that there is a scenario where we would \nnot get warrants to investigate terrorism. That never existed. Before \nthe PATRIOT Act, we were not turning down these warrants.\n  Some have argued that Moussaoui, the 19th hijacker--he was captured a \nmonth in advance of 9/11--many have said that if we only had the \nPATRIOT Act, we could have gotten him. That is untrue. There is a \nprovision called the lone wolf provision in the PATRIOT Act, but we did \nnot get Moussaoui because we did not do our job. We did not communicate \nwell. The superiors to the officers and the FBI agents in the field did \nnot even ask for a warrant. They turned down a request for a warrant \nwithout even asking the FISA Court for it.\n  We have the 19th hijacker a month in advance. We have his computer. \nWhen we do look at his computer on 9/12, we link him very quickly, \nwithin a matter of hours, to all the other hijackers. It is easy in \nhindsight to say we could have stopped 9/11, but to tell you the truth, \nwe have to look at the rules and say: Could we possibly have gotten \nthat information? The answer is yes.\n  The FBI agent in Minnesota wrote 70 letters to his superiors. The FBI \nwas told that Moussaoui was possibly an agent of terrorism. The French \nGovernment confirmed it. That was all we needed. With that information, \nhad they gone to the FISA Court, they would have gotten a warrant. When \nthe 9/11 Commission report came out, they acknowledged as much. \nMoussaoui's warrant, in all likelihood, would not have been turned \ndown, and there is a possibility we would have stopped it.\n  The suspicious activity reports are particularly galling because they \nare businesses that are forced to spy on their citizens. There is \nanother form of spying that goes on as well. These are called national \nsecurity letters. These are like warrants. They go after your banking \nrecords, such as the suspicious activity reports, but they are a little \nmore targeted in the sense that the government is asking for an NSL. \nBut it is not a judge who asks for an NSL. The person who asks for an \nNSL is an FBI agent, essentially a police or law enforcement agent. The \ndanger here is that we have removed the step where the police officer \nor the FBI agent would then ask for permission from a judge. That is my \nproblem with these national security letters.\n  Some say: We are not doing that many of them. Initially, we were not. \nNow we have done over 200,000 national security letters. One of my \nreforms, if it were to take place, would be to ask judges to review \nthese. I see no reason why they should not review them.\n  Some have said: You have no expectation of privacy. The courts have \nalready ruled that you have no expectation of privacy in your papers or \nelectronic records. This is the way it has been interpreted, but I \nthink it has been misinterpreted. I think it has been interpreted that \nyour banking records do not deserve privacy when they are not in your \nhouse, and I think it is an incorrect interpretation of the fourth \namendment. The fourth amendment says that in your papers, you are to be \nprotected. It does not specify those papers are in your possession or \nin someone else's.\n  At this time, I yield the floor to my good friend from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I thank Senator Paul. I came down to the \nfloor to thank him for bringing up a number of issues of concern and \nbeing willing to stand here and tell America what those concerns are.\n  I also respect his demanding the opportunity for debate and for \namendments of such an important bill. It is extraordinary, particularly \nafter the majority leader had promised in February that the PATRIOT Act \nrenewal would get a week of debate with the chance to offer amendments. \nAfter a couple of weeks of doing absolutely nothing on the Senate \nfloor, Senator Paul and others were denied the opportunity to offer \namendments that would\n\n[[Page S3314]]\n\nhave brought up legitimate debates about the PATRIOT Act.\n  There are a number of things a lot of us would have liked to have \nlearned more about, heard some of the arguments we have heard from \nSenator Paul today. Unfortunately, that has been limited to a \nrelatively small amount of time. It is, frankly, stunning to me that \nthe majority is actually willing to let the PATRIOT Act expire rather \nthan give Senator Paul a few amendments. That is an extraordinary \nsituation for the Senate that considers itself the world's greatest \ndeliberative body when one of the most important pieces of legislation \nwe could consider is jammed up against a break with no opportunity for \namendment.\n  I do not want to interrupt Senator Paul's flow because I think a lot \nof the things he is talking about are important that we consider. \nUnfortunately, they will not be considered. It does not sound as if his \ndebates will be allowed and for the amendments to be considered. It \nsounds as if what they are going to try to do is blame him for us \nvoting late or early. But I commend Senator Paul for standing for good \njudgment and common sense on a matter of this importance. Whether we \nagree or disagree with all the amendments is not the point. It is too \nimportant to be handled this way.\n  I will allow Senator Paul to continue, and I yield the floor. I thank \nhim for what he is doing.\n  Mr. PAUL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, not only are we not debating the PATRIOT \nAct, but does the Senator from South Carolina think we have given \nsufficient floor time to amendments and proposals as to how to deal \nwith the debt problem?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Kentucky knows \nthe answer to that question. Some of us have reserved time between 2:30 \np.m. and 3:30 p.m. for some give-and-take and some debate on the floor \nabout the budget votes that will be this afternoon. But that time was \ncanceled by the majority.\n  We have an impending debt that everyone in the world, except for \nthose inside this body, seem to understand. We are in trouble as a \ncountry. The majority has not produced a budget in over 700 days, I \nthink it is. At the same time, we are trying to negotiate how we will \nmove forward on this huge important point of raising the debt ceiling \nwhich none of us want to do. We are avoiding the subject of balancing \nthe budget. The majority leader has said these kinds of issues are off \nthe table.\n  It is very frustrating, whether it is the debt ceiling, whether it is \nthe PATRIOT Act and our homeland security, that we are spending weeks \ndoing nothing, bringing up, in some cases, controversial judges who \nshould not have been nominated in the first place, spending day after \nday of floor time and not bringing up important issues. We are all \nconcerned. I know America is concerned.\n  Again, I thank Senator Paul very much for the willingness to bring \nout the point that we have something here that is very important to our \nsecurity, to the privacy of every American. It needs to be vetted, \ndebated, and amendments need to be offered. Yet this has been denied \nafter a promise. I certainly encourage the Senator to continue. I thank \nhim for his courage.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, one other question is, we will not all agree \nnecessarily on the PATRIOT Act. The thing is, even for those who feel \nit is important it not expire, why would they not consent to some \ndebate? I have asked for three amendments, three votes. We could do \nthem in the next hour. We could debate and have this time and there \nwould be no expiration of the PATRIOT Act for those who think it \nexpiring is a problem.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, as the Senator from Kentucky knows, he has \n11 amendments he wishes to have considered. He was willing to compress \nthe time so we could do that expeditiously. They would not agree to \nthat. Senator Paul is willing to compromise to three amendments. It \nsounds as though they do not want him to offer those amendments \nbecause, frankly, they do not want to take a vote on some of them that \nmay expose what they believe. It is a frustrating situation for Senator \nPaul. As our majority friends over here like to do, they cause the \nproblem and try to blame it on us. As the Senator said, within a few \nhours, this could be decided and over. We could pass the PATRIOT Act. \nFolks could vote for or against what they want. We could send it to the \nHouse, and it could be done. It does appear the majority is willing to \nlet this important legislation lapse just to stop the Senator from \nKentucky from offering a few amendments. That is an extraordinary \nsituation.\n  Again, I thank the Senator for yielding. I appreciate him getting \nthis debate out on the floor.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I do not quite grasp why they are so fearful \nof debate and fearful of votes, that they are willing to let the \nPATRIOT Act expire to prevent debate and prevent votes. The sticking \npoint turns out to be an amendment basically on preventing gun records \nfrom being sifted through under the PATRIOT Act. People say: Well, what \nif someone--a terrorist--is selling guns illegally? Couldn't we get \nthem? Yes, we could get them the way we get everybody else: Ask the \njudge for a warrant. Judges routinely do not turn down warrants. It \nworked for us for 225 years, until the PATRIOT Act, when we had a \nprocess, the fourth amendment, protecting us from an overzealous \ngovernment. But it also worked to catch criminals.\n\n  At this time I yield the floor temporarily to my good friend from \nUtah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nKentucky for standing up for the fourth amendment principles he has \narticulated today.\n  This is an important issue to all Americans. Americans are at once \nconcerned about our national security. They want to make sure we can \nidentify and apprehend those people who would harm us. At the same \ntime, Americans are firmly committed to the idea of constitutionally \nlimited government--the concept that regardless of how passionately we \nmight feel about the need for certain government intervention, we can't \never allow government to be operated completely unfettered. We have \nliberty in place whenever government is controlled by the people, and \nwhenever there are certain things that are beyond the reach of the \ngovernment.\n  Senator Paul has helped identify some key areas of concern that have \nbeen implicated by the PATRIOT Act. He has suggested that we ought to \nat a minimum have a robust debate and discussion over some amendments \nthat might be proposed to the PATRIOT Act before we proceed. Three \nmonths ago we had a discussion, we had a vote, and there were a few of \nus who voted against the PATRIOT Act--not because we don't love \nAmerica, we do. We want to protect America. We voted against it because \nwe love America, because we believe in a constitutionally limited \ngovernment, because we want to make it better. We want to make this \nsomething that can at the same time protect Americans but without \nneedlessly trampling on privacy interests, including many of those \nprivacy interests protected by the fourth amendment.\n  Bad things happen when we adopt a law without adequately discussing \nits merits. Years ago, when the PATRIOT Act was adopted, there were a \nnumber of people who raised some of these privacy concerns. For that \nand other reasons, Congress made the decision way back then--almost 10 \nyears ago--to adopt the PATRIOT Act and adopt certain provisions of it \nsubject to some sunsetting provisions so that Congress would \nperiodically be required to debate and discuss these provisions. It \ndoes us no good if every time it comes up we are told we have to vote \nfor it or against it; we can't really debate and discuss it or consider \namendments to it.\n  We were told 3 months ago that at the end of May--and we are now \nhere--we would have an opportunity to debate, discuss, and consider \namendments. That opportunity has now been taken away from us and with \nit the chance to address many of these important privacy implications, \nmany of which do implicate the fourth amendment in one way or another.\n  Senator Paul has referred to some of them, including some of the \nimplications of the national security letters\n\n[[Page S3315]]\n\nwhich, while not directly implicated by the expiring provisions at \nissue right now, are inextricably intertwined with other issues that \nare in front of us, including those related to section 215 orders and \nincluding the roving wiretap issue that is up for reauthorization.\n  So I speak in support of the idea of robust debate and discussion, \nespecially where, as here, it relates to something that is so important \nto the American concept of limited government and so closely related to \nour fourth amendment interests. We ought to have robust debate, \ndiscussion, and an opportunity for amendment.\n  I thank Senator Paul for his leadership in this regard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. When we look at this debate and we talk about exactly where \nwe should go from here and why it is important, it is important to look \nat the PATRIOT Act and say to ourselves: How do we protect our \nConstitution if we are not willing to protect all parts of it? So many \nconservatives are avid for the second amendment. I am one of them. I \nwant to protect the second amendment. But I tell those who want to \nprotect the second amendment that they can't protect the second \namendment if they don't believe in the first amendment. If they don't \nbelieve in the first amendment, they can't have that voice that it will \ntake. If they want to place limitations on groups that advocate gun \nownership under the second amendment, that will limit the second \namendment. But, likewise, they cannot protect the second amendment if \nthey don't believe in the fourth amendment.\n  There is no reason we should allow a government to look at our gun \nrecords and to troll through all of them. If a government thinks \nsomeone is a terrorist, name that person, name the place, and show \nprobable cause. Do we want to allow government to troll through our \nrecords? The government has looked at 28 million electronic records--28 \nmillion. They are just sifting through all of our records looking for \nwhat. I want them to catch terrorists, but I want them to look at the \nConstitution with some restraint to say this person is a terrorist or \nwe suspect him to be so, for this reason. We need not be so frightened \nthat we give up our liberty in exchange for security.\n  Some would say our government is full of good people who would say: I \nhave not done anything wrong, and I don't have to worry about it. We \nare not worried about good government; we are worried about bad \ngovernment. Jefferson said once upon a time if all men were angels, we \nwould have no concern for constitutional restraint. But there have been \ntimes in our history and in the history of other countries where \nunsavory characters, where despotic characters have won election.\n  When Hitler was first elected in the 1920s and early 1930s, he was \nelected popularly. The thing is, they were so mad and upset over World \nWar I that they basically traded. They said: We want a strong leader. \nGive us a strong leader. But if we have rules that allow that strong \nleader to grab and do things, that is the real danger. At a minimum \nnow, the danger is--it is a great danger to us if we allow this to go \non if we get a despotic government at some point in time.\n  We are not worried about good people in government. We are worried \nabout people who might be elected who would abuse these powers. It has \nhappened. Look at what happened during certain administrations where \npeople looked at IRS records of enemies. Look at what is happening now \nwhere the executive branch is looking at donor records for those who do \nbusiness with government. If you are a contractor and you do business \nwith government, they want to know who you donate to.\n  There are dangers to allowing the government to snoop through our \nrecords. It doesn't mean we don't want to stop crime, we don't want to \nstop terrorism. It means we need to have a rule of law, and we need to \npay attention to the rule of law.\n  We proposed several amendments. One of them went through the \nJudiciary Committee. It was deliberated. It was amended. It was passed \nwith bipartisan support, but we won't get a vote on it. It disappoints \nme that they are afraid to debate this on the Senate floor, and we will \nget no vote on amendments that were offered seriously to try to reform \nthe PATRIOT Act to take away some of the abuses of it.\n  We offered three amendments to the PATRIOT Act. One was on the gun \nrecords. That apparently unhinged people who are afraid of voting on \nany gun issues. Because of that, we are all going to be denied any \ndebate or votes.\n  Some will say: Oh, you are going to keep your colleagues here until 1 \nin the morning. Well, I think when they are here tonight at 1 in the \nmorning, maybe they will think a little bit about why they are here and \nwhy we had no debate and why we had the power to have the debate at any \npoint in time. I have agreed and said we can have a vote on the PATRIOT \nAct in an hour or 2 hours. We could have had a vote on the PATRIOT Act \nyesterday. But I want debate, and I want amendments. I think that is \nthe very least the American people demand and this body demands, that \nthere be open and deliberate debate about the PATRIOT Act.\n  One of our other amendments has to do with destroying records. Some \nof these records they take from us through the bank spying on us, or \nthe government spying on us, are not destroyed. I think these records \nshould be destroyed at some point in time.\n  For goodness' sakes, if you are not a terrorist, why are they keeping \nthese records? There ought to be rules on the destruction of these \nrecords if you are not a terrorist and they are not going to prosecute \nyou.\n  The fourth amendment says we should name the place and the person. We \nhave one wiretap called the John Doe. They don't name the place or the \nperson, and they are not required to. I think we should. Now, are there \ntimes when it might be a terrorist when we say, well, we don't want to \nname the person? We don't have to name them in public. We could name \nthem to the FISA commission. I do not object to them being named and \nthe name being redacted, but the name should be presented to the judge \nwho is making the decision. I want a judge to make a decision.\n  James Otis--part of our revolution--for the 20 years leading up to \nthe American Revolution, there was a debate about warrants. They issued \nwhat were called writs of assistance. They are also called general \nwarrants. They weren't specific. They didn't say what crime one was \nbeing accused of, and the soldiers came into our houses. They would \nlodge soldiers in our houses, and they would enter into our houses \nwithout warrants. The fourth amendment was a big deal. We had passed \nthe fourth amendment, and it was one of the primary grievances of our \nFounding Fathers.\n  I don't think we should give up so easily. I don't think we should be \ncowed by fear and so fearful of attack that we give up our liberties. \nIf we do, we become no different than the rest of the countries that \nhave no liberties. Our liberties are what make us different from other \ncountries. The fact that we protect the rights, even of those accused \nof a crime--people say, well, gosh, a murderer will get a trial. Yes, \nthey will get a trial because we don't know they are a murderer until \nwe convict them. We want procedural restraints.\n  People say: You would give procedural restraints for terrorists? I \nwould say at the very least, a judge has to give permission before we \nget records. The main reason is because we are not asking for 10 \nrecords or 20 records or 40 records of people connected to terrorism. \nWe are asking for millions of records.\n  There are people in this room today who have had their records looked \nat. It is difficult to find out because what happens--here is the real \nrub, and this is how fearful they were. When the PATRIOT Act was passed \nshortly after 9/11, they were so fearful that they said: If a letter, a \ndemand letter, a national security letter asks for records, you are not \nallowed to tell your attorney. You were gagged. If you told your \nattorney, they could put you in jail for 5 years. It is still a crime \npunishable by 5 years in jail.\n  If I have Internet service and they want my records on somebody, they \ndon't tell me or a judge. We have no idea. There is no probable cause. \nThis person might be relevant, which could mean anything, however \ntangential. If I don't reveal those records, I go to jail. If I tell my \nwife they are asking for my records, I could go to jail.\n\n[[Page S3316]]\n\n  This secrecy on millions of records, this trolling through millions \nof records is un-American. It is unconstitutional. They have modified \nthe Constitution through statutory law. We have given up our rights. It \nshould be two-thirds of this body voting to change the Constitution and \nthree-fourths of the States. We did it by 50 percent with one bill. The \nbill was hot when it came here. There was one copy of it. No one read \nit.\n  I came from the tea party, and I said: We must read the bills. I \npropose that we wait 1 day for every 20 pages so we are ensured they \nare reading the bills. The PATRIOT Act was hundreds of pages long and \nnobody read it. Not one person read it because it wasn't even hardly \nprinted. There were penciled edits in the margin, and it was passed \nbecause we were afraid.\n  But we can't be so afraid that we give up our liberties. I think it \nis more important than that. I think it is a sad day today in America \nthat we are afraid to debate this. The great constitutional questions \nsuch as this, or great constitutional questions such as whether we can \ngo to war with just the word of the President, these great \nconstitutional questions are not being debated because we are so \nfearful of debate.\n  I urge the Senate to reconsider. I urge the Senate to consider \ndebating the PATRIOT Act, to consider amendments, and to consider the \nConstitution.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/25/senate-section/article/S3316-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley).

Mr. President, the budget circumstance we confront as a \nnation is clear. We are on a completely unsustainable course. The \noccupant of the chair knows this well as a very valued member of the \nBudget Committee. We are currently borrowing 40 cents of every dollar \nwe spend. That, obviously, cannot continue.\n  The other side has criticized those of us on our side for not going \nto a budget markup. The reason we have not is this is not a typical \nyear in which the Republicans put up a budget resolution in the body \nthey control and we put up a budget resolution and we go to conference \ncommittee to work out the differences. Something very different is \noccurring this year. There is a leadership negotiation with the highest \nleaders of the Republican Party in the House and the Senate, the \nhighest leaders of the Democratic Party in the House and the Senate, \nmeeting with the Vice President of the United States, on a plan to put \nin place a 10-year effort or perhaps a 5-year plan to deal with the \ndeficits and debt.\n  In fact, the Republican leader has made this observation:\n\n       [T]he discussions that can lead to a result between now and \n     August are the talks being led by Vice President Biden. . . . \n     That's a process that could lead to a result, a measurable \n     result, in the short term. And in that meeting is the only \n     Democrat who can sign a bill into law; in fact, the only \n     American out of 307 million of us who can sign a bill into \n     law. He is in those discussions. That will lead to a result.\n\n  It makes no sense for us to go to a budget markup at this moment that \nwould simply be a partisan markup when bipartisan efforts are underway.\n  Last year, for 8 months, I participated in the President's fiscal \ncommission--10 Democrats, 8 Republicans. At the end of that emerged the \nonly bipartisan plan that has come from anywhere so far. Five Democrats \nsupported it; five Republicans supported it; one Independent. Mr. \nPresident, 11 of the 18 commissioners voted for that plan to get our \ndeficits and debt under control. We have underway this new effort, a \nleadership effort, with the President represented at the table. We \nought to give that a chance before we pass a budget resolution that may \nbe required to implement any plan they can come up with.\n  The hard reality of what we confront is simply this: This chart shows \nthe spending and revenues of the United States going back to 1950--more \nthan 60 years of the revenue and expenditure history of the United \nStates. The red line is the spending line. The green line is the \nrevenue line. What jumps out at you is that spending as a share of our \nnational income is the highest it has been in 60 years. On the other \nhand, revenue is the lowest it has been in 60 years as a share of \nnational income. So that is the reason we have record deficits.\n  I hear all the time the other side of the aisle: It is a spending \nproblem. When you have a deficit, that is the result of the difference \nbetween revenue and spending. We have a spending problem, yes, indeed--\nthe highest spending as a share of national income in 60 years. We also \nhave a revenue problem--the lowest revenue we have had as a share of \nnational income in 60 years.\n  So now the House has sent us a plan, the Republican budget plan, and \nthe first thing they do is cut the revenue some more. Revenue is the \nlowest it has been in 60 years, and the first thing they do to address \nthe deficit is to cut the revenue some more. In fact, they cut, over \nthe next 10 years, more than $4 trillion in revenue. For those who are \nthe wealthiest among us, they give them an additional $1 trillion in \ntax reductions. By extending the top rate cuts, by extending a $5 \nmillion estate tax exemption, by cutting the top rate down to 25 \npercent from the 35 percent it is today, they are giving massive new \ntax cuts to the wealthiest among us.\n  Their average revenue during the 10 years of their plan is 18.3 \npercent. You can see from this chart, the last five times the budget \nhas been balanced, revenues have been around 20 percent: 19.7 percent, \n19.9 percent, 19.8 percent, 20.6 percent, and 19.5 percent. The revenue \nplan they have would have never balanced the budget in the last 30 \nyears.\n  If we look at what has happened on the revenue side of the equation, \nhere is what has happened to the effective tax rate for the 400 \nwealthiest taxpayers in the United States. Since 1995, when the \neffective tax rate on the wealthiest 400 was about 30 percent, that \neffective rate declined to 16.6 percent in 2007.\n  Warren Buffett has said that his executive assistant pays a higher \ntax rate than he does. Well, how can that be? The reason that happens \nis because Mr. Buffett has most of his income from dividends and \ncapital gains, taxed at a rate of 15 percent. His executive assistant \nis probably taxed at a rate somewhere in the 20, 25-percent range.\n  We have a circumstance in which we have the lowest revenue in 60 \nyears, and the House Republicans have sent us a budget that says: Let's \ncut it some more. Let's cut it another $4 trillion, and let's give $1 \ntrillion of that to the wealthiest among us.\n  If you look at what our friends are proposing, when we have the \nlargest deficits since World War II, they are proposing to give those \nwho earn over $1 million a year a tax cut, on average, in 2013, of \nalmost $200,000. For those earning over $10 million, they would give \nthem, on average, a tax cut of $1,450,000--this at a time when we have \nrecord deficits. What sense does this make? It makes no sense.\n  What are they doing to offset these massive new tax cuts for the \nwealthiest among us? They have decided the answer is to shred the \nsocial safety net that has been created in this country over the last \n60 years. They have decided to shred Medicare--shred it. They have \ndecided to shred program after program so they can give more tax cuts \nto those who are the wealthiest among us.\n  Here is what a top former President Reagan adviser said when he \nlooked at the House budget proposal. Remember, this is not a Democrat. \nThis is a top former Reagan economic adviser. This is what he said. His \nname is Bruce Bartlett. He said in his blog about the proposal from the \nHouse Republicans on the budget:\n\n       Distributionally, the Ryan plan is a monstrosity. The rich \n     would receive huge tax cuts while the social safety net would \n     be shredded to pay for them. Even as an opening bid to begin \n     budget negotiations with the Democrats, the Ryan plan cannot \n     be taken seriously. It is less of a wish list than a fairy \n     tale utterly disconnected from the real world, backed up by \n     make-believe numbers and unreasonable assumptions. Ryan's \n     plan isn't even an act of courage; it's just pandering to the \n     Tea Party. A real act of courage would have been for him to \n     admit, as all\n\n[[Page S3317]]\n\n     serious budget analysts know, that revenues will have to rise \n     well above 19 percent of GDP to stabilize the debt.\n\n  Let's go back to that chart that makes the point that Mr. Bartlett is \nmaking: that the five times the budget has been balanced around here in \nthe last 30 years, the last 40 years--1969, 1998, 1999, 2000, and \n2001--by the way, those last four all during the Clinton \nadministration--you can see what the revenue has been: nearly 20 \npercent of GDP in every one of those years. Revenue today is 14.5 \npercent of GDP. It is no wonder we have a problem with deficits. You \ncombine the high spending we have now with the low revenue, and you \nhave record deficits.\n  Our friends on the other side have decided the first thing you do \nwhen you have record deficits and the lowest revenue in 60 years is to \ngo out and give more tax breaks to the wealthiest among us.\n  Here, as shown on this chart, is what they do to health care in the \nUnited States. No. 1, end Medicare as we know it. Replace it with a \nvoucher system. They would reopen the prescription drug doughnut hole \nthat means seniors have to pay more of their prescription drug costs. \nThey would block grant Medicaid that ends the countercyclical nature of \nthe program. They would defund health reform, increasing the number of \nuninsured by 34 million people. Mr. President, 34 million more \nAmericans would not have health insurance if the plan that is before us \nwould pass.\n  When I say they are ending Medicare as we know it, here is why I say \nthat. Right now, in traditional Medicare, the individual pays about 25 \npercent of the cost. The rest is paid by Medicare. But look what the \nHouse Republican plan would do. It would dramatically increase the \nhealth care spending by seniors. Instead of paying 25 percent of the \nbill, seniors would be expected to pay 68 percent of their health care \ncosts.\n  That is what the Republican plan is about: very generous additional \ntax breaks to the wealthiest among us. For those earning more than $10 \nmillion a year, they would give, on average, a $1,450,000 tax \nreduction. To make up for it, they would say to seniors: Instead of \npaying 25 percent of your health care costs under Medicare, you pay 68 \npercent. What would that mean in dollar terms? Seniors would go from \npaying $6,150 a year to $12,500 a year.\n  That is the Republican plan that is before us. That is the budget \nplan we are going to vote on later this evening. Anybody who cannot see \nthat is a shredding of Medicare, that is a shredding of the social \nsafety net, just is not looking very closely.\n  The former Republican Speaker called the House Republican Medicare \nproposal ``right-wing social engineering.'' Those are not my words. \nThose are his words. Here is the interview. On ``Meet The Press,'' on \nMay 15, Mr. Gregory, the host, asked this:\n\n       Do you think that Republicans ought to buck the public \n     opposition and really move forward to completely change \n     Medicare, turn it into a voucher program . . . ?\n\n  Mr. Gingrich's answer:\n\n       I don't think right-wing social engineering is any more \n     desirable than left-wing social engineering. I don't think \n     imposing radical change from the right or the left is a very \n     good way for a free society to operate.\n\n  This budget that is before us is not just radical with respect to \nwhat it does to Medicare, what it does to the revenue of the United \nStates. You look at every part of this budget, there are no savings in \ndefense after we have had this massive defense buildup. From 1997 to \n2011, you can see spending on defense has gone from $254 billion a year \nto $688 billion a year. Even the House Budget Committee chairman, Mr. \nRyan, who is the architect of this plan, has said:\n\n       There are a lot of savings you can get in defense. There's \n     a lot of waste over there, for sure.\n\n  That is what he said about defense spending. Here is what he did \nabout it. He increases it dramatically, from $529 billion--this is just \nthe underlying defense budget; this does not count the war funding--he \nincreases the regular defense budget from $529 billion, in 2011, to \n$667 billion by 2021.\n  He did not cut one thin dime. After saying there is lots of waste \nthere, lots of places for savings, after the Secretary of Defense \nhimself has said they have to restrain spending, after the Secretary of \nDefense himself has proposed $178 billion of savings, the budget before \nus does not save one dime out of defense. Instead, it increases it \ndramatically from $529 billion to $667 billion, and that does not count \nwar funding. War funding would be on top of it.\n  This budget before us, the Republican budget from the House, also \ntakes some of the fundamentals of making our country strong and cuts \nthem dramatically.\n  Education is No. 1. I was raised by my grandparents. My grandmother \nwas a schoolteacher. She used to say: In our household, No. 1 is \neducation, No. 2 is education, and No. 3 is education. We got the \nmessage.\n  Let me read what two of the country's foremost economists have said \nabout the importance of education to the U.S. economy: an educated \npopulation is a key source of economic growth. Broad access to \neducation was, by and large, a major factor in the U.S. economic \ndominance in the 20th century and in the creation of a broad middle \nclass. Indeed, the American dream of upward mobility, both within and \nacross generations, has been tied to access to education.\n  What does the budget that has come over from the Republican house do? \nIt cuts education 15 percent, from $91 billion to $77 billion, from \n2011 to 2012. Education, obviously, is not the only important pillar to \nour economy. Another important pillar is the infrastructure of the \ncountry; our roads, bridges, highways, airports. These are the things \nthat support a vibrant and strong U.S. economy.\n  Here is the engineers' report card on America's infrastructure. \nAviation, a D; bridges, a C; rail, a C-minus; roads, D-minus; transit, \na D; the infrastructure grade point average, a D.\n  What do our colleagues propose in the budget that is before us? They \npropose cutting it 30 percent. Can you imagine what it is going to be \nlike to try to get around this country if you go out and cut \ntransportation 30 percent? Anybody who has driven on any of the roads \nacross America, certainly the roads in any of the major cities, anybody \nwho has gone through any of the airports, anybody who has gone on a \nrail system in this country, you think we are going to be better off if \nwe cut the funding 30 percent? That is exactly what the Republican \nbudget that is before us proposes.\n  We also know one of the near-term threats to the economy is what is \nhappening to the price of gasoline. Since December of 2008, gasoline \nhas gone from $1.81 a gallon to $3.85 on May 23--up $2 a gallon.\n  Every economist has said this is hurting the economic recovery in \nthis country. What do our colleagues in the House send us as a budget \nfor energy, things that can be done to reduce our dependance on foreign \nenergy? They cut it 57 percent--57 percent cut in the strategies \ndesigned to reduce our dependance on foreign energy--cut it 57 percent.\n  It does not add up. It does not make sense. It is not in the \nmainstream of thinking. This is a budget that if we poll the \nconstituent elements, the American people, they reject it out of hand. \nThey do not believe Medicare should be shredded. They do not believe \nthat those who are the most fortunate among us ought to be given more \ntax reductions at this time.\n  With record deficits and a debt growing out of control, the first to \nbe done is not to say to those earning over $1 million a year: You get \na $200,000 tax cut; to those earning over $10 million a year: You get a \ntax reduction of $1,450,000 and then to turn around and slash much of \nwhat helps middle-class families in this country, whether it is \neducation or infrastructure or transportation. That is the budget that \nis before us from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  We have other budget plans, the Paul budget plan, the Toomey budget \nplan. I will comment on those later. But I very much hope colleagues \nare listening, that they pay close attention to this debate, that they \nhave a chance to evaluate what should be the position of this Chamber \nwhen we vote later this evening.\n  I believe this is a defining vote for this Chamber. Are we going to \napprove a budget that is truly radical in its scope and dimension, that \nfundamentally ends Medicare as we know it, and at the same time gives \nmassive new tax cuts to the wealthiest among us? At a time when we are \nhaving the lowest revenue in 60 years, that cutting the\n\n[[Page S3318]]\n\nrevenue of the United States by over $1 trillion to give additional tax \nreductions to those who have already enjoyed dramatic tax reductions--I \npointed out early in my presentation, the effective tax rate on those \nwho are the wealthiest among us has declined dramatically during the \nrecent years.\n  This proposal from the House of Representatives says: We will do even \nmore to reduce the tax load on those who are the wealthiest among us. I \ndo not think it adds up. Let me say to those who think: Well, at least \nthe Ryan budget--the Republican budget--will reduce our deficits and \nget our debt back on track, we will solve that problem. Let me leave \nyou with one number. The Republican budget from the House of \nRepresentatives that we will vote on later today increases the gross \ndebt of the United States by $8 trillion.\n  So anybody who thinks that shredding Medicare and giving these giant \ntax breaks to the wealthiest among us is going to solve the problem, \nthat it is going to stop the explosion of debt is wrong. In the budget \nbefore us, the Republican budget from the House of Representatives, the \ngross debt of the United States in the next 10 years is increased by $8 \ntrillion.\n  For those who think the debt is already too high, you want to vote \nfor a plan that is going to increase the debt, the gross debt of the \nUnited States another $8 trillion? That is the Republican plan from the \nHouse of Representatives. That is the budget that is before us. That is \nthe budget we are going to vote on later this evening.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks, Senator Merkley be \nrecognized for up to 5 minutes and then Senator Sanders be recognized \nfor up to 5 minutes as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. The American middle class is hurting. Workers are \nunemployed. Families are losing their homes. Parents are worried, for \ngood reason, that their children will not have the same opportunity \nthey had.\n  American people have sent us to do a simple agenda of creating jobs. \nThey want a plan that will put our economy back on track and build a \nfoundation for our working families to succeed.\n  The Republicans have produced a plan, a plan that is in consideration \nbefore us today. But is it a plan that responds to the pleas of the \nAmerican people to create jobs and to help those Americans who are out \nof work and to put this economy back on track? The short answer is, \nunfortunately, it is not.\n  Perhaps it is a plan to invest in education. But then we look at the \ndetails and realize it savages the investment in education. Here we are \nas the first generation of American adults whose children are getting \nless education than we got, primarily because the cost of tuition is \noutpacing the average wages that working families earn. That is \nunacceptable.\n  Perhaps the Republican budget decides to invest in infrastructure. I \njust came back from China with the majority leader and a delegation of \n10 Senators and here is what we learned. China is investing 10 to 12 \npercent of its GDP in infrastructure. Europe is investing 5 percent. \nAmerica is investing 2 percent. We are barely able to repair the \ninfrastructure we have let alone add additional infrastructure for our \neconomy to thrive in the future. But the Republican plan does not \ninvest in infrastructure.\n  Perhaps it invests in energy, recognizing that we are sending $1 \nbillion a day overseas, that oil and our addiction to oil is half of \nour trade deficit, that both for national security and for strength of \nour economy and for a sustainable environment, we need to change this.\n  But, no, the Republican budget sustains our addiction to oil and \nwithdraws our investment in American--red, white, and blue American-\nmade energy.\n  Perhaps the Republican budget has paid attention to our Secretary of \nDefense who has listed $175 billion in programs that are not enhancing \nour national security and therefore should be cut. But, no, the \nRepublican budget paid no attention to that, and, in fact, increased \nand overrode the vision laid out by the Secretary of Defense.\n  So at a time when our middle class is struggling to get back to their \nfeet, the Republicans did not address education or infrastructure or \nenergy or defense but instead chose to do two things: end Medicare as \nwe know it and give bonus breaks to the best off in our society--take \naway from seniors across America and give to those who earn more than \n$1 million a year and a whole lot more to those who earn more than $10 \nmillion a year.\n  That is the Republican plan. In the Medicare side, there are two \ncomponents. The first is to reopen the doughnut hole. That is the hole \ninto which seniors fall when, after they have some assistance with the \nfirst drugs they need, they get no assistance until they reach a \ncatastrophic level. It is in that hole that seniors have been \ndevastated--had their finances devastated. We fixed it. Republicans \nwant to unfix it and throw seniors back into the abyss.\n  Then, instead of guaranteeing Medicare coverage for a fixed set of \nbenefits for every senior--as Medicare does now--the Republican plan \ngives seniors a coupon and says: Good luck. Go buy your insurance. If \nthe insurance goes up, too bad.\n  In fact, seniors would pay $6,359 more a year. In my working-class \ncommunity, that is real money. That is money senior families do not \nhave. That is money families do not have because they are wrestling \njust to pay their basic expenses through Social Security.\n  It is not the folks with golden parachutes who have multimillion \ndollar endowments from their previous work at the top of the economic \npyramid. Most do not realize that $6,000 will devastate the family \nbudgets of our seniors across this country.\n  Indeed, under the Republican plan, whereas seniors contribute 25 \npercent of their health care costs today, they would, by 2030, pay 68 \npercent, more than two-thirds--more than two-thirds. That is \ndevastating.\n  Indeed, this voucher plan from our colleagues across the aisle puts \nan insurance company bureaucrat in the middle of our medical decisions, \ntelling seniors what they get to have and what they do not get to have. \nThe bottom line is that if something is good for your health, the \ninsurance company does not want to pay for it, does not want to put it \nin the policy, that is too bad.\n  One of Oregon's larger insurers is planning a 24-percent increase in \nthe cost of health care next year--premiums up by 24 percent. Seniors' \ncoupons, under the Republican plan, are perhaps 2 percent. So that does \nnot work.\n  Colleagues, our citizens have sent us to create jobs, not to destroy \nthe lives of our seniors and hand the funds over to the best off in our \nsociety. Let's come back to planet Earth, recognize we are here to \nfight for an economy that raises working families and let's defeat this \nbudget tonight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \n2 minutes, and I thank my friend from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Conrad). Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me begin by saying that I get a \nlittle bit tired of being lectured to about deficit reduction and how \nsignificant a problem our deficit is by many folks who voted for \nlegislation time after time over the last 10 years that, in fact, has \ncaused the deficit crisis we are in right now.\n  Some of us voted against the war in Iraq, which will end up costing \n$2 trillion to $3 trillion, unpaid for. Some of us voted against the \nWall Street bailout. Some of us voted against tax breaks for \nmillionaires and billionaires. Some of us voted against the Medicare \nPart D prescription drug program written by the insurance companies. \nThose four programs have resulted in trillions of dollars in debt. To \nthose people who voted for that, please don't lecture us about the \ndeficit crisis. We didn't help to cause it.\n  The debate over deficit reduction comes at a very unusual moment in \nAmerican economic history. While the middle class is in rapid decline, \nwhile\n\n[[Page S3319]]\n\nreal median family income is going down, while wages for millions of \nworkers are going down, while poverty is increasing, we also are at a \nmoment when the wealthiest people in this country have never had it so \ngood. Over a recent 25-year period, 80 percent of all new income went \nto the top 1 percent.\n  Today, as a nation with the most unequal distribution of wealth and \nincome of any major country, we have the 400 wealthiest people in \nAmerica--just 400 people--owning more wealth than the bottom 125 \nmillion. When we deal with deficit reduction, we have to take into \nconsideration the decline of the middle class, the increase in poverty, \nand the growing disparity in income and wealth between the people on \ntop and everybody else.\n  Given the reality of record-breaking corporate profits and the \nincreasing wealth of the people on top, it should surprise no one that \npoll after poll shows that the overwhelming majority of Americans want \nour deficit crisis to be addressed through shared sacrifice--not just \ncoming down heavily on working families and the middle class, the \nchildren, the sick, and the elderly. The American people, in poll after \npoll, have said they want everybody to contribute and help toward \ndeficit reduction, not just the most vulnerable people in this society.\n  Unfortunately, the House-passed budget moves us in exactly the wrong \ndirection. It would end Medicare as we know it by giving senior \ncitizens inadequate vouchers to buy health insurance from private \ncompanies. Seniors would, on average, see their out-of-pocket expenses \ndouble by about $6,000 a year. Seniors at the age of 65 would be given \nan $8,000 voucher to go to a private insurance company.\n  Now, you tell me--if you are 65 and you are suffering with cancer or \nanother illness--what an $8,000 plan will do for you. It would be a \ndisaster.\n  Furthermore, the Republican plan would cut, over 10 years, $770 \nbillion from Medicaid, vastly increasing the number of uninsured and \nthreatening the long-term care of the elderly who live in nursing \nhomes.\n  The Republican budget would also make savage cuts in education, \nnutrition, affordable housing, infrastructure, environmental \nprotection, and virtually every program on which low- and moderate-\nincome Americans depend. With all of the focus on spending cuts, \nhowever, the Republican budget does nothing to reduce unnecessary \nmilitary spending at a time when our military budget is triple what it \nwas in 1997.\n  What people in Vermont tell me is what people in Oregon are telling \nthe Presiding Officer--that the time is now to begin accelerating our \ntroops out of Afghanistan. It is the right thing to do public policy-\nwise, and it is certainly the right thing to do for our budget.\n  Here is the kicker of this whole thing: The House Republican budget \ndoes not ask the wealthiest people in this country, whose tax rates are \nnow the lowest on record, to contribute one dime more for deficit \nreduction--not one dime more. Yet we can voucherize Medicare, slash \nMedicaid, education, infrastructure, and environmental protection, but \nto ask the wealthiest people in this country to pay one penny more in \ntaxes after they receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks, \nmy goodness, we can't do that.\n  I have another issue--and not just with the Republicans. It has to \ndo, frankly, with the Democrats and with President Obama. Will the \nPresident demand that any deficit reduction agreement end the Bush-era \ntax breaks for the wealthy? Will he stand up and be tall and fight for \nthat important principle? Will the President fight to eliminate \ncorporate tax loopholes? Will he end the absurd policies that allow the \nwealthy and large corporations to avoid taxes by establishing phony \naddresses in offshore tax havens? We are losing about $100 billion a \nyear from the corporations and the wealthy who stash their money in the \nCayman Islands and Bermuda.\n  My hope is--and I think the American people are hoping--that the \nPresident will stand firm in fighting to end those absurd loopholes. As \na Vermont Senator and a member of the Budget Committee, I will not \nsupport a plan to reduce the deficit that does not call for shared \nsacrifice. At least 50 percent of any deficit reduction plan must come \nfrom increased revenue from the wealthy and large corporations. We must \nhave the top 2 percent of income earners, who currently pay the lowest \nupper income tax rates on record, start paying their fair share. \nInstead of making it harder for working families to send their kids to \ncollege, we must end the foreign tax shelters that enable the wealthy \nand large corporations to avoid U.S. taxes.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Republicans \nhave 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am going to use my leader time, and I ask \nunanimous consent that time not take anything away from the debate on \nthe budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the national security of the United States \nis at stake, and the junior Senator from Kentucky is complaining that \nhe has not been able to offer amendments.\n  Let me take a moment to set the record straight. As all of us and the \nSenator from Kentucky are well aware, we have worked long and hard in \ngood faith to get an agreement to consider amendments. In fact, I \noffered him a solution that is more than fair. I proposed a consent \nagreement that would have brought before the Senate six amendments, \nmore than half of which--specifically four--were written by the Senator \nfrom Kentucky.\n  Unfortunately, in order to continue his political grandstanding, he \nrejected that offer.\n  It is unfortunate because the inability to reach an agreement has \nserious consequences. At midnight tomorrow, the PATRIOT Act will \nexpire. Unless the Senator from Kentucky stops standing in the way, our \nlaw enforcement will no longer be able to use some of the most critical \ntools it needs to counter terrorists and combat terrorism.\n  If they cannot use these tools--tools that identify and track \nterrorist suspects--it could have dire consequences for our national \nsecurity.\n  When the clock strikes midnight tomorrow, we would be giving \nterrorists the opportunity to plot attacks against our country, \nundetected. In the last several years, the government has stopped \ndozens of would-be terrorists before they could strike. Now the Senator \nfrom Kentucky is threatening to take away the best tools we have for \nstopping them.\n  Does this mean the PATRIOT Act is perfect? Of course not. Today, the \nRepublican leader and I received a letter from James Clapper, a three-\nstar retired general from the U.S. military, the Nation's Director of \nNational Intelligence. He knows better than any of us the real effects \nof letting terrorist-fighting tools expire. In his letter, he wrote \nabout our ability to conduct surveillance on foreign radicals, to track \npurchases of bombmaking materials, and other classified programs. All \nof these would expire with the PATRIOT Act, if we let it.\n  This is a particularly bad time to shut down electronic surveillance \nactivities. As has been widely reported in the press, we recovered \nthousands of documents, photos, videos and other materials from Osama \nbin Laden's compound. This material has opened dozens of investigations \nand leads to new terrorist suspects and terrorist activities directed \ntoward the United States of America. It continues to yield more and \nmore information every day.\n  If the Senator from Kentucky refuses to relent, the government will \nbe unable to fully pursue these leads. That would increase the risk of \na retaliatory terrorist strike against the homeland and hamper our \nability to deal a truly fatal blow to al-Qaida.\n  I repeat, Director Clapper, a retired three-star general, asked us \nnot to allow a moment's interruption in the intelligence community's \nability to protect the American people.\n  Some may be asking: Then why is the Senator from Kentucky holding \nout? What is keeping him from accepting an agreement to move forward--\none that I think is more than fair to him and the Senate? We could have \na couple of strong Democratic amendments and his amendment--four in\n\n[[Page S3320]]\n\nnumber. The reason is, he is fighting for an amendment to protect the \nright of terrorists, not of average citizens, to cover up their gun \npurchases. It is all dealing with a gun amendment.\n  We all remember the tragic Fort Hood shooting less than 2 years ago. \nA radicalized American terrorist bought guns from a Texas gun store and \nused them to kill 13 innocent soldiers and civilians. It is hard to \nimagine why the Senator from Kentucky would want to hold up the PATRIOT \nAct for a misguided amendment that would make America far less safe.\n  The Senator from Kentucky also complains that the Senate has not had \na week of debate. We all would like to have more debate on this issue. \nThe Presiding Officer would. We would like to have a lot of debate on \nother things. The Presiding Officer is one of the Senators who led an \neffort earlier in this session to make sure we have more robust debate. \nWe made a little progress but not enough.\n  The Senator from Kentucky, who is complaining that we haven't had a \nweek of debate, better come up with something a little better. Here is \nwhy. This matter has been before the Senate for 1 week now. I moved to \nproceed to the PATRIOT Act last Thursday. Today is Wednesday. As of \ntoday the Senate has been working toward passing this measure for 6 or \n7 days. There is no question that Senators have had the opportunity to \ndebate. The only question has been how Senators have chosen to use \nthese last 6 days.\n  The bottom line is that no matter how long it takes to get there, we \nare going to have this vote, and the vote will win. We will pass the \nPATRIOT Act and do everything we can to keep the American people safe. \nIt is up to the Senator from Kentucky whether those national security \nprograms will expire before we get a chance to vote. That expiration \ndate is important. If he thinks it is going to be a badge of courage on \nhis side to have held this up for a few hours, he has made a mistake. \nIt will set this program back significantly, and that is too bad. The \nclock is ticking, and the ball is in his court.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate the difficulties the \nmajority leader has and would agree substantively that the PATRIOT Act \ndoes need to be passed. It doesn't need to have any gap in it. As a \nformer Federal prosecutor for 15 years, I agree that the Paul amendment \nto make our terrorist investigators go further and have more difficulty \nin obtaining gun records than the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and \nFirearms investigators for far more minor crimes is a bad policy. I see \nwhere he is coming from, but I don't agree with that.\n  I would say that Senator Paul is a courageous, strong, new Member of \nthe Senate. He has some deep beliefs. He is entitled to advocate for \nthose. I believe he has tried to do that in good faith. He thought he \nhad an agreement to be able to offer his amendment, and the majority \nleader suggested he could offer amendments, but only the ones he \napproved, and he won't approve the one on guns.\n  I think that is not healthy, in the defense of Senator Paul, that he \nwould not have an opportunity to offer the amendment he wants to offer, \nnot the one that is approved in advance by the majority leader. I \nthink, to the extent that happens, it diminishes the great robust \ntradition of debate in the Senate. It is a difficult matter. I know \npeople feel strongly about it. I wanted to share those thoughts.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  My good friend Senator Conrad, who chairs the Budget Committee, made \nhis speech. I was disappointed in some of it. He said one thing very \ndramatic in his statement. We should think about it. He said the Ryan \nbudget is insufficient because it allows $8 trillion in new debt to be \nincurred by the United States over the next 10 years. Think about that. \nHe says that is unthinkable and it really is dramatic that we would \nhave that much debt accrue.\n  The only budget that exists from the Democratic majority is the \nPresident's budget. The President's budget, as analyzed by the \nCongressional Budget Office, without any doubt or dispute would add $13 \ntrillion to the debt of the United States in 10 years. They conclude \nthat the President's budget--the one that was praised by the Democrats \nwhen it came out--would increase the debt, increase spending, and \nincrease taxes more than if we did nothing. I call it the most \nirresponsible budget ever to be introduced because it makes our debt \nsituation worse at a time in which we have never faced a more serious \nsystemic debt crisis in America.\n  Senator Conrad says Federal education spending, which is basically \nthe Department of Education and some other programs, should not have \nits funding reduced. He did not acknowledge the fact that the \nPresident's budget proposes to increase education spending through the \nDepartment of Education by 10.5 percent next year, at a time when we \nare in record deficits. The Department of Energy is proposed to receive \na 9.5-percent increase. The Department of State is proposed to receive \na 10.5-percent increase. The Department of Transportation, with a \nphantom assumption of revenue from a source unidentified by the \nadministration, is projected to receive a 60-percent increase to fund \nnew high-speed rail and other priorities that have not been proven to \nbe effective today. Even if they are effective, we do not have the \nmoney. Sometimes you cannot do things you would like to do because you \ndo not have the money. To that extent, I would say we are on the wrong \ntrack.\n  Let me say about Congressman Ryan's budget proposal that it does \nsignificantly reduce spending every year. It completely changes the \ndebt trajectory. It reduces spending and deficits every year. It does \nnot get to a balance in 10 years, but it eventually gets to a balance \nin the outyears, according to their projections. Of course, intervening \nCongresses will have much to say about it. It does change the debt \ntrajectory, and it does put us on the right path. If passed, in my \nopinion, it would be the kind of budget that would create confidence in \nthe international markets, create jobs and growth in America, create \nvitality in our businesses, and it is something that would be better \nthan doing nothing and absolutely better than the inexcusable budget \nthat has been presented by the Democrats--the only one they have \npresented so far.\n  I wanted to make those points.\n  Madam President, the simple fact is that the American people are \nfurious with Washington. And they have every right to be. They work \nhard, pay their taxes, and play by the rules. They sacrifice for their \nfamilies, contribute to their communities, and uphold this Nation's \nvalues. They have built up the greatest, most dynamic economy on the \nface of the Earth. But Washington has wasted their tax dollars, eroded \nour values, and placed this Nation's economy at grave risk.\n  Politicians have arrogantly believed that the rules don't apply to \nthem. In the midst of a deep recession, as American families tightened \ntheir belts, Washington went on a historic spending spree. By the end \nof the first 3 fiscal years of the Obama administration, we will have \naccumulated another $5 trillion in total gross debt. Our deficit this \nyear alone will approach $1\\1/2\\ trillion. Our annual budget has nearly \ndoubled from what it was at the beginning of the decade.\n  This enormous surging debt prompted the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff to describe it as the greatest threat to our national \nsecurity. At $14 trillion it hovers over our economy like a dark cloud. \nIt undermines confidence and fosters uncertainty. Studies show our \ncrushing debt stifles job growth and robs us of as many as one million \njobs a year.\n  We borrow $5 billion a day, $100 billion a month and, under the \npresident's vision, we are on track to do the unthinkable: doubling our \nentire national debt in just 10 years. We are faced with what has \nrightly been called the most predictable economy crisis in our history. \nThe question is not whether such a crisis will occur but whether we act \nin time to prevent it.\n  A major financial crisis is not just some hypothetical danger: it is \nvery real and it is very serious. If the world loses confidence in our \nability to control our spending and debt, our interest rates could \ndramatically spike. Greece saw its interest rates triple before its \ndebt crisis hit. The rates for Ireland and Portugal quadrupled.\n  If the same were to happen to the United States we could become \nunable to pay the interest on our debt and face\n\n[[Page S3321]]\n\na Greece-like debt crisis that plunges our country into a deep \nrecession. This would not be some distant financial event, but an \neconomic disaster felt most severely by everyday working Americans.\n  There is no reason we should be in this situation. America's \nworkforce is the most productive on Earth. Our system of government is \nthe envy of the world. But those who occupy the halls of power have \nfailed to uphold the public trust. They have squandered this Nation's \nwealth and threatened our children's future.\n  So, again, the American people have every right to be furious.\n  They rose up in the last election and the big spenders in Washington \ntook a shellacking. We saw the emergence of the Tea Party a diverse \ncollection of Americans spread across the country who, after years of \nsitting silent, spoke out for the first time in their lives. They are \ngood and decent patriotic Americans who fear for their country and for \nthe future their children will inherit.\n  Their concerns are shared by the vast majority of Americans. Overall, \nmore than 70 percent of Americans believe this country is on the wrong \ntrack.\n  To get back on the right track requires strong leadership. I have \ncontinued to hope that President Obama would rally the country behind \nneeded reform. Unfortunately, the president seems determined to not \nonly keep our country on its dangerous course but to accelerate our \npace. He offered a budget in February a budget many Democrats praised \nthat he and his budget director declared to the whole world would ``not \nadd more to the debt,'' ``spend only money that we have each year,'' \nand ``live within our means.'' But those statements were not honest. \nThe President's budget never once produces a deficit less than $748 \nbillion. And the deficits climb to $1.2 trillion in the 10th year.\n  And what about the Senate? What is this august body doing to confront \nthis crisis? Is the Budget Committee meeting to work on a plan? Is \nthere a Senate budget being considered on the floor today? Will we be \namending a resolution on the Senate floor?\n  The answer to all of these questions is no. Today is the 756th day \nsince the Democrat-led Senate passed a budget. In that time Congress \nhas spent more than $7 trillion. We have accumulated another $3.2 \ntrillion in debt. What do we have to show for it? Unemployment stuck \naround 9 percent, anemic economic growth, and the very real threat of a \ndebt crisis.\n  But Majority Leader Reid and the big spenders in the Democrat Party \nare determined to keep spending and spending and spending. The reason \nwe have not seen a budget from Chairman Conrad and the Democrat Senate \nis because they know that they can't put forward a plan that wins the \nsupport both of their caucus and of the American people. News reports \nconfirmed that budget proposal Senate Democrats were working on and \nthen abandoned relied more heavily on taxes than savings. It would have \ncut only $1.5 trillion over 10 years. That doesn't even come close to \nwhat we need to cut. We are going to spend $45 trillion over the next \n10 years. Our national debt will be 100 percent of GDP by the end of \nSeptember.\n  House Republicans have stepped forward, fulfilled the duty they asked \nthe American people to bestow on them, and presented an honest, \ncourageous plan that will get the job done. It will save, or cut, \naround $6 trillion. But Leader Reid wants to use our floor time this \nweek to simply vote down this plan while offering nothing in its place. \nHe just wants to keep spending and spending and spending.\n  He is simply trying to remove himself from the spotlight that should \nbe directed on the inability or unwillingness of his caucus to deliver \na budget plan to the American people.\n  But the majority leader is more than happy to go into recess, more \nthan 750 days since the Senate has passed a budget, and simply be \ncontent to have obstructed every single effort to reduce spending or \nimpose budgetary control. He is content, it would seem, to send this \nChamber into recess after he has failed miserably to protect this \nNation from the financial danger ahead. He says ``there's no need to \nhave a Democratic budget.'' He says it would be ``foolish'' to present \none. So we will just keep spending and spending and spending.\n\n  What is the real strategy here? The Democrat strategy is just to \nattack, vilify, and disparage House Republicans because they did the \nhonorable thing and put forward an honest plan. Here is what Senator \nSchumer said earlier this week, speaking of today's votes:\n\n       We will exhibit this issue as an example of why we need to \n     keep the Senate Democratic in order to counter House \n     Republicans. We will point to this week and say the \n     Republicans tried to end Medicare but a Democratic majority \n     stopped it in the Senate. It's that simple.\n\n  Medicare is going to be insolvent in about 10 years. House \nRepublicans have a plan to save it. People may disagree on aspects of \nthat plan, may have different ideas for implementation. But the House \nRepublican plan will save Medicare. The Democrat Senate plan is to \nallow Medicare to go bust and to waste the Senate's time savaging the \nHouse Republican plan with a series of false, dishonest attacks. The \nDemocrat Senate plan is to ignore the danger and just keep spending and \nspending and spending.\n  Chairman Conrad, I am sad to say, called the House Republican plan \n``ideological,'' ``partisan,'' ``unreasonable,'' and ``draconian.'' I \nwas surprised to hear this given that the chairman served on the fiscal \ncommission, which issued the following statement in the preamble to its \nreport:\n\n       In the weeks and months to come, countless advocacy groups \n     and special interests will try mightily through expensive, \n     dramatic, and heart-wrenching media assaults to exempt \n     themselves from shared sacrifice and common purpose. The \n     national interest, not special interests, must prevail. We \n     urge leaders and citizens with principled concerns about any \n     of our recommendations to follow what we call the Becerra \n     Rule: Don't shoot down an idea without offering a better idea \n     in its place.\n\n  So after this week's mockery, what is next for the Senate? We will \npromptly adjourn for recess. The Senate will adjourn for Memorial Day--\na time when we honor those who have kept this country safe. But the \nSenate has done nothing to protect this country from the economic \ndanger that draws nearer each day.\n  If, after this shameful display, Majority Leader Reid wants to \nadjourn for recess, all I can say is this: not with my consent. I will \nforce a vote on it. Senate Democrats will have to stand before the \nAmerican people, having more than 750 days since passing a budget, and \ndeclare that they will go into a 1-week vacation having not taken a \nsingle, solitary step to address our Nation's fiscal crisis. They have \nnot even allowed the Budget Committee to meet.\n  We are told we don't need public meetings, that a small group of \nlawmakers and White House officials should meet in secret to hammer out \nsome 11th hour deal that nobody sees or scrutinizes until it is \nadopted. Well, it is that kind of thinking that got us here in the \nfirst place. What this process needs is more sunlight, not less. First, \nwe were told to wait for the Gang of Six. Now we are to supposed to \nwait for the Biden talks. But at what point will we just do our duty \nunder the law and work on a budget? I firmly believe that the best way \nout of this debt crisis is to have an open, honest, and public debate.\n  The one thing we haven't tried in this town is the one thing that I \nknow will work: to have an open, transparent process before the whole \nworld. Let's speak honestly about the dangers we face. Let's put \nforward a plan in the Senate to address those dangers. Let's open that \nplan to amendment and discussion. Let's stand and be counted before the \nAmerican people. If Democrats think the way out of this crisis is to \nraise taxes, let them put that plan on paper and let's debate it. But \nenough operating in the shadows. Enough hiding. Enough ducking. Let's \ndo the people's work. Let's give the American people the honest process \nand the honest budget they deserve.\n  We also need a budget that is based on facts. All of the evidence \nshows that deficit reduction plans relying on heavy tax increases are \nfar less successful and result in far less prosperity. Though raising \ntaxes is billed as the compassionate choice, there is nothing \ncompassionate about weakening our economy and bankrupting our country. \nThere is nothing compassionate about\n\n[[Page S3322]]\n\ndividing up an ever smaller amount of wealth. There is nothing \ncompassionate about ignoring the facts, the evidence, and the lessons \nof history. A compassionate budget is one that improves the fortunes \nfor every sector of American society--creating jobs, increasing wages, \nand expanding opportunity.\n  In other words, we must focus on growing the economy instead of the \ngovernment. That is the only way to ensure that America is able to \ncompete, to lead and to thrive in the 21st century.\n  An honest budget is one that not only puts our budget on a path to \nbalance but our country on a path to balance. In other words, we need a \nbudget that shifts the balance of power from Washington back to the \npeople.\n  At its core, the debate over our Nation's debt is a debate over our \nNation's identity. In his recent speech on the deficit, the president \nspoke of America's social compact to justify his big-government vision. \nBut the social compact I am familiar with is very different. The \nAmerican idea is that the government's role is to preserve our liberty, \nnot control our lives.\n  Ultimately, what we are fighting for is a future for our children \nthat is free from both the burden of debt and the burden of big \ngovernment. I was not elected to this office to participate in the \ntransformation of America to a European-style social democracy where \ngovernment dominates our lives.\n  America's greatness is not found in the size of our government but in \nthe scope of our freedoms. We need a budget that recognizes this \nessential truth.\n  I see my colleague Senator Paul is here. I know he would like to take \n5 minutes to respond to the majority leader. He is definitely entitled \nto that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that he be given 5 minutes, Mr. President, \nand that the 5 minutes not count against the time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I rise in response to a scurrilous \naccusation. I have been accused of wanting to allow terrorists who \nattack America to have weapons. To be attacked of such a belief when I \nam here to discuss and debate the constitutionality of the PATRIOT Act \nis offensive. I find it personally insulting, and I think it demeans \nthe body--it demeans the Senate body and the people that we cannot have \nan intelligent debate over the constitutionality of this bill.\n  I am somehow to be told that because I believe a judge should sign a \nwarrant, that I am in favor of terrorists having weapons? The absurdity \nof it. The insult of it. If one argues that judges should sign warrants \nbefore they go into the house of an alleged murderer, are you in favor \nof murder? Can we not have a debate on a higher plane--a debate over \nwhether there should be some constitutional protections, some \nconstitutional procedure--than to come to the floor and accuse me of \nbeing in favor of giving weapons to terrorists?\n\n  The question is, Can our Constitution withstand, is our Constitution \nstrong enough that we could actually capture terrorists and protect our \nliberties at the same time? Should we have some rules that say, before \nthey come into your house, before they go into your banking records, \nthat a judge should be asked for permission; that there should be \njudicial review? Do we want a lawless land? Do we want a land that is \nso much without restraint, a government without restraint, that at any \npoint in time they can come into your house? We were very worried about \nthat very thing. That is why our country was founded on such principles \nas the fourth amendment, to protect us from an overzealous government.\n  But to transfer an argument, where good people might disagree, into \nan accusation that I would let terrorists have weapons? No, I believe \nwe would stop terrorism but do it in a constitutional fashion, where \none would have a warrant issued by a judge.\n  Some people say, we don't have enough time to do that. At 3 in the \nmorning, judges are routinely called when someone is accused of rape or \naccused of murder. When there is an alleged crime, we get warrants, and \nit works. It has worked for 225 years, until we decided to throw out \nthe Constitution. We threw out the Constitution with the PATRIOT Act \nbecause we changed the Constitution--not by two-thirds in this body \nvoting for it and not by three-fourths of the States but by a scared 51 \npercent who threw out their liberties. They said: Make me safe. Make me \nsafe. I am afraid. Make me safe. But they gave up their liberties.\n  I think that was a mistake, and I think we should have an intelligent \nand rational discussion. I don't think it furthers the debate to accuse \nsomeone who has constitutional concerns about the way we are doing \nthings of being in favor of putting weapons into the hands of \nterrorists. I object strongly to this.\n  The leader has said they will compromise. He said 1 week of debate in \nFebruary and open amendments; that they would be open to amendments--\neven amendments they disagreed with. We will do whatever people feel is \nappropriate on this bill. That doesn't mean just amendments that are \nnot emotional or just amendments that have nothing to do with guns.\n  They are petrified to vote on issues over guns because they know a \nlot of people in America favor the second amendment; that they own guns \nand want to protect that right to own guns and the right to have those \nrecords not sifted through by the government. We don't want to have a \ngovernment that eventually will allow for direction of the police \ntoward those who own guns. We don't want our records to be public. We \ndon't want our records to be sifted through by a government without \njudicial review. But they do not want to vote on this because they know \nthe American people agree with us. If we polled this question, we would \nfind 80 to 90 percent of Americans don't want their banking records, \ndon't want their gun records to be sifted through by a government \nwithout a judge ever giving any approval.\n  This is a constitutional question, and I would ask the leader to \nstand by his agreement to an open amendment process.\n  At this time, I ask unanimous consent that my amendments, Nos. 363, \n365, and 368, be in order, with 1 hour of debate on each, followed by a \nrollcall vote. I ask unanimous consent that this occur at this time.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and, of \ncourse, as the Senator knows, I have given a statement on the floor \nthat one amendment I understand is in his consent makes this whole \narrangement impossible, and so, therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Objection is heard. Who yields \ntime?\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I yield Senator Ayotte up to 10 \nminutes or such time as she may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, today marks the 756th day since the \nDemocrat-controlled Senate passed a budget. The Democratic majority has \nabdicated a basic responsibility we have in our government; that is, to \nproduce a budget. States produce a budget, cities and towns produce a \nbudget, small businesses don't operate without a budget, and families \nproduce a budget. Yet here we are, running over a $1.6 trillion deficit \nthis year alone, and the Democratic-controlled majority is not bringing \nforth a budget or a blueprint to put our country on a path to fiscal \nresponsibility. It seems to me, if we do nothing else, that is a basic \nresponsibility we have as Members of the Senate.\n  On Monday, all Republican Senators joined Senator Sessions and me in \nsending a letter to the majority leader, urging him to take the steps \nnecessary to bring forward a fiscal year 2012 budget in committee, to \nhave a full, honest debate there and then on to the floor to make sure \nwe have a transparent budget debate so the American people can weigh in \non that and we can move forward to putting our country on a fiscally \nresponsible path.\n  As a reminder, the committee should have acted on the budget \nresolution before the statutorily-set deadline of April 1, and Congress \nshould have completed that action by April 15. Yet, unfortunately, the \nmajority in the budget committee and the majority leader has ignored \nthat law. The reality is, the majority party controls the work flow in \nthe Budget Committee and determines what is debated on the floor.\n\n[[Page S3323]]\n\nGiven the enormity of the obvious fiscal challenges we face, there is \nno excuse for why my Democratic colleagues have not been able to have a \ntransparent, serious debate about our country's fiscal future both in \nthe Budget Committee and on this floor. The American people demand that \nand are owed nothing less.\n  Unfortunately, instead of coming up with a budget blueprint that puts \nus on a path to sustainability, many of my Democratic colleagues have \nprimarily focused their efforts on distorting provisions of the House-\npassed budget plan, trying to score political points while our \ncountry's economic future becomes even more precarious. We have seen \nthe warning signs for our country in other countries around the world, \nas well as the S's recent announcement of a negative outlook for the \nUnited States.\n  Astoundingly, last week, the majority leader said it would be foolish \nfor his party to produce a budget plan. In talking directly with my \nconstituents in New Hampshire, I can say with certainty that is the \nlast word they would use to describe the Senate's refusal to have their \nown budget plan and to have a full and robust debate within the Budget \nCommittee and within this body about the fiscal plan for our country's \nfuture. That is the last word they would use because they sit around \ntheir kitchen tables at home and they put together a budget. They look \nat the revenue coming in and the expenses they have and they balance \ntheir budgets. They have no idea why we are not doing that here. That \nfundamental responsibility is, unfortunately, what the majority leader \nhas described as foolish, even though it is an exercise that families \nundertake every single day.\n  Last year, Congress failed to pass a budget, failed to pass any of \nthe 12 annual appropriations bills and failed the Nation by recklessly \nfunding the government on a series of short-term spending bills. The \nSenate cannot make the same mistake we made last year--a mistake that \nwas made by the Democratically controlled Congress this year, given the \nfiscal path our country is on. With less than 6 months remaining until \nthe start of the new fiscal year, it is past time for the Senate to \nproduce a basic budget plan that substantively addresses our grave \nfiscal crisis.\n  We need leadership and I call on the majority leader to show that \nleadership and the chairman of the Budget Committee to bring forth a \nbudget in our Senate committee. I am a brand new member of the Budget \nCommittee. I look forward to having that debate in that very important \ncommittee in our body, to work together with Members on both sides of \nthe aisle to craft a responsible budget plan that reduces spending and \nbrings us to a balanced budget. That is what our country needs.\n  In the letter that was sent to the majority leader, Republicans made \nclear we are ready to make the difficult choices to preserve our \ncountry and to get our fiscal house in order once and for all. We stand \nready to preserve the greatest country in the world. There is no \nquestion that the budget process is broken when we don't even have a \nbudget brought forth before the Budget Committee and a full and robust \ndebate in this body.\n  Congress must get serious about putting in place spending reforms. I \nwould like to see a balanced budget amendment to our Constitution, to \nmake sure Congress can't get around any spending reforms we pass. \nStates balance their budgets. Yet here in Washington we continue to \nspend money we do not have, unfortunately.\n  Congressman Ryan, in the House, has proposed, and the House has \npassed, a budget blueprint for our country. Yet my friends on the other \nside of the aisle have spent considerable time demagoguing the House \nbudget blueprint and their plan, even though they have shown the \ncourage to put forth a budget that puts us on a path to reduce spending \nand eventually bring us to a balanced budget. My Democratic colleagues \nhave brought out the usual scare tactics. But for all their \ngrandstanding, they haven't been straight with the American people.\n  We do need to address entitlement reform. We do need to make changes \nto Medicare--to preserve Medicare for those who are relying on Medicare \nright now and for future generations. I am the mother of two children, \nand I certainly don't want to look my children in the eyes--with the \nfiscal crisis our country is facing--and have them say to me: Mom, what \ndid you do about this?\n  Now is the time to act. We have three choices when it comes to \naddressing rising health care costs in Medicare. We can do nothing and \nwatch the program go bankrupt in 2024, as outlined by the recent \ntrustees' report on Medicare--an objective report that basically says \nthat program will go bankrupt by 2024. We can go forward with the \nPresident's proposal to ration care through the administration's plan \nto have an unelected board of 15 bureaucrats who will decide who is \ngoing to get coverage, when they are going to get coverage, and how \nphysicians are going to get paid or we can show real leadership and \nstrengthen the program to make it solvent for current beneficiaries and \nalso for future beneficiaries and allow them to make the choices, \ninstead of an unelected group of 15 individuals who are accountable not \nto Congress and certainly not to the people whose lives will be \naffected.\n  I commend Congressman Ryan for his courage. I challenge anyone, \nincluding the Members on the other side of the aisle who have been so \ncritical of the plan: Where is your plan? What is your constructive \nplan to save Medicare? How do you go home to your constituents, your \nelderly constituents--people such as my grandparents who are relying on \nMedicare--knowing that the trustees' report says it is going bankrupt \nin 2024--and say to them: I don't have a plan.\n  A constructive plan to preserve this program is important. It is what \nRepublicans are committed to. We are here to save Medicare, to save our \nentitlement programs, and most of all, to save our country from \nfinancial ruin. Now is the time for leadership. It is time to look at \nthe challenges we face with eyes wide open and to have the courage to \nfight for the American people and for the future of the greatest \ncountry in the world. We cannot afford to kick this can down the road.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has consumed 10 \nminutes.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank the Chair. If I may finish. I thank my colleague, \nSenator Sessions.\n  We cannot afford to kick this can down the road any further. We must \nact now. We must address our entitlement programs now. I would call on \nthe majority leader and on Senate Democrats--rather than demagoguing \nthe plan that has come forward from the House, if you have a \nconstructive plan of your own--to please come to the floor right now \nand bring forth a plan that will preserve Medicare, will preserve our \nentitlement programs, and put us on a path to fiscal responsibility and \nsustainability, to a balanced budget to save our country.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, before the Senator departs, I thank \nher for her comments and her valuable and constructive insights. I \nwould ask her about one thing. I know a lot of our new Members came to \nCongress, having campaigned and talked to people all over their States, \nwith a passion to do something about the unsustainable spending path we \nare on. We had a large number who wanted to be on the Budget Committee, \nand we are glad she just joined us.\n  But let me ask, is it a disappointment to get on the Budget \nCommittee, which the law says should write a budget and have hearings \non the budget, and then to find the majority leader has decided not to \neven allow a budget hearing to take place?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank the Senator from Alabama for that question. As \nthe newest member of the Budget Committee, it is an extreme \ndisappointment. I was looking forward to rolling up my sleeves and \nundertaking the responsibilities of putting forth a responsible budget \nto preserve our country. That is why I wanted to serve on the Budget \nCommittee.\n  I come from a small business family. I know one can't operate a \nbusiness without a budget. So many of my constituents and those I met \non the campaign trail asked me all the time: I have no idea, how can we \noperate a government without a budget? Yet here we are. That is what \nhas been so disappointing to me. I hope and I urge\n\n[[Page S3324]]\n\nour Democratic colleagues to change course and let the Budget Committee \ndo what it is supposed to do.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank Senator Ayotte of New \nHampshire. She is following in the footsteps of a great budget leader, \nchairman, ranking member, Judd Gregg, and brings those good instincts \nto the body.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following Republican speakers be \nlimited to 10 minutes each. I, at this point, am pleased to recognize \nmy very able and effective colleague, Senator DeMint, for his comments \nat this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I thank Senator Sessions for leading \nthese few minutes of debate we were allowed. It is an extraordinary \nsituation where we are as a nation, that we are here with only a few \nminutes of debate about what has become the most serious situation our \ncountry has ever faced, and that is our debt.\n  When President Obama was a Senator in 2006, he said ``increasing \nAmerica's debt weakens us domestically and internationally.''\n  Admiral Mullen, the Chairman of our Joint Chiefs of Staff, has said: \n``Our biggest national security threat is our debt.''\n  We know the rating agencies that look at our financial condition, \nsuch as Standard & Poor's, have downgraded us. We know major capital \nfunds have divested of Treasury notes, concerned about our political \nwill to deal with our debt. Yet we do not have a budget. We do not have \nany plan to deal with the debt. Everything Republicans put forward in \nthe House and the Senate the Democrats sit on the sidelines and \ncriticize and misrepresent. Yet they offer no solutions themselves.\n  It is hard to deal with $14 trillion in debt and what it really \nmeans. Here is one chart that is somewhat helpful. We hear in the news \nthat Greece and Ireland and Portugal are bankrupt. They are close to \ndefaulting. They are having to be bailed out by the International \nMonetary Fund. These charts just show the percent of debt relative to \ntheir total economy, their GDP.\n  We see Greece is already at 136 percent; Ireland is at 75 percent; \nPortugal, 82 percent. If we add up all the liabilities that we have as \na nation, we are already at 95 percent, which means we have more debt \nrelative to our total economy than Portugal and Ireland already, and \nvery soon we are on a track to even outpace Greece. Yet we do not even \nhave a budget, no plan of what to spend.\n  When Republicans talk about the need to cut spending all we get is \ncriticism. The President has actually submitted a budget that nearly \ndoubles our debt over the next 10 years. We will get a chance to vote \non it. Not even the Democrats are going to vote for that budget. But \nthey have not even presented one on their own.\n  We will also get a chance to vote on the House budget. The Democrats \nthink if we do, that is going to hurt us. But I think we will see most \nRepublicans vote for it because they know we have to deal with \nMedicare. The President's budget cuts what Medicare pays doctors \nanother 35 percent. Already about 50 percent of the doctors in this \ncountry will not see new Medicare patients. The President cut $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion from Medicare to help pay for ObamaCare and somehow he can \nlook us in the eye and say this strengthened Medicare. The fact is, the \nDemocrats have Medicare on a course of bankruptcy that is going to \nhappen much sooner than is projected because people will not be able to \nfind a doctor if the President's budget is implemented anywhere close \nto where it is going to be implemented.\n  Republicans are trying to save Medicare and make sure there are \noptions for seniors in the future that will be good options for them; \nthat they will have a way to pay for health care in the future. \nMedicare will not be there. Anyone who looks at seniors today and tells \nseniors that traditional Medicare is going to be there 5 or 10 years \nfrom now is not telling the truth because it is not. Doctors will not \nsee Medicare patients at the rate we are going to pay.\n  All we are doing today is having what we call message votes, show \nvotes. They are set up to fail. The majority leader does not intend to \npass any budget--not the President's budget, not a Republican budget, \nand they will not even offer one on their own. We are going to leave \nhere today with this situation right here: with America approaching a \ndebt level which we have seen take down other countries and continue to \nignore the obvious.\n  As has already been referenced by Senator Ayotte, the majority leader \nactually said:\n\n       There is no need to have a Democratic budget . . . it would \n     be foolish of us to do a budget at this stage.\n\n  It would be foolish because it would reveal what they really intend \nto do, which is to keep spending and keep borrowing, keep investing, \nkeep growing government programs, and not make those hard decisions \nthat have to be made to pull our country away from the edge of a cliff, \nwhich is where we are.\n  Everyone outside Washington seems to understand that we have an \nurgent situation right now. Yet here we are today with just these show \nvotes on a budget with no intent of dealing with this at all. What we \nneed to be doing is--recognizing the President has said our debt is our \nbiggest problem, and it is a failure of leadership to ask for an \nincrease in the debt ceiling--we need to recognize we cannot raise this \ndebt ceiling. We cannot increase our debt unless we make the hard \ndecisions that need to be made for the future.\n  The only decision that will change this place is if we pass a \nbalanced budget requirement for the Congress that the States have to \nratify. If we passed that this year before we voted on the debt \nceiling, then the people of this country in all 50 States would have a \nchance to ratify that. It would take 1 year or 2, 3 years to be \nratified; then there is another 5 years' implementation built into the \nbill. So we are talking 6 or 8 years to get to a balanced budget.\n  If we cannot make that commitment as a Congress, we are in effect \ncommitting to bankrupt our country because all of us know we cannot \nkeep spending more than we are bringing in when they are already \ntelling us we are at a debt level that is going to bankrupt our \ncountry. We cannot even pay the interest if interest rates go up at \nall.\n  We have to be responsible, and what we are doing today is completely \nirresponsible. I cannot raise the rhetorical level high enough to talk \nabout the absurdity of where we are. We put our country in danger, our \nfuture at risk, and yet we are having show votes on budgets and no \nbudget at all from the Democratic majority.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Alabama at least taking this time that \nwe have to point out the real issues and the urgency of the matter in \nthe fact that we need to move from show to real substance. We cannot \nroll up our sleeves and work together if the other side does not agree \nthat we have a problem. We do have a problem, and the only way to \nchange that is for us to agree as a Congress to balance our budget \nwithin a reasonable window and to put that structure on us so we keep \nthat budget balanced in the future.\n  I thank Senator Sessions and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Alabama for \ngiving me the opportunity to speak on this extremely important issue. \nLet me follow up on the central point that Senator DeMint from South \nCarolina has been making.\n  When I go back to Pennsylvania and talk to my constituents about the \nfact that the Government of the United States, the world's biggest \nenterprise--an enterprise--is going to spend $3.6 trillion this year, \nand we are doing it without a budget, they look at me in shocked \ndisbelief that this could even be possible. But it is possible because \nmy colleagues in the Senate, my Democratic colleagues, refuse to \nproduce a budget. It is an unbelievable abdication of responsibility.\n  My colleagues have asked the American people to elect them to the \nSenate, have asked the American people to be the majority party of the \nSenate, which they are, and their attitude is they have no \nresponsibility to lay out a plan for how they want to spend the $3.6 \ntrillion that they want to spend. They have no intention of laying out \na plan of where the revenue is going to come from, how much is going to \ncome\n\n[[Page S3325]]\n\nfrom which areas, and how this money should be spent--no overall \nblueprint, no guidelines, no architecture for spending this staggering \nsum of money. This is an extraordinary abandonment of a very \nfundamental responsibility.\n  I have to say, I have a hard time listening to the criticism of the \nHouse budget by people who have offered no budget as an alternative.\n  Let me speak about the House budget for just a minute. It has taken a \ngreat deal of criticism from my friends on the other side in particular \nbecause 10 years hence, in this budget, they recommend reforms to \nMedicare that save Medicare. I want to stress this point. The current \npolicies being advocated--not in a budget but advocated elsewhere by my \nDemocratic friends--they are currently in the process of crushing \nMedicare because that is what is happening.\n  Talk to your doctors back home, talk to your hospitals. We have small \nhospitals across Pennsylvania that are increasingly finding it so \ndifficult to operate. Reimbursements are being gradually crushed down. \nWe have this threat that doctors' reimbursements are going to be \ndramatically cut. We have created in the President's health care \noverhaul this Independent Payment Advisory Board, as it is called, the \npurpose of which is to find ways to ratchet down reimbursements for \nhealth care providers.\n  One of the things that breaks my heart is how often I have had the \nconversation with doctors who tell me, often choking up in the process, \nthey are encouraging their kids to pursue some other line of work, some \nother profession other than health care, the profession to which they \nhave dedicated their life. But this is the state of affairs that we \nhave today because of where Medicare is and where it is heading.\n  So the House comes along and offers a plan that saves Medicare, puts \nit on a viable, sustainable footing for future generations, and they \nget attacked for it. Is it the perfect plan? Is it the only plan? I am \nsure it is not. But it would work.\n  One of the things that makes so much sense about what they are doing \nis they are altering the payments as a function of people's wealth and \nhealth. It makes a lot of sense. So when younger people reach \nretirement age, they get more financial help from the government if \ntheir income is lower and their health is worse, and they get less if \nthey are wealthy and relatively healthy. This mechanism would put \nindividuals in control of their own health care and put the government \non a sustainable path.\n  Frankly, I think we ought to congratulate them for doing some very \nthoughtful work. I am going to vote for the House plan. The House plan \naddresses a very long term structural problem we have for our budget \nand does it in a very thoughtful and sensible way.\n  I am introducing an alternative budget because I wish to focus on the \nnearer term. My focus is these next 10 years, because I think we have a \ncrisis staring us right in the face and we have to deal with it now. So \nI think we have to deal with it in next year's spending and in the \nimmediate future.\n  A big part of my goal and what we have demonstrated in the budget I \nhave introduced and that we will have a vote on in a little while is \nthat we can balance this budget within 10 years. I think that is a very \nimportant goal. My budget accomplishes that with two elements: policies \nthat generate strong economic growth which have all kinds of benefits, \nnot the least of which is it generates more revenue for the Federal \nGovernment; and the other part of this is we have to tighten our belt. \nThis government has been spending way too much money. My budget \nratchets that back. The combination brings us to balance within 9 years \nand generates a modest surplus within 10 years. In the process, we \ndramatically reduce the amount of debt as a percentage of GDP.\n  We just saw the Senator from South Carolina present a comparison of \nwhat a dangerous position we are already in compared to that of other \ncountries that have racked up too much debt as a percentage of their \neconomies. We are following on this very dangerous path. My budget \nstarts to reverse that curve. It starts to lower the debt as a \npercentage of GDP and, by bringing the budget into balance, it will \nactually stop growing the debt altogether, which I think is a very \nimportant goal. Part of that is through pro-growth tax policies.\n  No. 1, in this budget we would ask the relevant committees in the two \nbodies to enact reforms that would simplify the Tax Code dramatically \nand allow us to lower marginal rates. The combination of a simplified \nTax Code and lower marginal rates is absolutely guaranteed to generate \neconomic growth. I would do it on the corporate side as well as on the \nindividual side and, on the corporate side, move to a territorial-based \naccess system so we wouldn't continue to have the tremendous \ncompetitive disadvantage we have vis-a-vis our trading partners.\n  On health care, we take a different approach for Medicare. We are \nfocused on these next 10 years. Over the next 10 years we do two \nthings: One, we end the fiction that we are going to cut doctors by 30 \npercent, or end the threat, depending on how you choose to look at it. \nSo the sustainable growth rate, as it is called around here--this \nnotion that we have to massively cut reimbursements to doctors all of a \nsudden--that is done away with. We recognize that would be a very \nimprudent policy.\n  Another thing we do is adopt one of the recommendations from the \nSimpson-Bowles commission on medical malpractice liability. That helps \nto save some significant money across the board on health care, and \ncertainly that includes Medicare.\n  On Medicaid, we adopt a very similar approach to that which is done \nin the House budget, which is to say this is completely unsustainable \nin its current form. Medicaid has been doubling every 8 years and it is \na big driver of the deficit we have in Washington. It is also a big \ndriver of huge deficits across the 50 States. It is a big problem, \nbecause the States have little or no flexibility in how they administer \nthis program. They have a big financial burden that comes with it. What \nI think we ought to do is take these resources, block grant them to the \nStates, and give the States the flexibility to figure out a better way \nto deliver health care services to low-income people. I think among our \n50 States, I am very confident there will be many that will come up \nwith better models and as they do, they will be adopted generally, and \nwe can put this program on a sustainable path, which it is certainly \nnot on today.\n  On some other areas of spending, on nondefense discretionary \nspending, we have to cut it. We have grown it too much. In fact, the \nbig surge in the deficit in recent years has come from the \ndiscretionary side. So what we call for is lowering nondefense \ndiscretionary spending to the level it was in 2006 and then freezing \nthat for 6 years, after which it would be indexed to the consumer price \nindex. Other mandatory spending, aside from the big entitlement \nprograms, would gradually be reduced to just over their 2007 level. I \nsay gradually. We do this so people have a chance to adjust. Frankly, \nthe economic growth we would get from the lower marginal tax rates \nwould help facilitate this. It gets lowered to 2007 levels by 2014, \nafter which it grows at CPI.\n  Our budget calls for no changes whatsoever to Social Security, and it \ncalls for none of the structural changes to Medicare because those \nwould occur after the 10-year window and we are focused on just these \nnext 10 years.\n  I would strongly stress that we are staring at a full-blown crisis. \nWe don't know whether it is a year from now or 2 years from now or 18 \nmonths or even nearer. That is impossible to know. But it is impossible \nto deny that we cannot continue on this course. We cannot continue \nrunning multitrillion-dollar deficits--deficits that are 10 percent of \nour entire economic output, that rack up this huge amount of debt as we \nhave done in recent years. That is not sustainable.\n  My first career out of college was in finance. When I was working in \nfinance, the idea of the Federal Government of the United States of \nAmerica even having a credit rating was not something that was \nunderstood to be that way. The United States of America was above the \ncredit rating system. It didn't apply to us. A triple A rating wasn't \neven relevant because we didn't even talk about the creditworthiness of \nthe United States, except to refer to it as the risk-free interest \nrate, the risk-free security, the security for which\n\n[[Page S3326]]\n\nthere was no risk of a failure because this was, after all, the \nGovernment of the United States of America.\n  Now we are in a position that is absolutely shocking to me. We very \nmuch are subject to a credit rating, but it is worse than that. We have \nS telling us they are actively contemplating the day on which they \nwill lower our credit rating and we won't even be AAA. This is \nabsolutely shocking to me and it has tremendously dire consequences.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I close by saying we cannot kick this \ncan down the road anymore. We need to do something now. I have a budget \nthat balances within 10 years and I urge my colleagues to support it. I \nthank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I see my colleague Senator Hatch and I will be yielding \nto him for 10 minutes. I thank my colleague, Senator Toomey, a member \nof the Budget Committee. He served on the House Budget Committee. He \nhas worked harder than maybe anybody on the committee and has proposed \na plan that would actually balance our budget within 10 years. It is \nthe kind of thing we should be debating in the committee. \nUnfortunately, I know the Senator has to be deeply disappointed because \nwe are not having a markup in committee. We are not even having a \nchance to bring forth his budget and defend it and point out why he \nbelieves it will make America a better place.\n  I thank the Senator from his contributions to the debate and to the \ncommittee.\n  Let me note that Senator Hatch is the ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee, a very significant, important committee that deals with the \nfinancial challenges our Nation faces every day. I thank the Senator, \nand I yield to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I thank my colleague, and I thank Senator \nToomey for his work.\n  Early this year, along with every one of my Republican colleagues, I \nintroduced a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n  The people of Utah want this amendment. The polls show that if \nCongress were to pass it and send it to the States for ratification, it \nwould have significant support across the country.\n  From my perspective, the debate we have been having over the fiscal \nyear 2012 budget this week--if you can even call it a debate--\nexemplifies yet again the need for a balanced budget amendment. It \nseems like a simple thing, but the balanced budget amendment would \nrequire the President to submit and Congress to pass a balanced budget. \nGiven the budget process over the last few years, this simple \nrequirement takes on added significance.\n  The fact is it has been 756 days since Democrats passed any budget, \nthe most basic of Congress's constitutional responsibilities. And the \nfact is that absent a balanced budget amendment, Congress will never \nadopt the spending restraint necessary to restore constitutional limits \non the Federal Government and the Nation's fiscal integrity.\n  The consequences of this ineptitude reached a new low on the Senate \nfloor yesterday. To recap for those who missed it, Democrats took to \nthe Senate floor and accused Republicans who are attempting to right \nour fiscal ship by reforming programs for the poor and elderly of \nseeking to harm women, children, and other vulnerable members of our \nsociety. This verbal assault was deliberate and premeditated. I \nactually thank my colleagues on the other side who declined to \nparticipate in those attacks. Those attacks might make for good \npolitics, but they are terrible for this country.\n  People here might wish to deny it, but the fiscal crisis we face is \nreal. They might wish to say that Social Security's finances are just \ndandy, but the fact is the disability trust fund will be exhausted by \n2018 and the overall trust fund will be exhausted in 2036, a year \nearlier than we previously thought.\n  As bad as Social Security is, the situation with Medicare is even \nworse. According to the Congressional Budget Office, Medicare will be \ninsolvent in 2020. According to the Medicare trustees, Medicare's \nunfunded liability is $38.4 trillion. And what is the Democratic \nresponse to this? All is well. Nothing to see here. Please move along. \nThis is what the Democratic candidate in New York's special election \nhad to say about her opponent's claim that reforms to Medicare were \nnecessary to restore the solvency of this program:\n\n       That's simply a scare tactic to tell our seniors that there \n     will be nothing for them. . . . That's not the truth.\n\n  Republicans are trying to scare seniors? That is rich. A liberal \nsurrogate for the Democrats is currently running an advertisement that \nshows House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan pushing an old woman in \na wheelchair off a cliff. Talk about a new low. The head of the \nDemocratic National Committee--fresh from lecturing conservatives about \ncivility in politics--described the House budget as a tornado through \nnursing homes.\n  Yesterday we were treated to claims on the Senate floor that stopped \nshort of these attacks, but not that far short. Yet it is Republicans \nwho are trying to scare seniors? Give me a break. Still, as bad as \nyesterday's display was, I ended my day positive about the future. Last \nnight, I attended a dinner celebrating the centennial of President \nRonald Reagan's birth and at that dinner I had the honor of introducing \nLech Walesa, the former President of Poland, who helped to roll back \nthe Iron Curtain and liberate a continent.\n  When Ronald Reagan became President, the Soviets were on the march. \nIt was not a foregone conclusion that Communists would wind up in the \nash heap of history. When Lech Walesa mounted the fence at the Gdansk \nshipyards, the only thing he could be certain of was prosecution by \nCommunist authorities. But Reagan and Walesa understood something. They \nunderstood that communism was a lie, played out on a world historical \nstage. And to borrow from Shakespeare, Reagan, and Walesa, that the \ntruth will out.\n  The fundamental truth we face today--one that cannot be denied--is \nthat our Nation faces a spending crisis that no amount of additional \ntaxes can fix. So let's talk about this budget process in a serious \nway. Unfortunately, doing so will not reflect well on this Chamber.\n  Borrowing from another one of Shakespeare's plays, in Hamlet the \ncharacter Marcellus observed that something is rotten in the state of \nDenmark. One might say the same about the Senate's action on the budget \nresolution. A budget is not law, but it is an important document that \ninstalls the guardrails for the operation of fiscal policy.\n  Under the Congressional Budget Act, each body is to report a \nresolution by April 15 of each year. President Obama submitted his \nbudget, and the House met the April 15 deadline. But Senate Democrats \nhave no budget of their own. Here is the Senate Democratic budget \nresolution: Just one big laid goose egg.\n  So here we are today talking about the House-passed budget. The \nsimple truth is my colleagues on the other side don't want to vote on a \nSenate Democratic budget. Instead, they are determined to vote on a \nbudget that everyone knows will not pass this body. Why is this? With \nall of their hard-edged partisan fury, and not even a thin reed of \nfiscal governance, like Marcellus, it is reasonable to conclude that \nsomething is rotten in the Senate. And if we follow the scent with our \nnoses, we will find it comes down to numbers.\n  The magic number is 50. There are 100 Members of this body and 53 of \nthose Members caucus with the Democrats. So why aren't there 50 votes \nfor a single Democratic budget? We have heard Senate Democrats won't \nsupport the President's budget. The stated reason is that the \nPresident's do-over budget was nothing more than a speech that was so \nvague that our friends on the other side refuse to treat it as a \nbudget. I believe there is a bigger problem holding up the Democratic \ncaucus. The heart and soul of the Democratic caucus is liberal, and I \nrespect that. But a healthy number of my friends on the other side are \nnot entirely in that camp. And many more realize a pure liberal fiscal \nposition might not be politically palatable. After all, the voters sent \na message last fall to get spending under control and not to hike \ntaxes.\n\n[[Page S3327]]\n\n  So because Senate Democrats are jammed up, unable to get their act \ntogether, their leadership proposes no budget of their own. We are \nengaged in a Senate budget debate, but there is no substantive Senate \nDemocratic budget before us, and we don't have one because at least 50 \nmembers of this body do not agree on one, even though they have 53 on \ntheir side. So how then do we define the majority's fiscal position?\n  What budget would the majority of Senate Democrats support if they \ncould? That budget is lurking in the background of this debate. It is \nthe budget the party's liberals would enact if they could. It is the \nbudget the President, in his heart of hearts, supports. It is certainly \nthe budget the folks at MSNBC support. It is the House Progressive \nCaucus's budget--an intellectually honest presentation of the liberal \nfiscal policy position. For interested folks, take a look at pages \nH2362 through H2870 of the Congressional Record of April 15, 2011. \nThere you will find the House Progressive Caucus budget's fine print \nand the debate over it.\n  The Progressive Caucus budget is real and it is ambitious. It is also \npolitically risky. Similar to the House budget developed by Chairman \nRyan, it took political courage. It is a statement of policy principles \nand numbers. With a goose egg as the stated Senate Democratic budget, \nfrom my perspective, the best place to look for the Democrat's position \nis the budget of the House progressives. There is no doubt that is \nwhere the sentiments of a majority of the Senate Democrat caucus truly \nare.\n  I also think the House progressive budget offers a valuable contrast \nto the House-passed budget. Last time I checked, there are two major \nparties in Congress, and both parties should be accountable for what \nthey would do about our perilous fiscal situation.\n  So let's hold them to account. The House progressives aim to balance \nthe budget by 2021. They aim to reduce public debt as a percentage of \nGDP to 64.1 percent by 2021. They aim for both taxes and spending to \ngrow significantly but to equal 22.3 percent of GDP by 2021. House \nprogressives advocate a fulsome growth in the role of the Federal \nGovernment, with new domestic spending rising by $1.7 trillion--new \ndomestic spending.\n  How do they propose to pay for all this? While the Democrats play \n``hide the ball'' on this issue, the House progressives are \nrefreshingly frank. The short answer is, tax hikes and cuts in defense \nspending. They propose $4 trillion in new taxes.\n  Let's take a look at these new taxes: raise marginal tax rates by 17 \npercent to 24 percent for single taxpayers. Look at that chart. There \nis an increase in the top marginal rates by 17 percent to 24 percent. \nThere is a brandnew ``millionaire'' surtax, with rates reaching as high \nas 47 percent. There is a new record-high death tax rate of 65 percent.\n  They treat capital gains and dividends as ordinary income. That \nmeans, in some cases, the marginal rate on capital gains and dividends \nwould more than triple. They tax all overseas business income \ncurrently. That would mean, with respect to growing global markets, \nU.S. businesses would be subject to uniquely high levels of taxation.\n  They create new taxes on banks and financial transactions. I will \nremind folks that the CBO told us last year this kind of tax would be \npassed through to bank customers and depositors.\n  House progressives look to reform Social Security by raising the base \nof the payroll tax on both employers and employees.\n  Look at this. My goodness. On health care, House progressives' \ntransparency is breathtaking for its honesty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I tell my distinguished colleague that \nwe only have a few minutes left, and the Senator from Utah is waiting. \nSo if the Senator could wrap up briefly. I have thoroughly enjoyed the \nSenator's remarks.\n  Mr. HATCH. All right. I thank my colleague.\n  Their budget anticipates taking ObamaCare to the next level with a \ngovernment-run plan. Progressives would impose government negotiation \nof prescription drug payments.\n  Where are the spending cuts? One word, ``defense.'' Defense will be \ncut by $2.3 trillion. This is the progressive budget. The hearts of the \nDemocratic Party would love to proceed down this path: ever higher \nspending and ever higher taxes to pay for it. But the heads of the \nparty realize that this would be politically disastrous. And so, like \nHamlet, they are paralyzed when action is demanded.\n  The failure of the Senate Democratic leadership to produce and vote \non a budget of their own cannot be allowed to mask a simple fact. The \nDemocrats might not like the solutions in the House budget, but their \nown failure to offer a proposal is a vote for the status quo. And a \nvote for the status quo is a vote for the destruction of Social \nSecurity and Medicare. And that is the true threat to America's \nelderly.\n  Serious times deserve serious measures. For that reason, I will be \nvoting for the motion to proceed on the House-passed budget, as well as \nthe budgets proposed by my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Toomey, \nand my colleague from Kentucky, Senator Paul.\n  We have entitlement programs with unfunded liabilities in the tens of \ntrillions. And the Democrats' response? Don't reform those programs to \nmake them sustainable. Instead let's scare up $21 billion by attacking \ntax breaks for oil companies.\n  If my Democratic colleagues want to have a tax reform debate, I am \nopen to that. But let's not pretend that increasing taxes on oil \ncompanies will make one iota's worth of difference in making the \ncountry's entitlement programs solvent. Let's not pretend that this is \na remotely serious solution to the country's fiscal problems.\n  Instead of offering a serious budget proposal and debating it, \nDemocrats chose to engage in the basest of politics, smearing \nRepublicans as hostile to women and the elderly.\n  I wish it were not so, but Marcellus' observation is compelling \ntoday. Something is rotten in the U.S. Senate. Nonetheless, and in \nspite of these antics, I am optimistic about the future.\n  The truth will out, and the truth is that this country is racing \ntoward a fiscal crisis. This fiscal crisis is still avoidable, if we \ntake courageous actions.\n  Chairman Ryan, in proposing his budget, and the House leadership for \nvoting on it, have done just that. And fortune favors the bold.\n  I thank my colleague for that little extra time. I intend to vote for \nthree of these budgets today because the three of them make sense. They \nare not crazy, they are not phony, and each of the three would save \nMedicare and other matters in the Federal Government.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank the Senator.\n  I have to say, the Senator's remarks about the progressive budget and \nthe fact that it represents the heart of this Senate Democratic \nconference's view of the budget is probably correct. It also represents \na view that would be widely and strongly rejected by the American \npeople.\n  Senator Lee, from Utah, is a new Senator. He campaigned in every \ncorner of his State. He has talked about this issue and spending and \nhas listened to his people and I am delighted to hear from him at this \ntime.\n  Madam President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute fifteen seconds.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Utah have 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I am fine \nwith that if we would have that time added on our side as well.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, 3 minutes will be added to \neach side.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, my distinguished colleagues who have spoken \nthis afternoon have pointed out a truth that is impossible to refute, \nwhich is, at the rate the Federal Government is spending, we will have \nacquired $15\n\n[[Page S3328]]\n\ntrillion of debt by the end of this year. That is a lot of money. It is \nrequiring a lot of interest payment. That interest payment is only \ngoing to grow large in the coming years.\n  The Obama administration is already predicting that by the end of the \ndecade, we will be paying $1 trillion a year just to service the \ninterest on our national debt. To put that in perspective, that is more \nthan we spend on Social Security in an entire year, more than we spend \non Medicare and Medicaid combined in an entire year, more than we spend \non national defense in an entire year. I actually believe that 10 years \nis putting it optimistically. I think that day is coming much sooner.\n  For that reason, I believe this body needs to pass a budget, a budget \nthat balances. The problem has been this body has refused to do this. \nEvery time we proceed with the idea that we will cut so many billions \nof dollars over the next 10 years or every time we adopt statutory \nspending caps, as we did with the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act almost 30 \nyears ago, as we did with the pay-go rules, Congress has treated those \nas something Congress can exempt itself out of. Congress has become a \nwalking, breathing waiver unto itself.\n  The problem is that we, as a legislative body, cannot bind future \nCongresses. We can legislate. We can appropriate only for this \nCongress. So our commitment now to save later is not binding--unless, \nof course, we adopt an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that will \nbind future Congresses. That is why I have said I will oppose any and \nevery attempt to raise the debt limit until such time as Congress has \npassed out of this body and presented to the States for ratification a \nbalanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution--one that would \nrequire a two-thirds supermajority vote to authorize Congress to spend \nmore than it takes in, in any given year, and to spend more than 18 \npercent of gross domestic product in any given year.\n  We cannot continue in perpetuity to rely on this kind of deficit \nspending. This will hurt every single Federal program. Whether you are \nmost concerned, on the one hand, about preserving our ability to \nprovide for our national defense or, on the other hand, if you are most \nconcerned about preserving our entitlement programs, you ought to want \na balanced budget amendment. You ought to be unwilling, as I am, to \nraise the debt limit until that amendment has been passed out by this \nbody and passed by the House of Representatives and submitted to the \nStates for ratification.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor to my distinguished colleague, the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, with whom I have appreciated the opportunity to work \nand would say, again, that he orchestrated a fine series of Budget \nhearings with some fabulous witnesses who made us all nervous but gave \nus some valuable insight. I say to Senator Conrad, I appreciate those \ngood hearings and I appreciate the opportunity to work with you and I \nam sorry we are not able to mark up a budget this time, it looks like.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I thank the ranking member. Those \nhearings would not have been possible without the active working \ntogether of my office and his office, and I do think they were an \nexcellent set of hearings talking about the dimensions of the problem \nwe confront and that we are on an unsustainable course, where we are \nborrowing 40 cents of every $1 we spend. It cannot continue.\n  Madam President, after my brief remarks, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe following Senators be recognized for up to 5 minutes off the \nDemocratic time: Senator Menendez, Senator Lautenberg, Senator Begich, \nand Senator Whitehouse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, just briefly, I wish to address this \nquestion of why we on our side have not laid down our budget proposal. \nLet me repeat, we are in an unusual year. This is not going to be a \ncircumstance in which there is a Republican budget, a Democratic \nbudget, you go to conference committee, and they are resolved because \nwe have a new process underway at the leadership level involving the \nWhite House. This is what the Republican leader himself said about that \nprocess:\n\n       [T]he discussions that can lead to a result between now and \n     August are the talks being led by Vice President Biden. . . . \n     That's a process that could lead to a result, a measurable \n     result. . . . And in that meeting is the only Democrat who \n     can sign a bill into law; in fact, the only American out of \n     307 million of us who can sign a bill into law. He is in \n     those discussions. That will lead to a result.\n\n  We do not need a Democratic budget and a Republican budget. We need \nan American budget. We need a budget that is bipartisan because all of \nus know that is the only budget that can possibly be adopted. The \nRepublicans control the House of Representatives. The Democrats control \nthe Senate. The only possibility for us to make progress is a \nbipartisan budget.\n  That is why I was deeply involved in the process on the President's \nfiscal commission--18 of us for 1 year--and it is the only place a \nbipartisan budget has so far emerged. Madam President, 11 of us \nsupported it--5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent--11 of us \nout of the 18 on the Commission.\n  We now have underway a group of five talks--Democrats and Republicans \nworking together. But, most important, we have, at the leadership \nlevel, Republican leaders from the House and the Senate, Democratic \nleaders from the House and the Senate, and the Vice President of the \nUnited States. What sense would it possibly make for us to go to markup \nof a budget before we have seen the results of these leadership talks? \nThat makes no sense. We have a bipartisan discussion underway--\nRepublican leaders, Democratic leaders, and the White House. We ought \nto have the courtesy and the patience to see if they can come up with a \nplan that would then form the basis of the budget.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise with deep concern about what \nthe proposed Republican budget does--in real terms--to real families in \nthis country.\n  I am deeply concerned that my colleagues on the other side--in their \nideological haze--seem to have lost sight of the real people whose \nlives will be affected by the choices we make.\n  It seems to me that the Republican budget proposal fails to realize \nthat budgets are not just about numbers. Budgets are about people--\ntheir hopes, their dreams, their expectations for a better life for \nthemselves and their children. They are about the promise of America--\nthe vision we have of safe, clean, vibrant communities in which to live \nand raise our families.\n  Budgets are a reflection of our values, not--as the House Budget \nCommittee chairman would have us believe--a faceless calculation of \npluses and minuses just to get to an arbitrary number--regardless of \nthe impact on families, seniors, students, and every community in this \ncountry.\n  We all have a budget, every family has one, maybe not a formal \nbudget, but we all have one. On the revenue side we have what we earn \nfrom gainful employment, investments, interest on savings. And on the \nflip side we have our expenses: our mortgage payment, groceries, \nutilities--and we have our contributions perhaps to our church or \nsynagogue, donations to a favorite charity, a favorite cause. These are \nexpressions of our personal values, just as the nation's budget is an \nexpression of our collective values.\n  We may not always think of the budget in those terms, but we should. \nIt is about our values.\n  Well, we found out last night, in upstate New York, that the \nRepublican vision of ending Medicare as we know it does not reflect \nAmerican values, and voters are not buying it.\n  Once again, our Republican colleagues have shown that they are out of \ntouch with the American people and are on the wrong side of history \nwhen it comes to what Americans think is fair--what they think is \nright.\n  Americans don't think it's right to give subsidies to big oil \ncompanies, tax breaks to millionaires, and take Medicare away from \nseniors.\n  They are saying that it is time to abandon the tired refrain of \nprivatization and ending Medicare as we know it. It is time to abandon \ntheir ideological agenda that leaves seniors to fend for themselves.\n  It is not who we are as a people, and it is not what Americans want.\n  This week I met with a group of seniors in Fort Lee, NJ. We discussed \nwhat\n\n[[Page S3329]]\n\nthe Republican budget cuts would do to the Medicare system they have \ndepended on for decades.\n  At the Fort Lee senior center, a typical 65-year-old, under the \nRepublican budget proposal, would pay an additional $7,060 by 2022. \nRight now, 142,834 seniors in New Jersey are impacted by the donut \nhole. Under the Republican plan those seniors will pay an additional \n$80 million for prescription drugs next year, and by 2020 seniors \ncurrently in the donut hole will pay an additional $1.6 billion.\n  Nationwide, nearly 4 million seniors would pay $2.2 billion more for \nprescription drugs in 2012 alone under the Republican plan. The \nRepublican plan to end Medicare would also force at least 1 million \nseniors to pay over $110 million more for annual wellness visits in \n2012.\n  And, by turning Medicaid into a block grant program, the Republican \nplan could cost America more than 2 million private-sector jobs over \nthe next 5 years and threaten our economic recovery. But that is not \nall. Nationwide, the Republican plan could cut more than $503 billion \nin Medicaid funding for seniors and the disabled, including life-saving \nnursing home care.\n  Leaving us with the uncomfortable and unanswerable question I pose to \nmy Republican friends: What will those people do--where will they go? \nWhat happens to them under your budget plan?\n  These are people, not budget numbers. What happens to them?\n  The Republican budget, in my view, satisfies a narrow political \nagenda that has obsessed about diminishing the role of government at \nall costs, no matter the trade-offs, no matter who it hurts, or what we \nlose.\n  I believe we can debate the role of government, but let's have it \nstraight-up. Let's not play this game of tearing away at the fabric of \nAmerica thread-by-thread to satisfy a political agenda, and falsely \nclaim it to be ``fiscal responsibility.'' It is not fiscal \nresponsibility; it's the single-minded goal of a conservative political \nagenda.\n  Fiscal responsibility is finding common ground and making difficult \nchoices together. In a democracy, one view does not make a budget.\n  We can negotiate responsible cuts. We all agree that we must make \ncuts and reduce the deficit. So let's agree now to negotiate fair cuts \nand include revenue expenditures that truly balance the budget, and are \ntruly fiscally responsible.\n  Cutting the deficit should not be a game of political brinksmanship. \nIt requires serious people coming to the table willing to make \ndifficult choices that balance cuts against revenues--balance necessary \nservices and investments that protect our values and our way of life \nagainst wasteful spending--while creating opportunity for every \nAmerican.\n  Balancing the budget isn't just about numbers. It is about protecting \nmiddle class families who are struggling to make ends meet in this \neconomy--and about reflecting their values, their hopes, their vision \nof what America is all about.\n  When considering our values as a nation, the question in this \nSenator's mind is: Who pays to lower the deficit and who does not under \nthis Republican budget proposal?\n  The answer is clear. Middle class families pay. Seniors pay. Anyone \nlooking for a Pell grant pays, but nothing is asked of the wealthiest \nAmericans, and Big Oil still gets billions in subsidies.\n  The fact is the Republican approach to balancing the budget is \nanything but balanced.\n  It is skewed to those who have the most and have already benefited \nthe most. A balanced long-term deficit reduction plan would have to \ninclude discretionary spending cuts, including defense, as well as \nentitlement changes. It would have to reduce revenue expenditures by \nclosing tax loopholes.\n  That is what fairness demands; it is what balance would demand. And \nit is what makes sense.\n  In my view, the Republican plan--with $1 trillion in tax cuts for the \nwealthy--makes no sense. It is as unbalanced a proposal as one could \nimagine. Yet our friends on the other side come to the floor and \nembrace it as rational, reasonable, and perfectly fair.\n  They look America in the eye, and say that giving the wealthiest \nAmericans more in tax relief will magically create jobs. Although there \nclearly is not evidence that it has in the past. They tell us that it \nwill raise all ships. They tell us--once again--that wealth will \ntrickle down.\n  How many jobs-lost, how many jobs-outsourced, how many companies-\nmoved-overseas do we have to endure before we admit that trickle-down-\neconomics is a quaint but false notion? The one thing lacking in \ntrickle-down is the trickle-down.\n  The fact is the Republican budget is not a balanced approach. It is, \nin fact, the epitome of imbalance. It memorializes a far-right \npolitical ideology and codifies it into a budget document that is \nfundamentally flawed.\n  My colleagues on the other side believe balancing the budget means \nputting $1 trillion dollars in tax cuts for the wealthy on one side of \nthe ledger, and $1.4 trillion in cuts to Medicare and Medicaid over the \nnext 10 years on the other. They believe it means a trillion dollars in \ntax cuts for millionaires who hold 40 percent of America's wealth while \neliminating protections for seniors, children, and the disabled--a \nchoice that will leave 34 million Americans with no medical insurance \nat all.\n  If we were serious about reducing the deficit in a balanced way, we \nwould start with the obvious, subsidies for Big Oil. The top five oil \ncompanies earned nearly $1 trillion over the last decade. Passing my \nbill to repeal oil subsidies would save taxpayers $21 billion over 10 \nyears.\n  We can safely assume oil profits will be much greater in the decade \nto come with higher oil prices, but let's assume the top five oil \ncompanies only get another $1 trillion in profits over the next decade.\n  And let's not forget that these profits are in Federal waters and on \nFederal lands, so they are making these profits with America's own \nresources. According to the data, the cost of exploration, development, \nand production of oil for the big five oil companies is about $11 per \nbarrel.\n  Oil has been trading at about $100 a barrel. That means Big Oil \ncompanies are enjoying a profit of over $90 per barrel of oil they \nextract.\n  Why in the world would they ever need subsidies in such conditions?\n  Handing out money to Big Oil companies and to the wealthiest \nAmericans shows that the other side is not interested in balancing the \nbudget or reducing the deficit, it wants to enact policies that favor \nthe rich. They would rather dismantle Medicare, cut Social Security, \ncut Medicaid for seniors and the poorest among us in nursing homes who \nhave no other place to go rather than solve our long term deficit \nproblems in a fair and balanced way.\n  It wasn't long ago that the budget was, in fact, balanced--during \nanother Democratic administration--when we had budget surpluses as far \nout as the eye could see.\n  How quickly we forget. The day Bill Clinton left office he handed the \nincoming president a $236 billion surplus with a projected surplus of \n$5.6 trillion over the next 10 years.\n  When President Bush left office he had turned a $236 billion budget \nsurplus into a $1.3 trillion budget deficit with projected shortfalls \nof $8 trillion over the next decade and handed the new President an \neconomy headed off the cliff.\n  Now, our Republican colleagues want to go back to the same failed \npolicies. They want to give more tax cuts to millionaires and \nbillionaires, subsidies to Big Oil while they end Medicare as we know \nit, and gut Pell grants and all they mean to our economic future.\n  They insist on tax cuts that will cost $700 billion on the revenue \nside over the next 10 years, and trillions more by slashing tax rates \nfor corporations and millionaires. Those making more than $1 million a \nyear will see a windfall of $125,000 each from the tax cuts, and tens-\nof-thousands-of-dollars more from the proposed rate cuts. While people \nin my State lose $34 billion in health benefits and 400,000 New \nJerseyans end up without health coverage at all. They want to shift the \nbalance to millionaires and billionaires, while making draconian cuts \nto make up for the deficits they created--cuts that do not reflect our \nvalues as a people and a nation.\n  The fact is ``balance'' is not about subsidies to Big Oil while \nending Medicare as we know it. It's not about $1\n\n[[Page S3330]]\n\ntrillion in tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, while slashing Pell \ngrants by18 percent.\n  Balance means fairness. It means evenness and equality. It denotes a \nstate of equilibrium, an equal distribution, a proportionate approach. \nIt implies symmetry--not a lopsided view that protects those who need \nno protection, but does not protect the interest of middle class \nfamilies struggling to make ends meet.\n  The Republican notion of ``balance'' not only ignores the concept of \nequality, fairness, shared responsibility and shared burden, but it \nflies in the face of the fundamental concept of American community \narticulated in our motto--E Pluribus Unum--Out of Many, One.\n  That we are all in this together and should benefit together, \nsacrifice together--each of us working together for the betterment of \nall of us.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse.) The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise with deepest hope that we are \ngoing to be able to defeat the House budget plan on which we are about \nto vote. This Republican budget is a scheme that would endanger the \nquality of life for millions of Americans who now struggle to get by. \nJust look at the gas pump and you will see what I am talking about.\n  The Republicans want to make sure the wealthy get wealthier with a \nnew trillion-dollar tax cut and put the burden on seniors, the middle \nclass, and young people to pay for it.\n  Paul Ryan, the House Republican Member who hatched this scheme, has \nsaid, ``This is not a budget; it is a cause.'' If you ask me, it is a \ncause for alarm. The other side wants to terminate Medicare, one of the \nmost successful programs ever developed in America, and turn it over to \nprivate insurance companies where CEOs now make millions. Under the \nRepublican plan, many seniors will have to choose between medication \nand food to get by, and seniors' out-of-pocket health costs will cost \nmore than double the present rate, to $12,500 a year. The Republicans \nwould hand seniors' health care over to insurance companies, where \ncomputers instead of doctors would decide which benefits they will \nreceive. The Republicans also want to reduce Federal Medicaid spending \nby half, taking away vital services such as nursing homes for seniors \nand health services for expectant mothers. All told, the tea party \nRepublican budget would rip away health care coverage from 50 million \nAmericans.\n  But health care for seniors and other Americans is not the only place \nRepublicans want to go to punish them. The House budget plan doesn't \njust protect the Bush tax cuts for the rich, it reduces them to even \nlower levels at the expense of working families.\n  Instead of more tax breaks for the wealthiest, we should be lifting \nup the foundation of our country--the middle class. In the past decade, \nthe average income of the bottom 90 percent of workers has declined \nwhile prices for everything escalates, and the top 1 percent saw \nincomes go up by $\\1/4\\ million each. Imagine. The average incomes of \nthe bottom 90 percent declined while the top 1 percent saw incomes go \nup by $\\1/4\\ million each.\n  This budget also cuts Pell grants which help reduce the cost of back-\nbreaking tuition for millions of college students. I never would have \nbeen able to attend Columbia University without government help from \nthe GI bill. It enabled me to cofound ADP, one of America's most \nsuccessful companies, employing over 40,000 people today.\n  In the post-World War II era, we created the ``greatest generation.'' \nI say invest more in our people so they can create the next ``greatest \ngeneration,'' which cannot be done without our help in education. We \nneed help for a more balanced approach to solving our fiscal problems, \nincluding asking the wealthy to carry their fair share of the load.\n  I was a CEO for many years. I learned that you can't create a great \ncompany or country without sufficient resources. This is no time, as we \nfight our way out of a recession, to penalize the middle class, the \nsenior citizens, or the young. This is the time to invest in tomorrow \nwithout penalizing those who pay the largest price now for their very \nexistence. Let those who can pay for the rebuilding of an America we \nall love. That is the way we ought to do it.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on this Ryan budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the ongoing \nbudget negotiations.\n  As a member of the Senate Budget Committee, I have jumped into this \ndebate head-on. But we are all here together. That is why I have asked \nthe Alaskans in my State and my communities all across the State to \nshare their ideas with me on how to cut the budget. I have put forward \na series of cuts and spending management programs from ideas from my \ncolleagues and my members throughout the State but also ideas I have \npicked up in my budget hearings. We know we are all going to feel the \npinch if we are serious about getting our budget and spending under \ncontrol, but I have made it crystal clear that I absolutely will not \nbalance the budget on the backs of seniors.\n  For me, the budget is a moral document. It reflects our values as a \nnation, and it demonstrates our commitment to supporting our elders and \nprotecting our children. It is the future pathway of our great country. \nBut the Republican House budget that has passed the House and is \nproposed today for us to vote on does not reflect these values. That is \nwhy Congressman Ryan received an earful from seniors when he went back \nhome to Wisconsin after rolling out his plan--his scheme, in my view--\nsetting us back decades. That is why voters in New York yesterday \nrejected Republicans and their extreme plan to eliminate Medicare as we \nknow it by electing a Democrat in a Republican district. I mention New \nYork not because this was a win for Democrats or a loss for Republicans \nbut because this was a win for our seniors and because the stakes are \ntoo high.\n  Americans all across the country are saying no to the current \nRepublican plan that could fail to automatically enroll our seniors in \nMedicare and instead force them to buy health coverage from a private \ninsurance company. And let me make it very clear on the private \ninsurance company. Medicare today, to administer, costs about 1.5 \npercent. So all of the rest of the money for Medicare goes to services, \nto programs to ensure health care for our seniors. If insurance \ncompanies got hold of this, their costs to administer would be 20 to 30 \npercent--clearly fewer services for seniors.\n  In Alaska, over the next 10 years, under this Republican House plan \nthat passed that is here in front of the Senate for us to vote on, it \nwill move the cost for Medicare for my constituents in Alaska from \n$5,000--their cost--in 10 years to over $10,000. On top of that, it \nwill force seniors to pay an average of $3,500 more for prescription \ndrugs over the next 10 years--again, adding about $8,500 in additional \nhealth care costs to seniors. At the same time, this budget they want \nus to approve--which, of course, I am not willing to--will give \nmillionaires another $1.2 trillion in additional reductions, at the \nsame time sticking it to our seniors. It will truly end Medicare as we \nknow it today.\n  In Alaska, our elders are revered. We respect their wisdom, and they \nguide our decisions. As a people, it is our duty to care for our elders \nas they grow older. The Republican plan, the Ryan budget, will cost, as \nI said, Alaska seniors dearly--thousands and thousands of dollars per \nyear more than they are paying today, seniors who are on fixed incomes. \nIn Alaska, we have one of the fastest growing senior populations in the \nNation by percent.\n  So I continue to look forward to working with my colleagues on the \nother side and my colleagues on this side to figure out how we are \ngoing to move forward on this budget, but let's not do it on the backs \nof seniors by throwing them over the ship and never looking back. \nSeniors paid into it, seniors expect it, and we have an obligation to \nensure they have the health care that ensures that they have a quality \nof life and live in dignity in their later years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lautenberg.) The Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, we are gathered here on the Senate \nfloor to face a very stark fact; that is, that\n\n[[Page S3331]]\n\nthe House Republican budget would end Medicare as we know it for future \ngenerations. The House Republican budget would increase costs for \ncurrent beneficiaries right away, and the House Republican budget would \ndo real damage to seniors across this country and in my home State of \nRhode Island.\n  With gas prices at near-record highs and unemployment numbers still \nin double digits, most folks are focused on making ends meet. They \ndeserve a budget that will improve the economic opportunity in our \ncountry, balance our budget, and maintain Medicare, Medicaid, and other \nprograms on which so many Americans rely. The House Republican budget \nfails every one of these tests. It ends Medicare, it lowers taxes for \nmost corporations and the most fortunate, who too often already pay \nlower tax rates than the average American, all while failing to balance \nthe budget.\n  The House Budget Committee chairman has claimed that ``our budget \nmakes no changes for those in or near retirement.'' This claim that \nthis budget resolution will not affect Americans who are already \nretired is simply flatout false. The House budget reopens the Medicare \nPart D doughnut hole that we closed in the reform bill. That will cost \nnearly 17,000 Rhode Island seniors, in 2012 alone, nearly $9.5 million \nout of pocket.\n  Seniors at the DaVinci Center in Providence, The Meadows in North \nSmithfield, and so many other places have gone without a cost-of-living \nadjustment in their Social Security benefits for 2 straight years even \nas costs have steadily risen at the pharmacy, at the grocery store, and \nat the gas pump. Taking away their prescription drug assistance, \ncharging them an additional $9.5 million hits them too hard and too \nsoon--in 2012, literally right away.\n  The Republican budget also ends Medicare as we know it for future \ngenerations. Planning to retire in 11 years? No Medicare. You instead \nwill be forced to buy private health insurance from insurance companies \nstanding between you and your doctors instead of the reliable, \naffordable insurance provided by Medicare.\n\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated this would \ndouble what retirees would pay out of pocket under the current system--\nmore than $6,000 extra for retirees.\n  The Republican attack on Medicare overlooks a basic fact--that all \nhealth care costs are skyrocketing, irrespective of who the insurer is. \nRecently, Defense Secretary Gates said, ``Everybody knows that we are \nbeing eaten alive by health care.'' There is a cost problem in health \ncare, but attacking Medicare fundamentally misdiagnoses the problem. \nBut that is another speech.\n  I recently held an official Senate Aging Committee hearing at the \nJohnston Senior Center in Rhode Island to give Rhode Islanders the \nchance to make their voices heard. Audrey Brett, a Middletown resident \nwho relies on Social Security and Medicare, said this:\n\n       For all those Americans who worked, paid their taxes, added \n     to the betterment of the country, served in military and \n     civil service--we cannot let them live and die in poverty. We \n     owe them their final days of security and dignity.\n\n  Audrey is right. But the Republican budget gets rid of that promise \nof security and dignity contained in Medicare. Medicare as we know it \nis lost. Here is what is protected: low taxes for the superrich, who \nalready pay lower tax rates than the average taxpaying American \nfamily--protected; low taxes for many large corporations, which for too \nlong have been gaming the system and paying too little--protected. And \nremember, the Republicans just voted last week to protect Big Oil tax \nsubsidies.\n  Wreck Medicare but protect those tax cuts and subsidies. Those are \nnot America's priorities. Let's put real priorities first--Medicare and \nallowing our seniors to enjoy a stable and dignified retirement.\n  I see the majority leader on the floor. I yield back the remainder of \nmy time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we have 5 \nminutes. I will take that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the vote we are going to have shortly is \nabout more than just public policy; it is about priorities, about \nwhether we hold fast to our values or break our promises.\n  There is a lot wrong with the House Republican budget on which \nSenators are about to cast their vote. But the most irresponsible and \nindefensible is a radical plan to end Medicare as we have known it. \nDoing so would break a solemn promise between our society and our \nseniors. It is a promise that for more than four decades has saved \nseniors from poverty, illness, and worse.\n  The promise of Medicare is this: If you work hard and contribute, \nAmerica will make sure you are protected in your golden years from the \nhardships of affording health care. The Republican budget would break \nthis promise. It would make life significantly more difficult and \npainful for America's seniors. It is as simple and as serious as that.\n  The Republican plan would kill Medicare. Even the conservative Wall \nStreet Journal admitted this, even though most Republican U.S. Senators \nstill refuse to face this reality; that is, as the Wall Street Journal \nsaid, the Republican plan would kill Medicare.\n  Here is what it would do. It would turn over seniors' health to \nprofit-hungry insurance companies. It would let bureaucrats decide what \ntests and treatments seniors get. It would ask seniors to pay more for \ntheir benefits, for their health care, charging every senior $6,000 \nmore every year in exchange for fewer benefits. That is a bad deal all \naround.\n  Those voting for this Republican plan would be forcing seniors in \nNevada to pay more than twice as much as they pay today in out-of-\npocket costs. Sadly, that is just not a Nevada problem, it is an Alaska \nproblem, too, and a problem that faces every State in the Union--$6,000 \nmore for every senior.\n  Those voting for the Republican plan to kill Medicare would be voting \nto reopen the doughnut hole we closed to help seniors afford expensive \nprescription drugs. Opening the doughnut hole would send drug prices \nliterally through the roof, costing, for example, 27,000 seniors in \nNevada and every other State thousands of dollars more between now and \nthe year 2020.\n  Those voting for the Republican plan to kill Medicare would also be \nforcing our seniors to pay almost a million dollars more for annual \nwellness visits that we put in our health care bill, and it would make \nit harder for seniors to access nursing home and long-term care. It \nwould make at least 34 million more Americans uninsured.\n  The Republican plan to kill Medicare was written in the name of \nsaving money. Listen to this, Mr. President. It costs seniors so much \nmoney that it doesn't do anything they said it would do. One study \nfound that seniors would spend $14 more for every dollar the government \nsaves. That is 14 to 1 in the wrong direction. That is not effective \neconomics anyplace. It is certainly not worth endangering the health of \nour seniors.\n  The Republican plan is a plan that tries to balance the budget \nliterally on the backs of America's seniors. This is a clear window \ninto the other party's priorities, though. While it asks seniors to pay \nmore and more, it allows the wealthiest to pay less and less. It gives \neven more tax breaks to those who need it the least--oil companies, \nbillionaires, and multinational companies that ship jobs overseas.\n  It comes down to this: The Republican plan to kill Medicare is a plan \nto make the rich richer and the sick sicker. A well-worn metaphor \ncharacterizes the Senate as a saucer, a deliberative body that cools \nthe intense heat and occasional zeal of the House of Representatives. \nIn voting down the radical Republican House-passed plan in Medicare, \nand keeping our priorities straight, and keeping our promise to our \nseniors, we are bringing that image to life that our Founding Fathers \nhad of this great body, the United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/25/senate-section/article/S3331-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3331-S3332]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n ESTABLISHING THE BUDGET FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2012--\n                           MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for allowing \nus to have a few remarks at this time, after the process has been \ncompleted tonight.\n  The Senate has not fulfilled its responsibility. The United States \nCode that we passed, Congress passed, requires that there be a budget. \nIt requires that Congress commence marking up the budget in the Budget \nCommittee, as the Presiding Officer knows, by April 1, and a concurrent \nresolution be passed by April 15, setting forth what the Congress \nauthorizes to be spent in the next year.\n  If anybody attempts to spend above that amount, the Budget Act allows \na point of order to be raised, and it would require 60 votes to go \nabove that level. So a budget says what we want to spend and makes it \ndifficult for anybody to spend more. It is what we do in our \nhouseholds, it is what our cities and counties do, it is what our State \ngovernments do.\n  I know Senator Manchin, the Presiding Officer, as a Governor, he had \nto deal with his tough budget situation. My Governor, Governor Bentley, \njust announced he is prorating 15 percent of the discretionary spending \nfor the rest of the year.\n  We are not talking about those kinds of cuts this year in Washington. \nI was in Estonia, near the Soviet Union on the Baltic Sea, and the \nproud Estonians had a larger deficit, larger economic decline than we \ndid. The Estonians told us that every Cabinet official took a 40-\npercent pay cut, every employee took 10 to 20. The health system, one \nsaid: My wife is a doctor. She is very unhappy. But they intend to \ncomplete the recovery in Estonia without adding to the debt at all. \nTheir debt to GDP is 7 percent.\n  By September 30 of this year, our debt-to-gross domestic product will \ntotal 100 percent, and according to the Rogoff-Reinhart study, a great \nauthoritative study that has gained a great deal of applause, when the \ndebt amounts to 90 percent of GDP, economic growth declines by 1 \npercent.\n  A 1-percent decline in GDP--the experts tell us--is the equivalent of \n1 million jobs. So we will be in a position where, because of the debt \nwe have accumulated, the economy will grow 1 percent less and we could \nhave 1 million less jobs.\n  We do not know what our economic growth might be. It looks like it \ncould be less than 2 percent. We are talking about a huge difference in \nwhat our economic growth could be this year. Maybe it will be 3. But if \nit is 3, it would have been 4. If it was 4, it would have been 5. If it \nis 3, it would be 2 because of this debt.\n  So these are the circumstances we are dealing with. Every witness has \ntold us we need to do something about it. The Nation is in a most \nserious fix. So there has been a decision made by the leadership of the \nSenate, the Democratic leadership of the Senate, not to produce a \nbudget.\n  It was interesting, when the President's budget was brought up, every \nsingle Member of the Senate--Republicans and Democrats--voted no. We \ncould say: Why did they do that? Well, the President's budget deserved \nnot a single vote. Considering the severe, serious financial condition \nwe are in, the President's budget was the most irresponsible budget \nthat has ever been presented to Congress. It is stunningly short of \nanything necessary.\n  Erskine Bowles, the man President Obama appointed to head the fiscal \ncommission, said the President's budget was nowhere close to where they \nwill have to go to avoid our fiscal nightmare--nowhere close. But our \ncolleagues, what have they done? They complained about the Ryan budget. \nThey vote against their own, and they vote against any other budget. \nThey vote against the Ryan budget saying it is going to eliminate your \nMedicare, and you will not receive your Medicare because of Paul Ryan \nand the mean Republicans.\n  But the Ryan budget made no change in Medicare in the 10 years in the \nRyan plan at all, except canceled the President's health care bill and \nsaved hundreds of billions of dollars. What it did was to propose in \nthe future that we develop a new way of administering Medicare that \nwould save money and make it more responsible to individual needs.\n  We refused to even move to that legislation, to discuss it, and to \nanalyze whether it should be done that way or whether it could be done \nanother way. But nobody denies that this budget, that any budget we \npass, must confront our entitlement programs. Surely, they do not. So \nwhatever you do, you are attacked by it. Our majority leader, whom I \nadmire and enjoy working with, was quite frank. He said: It would be \nfoolish for us to pass a budget. He did not mean it would be foolish \nfor America. He did not mean it would be foolish for the public \ninterest. He did not mean it would be foolish in terms of containing \nthe reckless spending and dangerous path we are on. He meant it would \nbe foolish politically because he had a plan, and the plan was to \nattack the people who had the courage, the gumption, and the hard work \nto produce a budget dealing with the long-term fiscal challenges of \nAmerica: Paul Ryan and his Budget Committee, wants to attack them, \nbring up their budget and vote it down, and not produce anything in \nresponse.\n  I believe that is an embarrassment to the Senate. It is an utter \nfailure to meet our statutory obligation. More importantly, it is a \nfailure to meet our moral obligation. Many have said:\n\n[[Page S3334]]\n\nWell, we need to do something because we are putting debt on our \nchildren and grandchildren. That is absolutely true. But we have been \ntold by numerous experts, including Mr. Bowles, who chaired the debt \ncommission, that we could be facing a debt crisis in 2 years, give or \ntake a little bit. That was his opinion.\n  His cochairman, Alan Simpson, said it could be 1 year. So we could \nhave another debt financial crisis that could put us back into a \nrecession as a result of our fiscal irresponsibility as soon as 2 \nyears, according to Erskine Bowles--accomplished businessman, \nsuccessful businessman, President Clinton's Chief of Staff, chosen by \nPresident Obama to head the Commission. That is what he told us in the \nBudget Committee just a few weeks ago.\n  How serious is it? Our highway spending this year is about $40 \nbillion. Last year, this country spent, in interest on our debt, $200-\nplus billion, five times the highway bill, just for example, and we \nneed to do something about our infrastructure and highways in America. \nI am very worried about it.\n  I indicated that, just for example, the highway budget is about $40 \nbillion. The Federal Department of Education is about $70 billion. But \nwe spent last year in interest payments on the debt that we have \naccumulated, over $200 billion.\n  The President submitted his budget. It was favorably commented on by \nDemocratic colleagues and represented what appears to be, I guess, the \nmainstream Democratic view--although I am pleased to see nobody voted \nfor it.\n  But according to the Congressional Budget Office, which has analyzed \nthe budget the President submitted to us, it would result in an \ninterest payment, in the 10th year, of $940 billion.\n  That is an amount of money that exceeds our imagination. It is larger \nthan the Defense Department budget. It is larger than Medicare. It is \nlarger than Medicaid. It is the fastest growing item in our entire \nbudget. And that assumes a slight increase but modest interest rate, \nbelow the 6-percent historical average. So if interest rates were to go \nup faster--and that is quite possible--instead of $940 billion, we \ncould have trillion-dollar-plus interest payments every year, crowding \nout the ability of the Education Department, Transportation Department, \nNOAA, the EPA, and every other agency in government to get funds. We \nwill crowd out that spending by placing an annual burden on our people \nof $940 billion a year. It is this trend and this path that is \nunsustainable. We have been told that.\n  I just want to repeat what happened just a few moments ago. What \nhappened? Four measures were brought up by the majority, and they were \nbrought up with the full knowledge that nothing would happen. There \nwere several hours of debate. We voted on four tremendously important \nitems, four budgets for the United States of America, with no real \nability to discuss each one of them in any depth at all. It was a \npolitical exercise. The majority leader said it would be ``foolish'' \nfor us to pass a budget. In other words, it is foolish for the \nDemocratic majority to commit themselves to any plan for the future of \nAmerica. It was an avoidance of responsibility. They would not even \nvote for the President's budget because if they did, they would be \nresponsible for it.\n  What they did was attack the one group of people who have done the \nright thing, the responsible thing, and that is to produce a historic \nbudget that would basically solve our debt problem--it didn't \noverreach--and that is the House budget. It was long term, short term, \nand it dealt with entitlements, discretionary spending, and taxes. It \nwas a thoughtful, important, historic budget. The Chicago Tribune \npraised it. The Wall Street Journal praised it. The fiscal commission \nchairmen, Bowles and Simpson, praised it for its courage, its \nintegrity, its lack of gimmicks, and for being honest.\n  Do you know what they said. They said, again, that anyone who opposes \nthe Ryan budget or opposes any one of the budgets, if you don't like \nit, you should put forth your plan. Has the leadership in the Senate \nproposed any plan? In a shocking display of irresponsibility--I don't \nhave words to describe the degree of irresponsibility that I think has \nbeen shown here tonight--they have said: We are not going to produce \nanything. We are just going to attack what you have done.\n  Many of our colleagues have said we have to deal with entitlements \nand confront the surging debt caused thereby; that Medicare and Social \nSecurity are in danger and they could go belly-up. We have to change \nwhat we are doing. The House wrestled with that. It wasn't within that \n10-year window. Everybody who is 55 and above and everybody who is on \nMedicare today would have no change--none. Yet we have people going \naround telling our seniors that this Ryan House budget would change \ntheir Social Security and they would not get it. In fact, it would save \nthe Social Security Program, put it on a sound basis, and guarantee \nthat people now receiving it and people over 55 who are soon to be \nreceiving it would have no change whatsoever. In fact, in some ways, it \nwould strengthen it for them. This is not correct.\n  Well, do we have a better plan? What about the Becerra rule? I \nsuppose that is Congressman Xavier Becerra they named that for, a \nDemocratic Congressman from Los Angeles. Did they produce anything they \nthink is better? Do they have any plans to change the debt course we \nare on? Zero, nada.\n  I really believe this is not the responsible way to deal with the \nchallenges this country faces. I am deeply disappointed. The matter is \nnot going away. As ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, I feel a \ngreat sense of responsibility to defend the legally required processes \nof a Budget Act. What kind of ranking member or member of the Budget \nCommittee would I be if I sat by and acknowledged and accepted these \nfour votes as somehow disposing of the situation?\n  What should happen? What should have happened is that by April 1, the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Conrad, with whom I enjoyed \nworking this year, should have produced a chairman's mark, and it \nshould have gone to the Budget Committee, and we would have had an \nopportunity to debate and vote on that and discuss all the issues \nrelevant to getting our country on a fine, sound, fiscal path. But I \nthink the majority leader decided that was not a good path.\n  Senator Conrad, if you read the newspapers, apparently brought up his \nbudget, his proposal to the Democratic conference, and it received a \nchilly reception, according to the newspapers. Senator Conrad has said \nrepeatedly that he knows we are on an unsustainable path. He said once \nthat we are heading to the wall at warp speed. We have to change, he \nsaid, because we are on an unsustainable path. But they thought, I \nsuppose, he was too frugal, and so apparently, according to the papers, \nhe came back the next week with a budget that Senator Sanders and some \nof the others apparently blessed. We thought we were going to have a \nmarkup, maybe, and he would bring that forward. They said publicly: We \nhave a budget, and we have basically agreed on a budget, but we are \njust not bringing it forward. But it should have been brought forward \nto committee, marked up, passed out of committee, and brought to the \nfloor.\n  It won't pass the committee, they say. What do you mean? We have to \npass a budget. The Budget Act provides that it can't be filibustered. \nIt allows the budget to be passed with a simple majority. The Democrats \nhave a majority in the committee. They can pass a budget just like they \nlike it. Whatever they like, they could vote to pass it. Why not? Well, \nI think it is because they thought it would be foolish politically for \nthem to commit themselves to any plan that dealt with taxes, with \nspending, with the debt. They didn't want to commit themselves. They \ndecided that the smart thing to do would be to attack the foolish \nRepublicans, who actually had the responsibility and the integrity and \nthe sense of duty to lay out a plan for this country's financial \nfuture.\n  Make no mistake about it, a budget is a serious matter. It sets forth \nyour vision for America, how big you would like the government to be, \nhow much tax you want to impose, how much spending you want to incur \nand how much debt you would like to incur, and it sets it forth before \nthe whole world. We were waiting to see--the House had done their \nduty--what will the Senate do? Nothing.\n  I don't think that is responsible. I don't believe it is acceptable. \nI don't accept it. I am going to continue to resist this kind of no-\naction policy.\n\n[[Page S3335]]\n\n  I hope the American people will register their complaints and \nconcerns with their Senators and demand that this Senate do its duty to \nset forth a budget that can help contain spending in America and put us \non a path to financial stability and allow our economy to begin to grow \nat a robust rate because I truly believe the debt and the interest we \npay is weakening our economy, as the expert economists have told us.\n  Mr. President, we can't quit now. We are not going to quit now. We \nare going to keep pushing for the kind of budget that will allow us to \nput this country on a sound path. I am deeply disappointed that we have \ntotally shortcut the entire process. We have entirely avoided the \nresponsibility to cast a serious vote on a budget, bring one up where \nwe have the opportunity to debate and amend it and calculate out and \nstudy and make sure there are no gimmicks in there and hidden \nmanipulations that hide the way the numbers appear. We have seen that \ntoo often. In fact, if the American people knew the extent to which \nthis Congress, year after year, has manipulated the numbers to hide the \nserious, irresponsible spending programs we are executing, they would \nbe more angry with us than they are, and 70 percent of Americans think \nthis country is on the wrong track. Fundamentally, I believe that is \nbased on the fact that they think we are spending recklessly, running \nup too much debt, and endangering the future health and welfare of \ngenerations to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am submitting my views today \nabout the need to enact a fiscally responsible federal budget for \nfiscal year 2012.\n  The April 15 statutory deadline for Congress to complete its annual \nbudget resolution was over a month ago. An annual budget resolution is \nessential for controlling spending, for guiding the annual \nappropriations process, and for setting national spending priorities.\n  For the past 2 years, the Senate has failed to meet this critical \ndeadline. During that time, the U.S. has borrowed an additional $3.2 \ntrillion--more than $100 billion a month until the $14.29 trillion debt \nceiling was reached on May 16.\n  For the first 7 months of the 2011 fiscal year, the budget deficit \nwas a record $871 billion--$71 billion higher than it was at the same \npoint in fiscal year 2010. During the same period, income tax revenues \nincreased by $110 billion, or 9.1 percent.\n  The problem isn't that Americans are taxed too little; Federal \ndeficits are out-of-control because government is spending too much.\n  Not passing a budget, not bringing forward even a budget proposal, \ntakes us down a path that ends in Social Security and Medicare \nbankruptcy, harms our national security, and passes the bill for \ncurrent fiscal irresponsibility onto our children and grandchildren.\n  We are just 4\\1/2\\ months from the beginning of fiscal year 2012. \nUnless we pass a budget and approve the individual spending measures \nthat are required to fund government operations, we will return to \nstopgap continuing resolutions and to recurring threat of government \nshutdowns.\n  Yesterday, I joined all 46 of my Republican colleagues in a letter to \nthe Senate majority leader that urges him to initiate the steps that \nmust be taken for the Senate to debate, vote, and produce a responsible \nFederal budget for the next fiscal year.\n  As the majority leader knows, the procedural votes he has scheduled \nwill not advance us toward that goal. These votes are intended only to \nscore political points.\n  Today I will be in Dallas to attend my daughter's graduation from \nlower school to middle school. This will prevent me from being present \nfor votes on the motions to proceed on four budget proposals. My \nabsence for these procedural votes will not affect the outcomes. But I \nwanted to make known my position in advance of these votes.\n  A serious attempt to move a fiscal year 2012 budget forward would be \na bipartisan effort that would enable us to debate, amend, and move \nforward a plan for long-term deficit reduction, while funding essential \ngovernment programs and services. I look forward to a real debate, open \namendments, and a vote on a serious budget that will dramatically bring \ndown the outstanding debt our country has accumulated. Unfortunately, \nthat opportunity is not going to be presented to the Senate today.\n  I would vote in favor of the motions to proceed on the three \nRepublican-originated budget proposals before the Senate: the so-called \nRyan budget that has been approved by the House of Representatives, as \nwell as alternative plans put forward by Senator Toomey and Senator \nPaul.\n  Each of these proposals would put the Federal Government on a \nmultiyear glide path to a balanced Federal budget. Each proposal would \ngo about achieving this crucial goal by reducing Federal spending, not \nby raising taxes, and could be a constructive starting point for Senate \ndebate and consideration of amendments. I do not agree with parts of \neach proposal. But if we had an open amendment process we could attempt \nto improve each proposal, while preserving the best parts.\n  I could not vote for the motion to proceed to consideration of the \nPresident's fiscal year 2012 budget. Unlike the Republican proposals, \nthe President's fiscal year 2012 budget proposes to add $8.7 trillion \nin new spending and $1.26 trillion in net new taxes over the next \ndecade, while only projecting $1.1 trillion in savings over 10 years.\n  Rather than balancing the Federal budget, the President's budget plan \nwould add several trillion dollars more to the national debt. That \nwould be a catastrophe by any standard. But the reality of the \nPresident's budget would be much worse. In the President's budget a \n$1.1 trillion deficit was projected for the current fiscal year. But we \nare instead headed for a $1.4 trillion shortfall.\n  The President subsequently signaled understanding that his proposed \nbudget falls short by releasing a new deficit reduction proposal on \nApril 13. The President's new plan targets $4 trillion in deficit \nreduction in 12 years--through tax increases and a new ``debt \nfailsafe'' trigger that would include cuts to spending through the tax \ncode--a new euphemism for tax increases.\n  It is our responsibility to the country to act on establishing \nconstraints on federal spending and producing a budget blueprint. My \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle have chosen not to prepare \nnor advance a fiscal year 2012 budget resolution forward, except to say \nrepeatedly that higher taxes are essential. In my estimation, raising \ntaxes in a struggling economy will stifle job creation and further \ndelay recovery from a devastating, long-lasting recession.\n  We must make bold cuts in spending where we can. We should also take \nsteps to assure the long-term safety and soundness of Social Security \nand Medicare, for current retirees and for today's workers who will \nneed to depend on benefits later. We must also carefully prioritize \ninvestment and research in areas of strategic national importance.\n  Just as American families and small businesses across the Nation set \ntheir spending priorities so Congress is expected to do the same. As a \nnation, we have reached a serious, fiscal crisis. It is time to start \nmaking the necessary and difficult decisions for the future of our \ncountry.\n\n\n                            H. Con. Res. 34\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, for me, Medicare is not a political talking \npoint. My parents immigrated to the United States in the late 1950s. \nThey worked hard for over 40 years to provide their children the chance \nto do all the things they themselves could not. But they never made \nmuch money. As a result, they retired with precious little in savings. \nMedicare was and is the only way they could access health care.\n  When my father got sick, Medicare paid for his numerous hospital \nstays. And as he reached the end of life, Medicare allowed him to die \nwith dignity by paying for his hospice care.\n  Like most 80-year-olds my mother has several age-related ailments. \nWithout the access to quality health care that Medicare pays for, I \ncannot imagine what life would be like for her.\n  America needs Medicare. We need it to continue without any benefit \nreductions for those like my mother currently in the system. And we \nneed it to survive for my generation and my children's generation.\n  But Medicare is going bankrupt. Anyone who says it is not is simply\n\n[[Page S3336]]\n\nlying. And anyone who is in favor of doing nothing to deal with this \nfact is in favor of bankrupting it.\n  Medicare will go broke in as little as 9 years. No one likes this \nnews, but it is the undeniable truth. And the sooner we begin to deal \nwith it, the better off we are all going to be.\n  My goals are simple. First, I will not support any plan that changes \nMedicare for people like my mother who are currently on the plan. We \ncannot ask seniors to go out and get a job to pay for their health \ncare.\n  Second, any solution must solve the problem. We need to save \nMedicare, not simply delay its bankruptcy.\n  And third, any solution cannot hurt economic growth. At a time of \nhigh unemployment, Americans cannot afford to pay more taxes.\n  I will support any serious plan that accomplishes these three things. \nIt does not matter to me if it comes from a Democrat or a Republican. \nSaving Medicare is more important than partisan politics.\n  House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan has offered a plan. I \nsupport H. Con. Res. 34 because, right now, it is the only plan out \nthere that helps save Medicare.\n  Democrats oppose this plan. Fine. But, if they have a better way to \nsave Medicare, what are they waiting for to show us? What is their plan \nto save Medicare? Either show us how Medicare survives without any \nchanges or show us what changes you propose we make. Anyone who \nsupports doing nothing on Medicare is a supporter of bankrupting \nMedicare.\n  Where is the House Democrat plan to save Medicare?\n  Where is the Senate Democrat plan to save Medicare?\n  Where is President Obama's plan to save Medicare?\n  They have no plan to save Medicare, and they do not plan to offer \none. They have decided that winning their next election is more \nimportant than saving Medicare for my mother and retirees like her.\n  I have been in the Senate just long enough to be disgusted by the \nreality that Washington has too many people who think their personal \npolitical careers are more important than our country's future.\n  Maybe the Democrats' strategy to use Medicare as a political weapon \nwill work. Maybe not offering their own plan to save Medicare will help \nthem win seats in Congress and reelect the President. Maybe it is great \nfor the Democrat Party.\n  But it is terrible for people like my mother, and it is terrible for \nAmerica.\n  Medicare is going bankrupt. If something does not happen soon, in \njust a few years whoever is in charge in Washington will have to go to \npeople like my mother and tell them we can no longer afford to continue \nproviding her with the same Medicare she is used to.\n  We have always had intense partisan politics in America. But \nthroughout our history, on issues of generational importance, our \nleaders have agreed to put aside politics for the sake of our country. \nShouldn't saving Medicare be that kind of issue?\n  I am ready to work with anyone in Washington who is serious about \nsaving Medicare. I am open to any serious solutions they have.\n  We are running out of time to save Medicare for our parents and \nsecure it for our children. If we fail, history will never forgive us.\n\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 20\n\n  Mr. President, I came here to support budgets that make tough \nspending reductions, save our safety net programs, and preserve our \ncommitment to protecting Americans at home and abroad. In the midst of \nthis fiscal crisis, there should be no sacred cows in the Federal \nbudget, but we also can't walk away from our commitments abroad. \nEspecially in this time of great upheaval around the world, and as \nAmerica's enemies dream of a Greece-like day of reckoning that will \nleave us no choice but to abandon our allies around the world, I simply \ncannot support a budget that would make the world a less safe place \nbecause the United States' role in it is diminished.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/25/senate-section/article/S3336-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MARY JANE McCARTHY\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, it is my very great pleasure to pay \ntribute to one of the great treasures of the Senate, Mr. Lloyd Ator. \nLloyd is retiring after 17 years as the legislative counsel for the \nCommerce Committee, and 11 years in the Senate Legislative Counsel's \nOffice. Lloyd has been a truly outstanding public servant, and his \nservice has made our country a better place.\n  Given the breadth of issues within the committee's jurisdiction, the \nlegislative counsel is required to be something of a Renaissance man. \nFortunately, that is a perfect description of Lloyd. He has been \nrequired to know the underlying law in so many areas, from the \nOlympics, to daylight savings time, railroad rates, aviation security \nscreening, cellphone use, science standards, fisheries management, \nmaritime liability, commercial privacy, and satellites. To draft \nconcise, thoughtful, and technically accurate bills on this range of \nissues, as Lloyd has done, requires unparalleled skill, expertise and \ndedication. Lloyd is also a parliamentary expert and served as an \noutstanding resource for committee members. Even when every other \ncommittee did away with their own legislative counsels, the Commerce \nCommittee was determined to keep Lloyd, knowing that his unique \ncapabilities made him our ``secret weapon.''\n  Not only is Lloyd an experienced drafter, he is a man of unflagging \nspirit. One of Lloyd's most remarkable qualities is his unwavering \npatience. No matter how many times he was asked to rewrite an amendment \nor edit a draft, he never once rolled his eyes or expressed \nfrustration. He continually responded calmly and patiently, offering a \nword of humor at just the right moment. His humorous comments on drafts \nof bills are legendary on the committee.\n  Lloyd has become a bulwark on the committee, respected by colleagues \nand Members on both sides of the aisle. As a trusted adviser, he has \nalways maintained the utmost level of confidentiality, even while \ndrafting competing bills. Despite this position of privileged \nknowledge, Lloyd has always remained discreet and has earned the \nrespect of all with whom he has worked. Lloyd is someone that both the \nMembers and the Commerce staff have come to rely on, time after time. \nIt has been largely through Lloyd's hard work, patience, and extensive \nlegislative knowledge that the Commerce Committee has been able to \nproduce such high quality legislation for the past 17 years. He has \nplayed an important role in every major piece of legislation the \ncommittee has considered for the past decade and at the close of the \nlast century.\n  Lloyd is an incredibly humble man and has never been one to seek \nrecognition, which is part of why I am so pleased to honor him today. \nLloyd's retirement signifies a great loss to the committee and to the \nSenate. As sad as we are to see him go, I know that he is looking \nforward to spending more time with his family, his dog, and on many \nmore trips to France. It is with sincere thanks from a grateful \ncommittee that I wish him nothing but the best in the\n\n[[Page S3337]]\n\nyears to come. We have all been made better by his contribution, his \npresence, and his example. He is an institution and his extraordinary \nservice is as much a part of Commerce Committee lore as the Enron \ninvestigation or the deregulation of telecom. He is an institution we \nare extremely proud of and will always honor. We will strive to live up \nto his example.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/25/senate-section/article/S3337-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               TRIBUTE TO SAUL MARTINEZ ELEMENTARY SCHOOL\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nhonor students, teachers, administrators, librarians, and parents from \nSaul Martinez Elementary School in Mecca, CA, for taking a stand to \nresolve a serious pollution problem the community was facing. Together, \nthey have demonstrated how important it is to speak up and be heard to \nmake government officials aware of vital issues that affect their \ncommunity.\n  Like all Americans, the residents of Mecca, CA, have the right to \nexpect that the air they breathe is clean, and that the Federal and \nState government will enforce the Nation's environmental laws to \nprotect them from dangerous pollution. Unfortunately, some residents in \nMecca became sick from overpowering air pollution coming from a nearby \nwaste recycling facility. The noxious odors posed a public health risk \nto the two schools located near the site, Saul Martinez Elementary \nSchool and Mecca Elementary School.\n  I became involved because local citizens, including teachers and \nstudents at the two schools, spoke out about the public health threat \nin Mecca that needed to be addressed immediately.

A bill to improve education, employment, independent living \nservices, and health care for veterans, to improve assistance for \nhomeless veterans, and to improve the administration of the Department \nof Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, we all have a shared commitment to our \nNation's veterans. That shared commitment is reflected in many of the \nprograms that are supported by yourself and my other colleagues in this \nbody every year. I deeply respect the knowledge and dedication that my \nfellow Senators have brought to this critical issue. Each of my \ncolleagues, almost without exception, has supported measures that have \nhelped our veterans over the years.\n  I rise to introduce my first piece of legislation, a bill to help our \nNation's veterans.\n  Our Nation must keep faith with the men and women who have served and \nsacrificed for our freedom. Unfortunately, and unconscionably, America \nis still failing them and their families by tolerating unemployment, \nhomelessness, and inadequate health care. We must renew our commitment \nto the more than 250,000 veterans in Connecticut and 22 million across \nthe country to ensure that no veteran is left behind.\n  Our commitment to veterans must be unwavering. Despite our best \nintentions, we fail all too often to accord our veterans the support \nthey have earned. Unfortunately, according to the Department of \nVeterans Affairs, more than 76,000 veterans are homeless on any given \nnight and nearly twice that number will be homeless at some point \nduring the year. The unemployment rate among veterans has doubled over \nthe past 3 years. Twenty-seven percent of veterans in their early \ntwenties are unemployed. That number is almost twice the unemployment \nrate of their peers who have not served in the military. The Bureau of \nLabor Statistics recently reported that unemployment for veterans who \nserved their country after September 2001 to be 11.5 percent, again, a \nfigure far higher than the national unemployment rate.\n  Twenty percent of Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans are estimated to \nsuffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. When veterans return home, \nthey must wait at least half a year, on average, for a claims decision \nby the Department of Veterans Affairs before they can receive benefits. \nThose numbers are simply unacceptable. As I speak today, America's \nlongest war continues, with less than 1 percent of the Nation in \nuniform. Never in the history of the country have so few fought for so \nlong, at such great personal cost and sacrifice.\n  Under the leadership of Secretary Shinseki, the Department of \nVeterans Affairs has taken strong steps toward the goal of building a \n21st century system that supports caregivers of seriously injured Iraq \nand Afghanistan veterans, improving services to women veterans, \nexpanding the availability of health care, and preventing veteran \nhomelessness.\n  Gaps in the system remain, and they are debilitating, destructive, \nand devastating for many veterans. We can do better and we must do \nmore. The legislation I introduce today is entitled Honoring All \nVeterans Act of 2011. Its 16 comprehensive provisions are only the \nfirst phase of my efforts.\n  This legislative proposal is a comprehensive package but only an \nopening salvo in a sustained, unceasing campaign to ensure that no \nveteran is left behind. It is a downpayment on a larger debt. The goal \nis to give all veterans the homecoming and the services they need and \ndeserve. Our military men and women have kept their promise to serve \nand sacrifice for this country, and we must now keep faith with them. \nOur commitment to veterans should reflect the depth of their sacrifice. \nThis measure is entitled Honoring All Veterans Act because all veterans \nare brave service men and women, serving today in places we can barely \npronounce the names of. They are deployed around the globe, and they \ndeserve to be honored for defending our freedom and democracy. We must \nhonor that service not only in words but in deed.\n  This legislation comes from veterans and their families--seeing and \nhearing their struggles and dreams, their achievements and defeats as I \nhave worked for them during my 20 years as attorney general and 4-plus \nmonths as a Senator.\n  In the VFW and American Legion halls, in living rooms, in school \nauditoriums, and in countless gatherings across the State of \nConnecticut, I have been privileged to listen and learn from veterans \nand their families who have shared their personal stories and insights.\n  This legislation simply continues the work I have done as attorney \ngeneral. I worked to make the Department of Defense release information \non those who may have been improperly separated from military service, \nand urged the Department of Veterans Affairs to update its obsolete \ndatabase systems that were preventing tens of thousands of disabled \nveterans from obtaining deserved tax benefits. In 2007, I worked with \nthe Connecticut congressional delegation to make the Department of \nDefense provide accurate information about educational benefits to \nveterans. I have fought for them individually when they encountered \nbureaucratic resistance and red tape from an unresponsive system. I am \nproud of that work and proud, most important, of my partnership with \nveterans in Connecticut in proposing this legislation. My goal then, \nand it has been continuously, is to keep faith with our veterans, to \nhonor our promises to them.\n  This Honoring All Veterans Act of 2011 will address four key areas: \nfirst, expanding job opportunities for veterans; second, assisting \nhomeless veterans; third, improving veterans health care, with a \nspecial emphasis on mental health services; fourth, modernizing the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs.\n\n  On expanding job opportunities to honor all veterans and give them \nthe welcome home they deserve, we need to focus first on jobs. Like all \nAmericans, veterans are striving to provide for their families and \nparticipate in the economic recovery to find jobs in our slowly \nrecovering economy. Good jobs require education and training, as well\n\n[[Page S3342]]\n\nas independent living services for veterans. Our Nation has done much \nto address this issue, such as the expanded post-9/11 GI bill, but gaps \nin the system remain. They are all too glaring. My legislation will \nexpand job opportunities in five significant ways.\n  First, the legislation raises the statutory cap for the Vocational \nRehabilitation and Employment Independent Living Program to welcome \nhundreds of additional veterans. This vital program helps veterans with \nsevere service-connected disabilities, enabling them to live \nindependently. It helps veterans with those kinds of disabilities to \nparticipate in family and community life and increases their potential \nto return to work. There is a strong case for removing the cap on \nparticipation in the program. I would like to recognize the \ndistinguished junior Senator from Hawaii for the work that he has done \nin this regard. I hope that my legislation will ensure the program can \ncontinue to assist veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan, \nwhile Congress works to find funding to remove the cap completely.\n  Second, the legislation authorizes veterans to reuse the Department \nof Defense Transition Assistance Program, known as TAP, and meet with \ncounselors at any military installation for up to 1 year after their \nseparation. This program was developed to assist military personnel \nleaving the service with information about jobs, education, and career \ndevelopment. Veterans returning to Connecticut wishing to participate \nagain in the Transition Assistance Program should have that opportunity \nto participate for a second time, maybe even a third time. Coming back \nfrom deployment, servicemembers are often focused on other important \naspects of the transition process, rather than how to find a job. They \nmay have never written a resume before or attended a job interview. \nHaving started the job search they have specific areas where they \nrealize they need help. I discussed this idea at a recent Senate Armed \nServices Committee hearing with the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for \nManpower and Reserve Affairs. He testified that the military is right \nnow in the process of redesigning the TAP program. I am going to work \ntoward having this provision included in the redesign of the TAP \nprogram so that TAP continues to be an opportunity once a servicemember \nreturns home.\n  Third, the legislation authorizes a study of how best to ensure that \ncivilian employers and educational institutions recognize veterans' \nmilitary training. The military recruits the most talented men and \nwomen in America to serve, and then it invests heavily in their \nprofessional development. Yet when they trade their uniforms in for \ncivilian clothes, employers and others such as professional accrediting \norganizations often refuse to recognize or understand how to make use \nof their military experience and the expertise they have gained.\n  The Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America reported that 61 percent \nof employers do not believe they have ``a complete understanding of the \nqualifications ex-servicemembers offer,'' and recently separated \nservicemembers with college degrees earn on average almost $10,000 less \nper year than their nonveteran counterparts.\n  One way to close this gap is to have the Department of Defense review \nthe list of military occupations specialties, such as the 22 MOS's in \nArmy engineering or 16 MOS's in Army communications, and ensure that \ncompleting MOS qualifications will provide those servicemembers with \ncredentials recognized by civilian employers.\n  The study authorized in this legislation will start that process. I \nam committed to working in the Senate to see this problem resolved.\n  Fourth, the legislation reauthorizes the Veterans Education Outreach \nProgram to provide money for campus-based outreach services to \nveterans. This program was first established in 1972 to provide \ncolleges with a significant number of veterans on campus with \nadditional resources to make sure those students get the most out of \ntheir educational experience and use VA benefits available to assist \nthem. I believe that the return of veterans from deployments during the \nGlobal War on Terror requires the same kind of on-campus support. While \nthere are other programs helping veterans pay the cost of tuition and \nmany colleges have great veterans services on-campus, the Veterans \nEducation Outreach Program is the missing link to ensuring veterans are \ninformed about their VA benefits and maximizing the opportunity to \nstudy and obtain employment.\n  Fifth, the legislation authorizes a comprehensive program at the \nDepartment of Labor to assist veterans with TBI or PTSD in the \nworkplace. It provides technical assistance to employers of veterans \nliving with those conditions and provides best practices relating to \nhelping those employees develop successful strategies for on-the-job \nsuccess. The legislation requires the Office of Disability Employment \nPolicy to coordinate an inter-agency working group which will produce a \nfederal homecoming plan for reintegration of these veterans. These \ntasks have been conducted to a limited degree by the Department of \nLabor through the America's Heroes at Work program and the Veterans \nEmployment & Training Services and they are to be commended for their \nefforts to date. However, by defining these requirements in statute, it \nis my hope that these programs will expand to reach all veterans that \nneed help.\n  This legislation also reaches veterans in a variety of other key \nareas. Recently, a female veteran visited my office. She and her two \nchildren were homeless and needed help. In their case, we could find \ntemporary shelter. But on the issue of homelessness, many veterans do \nnot know where to turn or are hesitant to do so. The current per diem \ngiven to homeless veterans does not address rising costs and regional \nvariations in helping homeless veterans. Women are particularly \nunderserved now, and my hope is that new housing projects take care of \nfemale veterans. For example, the Newington Mission Homeless Project in \nmy state will help forgotten heroes find shelter. The Honoring All \nVeterans Act reforms the per diem program and helps military families \navoid homelessness by permanently extending their foreclosure \nprotection for servicemembers.\n  On improving veteran health care and mental health services, as I \nhave traveled Connecticut meeting with veterans, I have seen firsthand \nhow veterans with traumatic brain injury or post-traumatic stress \ndisorder face unique challenges in accessing the Department of Veterans \nAffairs for benefits and medical assistance. Veterans deserve the best \npossible medical care, particularly when it comes to treating TBI or \npost-traumatic stress. These are the signature wounds of the conflicts \nin Afghanistan and Iraq. More than a quarter of these injuries are \nundiagnosed, according to the military itself. Then too often, even if \nthey are diagnosed, servicemembers are screened but do not receive a \nfull course of treatment.\n  To address this issue, my legislation requires the Department of \nDefense to identify and then close the gap between screenings and \ntreatment. Simply diagnosing a soldier or a marine with symptoms of \nPTSD or TBI does not heal them.\n  This legislation also addresses the problem of finding qualified \npsychiatrists, psychologists, and nursing professionals to work in VA \nmedical hospitals and outpatient clinics by accessing graduates from \nthe Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences. This \nuniversity trains outstanding medical professionals for military \nservice. Under existing law the Secretary may exempt graduates from \nworking in a military hospital after graduation, based upon forecast \ndemand. The Honoring All Veterans Act allows those graduates identified \nby the Secretary as excess to military requirements to serve out their \ncommitment in the VA medical systems, rather than releasing them to \nprivate hospitals. This provision is just one example of how the \nlegislation is crafted to better utilize the existing resources of the \nDOD and VA medical systems.\n  Modernizing the Department of Veterans Affairs is the final section \nof this legislation. It addresses the DOD and VA transition process \nthrough improved monitoring and oversight. It increases pension \nbenefits and gives veterans grounds for appeal at the Board of Veterans \nAppeals if the VA has misplaced or misfiled their documents.\n  I hear about this problem, as my colleagues do, again and again as I \nlisten to veterans. Recently, a veteran visited\n\n[[Page S3343]]\n\nmy office. He has been waiting on a hearing date with the Board of \nVeterans Appeals for over a year.\n  His story is typical.\n  This legislation provides much needed improvement to the Board of \nVeterans Appeals. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \naddress other much needed improvements.\n  We can honor our veterans whose claims are stuck in the Board of \nVeterans Appeals by confirming judges to the court that reviews them. \nThree of those nine seats are now vacant, and each judge must preside \nover 600 cases per year, far more than any other Federal appellate \ncourt.\n  Finally, in closing, let me recognize the many veterans throughout \nthe State of Connecticut who helped me craft this measure.\n  I thank CDR Richard DiFederico of the VFW and CDR Daniel Thurston of \nthe American Legion for their very dedicated work, not only in \nassisting me but day in and day out on behalf of veterans.\n  I thank Bob Janicki, who has spent recent years after serving this \ncountry in the U.S. Marine Corps during the Vietnam era, for providing \nhelp to homeless veterans and veterans seeking jobs.\n  Paul ``Bud'' Bucha is a veteran and friend with the most \ndistinguished service record possible in winning the Medal of Honor. \nHis life after military service, giving back to other veterans and \nmanaging several successful companies, has been an example of how \nveterans continue to provide leadership with courage and vision.\n  MSG Frank Alvarado has made a number of very helpful suggestions, \nincluding, for example, reauthorizing the Veterans Education Outreach \nProgram.\n  I would also like to acknowledge my deep respect to Dr. Linda \nSchwartz, who has been a tireless advocate for all veterans.\n  Connecticut is blessed to have the leadership of veterans who help \neach other, care for each other, look out for each other. I look \nforward to working with them in ensuring that this legislation is \npassed. I have no illusions that accomplishing passage of these kinds \nof measures will be easy, but I hope for support across the aisle. This \nkind of goal certainly ought to unite us, not divide us. We have so \nmuch more in common on this issue than in conflict. I am hoping we can \nwork together to ensure that we keep faith with our veterans, that we \nhonor their service, ensure that we welcome them home with the kind of \nservices they need and deserve so that no veteran will be left behind.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na summary of this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 The Honoring All Veterans Act of 2011\n\n                      Section by Section Analysis\n\n\n  Title 1--Education, Employment, and Independent Living Services for \n                                Veterans\n\n       1.

A bill to allow for the harvest of gull eggs by the Huna \nTlingit people within Glacier Bay National Park in the State of Alaska; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nthe Huna Tlingit Traditional Gull Egg Use Act of 2011, cosponsored by \nmy colleague Mark Begich from Alaska, which represents an important \nstep forward in allowing the Huna Tlingit people access to enjoy their \ntraditional subsistence activity of gull egg collection.\n  The collection and consumption of gull eggs is an integral part of \nthe culture of the Tlingit people of Southeast Alaska, and eggs were \ngathered at rookeries long before Glacier Bay National Park and \nPreserve's establishment in 1925. A Legislative Environmental Impact \nStatement was completed in 2010 regarding this proposal to allow \nlimited harvests of gull eggs in Glacier Bay National Park and \nPreserve, and the preferred alternative authorized the implementation \nof a cooperative management program for gull egg collection and \nemphasized a traditional harvest strategy for the collections.\n  My bill will authorize this harvest of gull eggs at five nesting \nareas on two separate days each calendar year within the Park. This \nwould allow a large number of tribal members to interact with their \ntraditional homeland and provide an opportunity for as many as 12 young \npeople to participate annually and spend time with elders learning \nabout traditional egg harvest practices in addition to other aspects \nTlingit culture\n  This bill is widely supported throughout the environmental and \nconservation communities, as well as the Alaska Native community. The \nharvesting of gull eggs would only have minor effects on the gulls, but \nthe cultural benefits that would be realized by the Native community \nwould be great.\n  I would like to thank Senator Begich, an original co-sponsor of this \nbill, for his and his staff's hard work in moving this bill forward. It \nis our hope that this bill will receive quick but careful consideration \nas the local tribe members have been eagerly awaiting passage of this \nmeasure for quite a long time.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Leahy, and \n        Mr. Franken):\n  S. 1064. A bill to make effective the proposed rule of the Food and \nDrug Administration relating to sunscreen drug products, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, as families prepare for Memorial Day \nfestivities, and plan outings this summer, most will be outdoors \nwithout adequate sun protection, even if they use sunscreen.\n\n[[Page S3344]]\n\nThis is because there are currently no rules that sunscreen makers must \nfollow when making claims about the level of protection their products \nprovide.\n  Currently, sunscreen products are only required to protect against \nUVB rays, the rays that cause tans and sunburns and the level of \nprotection is documented with a Sun Protection Factor, SPF. \nUnfortunately, even these numbers can be misleading or worse, \ninaccurate. Researchers have found that a sunscreen product with a SPF \nof 30 protects against 98 percent of the sun's UVB rays, while a \nsunscreen labeled with a SPF of 100 protects against 99 percent of the \nsun's UVB rays. The larger the SPF number doesn't always result in \nsignificantly better protection.\n  Moreover, sunscreen products are not required to protect against \ncancer-causing UVA rays. UVA rays actually penetrate deeper into the \nskin and can cause more damage. Some sunscreens and products containing \nsun protection claim to protect against these rays, but there are no \nscientific standards by which to measure their validity.\n  We have seen the effects that a lack of reliable sun protection can \nhave in the rising rates of melanoma in this country, which has doubled \nin the past 30 years. This year alone, over 2 million people will be \ninformed that they have a preventable form of skin cancer. My state of \nRhode Island is among the top ten for reported melanoma diagnoses.\n  After years of working with my colleagues to press the Food and Drug \nAdministration to act, in August of 2007, the FDA finally proposed a \nrule that would require sunscreen labels to disclose the level of UVA \nprotection in a standard format that appears near the sun protection \nfactor rating, and ensure that the SPF rating actually corresponds to a \nproduct's protection against UVB rays. This was a step in the right \ndirection. The downside is that nearly 4 years later this proposal has \nstill not been finalized.\n  For this reason, today I am introducing the Sunscreen Labeling \nProtection Act, the SUN Act, along with my colleagues, Senators \nSchumer, Kerry, Leahy, and Franken. This legislation would require the \nFDA to finalize the sunscreen labeling monograph. If the FDA fails to \nfinalize its proposed monograph of August 27, 2007 within 180 days of \nenactment of the SUN Act, the monograph, as proposed, would become \neffective. I look forward to a summer when Americans can finally feel \nprotected from the sun's harmful rays.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1064\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Sunscreen Labeling \n     Protection Act of 2011'' or the ``SUN Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. EFFECTIVE DATE FOR RULE RELATING TO SUNSCREEN DRUG \n                   PRODUCTS FOR OVER-THE-COUNTER HUMAN USE.\n\n       Notwithstanding subchapter II of chapter 5, and chapter 7, \n     of title 5, United States Code (commonly known as the \n     ``Administrative Procedure Act'') and any other provision of \n     law, the proposed rule issued by the Commissioner of Food and \n     Drugs entitled ``Sunscreen Drug Products for Over-the-Counter \n     Human Use; Proposed Amendment of Final Monograph'', 72 Fed. \n     Reg. 49070 (August 27, 2007), shall take effect on the date \n     that is 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     unless such Commissioner issues the final rule, which \n     includes formulation, labeling, and testing requirements for \n     both ultraviolet B (UVB) and ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation \n     protection, before such effective date.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. UDALL of Colorado (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, and Ms. \n        Murkowski):\n  S. 1067. A bill to amend the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to require the \nSecretary of Energy to carry out a research and development and \ndemonstration program to reduce manufacturing and construction costs \nrelating to nuclear reactors, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nrole safe nuclear energy can play in moving our country toward a more \nsecure energy future.\n  Given the economic, national security, and environmental threats that \nwe face, we need a comprehensive energy policy. In this regard, safe \nnuclear energy clearly has emerged as an important player in our search \nfor stable and domestic energy sources with fewer greenhouse gas \nemissions.\n  A cleaner energy economy will spur innovation in, and accelerate the \nshift to, clean and domestic energy sources. It will create a new \nindustrial sector employing millions of Americans in the research, \ndevelopment, and commercialization of new energy technologies. And it \nwill help reduce our dependence on foreign oil from unstable regions of \nthe world and cleaner energy technologies will help us get there.\n  Finally, as we try to emerge from perhaps our greatest economic \ncrisis since the Great Depression, we need an ``all of the above'' \nsolution to jump-start our economy and create new jobs. Beyond \nrenewables and natural gas, this also means next generation nuclear \nenergy.\n  That is why I am introducing the bipartisan Nuclear Energy Research \nInitiative Improvement Act today. This bill would authorize the \nDepartment of Energy to carry out a research, development, and \ndemonstration program to reduce manufacturing and construction costs of \nsafe nuclear reactors. It would support research in areas critical for \nus to achieve these goals, while also protecting national security. For \nexample, it would support research into: modular and small-scale \nreactors, balance-of-plant issues, cost-efficient manufacturing, \nlicensing issues, and enhanced proliferation controls.\n  In light of the disaster at the Daiichi nuclear facility in Japan, it \nis evident a new era of safe nuclear energy development is needed: one \nwith enhanced safeguards and more agile manufacturing and operating \ncapabilities. My bill seeks to achieve those objectives.\n  Nuclear power's energy security and environmental benefits have \nearned this industry an important place at the table. It is my hope \nthat we can build new, safe nuclear plants over the next decade to \ncreate jobs and build a cleaner, more secure tomorrow. My bill would \nhelp us accomplish these goals.\n  I would like to thank Senator Bingaman and Senator Murkowski for \njoining me in introducing this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1067\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide \nfor temporary student loan debt conversion authority; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, this month marks commencement \nseason at our great colleges and universities across Ohio and the \nNation. I have had the honor of speaking at a few this year--Owens \nCommunity College, Ashland University, Cleveland Marshall College of \nLaw, and Ohio Northern University.\n  It is a day of achievement and accomplishment, a reaffirmation of why \neducation is a key to our economic prosperity. But it is also a day of \nanxiety. Graduates are leaving campuses to enter a difficult job market \nsaddled with student debt.\n  Approximately 2/3 of Ohioans who attend a private or public 4-year \ncollege or university graduate with an average of nearly $26,000 in \nstudent loan debt. Unfortunately, as student loan debt levels continue \nto grow, the Nation's hiring climate remains sluggish. This has led to \nlimited employment opportunities for recent graduates; nearly half of \nthe 2009 graduating class is currently unemployed or employed in a \nposition that does not require a college degree.\n  Such circumstances are leading to undue personal stress and \npotentially, a lifetime of financial challenges. Far too often, \nindividuals and families are becoming part of the ``sandwich \ngeneration'' where families are paying for the cost of their children's \neducation while also taking care of their aging parents.\n  That is why last year I supported--and the President signed into law, \nthe Health and Education Reconciliation Act, the single largest federal \ninvestment in student aid in generations. The law ends wasteful \nsubsidies to private lenders through the Federal Family Education Loan, \nFFEL, Program. In doing so, we cut out the middleman and loans are now \nnot only originated, but also serviced, by the U.S. Department of \nEducation.\n  By ending subsidies to private banks, we saved billions of dollars, \nand used the savings to allow the maximum Pell Grant award to reach a \nhistoric level. We made it easier for students to repay loans through \nthe Income-Based Repayment Program. We did this all at no cost to the \ntaxpayer.\n  For many colleges and universities, the transition from FFEL to the \nDirect Loan program has been a resounding success as there has been no \ndisruption to borrowers or financial aid administrators.\n  For those borrowers who are in the middle of the transition period, \nI, along with my good colleague Senator Franken, am introducing the \nStudent Loan Simplification and Opportunity Act. This legislation, by \nsimplifying loan repayment and reducing the loan amount, benefits \ncollege graduates. And this legislation, by removing costly subsidies \nprovided to private lenders, saves 1.8 billion dollars that will be \nreinvested in the Pell Grant Program, thereby ensuring that other \ndeserving students can afford to attend college.\n  The Student Loan Simplification and Opportunity Act would allow \nstudents with both FFEL loans and Direct Loans to voluntarily transfer \ntheir FFEL debt to a Direct Loan servicer over a nine-month period.\n  By converting loans, the likelihood that a borrower may miss a \npayment and end up further in debt would decrease. On average, a \nborrower with multiple loan servicers has a 20 percent higher chance of \ndefaulting on their loan payments. Yet, this program not only \nsimplifies a borrower's loan repayment, it reduces the amount owed. \nBorrowers who transferred their debt would be rewarded with up to a 2 \npercent reduction in the principal amount of their FFEL loan.\n  I am proud to introduce the Student Loan Simplification and \nOpportunity Act, as this legislation will benefit both borrowers and \ntaxpayers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 1079.

REPORT ON INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION ACTIVITIES.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) in democratic societies, citizens rightly expect that \n     their government will not arbitrarily keep information secret \n     from the public but instead will act with secrecy only in \n     certain limited circumstances;\n       (2) the United States Government has an inherent \n     responsibility to protect American citizens from foreign \n     threats and sometimes relies on clandestine methods to learn \n     information about foreign adversaries, and these intelligence \n     collection methods are often most effective when they remain \n     secret;\n       (3) American citizens recognize that their government may \n     rely on secret intelligence sources and collection methods to \n     ensure national security and public safety, and American \n     citizens also expect intelligence activities to be conducted \n     within the boundaries of publicly understood law;\n       (4) it is essential for the American public to have access \n     to enough information to determine how government officials \n     are interpreting the law, so that voters can ratify or reject \n     decisions that elected officials make on their behalf;\n       (5) it is essential that Congress have informed and open \n     debates about the meaning of existing laws, so that members \n     of Congress are able to consider whether laws are written \n     appropriately, and so that members of Congress may be held \n     accountable by their constituents;\n       (6) United States Government officials should not secretly \n     reinterpret public laws and statutes in a manner that is \n     inconsistent with the public's understanding of these laws, \n     and should not describe the execution of these laws in a way \n     that misinforms or misleads the public;\n       (7) On February 2, 2011, the congressional intelligence \n     committees received a secret report from the Attorney General \n     and the Director of National Intelligence that has been \n     publicly described as pertaining to intelligence collection \n     authorities that are subject to expiration under section 224 \n     of the USA PATRIOT Act (Public Law 107-56; 115 Stat. 295); \n     and\n       (8) while it is entirely appropriate for particular \n     intelligence collection techniques to be kept secret, the \n     laws that authorize such techniques, and the United States \n     Government's official interpretation of these laws, should \n     not be kept secret but should instead be transparent to the \n     public, so that these laws can be the subject of informed \n     public debate and consideration.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 60 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall publish in \n     the Federal Register a report--\n       (1) that details the legal basis for the intelligence \n     collection activities described in the February 2, 2011, \n     report to the congressional intelligence committees; and\n       (2) that does not describe specific intelligence collection \n     programs or activities, but that fully describes the legal \n     interpretations and analysis necessary to understand the \n     United States Government's official interpretation of the \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801 \n     et seq.).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 385.

Res. 16, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 16\n\n       Whereas Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution of the \n     United States reserves for Congress the right to declare war;\n       Whereas the War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1541 et seq.) \n     states that it is intended to ``fulfill the intent of the \n     framers of the Constitution of the United States'' in \n     requiring the President to seek the consent of Congress \n     before the introduction of the United States Armed Forces \n     into hostile action;\n       Whereas the President must seek authorization from Congress \n     prior to engaging the United States Armed Forces in an armed \n     conflict absent an imminent threat to national security;\n       Whereas President Barack Obama, without seeking a formal \n     authorization from Congress, ordered the execution of a \n     sustained military engagement through the enforcement of a \n     no-fly zone in Libya on March 19, 2011;\n       Whereas Congress did not consider or pass a formal \n     authorization for the President to initiate military \n     operations in Libya;\n       Whereas the War Powers Resolution establishes that the \n     President must notify Congress of the introduction of the \n     United States Armed Forces within 48 hours after commencing \n     such action;\n       Whereas President Obama acknowledged his obligation to \n     submit a notification of his actions in Libya under the War \n     Powers Resolution through a letter delivered on March 21, \n     2011, to Speaker of the House John Boehner and President Pro \n     Tempore of the Senate Daniel Inouye;\n       Whereas section 8(a) the War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. \n     1547(a)) establishes that the President may not construe \n     authorization from any other act or treaty unless such act or \n     treaty is ``implemented by legislation specifically \n     authorizing the introduction of the United States Armed \n     Forces into hostilities'';\n       Whereas President Obama contends that hostile engagement by \n     the military forces of the United States against the \n     Government of Libya was part of a multilateral response \n     authorized by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 \n     (2011) and in consultation with the Arab League;\n       Whereas section 2(c) of the War Powers Resolution (50 \n     U.S.C. 1541(c)) provides that no attempt by the President to \n     introduce the United States Armed Forces into hostile action \n     may be made under the War Powers Resolution unless there is \n     ``(1) a declaration of war, (2) a specific authorization, or \n     (3) a national emergency created by attack upon the United \n     States, its territories or possessions, or its armed \n     forces'';\n       Whereas the Government of Libya, immediately prior to the \n     introduction of the United States Armed Forces into the \n     conflict on March 19, 2011, had not attacked the United \n     States nor declared any intent to do so;\n       Whereas President Obama had stated the purpose of enforcing \n     a no-fly zone over Libya was to ``take all necessary measures \n     to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under \n     threat of attack in Libya'' and not in response to any direct \n     or immediate threat to the United States;\n       Whereas section 5(b) of the War Powers Resolution (50 \n     U.S.C. 1544(b)) further establishes that, in absence of \n     authorization from Congress, the President may not engage the \n     United States Armed Forces in an armed conflict for a period \n     longer than ``sixty calendar days'';\n       Whereas members of the United States Armed Forces have \n     remained engaged in operations in Libya since March 19, 2011;\n       Whereas, on May 20, 2011, the limit of sixty calendar days \n     placed on the President's ability to continue engagement of \n     the military forces of the United States against the \n     Government of Libya will have been exhausted under the terms \n     of the War Powers Resolution;\n       Whereas Section 5(b) of the War Powers Resolution (50 \n     U.S.C. 1544(b)) requires that ``within sixty calendar days . \n     . . the President shall terminate any use of United States \n     Armed Forces . . . unless the Congress (1) has declared war \n     or has enacted a specific authorization for such use of the \n     United States Armed Forces, (2) has extended by law such \n     sixty-day period, or (3) is physically unable to meet as a \n     result of an armed attack upon the United States'';\n       Whereas President Obama reiterated on May 20, 2011, that \n     the military forces of the United States remain engaged in \n     hostilities, including ``suppression and destruction of air \n     defenses'' and ``precision strikes by unmanned aerial \n     vehicles'';\n       Whereas Congress has not considered or passed a formal \n     authorization for the President to continue military \n     operations in Libya; and\n       Whereas President Obama has not indicated any intent to \n     cease operations in Libya after the sixty-day limit \n     established by the War Powers Resolution: Now, therefore, be \n     it:\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     Congress--\n       (1) declares that, as it pertains to the continuing armed \n     engagement of the United States Armed Forces against the \n     Government of Libya, the President has exceeded the statutory \n     time limits placed on him by the War Powers Resolution and is \n     therefore in violation of the law; and\n       (2) calls on the President to--\n       (A) seek a formal authorization from Congress to continue \n     the mission in Libya; or\n       (B) cease armed engagement against the Government of Libya \n     until such time as further action is authorized by Congress.\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, in accordance with rule V of the Standing \nRules of the Senate, I hereby give notice in writing that it is my \nintention to move to suspend Rule XIV, paragraphs 3 and 4 for the \npurpose of moving to proceed to S. 1070, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1070\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fourth Amendment Restoration \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution \n     states ``The right of the people to be secure in their \n     persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable \n     searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants \n     shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or \n     affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be \n     searched, and the persons or things to be seized.''.\n       (2) Prior to the American Revolution, American colonists \n     objected to the issuance of writs of assistance, which were \n     general warrants that did not specify either the place or \n     goods to be searched.\n       (3) Writs of assistance played an important role in the \n     events that led to the American Revolution.\n       (4) The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution \n     was intended to protect against the issuance of general \n     warrants, and to guarantee that only judges, not soldiers or \n     police officers, are able to issue warrants.\n       (5) Various provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act (Public Law \n     107-56; 115 Stat. 272) expressly violate the original intent \n     of the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n\n     SEC. 3.
