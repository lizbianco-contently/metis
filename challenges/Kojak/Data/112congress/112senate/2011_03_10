Mr. President, it is time once again for us to get down to \nbusiness. Yesterday's budget votes didn't bring us any closer to a \nconclusion, but it did bring to our minds a lesson, and it does that \nvery clearly. That lesson is that one party alone will not reach a \nresolution without the other's cooperation and consent.\n  We voted on the Republican budget proposal and on the Democratic \nbudget proposal. Neither plan came close to the 60 votes needed to pass \nor even the 51 votes which would represent a majority of the Senate. \nBut the exercise wasn't in vain. We have demonstrated publicly and on \nthe record that we know the answer lies somewhere in the middle. Now it \nis time to find that answer in a budget that will reflect our values, \nkeep the country running, and create jobs.\n  I can speak only for my caucus when I say we accept the lessons of \nyesterday's vote. We know we will have to make sacrifices to reach \nconsensus, and we are willing to do that. Republicans have to be \nwilling to move their position also. Perhaps they are willing to \nfinally acknowledge that, given our deep debt, we can't afford \ngovernment giveaways to millionaires and oil companies making record \nprofits. Both acknowledgments would help close the deficit gap. Both \nwould be big pieces to the puzzle.\n  Perhaps Republicans are willing to offer more reasonable cuts that \nthe Democratic caucus can support. By reasonable cuts, I mean cuts that \ndon't\n\n[[Page S1516]]\n\narbitrarily kick Head Start students out of class or rob college \nstudents of their Pell grants--both cuts resoundingly rejected \nyesterday--and I mean cuts that don't pull the plug on renewable energy \njobs or cuts that fire thousands of workers at community health centers \nacross the country. Republicans should be willing to look at our \ncountry's substantial budget and find cuts more worthy than those that \nwould weaken law enforcement and border security to keep us safe. I \nhope they will.\n  I hope they will join Democrats in saving money by attacking waste, \nfraud, and abuse. I hope they will join us in making tough choices and \navoiding the temptation to make counterproductive cuts. Let's come \ntogether to cut in a way that strengthens our economy and doesn't \nweaken our economy. Let's cut in a way that makes our neighborhoods, \nour schools, and our borders stronger, not weaker.\n  As the negotiation process begins anew, I remind my Republican \nfriends that time is short. I also remind them that the deadline we \nface--a week from tomorrow--is the deadline they set. We didn't set it. \nDemocrats warned from the start that the process would take a month. \nRepublicans would agree only to a period half as long as that--2 weeks. \nThose 2 weeks are up, as I said, next Friday.\n  So my message is this to my Republican colleagues: You set the \ndeadline, and the responsibility of meeting it is as much yours as it \nis ours. Both parties also share a responsibility to be reasonable. So \nlet's get to work. We cannot negotiate this in the media. We cannot \nnegotiate this if we are unwilling to give any ground. We cannot be \nstubborn and expect a solution. It is time to negotiate in good faith, \nit is time for all political posturing to end, and it is time for \npragmatism, which is long overdue.\n  I would also say to my friends in the House that the Senate has \nproduced two very strong jobs bills. One is the FAA reauthorization, \nwhich is long overdue. That was a bipartisan bill. It passed \noverwhelmingly here in the Senate and would save or create 280,000 \njobs--a pretty good step in the right direction. Just in the last 24 \nhours, we passed the patent reform bill. That will create 300,000 jobs. \nThese two jobs bills need to be completed by the House of \nRepresentatives so we can send them to the President. These two jobs \nbills are important. The House should focus on jobs, not these \narbitrary cuts they have been making. So I hope the House would right \naway work on the jobs bills that have already passed the Senate--\npatents and, of course, the FAA bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/10/senate-section/article/S1516-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, throughout the week I have pointed out \nthat our Nation faces a day of reckoning on entitlements such as Social \nSecurity and Medicare, and I have expressed my disappointment about the \nWhite House's failure to lead on reforms that would save these programs \nat an opportune moment like our own.\n  The best time to solve the kind of fiscal crisis we face is when the \ntwo parties share power in Washington. Everyone knows we either address \nthese problems together or they won't be addressed at all. Everyone \nknows the President has to take the lead. That is why Presidents from \nboth parties have done just that during periods of divided government \nin the past. That is why many of us are calling on this President to do \nthe same for the good of the country now.\n  But when it comes to job creation, the President isn't just failing \nto lead; in many cases, he is actually blocking the way. Nowhere is \nthis more evident than in the area of energy exploration.\n  Americans looking at the price of gas at the pump these days are \njustifiably upset. What they may not realize is that some in the \nadministration are actively working to prevent us from increasing our \nown oil production here at home. So this morning, with gas prices on \nthe rise, I would like to step back for a minute and quickly review \nwhat the administration is doing to inhibit energy production right \nhere at home. Taken together, it would be a pretty long list, including \ndelays and suspensions and revocations and outright cancellations of \nlease permits, which translates into higher prices and fewer American \njobs. So I will just list a few of the highlights.\n  The administration started by canceling oil and gas leases for \ndomestic exploration. Immediately after taking office, the Secretary of \nthe Interior, Ken Salazar, canceled 77 oil and gas leases in the State \nof Utah. One year later, the administration suspended 61 more leases, \nthis time in Montana. Shortly after canceling the Utah leases, \nSecretary Salazar extended the public comment period to renew offshore \ndrilling by another 6 months, dragging out an already lengthy process \neven further.\n  Then, immediately after the gulf oilspill began last April, the \nadministration imposed a 6-month moratorium on offshore drilling in the \ngulf even as it canceled energy exploration that was set to take place \nthousands of miles away from the spill in the gulf up in the Arctic. \nTwo Federal courts on three separate occasions have declared the \nmoratorium in the gulf unjust. The administration has ignored them. It \nhas kept the ban in place despite these rulings, forcing the drillers \nwho have been affected by it to relocate their rigs--and the thousands \nof good-paying jobs they supported--to other parts of the world.\n  So if one is wondering where the jobs are, a good place to start is \nthe administration's efforts to block American energy exploration. \nSenator Murkowski points out that U.S. oil reserves at just three \nsources in Alaska--just three sources in Alaska--could replace crude \noil imports from the Persian Gulf for nearly 65 years. Three sources in \nAlaska, currently shut down, could replace crude oil imports from the \nPersian Gulf for 65 years. Yet all three are off limits due to \ndecisions made by or continued by this administration.\n  Behind all these actions is a complete disconnect. At a time when gas \nprices are climbing higher and higher, pinching pocketbooks and \nthreatening an economic recovery, Democrats in Washington would rather \nignore the fact that Americans will remain dependent on fossil fuel for \ndecades to come. But we shouldn't be surprised by it. Two months before \nthe President was elected, the man he ended up choosing as his Energy \nSecretary told a reporter how he would go about reducing America's \ndependence on oil. He said: ``Somehow, we have to figure out how to \nboost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe.'' And if that was \nthe strategy, Secretary Chu seems to be getting his wish. And the \nadministration is doing just about everything it can to keep them \nthere.\n  Now is the time to be asking what we can do to increase domestic \nenergy production, not proposing ways to squeeze American families even \nmore. That is why all of these actions by the administration, along \nwith the tax hike on energy production some have proposed that will \nonly be passed on to consumers in the form of even higher gas prices, \nare the very last thing Americans need right now. We should be looking \nfor ways to lighten the burden on American families, not saddling them \nwith a minivan tax.\n  There is a better approach. Rather than squeezing the public and \nkilling jobs with artificially higher prices, we should be looking for \nways to increase domestic production even as we promote alternative \nsources of energy for the future. An all-of-the-above approach to \nenergy production--and the jobs that come with it--of the kind \nRepublicans have been advocating for years would capitalize on the \nabundant resources we already have right here at home while at the same \ntime looking for alternative sources of energy and new technologies \nthat will free us from dependence on fossil fuels down the road.\n  This is a responsible approach. It protects existing jobs and creates \nnew jobs at a time when Americans need them. It would reduce our \ndependence on foreign sources of oil. It honors the concerns Americans \nhave right now about the rising price of gas, and it respects the \nreality that most of the cars in this country will run on gas for many \nyears to come. But higher prices at the pump and fewer American jobs is \nthe wrong answer.\n\n[[Page S1517]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/10/senate-section/article/S1517-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1517]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DAVID BRODER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, sadly, we lost David Broder yesterday. \nA lot has been said in the last 24 hours about that distinguished \njournalist. I wish to add just a brief word of my own.\n  I will not pretend to have known him well, although we did talk from \ntime to time over the years. I admired him greatly. One could not help \nbut admire him, and a few things truly stand out. First of all, in a \ncity that is full of people in a rush to make an impression, David was \nthe guy who took the time to get it right, day in and day out, without \nbombast or pretense.\n  He wasn't looking to make an impression as much as he was trying to \ndo his job and to do it well. The notoriety, of course, took care of \nitself. He was a workhorse first and foremost--a reporter who seemed to \nenjoy the work more than any attention he got for it.\n  Everyone who ever worked with him seems to have a story about \nwatching him knocking on doors while he was in his late seventies or \nearnestly listening to a Midwest voter out in the cold. It all points \nto a sort of sturdiness of purpose and to the old virtues of patience, \nfairness and hard work and a sense that other people's opinions were at \nleast as valuable as his own.\n  Add to that a deep curiosity and thoughtfulness and a childlike \nappreciation for the mechanics of democracy, and we have a pretty good \nmodel for what political reporting is all about.\n  I hesitate to say he was conservative in temperament, if not in his \npolitics, but that is what came through.\n  It became commonplace to say David Broder was the dean of American \npolitical reporters. But I think it is worth understanding what people \nmeant by that. It doesn't mean he was the most exciting guy in the \nroom--he wasn't. It doesn't mean he had the most scoops--I am not sure \nhe did. I think what it means, aside from the sheer length of his \ncareer, was that more than most people, his life came to take the shape \nof the profession he chose in life. It became sort of an extension of \nhimself.\n  That is what seemed to give him so much joy and satisfaction in his \nwork, along with the respect and admiration and maybe even a little bit \nof envy of so many others.\n  Republican or Democrat, liberal or conservative, young or old, we \ncould use a few more David Broders.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/10/senate-section/article/S1517-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1517]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I was hoping to have a little bit more \ntime, so I will cover this a little faster than I normally would. It is \nso critical.\n  I just got back from the Middle East, and I know the problems that \nare over there. A lot of people are saying the gas prices that are \ngoing up are a result, partially, of what is happening over there, but \nthe real problem is a political problem.\n  First of all, let me talk about the commitment this administration \nhas to cap and trade. Some people who have been around for a while can \nremember that way back at the Kyoto treaty I kind of led the opposition \nto ratifying that treaty. Later on--for the next 10 years--they tried \nto pass cap-and-trade legislation. Since I chaired the committee of \njurisdiction at that time, we thought this was not going to work, even \nby the admission of the EPA. If we were to pass something such as this \nin the United States, it wouldn't have any effect on reducing \ngreenhouse gases.\n  I still say this. Something is happening this morning in the House. \nThey are looking at this issue, and we have introduced legislation that \nhas said the EPA doesn't have the jurisdiction to regulate greenhouse \ngases. I will get to that in a minute.\n  My message is simply that higher gas prices are simply a product of \nthis administration's goal. The minority leader, a minute ago, said \nsomething. He quoted Steven Chu, the Secretary of Energy. He said: \n``Somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to \nthe levels in Europe.''\n  In the United Kingdom, gas is $7.87 per gallon; in Italy, it is \n$7.54; in France, it is $7.50; in Germany, it is $7.41.\n  That is what this administration wants to do with gas prices. They \nhave a motive for doing that. I cannot stop talking about the cap-and-\ntrade agenda until we realize how it does affect things. You might \nremember that back during the campaign, President Obama stated in \n2008--when he was running for office--and he has stated it several \ntimes: ``Under cap and trade, electricity prices would necessarily \nskyrocket.''\n  He had it right. The whole point of that is, it would skyrocket if we \nwere to pass it. That also has an effect on all forms of energy. The \nHouse Energy and Power Subcommittee is voting this morning on the \nEnergy Tax Prevention Act, which I introduced in the Senate, and it was \nintroduced by Congressman Upton in the House. The bottom line of the \nEnergy Prevention Act is to make it so EPA doesn't have the \njurisdiction to do what they could not do legislatively. Starting with \nthe Kyoto treaty and all the way up to the following 10 years, they \ntried to pass--in 2003 and 2005 and 2008 and 2009--a similar type of \ncap and trade.\n  What is the cost of cap and trade? The cost would be--and this goes \nback to the Kyoto treaty and when we had the estimates from the Wharton \nSchool and MIT--between $300 billion and $400 billion a year. In \nOklahoma, that translates to $3,000 a year for each family who files a \ntax return. What do we get for it? By the admission of the Obama EPA \nand Lisa Jackson, in response to a question I asked live on TV--I \nasked: What effect would this have on worldwide emissions of \nCO2? The answer was it would not because that only affects \nthe United States. In reality, it could actually increase it, as our \njobs go overseas, to places such as China and Mexico and other places \nwhere there are fewer emission controls. So it could have the opposite \neffect.\n  Nonetheless, I say this because there are people wandering around out \nthere who say we should do something about emissions. Yet I wish to \nmake sure they are listening. Even if we did this, it would not have \nany effect. They hope, if we restrict enough supply, the price will \nincrease and we can simply shift to what they call green energy.\n  I think it is important people understand that the Republican \nposition on this is, yes, we want green energy, renewables, but we also \nwant coal and natural gas and nuclear and oil. These are the products \nthat can run America today. This is what we are doing. Back in \nOklahoma, there are logical people. They ask: What would it be if they \ndon't want oil, gas or coal? How do we run this machine called America? \nThe answer is, we can't.\n  Let me state this--I don't have the time. It is not just the \nadministration or Secretary Chu but others in the administration, such \nas Alan Krueger, Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy, who said: \n``The administration believes that it is no longer sufficient to \naddress our Nation's energy needs by finding more fossil fuels.''\n\n  They are antifossil fuels. They admit the tax subsidies are currently \nprovided in the oil and gas industry, and they lead to inefficiency by \nencouraging overinvestment in domestic resources in this industry.\n  This is critical. This is an administration official, Alan Krueger: \n``The small change in domestic producer costs [which I call a tax \nincrease] could cause some production to shift from domestic to foreign \nsuppliers.''\n  There it is, folks. That means we would have to depend on the Middle \nEast--import more of our energy from the Middle East. By the way, I \nthink it is important to note the Congressional Research Service--and I \nthink we all respect their work--came out with a report, and they \nstated--and nobody has been able to refute this yet--that the United \nStates of America now has\n\n[[Page S1518]]\n\nthe largest supply of recoverable reserves in gas, oil, and coal. We \nkeep hearing people say it is only 3 percent of the amount--we are \nusing 25 percent of the energy and are producing just 3 percent.\n  That is flatly not true. I think people understand that because they \nuse that as proven reserves. You can't prove reserves until you drill. \nWe have the political problem that the Democrats don't want us to \ndrill. In that case, we have to fall back on the other way of looking \nat it; that is, recoverable reserves. I say this: We are in a position \nright now to have the recoverable reserves. This chart shows these are \nthe recoverable reserves we have right now. This is America's true oil \npotential. This is what we could produce. These are the proven reserves \nthey talk about. The bottom line is, we have--and this is \nincontrovertible--the world's largest supply of oil, gas, and coal.\n  This chart shows the amount of oil, gas, and coal we have is greater \nthan that of China, Iran, and Canada--all three put together. This is \nwhat we have here. So people say: Wait a minute. That is a problem. \nThen why are we importing from foreign countries? It is because we have \na political problem. We have a majority in this Senate and they had a \nmajority in the House and the President trying to continue this policy \nof not allowing us to develop our own resources.\n  We are the only country in the world that doesn't develop our own \nresources. I do know there are a lot of problems out there. Certainly, \nwe have problems in the Middle East. But when I talk to my wife at \nhome, the problem is what she is paying for gas. It is not going to get \nany better. How many people went to school and didn't learn about \nsupply and demand? We have all the supply we need in America--when we \nadd what we get from Mexico and Canada--to be independent from the \nMiddle East. They don't let us develop it. Eighty-three percent of our \nFederal lands right now are off limits. It is a political problem.\n  I can remember when we had the oilspill down in the gulf, some of the \nfar left environmentalists were rejoicing that it happened. They could \nparlay that into not allowing us to drill for our own natural \nresources.\n  Finally, last week, the EPA issued its first permit for deepwater \ndrilling in the gulf, due to a lot of political pressure being put on \nand the realization that the American people are not dumb. We can \ndevelop our own resources and resolve this problem we have. If we look \nat what we have right now in reserves, in terms of recoverable reserves \nin oil and in gas, we have enough oil right now to run this country--\nthis is in recoverable reserves--for 90 years. Again, we have enough \ngas in recoverable reserves to run this country for 90 years. That is \nnot including shale. We all know about the great shale deposits in the \nWestern part of the United States. That is gigantic compared to what we \nhave available to us. We also hear about methane hydrates. The reason I \ndon't include shale and methane hydrates is because they are not \nrecoverable today. It is not something we use today. If we lifted all \nrestrictions, that would not give us, tomorrow, the shale reserves that \nare out there, nor the methane hydrates. What we would be able to do is \nstart further developing those.\n  Even without them, we can run this country called America for 90 \nyears on our own oil and gas. Then we go to coal and the significance \nof the oil reserves. Right now, we have 28 percent of the world's coal \nand, in fact, the CRS states America's recoverable coal reserves to be \n262 billion short tons. For perspective, the United States only uses \n$1.2 billion of short tons of coal each year. So what we have is oil, \ngas, and coal.\n  The only problem is, we have an administration that, by its own \nadmission, wants to kill oil, gas, coal, and fossil fuels. We can't do \nthis without a change in the administration or a change in policy. I \nthink, as you can see, when the gas prices go up--and all of America \nshould listen--all they have to do is remember what this \nadministration's position is, and that, as Steven Chu said--as the \nSecretary of Energy told the Wall Street Journal in 2008: ``Somehow we \nhave to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in \nEurope.''\n  This is President Obama's position. If we take this position, we are \ngoing to have gas prices going up. You can talk around it all you want, \nbut supply and demand is very simple. We have the potential supply to \nrun this country for the next almost 100 years on just what we have \ndeveloped.\n  I know the Senator from Kansas is anxious to make his statement.

Mr. President, I am humbled today to deliver my initial, \nmy very first speech on the floor of the Senate and to discuss a topic \nof vital importance to our country's future--our Nation's fiscal \nhealth.\n  It is a privilege to join the distinguished Members of this Chamber \nand to work alongside my friend of nearly 40 years now, Senator Pat \nRoberts. We met some time ago when I came to Washington, DC, as a \nsummer intern in the summer of 1974 and Watergate for a Congressman \nnamed Sebelius. My colleague Pat Roberts was his Chief of Staff and has \nbeen my friend since.\n  I am also humbled to follow in the footsteps of Gov. Sam Brownback \nand the many who came before him and whose names are etched in this \ndesk where I now stand. I am mindful of their service and particularly \nthat of Senator Bob Dole who served Kansans for nearly three decades in \nthis seat.\n  During nearly 36 years on Capitol Hill, Senator Dole became known as \nthe leader who worked relentlessly to forge alliances in order to pass \nsignificant legislation. Today he serves as a role model for those who \nhave dedicated their lives to public service. I thank Senator Dole for \nhis call yesterday wishing me well today, but I thank him more for his \ndistinguished service to our country and to Kansans. I know that love \nand respect the people of his hometown of Russell have for him. I will \nwork to honor his legacy.\n  I grew up just down the road from Bob Dole's hometown in a smaller \ntown, Plainville, a place where folks know their neighbors and look \nafter them. Much of what I know about people I learned early in my life \nby working at the local hardware store, the swimming pool, the \ndrugstore, and on my paper route. I learned there is good in every \nperson and that satisfaction in life comes from what you do for others \nrather than what you do for yourself. I learned that each family's joys \nand sorrows are increased and diminished when they are shared with \ntheir neighbors and friends. And I learned what it means to put others \nfirst, as my mom and dad always have. I was fortunate to grow up with \nloving parents who taught me the value of hard work, the importance of \neducation, and the necessity of integrity. In fact, they once made me \nreturn the 3 cents I had found when I turned in a pop bottle from my \nneighbor's back porch.\n\n  My dad, a World War II veteran, worked in the oilfields of western \nKansas, and my mom, who grew up in the Depression, was the lady you \npaid your light bill to. They were my Sunday School teachers and my Boy \nScout leaders, and they always encouraged me to do my best. My parents \nworked hard, avoided debt, paid their bills, and wanted to make sure my \nsister and I would have the chance to pursue our dreams.\n  I was also fortunate to have many teachers who instilled in me a love \nfor learning and a desire to explore the world beyond our city limits. \nAs a kid, I enjoyed reading about politics and history and government. \nPeople such as my fourth grade teacher Mrs. Pruter\n\n[[Page S1519]]\n\nhelped me to develop an interest in our country and public service. \nBecause of my teachers' interest in me, I am part of the first \ngeneration in our family to attend and graduate from college.\n  Nothing in my background would suggest I would have the opportunity \nto serve as a Member of the Senate. That says something about our \ncountry and the opportunity we as Americans have to dream big and to \npursue those dreams. It also says something about my home State and the \nspecial way of life we lead.\n  The pioneering spirit of those who settled our State 150 years ago \nand tamed the West lives on in Kansas today. We work hard, we come \ntogether to find commonsense solutions, and try to make a difference in \nour communities, our State, and our Nation. We also strive to provide a \nbetter future for our kids and grandkids so they can pursue their \ndreams and reach their goals. This is the reason I got involved in \npublic service, and it is the reason I remain involved today.\n  Since coming to Congress in 1997, I made a priority to stay connected \nto the Kansans I represent, so I return home on the weekends. Whether I \nam at the grocery store, attending church, or filling the tank with \ngas, the conversations I have with Kansans matter to me and impact the \nwork I do here in Washington. When I served in the House of \nRepresentatives, I held annual townhall meetings in each of the 69 \ncounties in my district, following the lead of my predecessor, then-\nCongressman Pat Roberts. I have continued this tradition as a Senator. \nI have continued this tradition as a Senator and begun traveling \nthroughout all 105 counties in our State to hear directly from Kansans, \nand I am committed to making sure their voices are heard in our \nNation's Capital.\n  Last spring in Kansas, I watched our oldest daughter walk across her \ncollege graduation stage and it was another defining moment for me. Our \ncountry is facing enormous fiscal challenges and if we fail to act, our \nchildren's future is at risk. I believe all Members of Congress, and in \nfact every American, has the responsibility to be a good steward of \nwhat has been passed on to us. So at that moment, that graduation \nevent, I renewed my commitment to do my part to turn this country \naround.\n  I am one of many voices to express this concern. In 1985, President \nReagan took the podium during his second inaugural address and spoke \nabout one of his greatest concerns: our Nation's deficit spending. He \ntold the American people that 50 years of deficit spending had finally \nbrought our Nation to the time of reckoning. He said:\n\n       We've come to a turning point, a moment for hard decisions. \n     We must act now to protect future generations from \n     government's desire to spend its citizens' money and tax them \n     into servitude when the bills come due.\n\n  I am here today, 26 years later, to issue, unfortunately, the same \nwarning. We are again facing a turning point in our country's history \nand we no longer can delay difficult decisions. When President Reagan \nstood and spoke those words, our national debt was $1.8 trillion. \nToday, that number has soared to $14 trillion--slowing our economic \ngrowth and threatening the prosperity of future generations who will \nhave to pay for our irresponsibility.\n  Our government borrows 40 cents of every dollar it spends and half \nour national debt is held by foreigners, many who do not share our \ninterests. The simple truth is our Nation's debt is the responsibility \nof several Congresses and Presidents who have allowed us to live well \nbeyond our means for way too long. Members of both political parties \nhave ignored this growing fiscal crisis and left it up to others in the \nfuture to deal with.\n  In my travels in Kansas I am often asked: How can Washington continue \nto spend and borrow so much? What will our country be like for our kids \nand grandkids? I join Kansans in voicing these concerns. In the last 2 \nyears, government spending has grown nearly 25 percent and we have had \nrecord trillion-dollar budget deficits. This year, the Federal \nGovernment will spend $3.7 trillion and collect $2.2 trillion. That is \na shortfall of $1.5 trillion. Common sense--Kansas common sense--tells \nus that pattern cannot continue.\n  Some will say we need to raise taxes to get us out of this mess. But \nthe reality is we don't have a revenue problem, we have a spending \nproblem. Experience shows us that money raised by Washington, DC, \nresults in more spending in Washington, DC.\n  The debate about government spending is often seen as a \nphilosophical, academic, or partisan issue, but the truth is out-of-\ncontrol borrowing and spending has very real consequences on the daily \nlives of Americans. When we continue to fail to balance the budget, it \nmeans increasing inflation, higher interest rates, and uncertainty in \nthe economy, which results in less business investment and fewer jobs.\n  This is not an academic discussion. It is not a partisan discussion. \nIt is about the future of our Nation. We were not elected to ignore \nthese problems but rather to confront them. Congress can and should do \nwhat Kansans do: Make decisions based on solid values and be held \naccountable for those decisions.\n  A few weeks ago, the International Monetary Fund issued a report \noutlining how serious our financial situation has become. America \nwasn't the only country that came under scrutiny by the IMF. Japan has \nalso fallen behind in its deficit goals. To make matters worse, \nStandard & Poor's downgraded Japan's credit rating out of concern for \nthe country's ability to tackle their debt. If we do not face realities \nand take serious steps now to confront this challenge, we will find \nourselves in a similar position. The impact will be disastrous, as it \nhas been in Greece and Portugal and Ireland.\n  Unfortunately, this reality has not yet sunk in in enough places here \nin Washington, DC. President Obama asked Congress to increase the debt \nceiling--allowing our country to take on even more debt. But it would \nbe irresponsible to allow more spending without a serious plan in place \nto reduce the deficit. Americans are looking for leadership in \nWashington to help create jobs and get our economy back on its feet. \nBut lately, all they have heard is a lot of partisan rhetoric, and all \nthey have seen is more government spending.\n  It is time for our government to change direction and to change \ndramatically. We must work together to restrain spending and to put in \nplace progrowth measures that create jobs by saying both no to more \nspending and yes to projobs measures. By saying both no to more \nspending and yes to projobs measures, we will reduce the uncertainty in \nthe marketplace, encourage business investment, become more competitive \nin the global economy, and--most importantly--create employment.\n  The best way to get our spending under control is to get a budget and \nstick to it. One of the basic responsibilities of Congress is to \nproduce an annual budget, yet we are once again operating under a \ntemporary spending measure called a continuing resolution because the \nDemocratic leadership failed to pass a budget plan last year. Congress \nhas taken virtually no step to address this deficit spending. We have \nto come together and see that we do so, and we must pass a commonsense \nbudget that reduces our deficit this year, next year, and well into the \nfuture.\n  Last month, President Obama sent his 2012 budget message to Congress. \nInstead of moving toward fiscal responsibility, the proposal contains \nmore of the same borrow-and-spend mentality. It proposes $8.7 trillion \nin new spending, $1.6 trillion in new taxes, and doubles the national \ndebt by the end of his 4-year term. At no point during the President's \n10-year budget projection would our government spend less than it is \ntaking in.\n  Rather than spend more, we must close the gap between what the \ngovernment takes in and what it spends. Last month, I introduced the \nRESET Act to rescind $45 billion in unspent stimulus funds and direct \nthose dollars toward paying down the deficit.\n  Another commonsense measure I have long supported is a constitutional \namendment to require a balanced budget. Unfortunately, when Members of \nCongress are not required to prioritize their spending, they simply \nborrow more over a long period of time. This proposal--this \nconstitutional amendment--would limit Federal spending to 20 percent of \ngross domestic product and require a two-thirds majority of Congress to \nraise the taxes. By forcing Congress to be disciplined, to live within \na budget, we will turn away from record deficits and back to fiscal \nresponsibility.\n\n[[Page S1520]]\n\n  In addition to living by a responsible budget, we must also address \nour long-term unfunded liabilities, including Social Security, \nMedicare, and Medicaid. Last year, mandatory spending made up 56 \npercent of our entire budget. This percentage will only increase in the \nyears ahead as more Americans retire and fewer workers are there to \nreplace them. Already, Social Security pays out more than it collects \nand its total debt will increase over $\\1/2\\ trillion in the next 10 \nyears. Medicaid spending consumes nearly a quarter of State budgets and \nwill further burden States that are now required to pay for the vast \nMedicaid expansion found in the recent health care reform law. \nFurthermore, Medicare's unfunded liabilities are $37 trillion. This \nstaggering sum is nearly three times the amount of our current national \ndebt.\n  This challenge cannot be ignored any longer. We must pursue change \nand reform, but it will take the leadership of President Obama and the \nwillingness of both political parties. We are ready to have that \nconversation with the President and we expect his leadership.\n  Finally, history shows economic growth starts with the private \nsector, so Congress must create an environment where entrepreneurship \nand business can flourish. Small businesses are the backbone of the \nAmerican economy and have generated 65 percent of the new jobs over the \nlast two decades. They also employ half our private-sector workers. \nClearly, small business is the engine of job creation and critical to \nour country's economic success.\n  As I tour plants in Kansas, business owners say: What next? What next \nharmful thing is Washington, DC, going to do that puts me out of \nbusiness? For too long, Washington has increased the regulatory and tax \nburden on businesses at the expense of jobs. Mountains of government \nregulations and higher taxes are undercutting any efforts to create \njobs and erodes our global competitiveness, especially in the \nmanufacturing, agricultural, and energy sectors. Rather than hiring new \nworkers, businesses are spending their resources on complying with \never-changing regulations and increased taxes or, worse, those \nbusinesses are leaving our country.\n  We need to be doing all we can to put people back to work and grow \nthe economy, and that includes replacing our convoluted Tax Code and \neliminating bureaucratic intrusion into our free market economy.\n  Maintaining a strong business environment at home must be coupled \nwith opening new foreign markets for American goods and agricultural \ncommodities around the world. In today's global economy, we cannot \nafford to sit on the sidelines while other countries move forward. Each \nday that passes, we risk losing more of our markets and our market \nshare to competing nations.\n  Across our country, thousands of Americans depend upon exports for \njobs, including more than one-fourth of all manufacturing workers in \nKansas. By increasing our Nation's exports, we will create jobs and \nopportunities for all Americans, without raising taxes or increasing \nthe Federal budget. While our Nation's unemployment rate hovers between \n9 and 10 percent, it is simply inexcusable to not do what we know we \ncan do that will create jobs in America.\n  One commonsense way to open more markets is to pass trade agreements \nwith Colombia, Panama, and South Korea, which have been stalled in \nCongress. While Congress dithers, Colombia has moved forward on trade \ndeals with Canada, Chile, the EU, Brazil, and Argentina--to name a few \nof our competitors. Comparably, tariffs have caused American farmers to \nlose nearly 20 percent of total agricultural markets in Colombia over \nthe last 5 years. It is past time to pass these trade agreements and \ncreate more markets and, therefore, more jobs for Americans.\n  For the United States to remain competitive in a global market, \nCongress must also develop a comprehensive energy policy that allows \nfor an ample energy supply which is both affordable and reliable. \nRising gas prices and recent events in the Middle East have \ndemonstrated once again the importance of having access to a reliable \nenergy supply. No simple form of energy can provide the answer. To meet \nour country's energy needs we must develop traditional sources of oil, \nnatural gas, and coal, encourage the development of renewable energy \nsources such as biofuels, wind, solar, geothermal, and hydropower, \nexpand the use of nuclear energy, and encourage conservation.\n  Lastly, we need to repeal the flawed health care law and replace it \nwith commonsense changes that reduce increasing costs and promote \nchoice in our health care system, such as increasing competition in the \ninsurance market, giving States the flexibility to address the health \nneeds of their unique populations, enacting medical liability reform, \nand enabling small businesses to pool together to offer coverage at \nlower prices. These ideas have bipartisan support and are backed by the \nAmerican people because we know they will work.\n  Congress should be an ally of the people, not an adversary. Congress \nhas a responsibility to create an environment where the free market can \nsucceed, so business can move forward with confidence and start \ncreating jobs again.\n  In Washington, DC, it is often easy to forget what is most important \nin the midst of all the talk of partisan politics, the next election or \nthe latest poll. When I need a reminder, I will talk a walk--and I will \nwalk from this magnificent Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial. Between \nthose two points, I pass the World War II Memorial, the Vietnam Wall, \nand on the way back I will walk by the Korean War Memorial. These \nmemorials to our citizen soldiers help put everything in its proper \nperspective. Our freedoms are so important that our Nation's sons and \ndaughters were willing to risk their lives to defend and protect them. \nThese brave men and women didn't sacrifice for Republicans or \nDemocrats; they gave their lives for the greater good of our country \nand to ensure their children and grandchildren would also experience \nAmerican freedom and liberty.\n  We have before us an opportunity--an opportunity to set aside the \ngame of politics and to work together to confront the enormous \nchallenges before us. Whether we have the courage to tackle our fiscal \ncrisis now will determine the course of our country's future for the \nnext generation.\n  I stand ready to work with my colleagues in this chamber to do what \nit takes to get our economy back on track. Americans are known for \ntheir enterprising spirit and strong resolve, and our country will \nrecover when we begin to live within our means and create a pro-growth \nbusiness and jobs environment.\n  Last month, we recognized the 100th anniversary of President Ronald \nReagan's birth. It was a fitting time for all Americans to honor the \nmemory of a man whose leadership guided our country through many \nchallenges. Our 40th President believed in the greatness of America. He \nbelieved in the principles of individual liberty, self-government and \nfree enterprise. And he believed there ``are no limits to growth and \nhuman progress when men and women are free to follow their dreams.''\n  It is with that same optimism and hope for the future that I stand \nbefore you today. I didn't come to Washington for personal glory. I \ncame to Washington because I believe we have the responsibility to be \ngood stewards of what we have been given and to pass on to the next \ngeneration the life we love and lead. We know what American can and \nshould look like.\n  When I took the oath of office, I pledged to support and defend the \nUnited States Constitution and to faithfully fulfill the duties of this \noffice--so help me God. I will continue to seek His help and His \nguidance in the days ahead, knowing that in Him all things are \npossible.\n  As I humbly begin my new responsibilities, I remain committed to \nleading with Kansas common sense, and to making the tough choices \nnecessary today, so that tomorrow--and every day thereafter--our \nchildren and grandchildren can live in an America that provides them \nthe opportunity to dream big and pursue those dreams.\n  If I am successful, I will have fulfilled my responsibilities. If I \nam successful, I will have fulfilled my responsibilities as a parent, \njust like my mom and dad, and as an American who believes our country's \nbetter and brighter days lie ahead.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n\n[[Page S1521]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio).

Mr. President, we had two important votes yesterday on \nwhat we are going to do about the surging debt this Nation is incurring \nand the dangers that debt poses to the future health of our economy, \nthe prosperity of our people, and the employment of our people.\n  We had a debt crisis, a financial crisis in 2007, that we still have \nnot recovered from. It damaged us. It damaged American individuals. \nThere are people unemployed in large numbers because of that. We have \nnot yet recovered from it. We have some growth, but we have not yet \ncome out of it. We have to deal with it in a serious way.\n  So the proposal was, as passed by the House, to reduce the spending \nfor the rest of the 7 months in this fiscal year ending September 30 by \n$61 billion. Our colleagues in the Senate basically proposed to do \nnothing, a $4.6 billion reduction in spending over the rest of this \nfiscal year. That is an unacceptable number. Perhaps we can disagree \nover where cuts ought to occur, but it is critically important at this \ntime in history, as I will discuss, that we take real action that sends \na message and actually saves money, not Washington speak about saving \nmoney, but real savings in money.\n  We can do that. Every city, county, and State is doing that all over \nthe country, and far bigger reductions in spending than we are \ndiscussing here. So the House proposal was to reduce discretionary \nspending $61 billion, which is about a 6-percent reduction in the \nplanned spending level. That is not going to destroy our country. It is \nstill well above the levels we were spending in 2008. But that $61 \nbillion, when calculated over 10 years because it reduces the baseline \nof our government spending, would calculate a net savings of $862 \nbillion, counting interest, because it is that $61 billion every year \nplus the interest. We pay interest on the debt we are running up.\n  We started out projecting a $1.3 trillion deficit this year, the \nlargest in the history of the Republic. But now the scores have gone \nup, and we are looking at over 1.6. We spend $3.8 trillion, but we are \nbringing in only $2.2 trillion. This is why 40 percent of what we are \nspending this year is borrowed.\n  We have an opportunity now; this CR is it. We need to reduce spending \nnow. People say, well, we can wait. We do not want to reduce spending \nfor some of our favorite programs. This is damaging. We hear the old \nspeeches that sound like they were given 20 years ago about any \nproposal to cut any spending level is seen as some total disaster, \nsuggesting that the Republic will cease to exist. Of course, Americans \nknow that is not so. They are not buying that. What world are we in?\n  The President submitted a budget that basically does nothing but \ncontinue the increases in spending. We just had the State Department in \nthe Budget Committee. I am ranking Republican on the Budget Committee. \nThey are asking for a 10.5-percent increase in the State Department's \nspending. The Department of Education was in last week. They want 11 \npercent. The Department of the Interior was in. The President proposes \na 9.5-percent increase in their spending.\n  Increases in 2012, that is their proposal. What world are they in? \nWhat about Transportation? Do you know how much they proposed \nincreasing Transportation? Sixty-two percent. What world are we \noperating in? People say: You are just exaggerating. It is business as \nusual. We do not have to make any changes. We need to make investments, \nSessions. This country needs to have more investments. The State \nDepartment had a 33-percent increase in 2 years. The Education \nDepartment had a 30-percent increase. I mean, when does it stop?\n  If we reduce some of the increases that have been obtained, is that a \nreal cut or is it just moving back to a more sane level? That is what \nit does. But when we do not have money, we have to make tough \ndecisions.\n  So, again, the question is, Are we just raising this politically? Are \nwe just trying to make a political point or is there really something \nthat is happening in America that is dangerous and requires us to take \nthis step whether or not we want to take it? Are we required to? Is it \nreal? Do we have a crisis that is dangerous for us?\n  Mr. Erskine Bowles and Mr. Alan Simpson, Senator Simpson--Mr. Bowles \nwas President Clinton's Chief of Staff--were appointed by President \nObama to cochair the debt commission that did their report. This is \nwhat they said the day before yesterday, both of them. This was their \nsigned joint statement to the Budget Committee the day before \nyesterday:\n\n       We believe that if we do not take decisive action, our \n     Nation faces the most predictable economic crisis in its \n     history.\n\n  Are these extremists? They spent months studying the crisis the \nNation is in and what it takes to get us out of it. They proposed some \nsubstantial changes in what we are doing. Just yesterday they said: We \nare facing a crisis, the most predictable the Nation has ever faced in \nits history.\n  In other words, we can see it coming. People say: Oh, it will not \nhappen to us. Well, they should probably pick up the book, ``This Time \nIs Different,'' by Professor Rogoff at Harvard and Reinhart at \nMaryland, one of our other great universities. And their book proposes \nand shows how governments, sovereigns, get into financial trouble and \nhow quickly bad things can happen. The title of it should tell you \nsomething. The title is, ``This Time Is Different.''\n  The title suggests that all of these great financiers in these \ncountries that ran up too much debt never thought it was going to \nhappen to them, and when people raised questions, they said: Do not \nworry, this time is different.\n  Well, is this an extreme book? Is this a dangerous book? They say \nwhen your debt, based on history and worldwide studies, reaches 90 \npercent of your total economy, your total debt equals 90 percent of \nyour GDP, your economy, on average, loses 1 percent growth and is at \nrisk of a catastrophic adjustment, some sort of crisis.\n  Well, what percent of GDP are we now? We have gone over 95 percent. \nThe experts tell us by September 30, when this fiscal year ends, we \nwill be at 100 percent of GDP. So is this some sort of fearmongering \ntalk or are we just dealing with reality? Are we really facing a crisis \nwe can see plainly in front of us? I suggest it is.\n  Mr. Geithner, President Obama's Secretary of the Treasury--unlike his \nBudget Director who also testified before the Budget Committee, Mr. \nGeithner was more frank when asked: Do you agree with the Rogoff study? \nIs that a sound study? ``Yes, I believe it is.''\n  Then he said this, frankly: ``I think it understates the risks.'' \nUnderstates the risk. And when asked about that, he said, basically, \nthere can be systemic, immediate shocks that occur that are \nunpredictable just like in 2007 when all of a sudden we went from a \nboom to a bust, and as things happened in Greece, Ireland, and Iceland \nthese things can happen in this modern world with electronic financial \ntransfers very quickly.\n  I believe we can prevent this. I believe we can prevent it. But we \nhave to take action or we are heading in the wrong direction. Did you \nnotice the news yesterday? Bill Gross, who runs the world's biggest \nbond fund at Pacific Investment Management, announced they had totally \neliminated U.S. Government-related debt from their flagship fund, as \nthe United States Government projected record deficits.\n  So that is a big development, frankly. I mean, he manages more money \nthan anybody in the world--I guess in the history of the world. He has \neliminated government debt from the Total\n\n[[Page S1522]]\n\nReturn Fund, and that was just announced.\n  So is that something we should be concerned about? I think it is. \nBecause who is going to buy our debt? Who will buy our Treasury bonds, \nnow 10-year bonds, at 3.5 percent or so interest? People who get \nworried about their debt sell their bonds. Who is going to then buy \nthem? Where are we going to get people to buy our bonds without paying \nhigher and higher interest rates?\n  Well, is our crisis coming upon us? Let me share with you the \ntestimony that Mr. Simpson and Mr. Bowles gave to the Budget Committee \njust 2 days ago.\n  This is what Mr. Bowles said, Cochairman appointed by President \nObama. He is very worried.\n\n       This problem is going to happen. It is a problem we're \n     going to have to face up to in maybe 2 years, maybe a little \n     less, maybe a little more.\n\n  He is talking about a crisis. He said it is the most predictable \ncrisis the Nation has ever faced. He is pleading with us to get off the \nunsustainable path we are on.\n  What about Alan Simpson, the distinguished Senator from Wyoming who \nis so frank and articulate. He is also a delight to hear. He said:\n\n       I think it will come before 2 years . . . I'm just saying \n     at some point, I think within a year, at the end of the year, \n     if they [the people who hold our debt] just thought you're \n     playing with fluff--5, 6, 7 percent of this hole--they're \n     going to say, ``I want some money for my paper.'' And if \n     there is anything money guys love, it's money. And money \n     guys, when they start losing money, panic. And let me tell \n     you, they will. It won't matter what the government does, \n     they'll say, ``I want my money, I've got a better place for \n     it . . . '' Just saying for me, it won't be a year.\n\n  Mr. President, we have a time agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time expired some time ago. The \ntime is limited to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair. I ask unanimous consent for 2 \nadditional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. This is from the Washington Post, late January:\n\n       In an analysis of the U.S. debt last week, S analysts \n     said the unthinkable could occur unless U.S. officials take \n     action.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       U.S. officials must act quickly to control government \n     deficits or face slower growth and even more difficult \n     choices in the future, the International Monetary Fund said \n     Thursday in a report criticizing the tepid U.S. response to \n     its rising debt.\n\n  Admiral Mullen, Chairman of Joint Chiefs:\n\n       I believe that our debt is the greatest threat to our \n     national security.\n\n  Secretary Hillary Clinton, Secretary of State:\n\n       Secretary of State Hillary Clinton waded into the nation's \n     fiscal debate Wednesday, calling the expected $1.3 trillion \n     U.S. deficit ``a message of weakness internationally.''\n\n  Clinton says the deficit is a national security threat. It was $1.3 \ntrillion when she said that in September. The projected deficit now is \n$1.6 trillion-plus. Secretary Geithner said the same.\n  We have had a debate. We had 10 Democrats defect from the Democratic \nbill that did nothing, saying we needed to go further. We had two \nRepublicans defect. One Independent defected, probably thought it was \ncutting too much. But the majority of Members seemed to be saying we \nneed to reduce more.\n  I suggest that our leaders get together. If there is a disagreement \nabout where the reductions ought to occur, so be it. Let's work that \nout. But we need to reduce spending significantly. The House number is \na minimal amount. I believe it will send a message to the Bill Grosses \nof the world who move billions of dollars around that this country is \nwilling to take action, even tough action, to get off this \nunsustainable path.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Sanders pertaining to the introduction of S. 552 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. SANDERS.

Madam President, last week I spoke on five of the \nsteps we need to take to increase domestic oil production. Today I wish \nto take a few moments to speak more broadly about our Nation's energy \npolicy as a whole, what the proper goals for such a policy should be, \nand the false choice between increased domestic production and reduced \noil consumption.\n  Energy policy has repeatedly been brought up as an area where this \nCongress and this President can find common ground. Knowing something \nactually needs to be done, however, is no guarantee it will be done. \nThe truth is most of us know we can improve in the area of energy. With \noil prices at above $100 a barrel and the price at the pump heading \ntoward $4 a gallon, we need to develop a coherent national energy \npolicy to find that common ground, and that need has taken on even \ngreater urgency.\n  So what makes for good energy policy and how can we ensure that \nagreement is finally reached on meaningful energy legislation? I think \nwe should have essentially five goals, and those five goals are: an \nenergy that is abundant, affordable, clean, diverse, and domestic. I \nrealize these words, especially in combination with one another, don't \nlend themselves to a clever acronym or a catchy slogan, so maybe we \nneed to rearrange them and figure out what word we can make. But if we \nfollow these as our guiding principles and make sure our legislative \nefforts reflect each and every one, I believe genuine progress can be \nwithin our reach. So let's start with the concept of affordable energy, \nbecause that is certainly the most relevant topic right now.\n  Times such as these serve as a wakeup call as to how important \nenergy--and particularly affordable domestic energy--is to our Nation. \nEnergy provides the base of everything we do; not just heat and power \nand light and transportation, but the food we eat, the clothes we \nwear--everything. Whether for a server farm or for a soybean farm, \nabundant and affordable energy is the foundation for a robust economy. \nBut, unfortunately, there seem to be those who feel the key to clean \nenergy is to make energy scarce and expensive. We don't need an \nexperiment or an act of Congress to know an economic recession reduces \nemissions, and a depression, of course, would even do that more so. The \ncurrent price of oil is a stark reminder that while making energy \nscarce and expensive may, in fact, reduce our emissions, it is an even \nmore effective way to crush an economic recovery. That is not good for \nus.\n  The President has proposed we should raise the taxes on oil \ncompanies, but in the middle of tough economic times, the American \npeople are not open to those policies that will increase their energy \ncosts. There is a better path that would do more to bolster our energy \nsecurity, more to create jobs, more to generate government revenues \nand, equally, more to reduce our deficit. Instead of punishing one \nindustry to promote another, let's use our tremendous reserves of \nconventional resources which account for more than 80 percent of our \nenergy supply. Let's use these to fund the next generation of clean \ntechnologies. Let's prove up and produce our resources and then put \nthese revenues toward--whether it is tax incentives, whether it is \nadditional research, whether it is studies at our universities, you \nname it, but let's use these wisely.\n  Speaking specifically to the regulatory burdens on energy, I think we \nall recognize the Clean Air Act has made our air cleaner and certainly \nimproved our health. Carbon monoxide, SOX, NOX, \nand a host of other pollutants have largely been removed from \nsmokestack and tailpipe emissions. I think we recognize there is more \nwe can do in terms of the regulation of HFCs and other greenhouse gases \nwhich, while they emit much lesser quantities, they certainly have \npotent greenhouse effects. But the Clean Air\n\n[[Page S1523]]\n\nAct is not the proper legal framework for regulation of carbon dioxide, \nwhich is emitted in huge quantities by almost every human activity and \nwhose effect cannot be confined to a nonattainment area, and which, in \nitself, is not harmful to health. All of us want a cleaner energy \nsupply, but the approach taken over the last several years seems to \nhave been one of all or nothing instead of the all-of-the-above \napproach, and I think it has been counterproductive. We need to seek \nout and accept policies that will lead to steady progress.\n  We don't yet know the best way to provide energy that is clean and \nabundant and affordable, but what we do know is there is a whole myriad \nof opportunities. We have oil and natural gas; we have wind; we have \nsolar; we have hydro; we have geothermal. We have coal, biofuels, \nfission, fusion. Just naming the types of energy and the subcategories \nwithin energy is a whole floor speech in and of itself. Whether it \nturns out to be fireflies we collect in a bottle or something we simply \nhaven't even imagined yet, we don't know what source or what \ncombination of sources will actually turn out to be best for America. \nThat should be cause for those of us here in Congress to be \nextraordinarily careful in trying to predetermine what sources should \neither win or lose. We are always talking around here about we need to \nsteer clear of picking winners and losers, and yet it seems that is \nwhat we do all the time. A diversity of energy sources provides the \nbest proving ground and insurance against overreliance on any one \nsource, and a healthy economy provides the best demand for the cleanest \nsources available.\n  Winston Churchill once said:\n\n       On no one quality, on no one process, on no one country, on \n     no one route, and on no one field must we be dependent. \n     Safety and certainty in oil lie in variety and variety alone.\n\n  Winston Churchill was talking about oil, but his words are just as \napplicable to our need for diversity in all of our types of energy.\n  Finally, the need to make our energy domestic to the greatest degree \npossible is something we have all known--we all know we need to do \nthis--but we have failed to do anything about it for decades. It \nshouldn't take an upheaval in North Africa to convince us that sending \nbillions of dollars a day out of our economy to countries that are not \nour friends is a bad idea.\n  We know it is a bad idea. Yet we continue year after year after year. \nWe need to focus on two parallel tracks: increased domestic production \nand decreased consumption. We absolutely should reduce our dependence \non oil. In our early days of the automobile, we saw a wide range of \nexperiments as inventors and entrepreneurs strove to find the best \napproach. Again, I think we are on the verge of a renaissance in \nvehicle technologies where we explore electric vehicles, biofuels, fuel \ncells, efficient diesels, natural gas, propane, and other approaches. \nBut for right now, today, we use 20 million barrels of oil a day, and \nfor the vast majority of its uses there is no imminent substitute.\n  I said last week in my comments that for the sake of our national \neconomy, for the sake of our Nation's security, and for the sake of the \nworld's environment, we should produce at home the highest possible \npercentage of the oil we do consume.\n  Domestic production is currently being stifled by those who engage in \nwhat I guess you would call magical thinking--that if only we stop \nproducing oil in the United States, then the world's need for oil is \ngoing to go away and Skittles are going to fall from the sky and \nunicorns will prance in the streets. It is just not real.\n  The harsh reality is our foreign oil dependence contributes to \nconflicts where young men and women die or come home without limbs, and \nwe wreck our economy. There always will be future conflicts in the \nworld, whether in the Middle East or elsewhere. As a nation, we will \nhave to decide on our proper role in each. We can and should do \neverything possible, however, to eliminate foreign oil dependence as a \nstrategic consideration.\n  Madam President, none of this is due to America running out of oil. \nIn Alaska, my home State, we have estimated reserves in excess of 65 \nyears' worth of Persian Gulf imports. So, again, in Alaska alone--one \nState--we have reserves in excess of 65 years of what we take from the \nPersian Gulf. There are also, of course, tremendous reserves in other \nStates and, of course, offshore.\n  For decades, opponents of domestic production have argued that we \nshould not produce more because we are not going to see this come \nonline for years to come. If, 20 years ago, or even 10 years ago we had \nignored those who had said ANWR was unacceptable because it would take \na decade to develop, we would now, at this point in time, be enjoying \nanother 1 million barrels of domestic production per day. But we said, \n10 years ago, 20 years ago, it is going to take too long to bring that \nANWR oil online, so we just ought not do it. Look where it puts us \ntoday.\n  Opponents also like to say that a policy of increased domestic \nproduction will have no immediate effect on oil prices. We don't even \nwant to waste time arguing the folly of trying to dismiss good national \nenergy policy because it is long term. I also note that using the \nStrategic Oil Reserve to mitigate high oil prices--to maybe push them \nback below $100 a barrel for a short term, a couple weeks--should be \nunacceptable to us. We need a viable long-term answer, not a short-term \nand shortsighted political alibi.\n  There is nothing that OPEC fears more than America committing to the \ntwin tracks of increased domestic production and reduced consumption. \nWere we to do so, we would see OPEC doing everything in their power to \ndrive down world oil prices to make us abandon our policies and, once \nagain, hamstring ourselves and make us reliant upon them for our oil.\n  I want to offer an important perspective. Even if we cannot accept \nthat America increasing production and decreasing consumption would \naffect global oil prices, remember, price is not the only reason to \nadvance such a policy. Right now, the high price of oil works against \nAmerica, and it works for every nation that deliberately produces its \nreserves. Production provides them with jobs, it provides them with \nrevenue for their government, and it provides better trade balances and \nnational security, but all at our country's expense.\n  We are the only country that has identified a huge resource base and \nthen absolutely refused to produce it. So often we hear on this floor \ndiscussion about China eating our lunch in clean energy, about Japan \nand Germany outpacing us in wind and solar technology. But does anybody \nthink if those countries had a Gulf of Mexico or an ANWR, they would \nnot be drilling in those areas as we speak? Does anyone think those \nnations demagog nuclear power or refuse to permit coal plants? Their \nenergy policies are on a better track than ours. They are not just \nlooking at what is happening today; they are looking at tomorrow, at \ntoday--they have an energy policy that carries them out.\n  There is an article in the Wall Street Journal of yesterday by Nansen \nSaleri. He concludes his article with this statement:\n\n       The U.S. does not have an energy problem. It has an energy \n     strategy problem.\n\n  Think about that. It is not lacking the resources; it is the strategy \nfor how we develop our energy resources.\n  During his campaign, President Obama liked to quote Dr. Martin Luther \nKing and talk about ``the fierce urgency of now.'' There are few issues \nmore important or more fundamental to our Nation's long-term success \nthan a viable energy policy. People are very correct when they say that \nparts of this will take time, and parts will take a longer period of \ntime. But now is never more fiercely urgent than when we have such an \nimportant and long journey ahead of us. If we are ever going to take \ncontrol of our energy future, now is the time to come together and \nsupport policies that promote abundant, affordable, clean, diverse, and \ndomestic energy. It is critically important to us.\n  I look forward to these conversations that we will continue on the \nSenate floor as we talk about ways we not only work to reduce our \nbudget, ways we not only work to create jobs in this country, but ways \nthat we truly build a strategic energy policy for the long-term for \nthis country.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S1524]]\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/10/senate-section/article/S1524-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1524-S1525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            GASOLINE PRICES\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I wish to talk about gasoline prices and \nenergy. Just a few years ago, this Nation was in the middle of an \nenergy crisis not unlike the one we are in today. Back then Nevadans \nwere confronted with record prices at the gas pump, and this body did \nnothing to relieve their burden.\n  When I joined my colleagues to demand that we explore our own \ndomestic energy possibilities, the call fell on deaf ears. In May of \n2007, I said that ``moving America toward energy independence needs to \nbe more than a bumper sticker and a campaign slogan.'' Unfortunately, \nit remained just that.\n  Campaign promises to protect our Nation's security interests remain \non the campaign trail, and cheers at political rallies to increase \nAmerica's energy independence are left behind with deflated balloons \nand forgotten confetti. Well, here we are. My colleagues on this side \nwarned against what an unstable Middle East could mean for our gasoline \nneeds. Yet, today, what are we witnessing? Turmoil in that region and \nescalating gasoline prices at home once again.\n  Unfortunately, this time around, our economy is also in trouble. My \nState of Nevada has continued to suffer the most during this recession, \nand economists are not predicting a quick turnaround anytime soon.\n  The problem with this new energy crisis is that a record number of \npeople in Nevada and around the country are now without jobs and \nwithout homes. So how are they supposed to afford $4-a-gallon gasoline \nor maybe even $5-a-gallon gasoline at the pump? I will tell you simply, \nthey cannot afford this.\n\n  Recent unrest in Egypt, Libya, and other countries has forced gas \nprices to rise nearly 40 cents a gallon in the recent weeks. For those \nstruggling in my State, that is verging on unfavorable. For those who \nare worse off, it already is. The price of gas is at a 2-year high. The \naverage price of a gallon of gasoline in America is now $3.52. When \nPresident Obama first took office, the average price for a gallon of \ngasoline was $1.84. That is a 91-percent increase. What are we doing? \nNothing. In Nevada, gas prices are rising and are now above $3.60 a \ngallon. The biggest concern with the rising cost of gasoline is that it \ntranslates into higher prices at the grocery store, utility bills, and \nvirtually everything we do.\n  I have spoken at length over the past few years about people in my \nState who are being forced to decide between paying the rent or putting \nfood on the table to feed their families. But what are they going to do \nif they can afford to do either? This is a sad thought for me but a \nreality for many others.\n  Throughout this economic downturn, Members from both sides of the \naisle have come to the floor to talk about people in their home States \nwho are suffering. Philosophical differences aside, both parties have \nput forth legislation that they believe will help the economic plight \nof many Americans. What have we done about energy prices that threaten \nto derail recovering families? Nothing.\n  Rising gas prices affect nearly every sector of our economy. \nEverywhere we look in America today, our economy continues to be \ndirectly affected by the skyrocketing price of fuel. At a time when \nunemployment is over 14 percent in my home State and Americans are \nalready struggling financially, we can no longer allow this problem to \nbe ignored or to be set aside. We need real solutions that develop our \ndomestic energy and oil production, and we need those solutions to \ndecrease our dependence on dangerous foreign oil.\n  We send over $500 billion a year out of this country to buy foreign \noil. A lot of that money ends up financing the very people who would do \nus harm. What America needs is everything but foreign oil from \ndangerous countries. That needs to be our energy policy so that we can \nensure that the price of gas does not further cripple our crumbling \neconomy.\n  In 2008, I spoke on the Senate floor and said these following words:\n\n       The American people are looking to us for solutions. We \n     have a responsibility to make decisions here in order to \n     provide them much needed relief at home. For many months, \n     Republicans have been working to provide that relief. We have \n     been focused on a three-pronged approach: boosting renewable \n     energy and alternative energy, encouraging energy efficiency, \n     and growing our American energy supply. This line of attack \n     balances the need for us to be responsible stewards of our \n     environment with the need for reliable, affordable energy to \n     fuel our lives and our economy.\n\n  Again, that is what I said in 2008 when Republicans wanted to address \nthe need for American energy independence. But the Democratic majority \nhad other priorities.\n  We simply cannot continue to pass the buck on to another Congress and \nkick the can down the road. We need to take action, and we need to do \nit now.\n  Like the spending cuts, everything needs to be on the table when \ndiscussing American energy independence. By working to eradicate our \ndangerous dependence on foreign oil from the Middle East and Venezuela, \nwe can protect Americans from choosing between paying the rent, \nproviding food for their families, or paying for gas to drive to work.\n  What does an ``everything but dangerous foreign oil'' approach look \nlike? It means 10 billion barrels of oil from ANWR in Alaska. It means \n28 billion barrels from deep-sea exploration; about 1.8 trillion \nbarrels possibly from oil shale in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming; \ntrillions of cubic feet in American natural gas. It also means a 230-\nyear supply of coal and great potential for nuclear energy. These are \nAmerican sources of energy. If we combine those with conservation and \naggressive investment in renewable and green energy--solar, wind, \ngeothermal, hydropower, fuel cells, and electric vehicles--they are all \nkey to our American energy independence.\n  I recently visited a couple of different places in my home State of \nNevada that are producing electric cars. Those are great, but you still \nhave to produce the energy to produce the electricity to run those \nelectric cars. That is why we need this ``all of the above'' approach \nfor American energy independence.\n  My home State of Nevada is actually a shining example of many \ninnovations being made on these fronts. Nevada Solar One in Boulder \nCity is one of the largest capacity solar powerplants built in the \nworld and generates enough electricity to power at least 14,000 \nhouseholds a year. Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas has the Nation's \nbiggest photovoltaic solar power system, which supplies 30 percent of \nthe energy used at the base. Henderson has Nevada's first solar \ncommunity, where each home has a rooftop solar electric system. Late in \n2007, Ausra, Inc., selected Las Vegas as the site for the first U.S. \nmanufacturing plant for solar thermal power systems. The world's third \nlargest geothermal power producer is headquartered in Reno, NV. And \nNevada is home to the only associate degree program in the Nation in \nenergy efficiency. It is absurd to think that people in Nevada are \ngoing to be crippled by increasing prices at the gas pump at the same \ntime that our State is leading the way in renewable energy innovation \nsimply because Congress will not act to address this crisis.\n  Throughout this last year, bills were passed filled with unintended \nconsequences because every dip in the economy was deemed by some to be \na crisis that required an immediate solution. Yet we knowingly continue \nto ignore the energy crisis that will continue to plague our country \nevery time the Middle East cannot get along.\n  According to the Department of Energy, oil is the source of more than \n40 percent of our total energy demands and more than 99 percent of the \nfuel we use in our cars and trucks.\n  The Senator from Alaska, Ms. Murkowski, was just on the floor talking \nabout how we all want to transition to a more green economy. But the \nfact is, that is going to be years and even decades away, so we have to \nhave American sources of energy here now.\n  The United States consumed about 19 billion barrels of petroleum \nproducts a day in 2009. We receive over half of this oil--51 percent--\nfrom foreign sources, predominantly from the Middle East, Africa, and \nCentral America. We cannot continue to ignore this issue. Inaction is \nno longer an option.\n\n[[Page S1525]]\n\n  The Obama administration's approach to developing domestic energy \nproduction has been to impose regulations, withdraw permits, and shut \noff access to lands that contain valuable oil and natural gas deposits. \nIn addition, the EPA is currently regulating domestic energy resources \nfor greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. We can no longer \nafford organizations, such as the EPA, claiming authority to cut off \nour access to resources because of arbitrary rules based on unsound \nscience. These backdoor climate regulations could increase the cost of \ngasoline and electricity by 50 percent. These policies work to promote \nour dependence on foreign oil, and they do nothing to reduce the cost \nfor ordinary Americans.\n  Ten billion barrels in ANWR in Alaska means that not drilling is not \nan option. ANWR is roughly the size of South Carolina, but drilling in \nANWR will only be about the size of McCarran Airport in the city of Las \nVegas. That is about 2,000 acres out of the size of South Carolina. If \nI had a map here, it literally would be a dot on a huge map. That is \nhow tiny an area we have to disturb to get this 10 billion barrels of \noil out of ANWR.\n  We can even access ANWR during the winter months. We can drive out on \nice roads that are 6 feet thick, and then in the spring, when \neverything starts to melt and the animals need to come out for their \nbreeding in the springtime, we can cap the wells, take all of the \nequipment out, and let nature take its course in the summer months.\n  Additionally, at least 40 billion barrels of recoverable oil in the \nNational Petroleum Reserve-Alaska and the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas \nmeans that Alaska alone can replace crude imports from the Persian Gulf \nfor nearly 65 years. Let me repeat that. New oil in Alaska can \nreplace what we import from the Persian Gulf for the next 65 years. If \nthat is not in the interest of America--our national security interests \nand our national economic interests--I don't know what is. I bet that \nis a statistic the Obama administration would rather keep hidden. As a \nmatter of fact, they are keeping it hidden because the EPA is blocking \nthe ability of Americans to go in and get those oil and natural gas \nreserves.\n\n  Also, in Louisiana, drilling for natural gas in the Haynesville Shale \nresulted in an estimated $5.7 billion in new household earnings for \nLouisiana residents in 2009, and it created over 50,000 jobs. I mention \nthis because going after American energy produces American jobs. I \nthink everybody in this Chamber agrees we need American jobs today.\n  Now we are finding that there are more reserves located in central \nLouisiana and southern Mississippi, and they may contain 7 billion more \nbarrels of natural gas. But we have also found many natural gas \nreserves in the rest of the country. Shale reserves in Pennsylvania, \nOhio, New York, Oklahoma, and West Virginia could provide us with \nliterally billions more barrels of natural gas.\n  Yet, in the midst of this abundance, the administration has strapped \ndown these reserves with regulations and too-long-to-comply-with \npermits. The solution to this situation is simple: We need to \nstreamline the process to allow America to access its own resources \nwithout the hindrance of bureaucratic redtape. If we are allowed to \nfully tap into the potential of these reserves, we will be one step \ncloser to developing affordable and environmentally safe compressed \nnatural gas vehicles. This will not only curb our reliance on dangerous \nforeign oil but also create even more jobs and put us at the forefront \nof alternative-fuel technology. By using our own natural gas reserves, \nwe can build more powerplants, improve our transportation needs through \nbuses and trucks that run on natural gas, power our fleets, and improve \nour country's ability to manufacture steel, fabric, glass, and plastic \nthat we need instead of outsourcing these jobs overseas, which is what \nhas been happening.\n  Madam President, 28 billion barrels of deep-sea oil means that the \nObama administration cannot continue to hold these reserves hostage by \nbanning deep-sea drilling. The Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic coast \nareas alone hold commercial oil reserves of 28 billion barrels of oil \nand up to 140 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. These are huge \nreserves.\n  Despite the administration lifting its moratorium on permits late \nlast year, only one deepwater well permit has been issued in the last \n11 months--only one. We can and we must do better than this.\n\n  Yesterday, it was reported that the Obama administration will issue \nanother handful of deepwater drilling permits in the near future. Of \ncourse, this comes at a time when the administration is appealing a \nruling from a Federal court that has ordered the administration to act \non the permits that have been pending and that have been virtually \nignored.\n  Secretary Salazar, in a Senate subcommittee hearing just yesterday, \nsaid oil production in the gulf will not drop significantly as a result \nof the administration's delay. He said we ``may see a blip.'' Well, \nthis country cannot afford to see a downward blip. As a matter of fact, \nwe need to see an upward tick. We need to see more production coming \nout of the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Recently, Senator Vitter drafted his No Cost Stimulus Plan, as he \ncalls it--or his 3 Ds. Those 3 Ds are domestic energy, domestic jobs, \nand reducing the deficit. This bill aims to increase our ability to \naccess domestic energy sources to increase our energy independence. It \nwould use these domestic energy sources to create thousands of real, \nprivate-sector, long-term jobs in areas such as my State, where we have \nthe potential to lead the Nation in renewable energy.\n  In 2009, the Obama administration canceled 77 oil and gas leases in \nUtah, and in 2010 it canceled another 61 oil and gas leases in Montana. \nThis is astounding to me because now, instead of acting on American \nenergy independence, we are trying to stifle the progress we are \nmaking. Senator Vitter's legislation would direct the Obama \nadministration to reinstate oil and gas leases that were canceled and \nto open ANWR to oil production.\n  Senator Vitter's legislation would also establish an ANWR alternative \nenergy trust fund so we can pay for renewable energy development with \nour own money instead of borrowing money from China and Saudi Arabia \nand others to do it. The bill also restricts the EPA from imposing \nregulations that cut off our access to oil and gas resources instead of \nutilizing them.\n  We have been talking about the debt on this floor and overspending. \nWe need legislation to go after American energy. By the way, this \nlegislation would not cost us any money. As a matter of fact, it brings \nin money to the U.S. Treasury because we get royalties off of American \nenergy. That is the direction in which the Senate, the House, and the \nPresident needs to take our country--less dependence on foreign oil, \nmore American security from an energy independence standpoint, more \neconomic security, and more military security as well.\n  Republicans have solutions and we are eager to start this debate, but \nwe need the majority to bring these bills to the floor of the Senate. \nThe issues are too critical for us to delay. We can't afford to let \ngasoline continue to go up and up and up, to $4, $5, who knows where it \nis going to stop.\n  Unfortunately, President Clinton vetoed the bill that would have \nopened ANWR back in the mid-1990s. I think we were one vote short in \npassing the ability to open ANWR when President Bush was President. \nThis body failed by one vote. That is unfortunate, because if we had \nopened ANWR, we wouldn't be in nearly as bad shape as we are in today. \nBut it isn't just ANWR, it is many other places where we can have \nAmerican energy and we need to act and we need to act now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/10/senate-section/article/S1525-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1525-S1528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DEBT AND NATIONAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I rise to talk about our Nation's \nsecurity and what the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ADM Mike \nMullen, recently said is the greatest threat to America's future. He \nmentioned not too long ago that the greatest threat to America's \nnational security is our national debt, not al-Qaida or the Iranian \nnuclear threat or instability in the Middle East or Russian spies but \nour national debt.\n  That is a stunning statement, but I think it is backed up by the \nnumbers. We are more than $14 trillion in debt.\n\n[[Page S1526]]\n\nIt took 220 years of American history, up to the beginning of 2009 and \nwith 43 American Presidents, to pile up $6.3 trillion in publicly held \ndebt. Under the Obama administration's latest budget, we will double \nthat in another 2 years and triple it in 10. That budget calls for a \nsizable annual deficit every single year for the next 10 years. The \nsmallest budget deficit we would face would be $607 billion in the year \n2015, and then our deficits would start rising again.\n  That is what the White House calls a balanced budget. I would call it \na joke, but it is no laughing matter. We just learned China holds even \nmore of our debt than the Treasury had previously thought--26 percent \nof total U.S. debt held by foreigners. The President's budget \ninevitably would add to that.\n  That crushing debt burden we are imposing on future generations will \nseriously limit their ability to live the American dream. For \ngenerations in this country, parents have sacrificed so their children \ncould have a better life, but today we are standing that tradition on \nits head. Excessive spending and debt threaten to make the next \ngeneration the first in our history to have a lower standard of living \nthan the one that came before. That was not what my parents did. My \nfather fought in World War II. He worked hard as a teacher, a coach, he \ndrove the schoolbus, ran a motel in my hometown, and basically did any \njob he could and made whatever sacrifices he needed to make in order to \nkeep our family fed, clothed, and sheltered. His father before him, my \ngrandfather, traveled to this country from Norway and worked doing hard \nlabor laying the railroad across the Plains. He started his own \nhardware store and ran it through the Depression and war until he \ncouldn't work anymore. He knew what it meant to sacrifice to take care \nof his family.\n  But today, Washington seems to be saying the generations to follow us \nwill have to sacrifice so we will not have to make the tough choices. \nWe don't want to do the hard work of living within our means, so our \nchildren and our grandchildren will just have to get by on less. Every \none of us in this Congress should be ashamed of that prospect.\n  But more than shame for what we are doing to future generations, we \nshould be alarmed about what we are doing to our economy today. That \nskyrocketing debt means a burden of uncertainty on our businesses, \nsmall and large alike. When businesses and people are uncertain if \nthere will be a fiscal crisis, they limit their investment. Added to \nthe stifling amount of overregulation coming out of Congress and the \nadministration these past 2 years, it means businesses have one more \nreason to worry about whether they can afford to add another person to \nthe payroll. That means fewer jobs.\n  One influential study, endorsed by none other than Treasury Secretary \nGeithner, found that countries with very high debt burdens suffer from \nlower economic growth rates. Median growth rates for countries with \npublic debt above roughly the 90 percent of GDP threshold are about 1 \npercent lower than otherwise. The reasons for this are simple: \nGovernment borrowing crowds out private investment. The less productive \npublic sector takes resources that could and would be better used by \nthe more productive private sector.\n  We have already crossed the dangerous 90 percent threshold--gross \ndebt was 93 percent of GDP at the end of last fiscal year and will top \nthe 100 percent barrier by the end of this fiscal year. Under the \nPresident's budget, the debt will continue to grow rapidly, eventually \nreaching 107 percent of GDP--and that is even with the gimmicks and \nquestionable assumptions the White House budget proposal contains, \nincluding what I believe are very unrealistic economic growth \nassumptions.\n  President Obama's own economic advisers have estimated that a 1-\npercent increase in GDP translates into 1 million more jobs. Many more \npeople would have jobs today if it weren't for this crushing debt \nburden.\n  We did finally have some good news last Friday about private sector \njob creation. Nobody was happier than I to see that. But the fact \nremains that the labor force participation rate in the latest \nunemployment figures was unchanged at 64.2 percent, the lowest level it \nhas been since the early 1980s. A lot of workers have been so \ndiscouraged with the lack of jobs they have simply stopped looking.\n\n  Let us not forget our recovery so far has lagged far behind past \nrecessions. At this point after the 1981-1982 recession, the economy \nhad already expanded to 10 percent. But the current recovery has only \nexpanded the economy by .14 percent. That is not good enough. We all \nknow if we don't act soon to get control of Federal spending and our \nsoaring debt, any good news will be short-lived.\n  For 2 years, the Pied Pipers of big government told us they could \nspend their way out of financial troubles; that the money was free and \nit would lead to jobs, jobs, jobs. Well, they were wrong, and 2 years \nof their policies have left us dramatically worse off. It is simple: \nToo much government spending means too much government debt. That means \na weaker economy and fewer jobs.\n  I think we are finally at the point where most people, even here in \nWashington, are willing to concede we need to get a handle on our \nspending. Even the Obama administration--the biggest spending White \nHouse in history--has finally come around to the realization that just \nmaybe we should let the credit card cool off a bit.\n  There is no better time in America's history to change course \nregarding Federal spending. We are at a moment when we are about to get \nhit by a succession of three budgetary waves. First, the end of the 2-\nweek continuing resolution on March 18. Then we will have to address \nthe debt limit sometime this spring. After we have dealt with those two \nmatters, we need to take up the budget for fiscal year 2012 because the \nnew fiscal year is only 6 months away.\n  None of those is a mystery. None of them snuck up on us. We have seen \nthem all coming. We have had plenty of warning. We have no excuse for \nbeing unprepared. I am confident we can come together and solve all \nthree of those issues. We showed we can do it with the 2-week CR, \nfinding $4 billion of spending that we could agree was not our most \nimportant national priority right now and could be cut. Thanks to the \ngreat work of our friend and colleague, Dr. Coburn, the GAO has \nconfirmed there are hundreds of billions of dollars in waste and \nduplication we can begin to scrub out of our Federal budget.\n  That is our short-term situation--those three challenges. But there \nhas also been talk of a balanced budget amendment, and I am a cosponsor \nof two balanced budget amendments. That is not a short-term fix. That \nis a long-term issue. So that is the short term and the long term.\n  In the midterm, we need to come up with additional solutions to get \nus off what I call Federal fiscal irresponsibility, budgetary \nbrinksmanship, and deficits as far as the eye can see. We need to get \nback on the path of prosperity, and that path cannot be built on \nborrowed money and reckless spending. Getting back on the right path \nwill require us to fix our broken budget process.\n  To that end, I am proud to reintroduce a bill I introduced last year \nthat would establish commonsense reforms to improve transparency and \nefficiency in our budgeting process. I am proud Senators Chambliss, \nCrapo, Inhofe, Johanns, Kirk, Portman, and Wicker have joined me in \ncosponsoring S. 439, the Deficit Reduction and Budget Reform Act of \n2011.\n  If we don't do something to fix this broken system and soon, we are \ngoing to keep getting hit by these budget waves, and sooner or later \nthey are going to sink us.\n  My proposal has three main parts. The first is budget reforms. I \npropose we start by reforming pay-go rules to prevent the double-\ncounting gimmicks that too often are used around here, particularly \nwith regard to our trust funds. We saw that double counting occur \nduring the health care debate last year, when hundreds of billions of \ndollars were doubled counted--essentially spent twice--during the \nhealth care debate.\n  My proposal would make the Federal budget a binding joint resolution \nsigned into law by the President. Today, it is a nonbinding resolution \nand routinely gets waived.\n  My proposal calls for a biannual budget timeline. There is more time\n\n[[Page S1527]]\n\nfor oversight and to see what is working doing a budget every other \nyear--during the odd-numbered years--and then during the even-numbered \nyears doing oversight. So instead of looking for ways to spend taxpayer \ndollars, we look for ways to save taxpayer dollars.\n  My proposal also calls for a legislative line-item veto. Governors \nhave it; the President should too.\n  My proposal would prevent the abuse of emergency spending \ndesignations, which, again, have become all too routine and all too \nfrequent around here, to get around spending caps.\n  My proposal calls for the creation of a new CLASS Act trigger, if \nthat new entitlement program is not solvent over a 75-year timeframe.\n  I would also modify the Medicare cost containment trigger to have \nhonest accounting with respect to revenues and savings in the new \nhealth care bill.\n  My proposal also would update the Credit Reform Act to score the \npurchases of debt, stock, equity, and capital using a discount rate \nthat incorporates market risk rather than the procedure that has been \nused in the past which, in my view, completely understates the cost of \nmany of these programs.\n  I call for a new standing joint committee of Congress for budget \ndeficit reduction. If you can believe this, there are 26 committees or \nsubcommittees that spend tax dollars and not one that saves tax \ndollars. That joint committee would be responsible for producing a bill \nto cut the deficit by at least 10 percent every budget cycle without \nraising taxes. This bill would get expedited consideration in both \nChambers of Congress and use only spending reductions, not tax \nincreases. Tax increases would be off the table. A standing committee--\nnot just issuing one report and closing up shop--its recommendations \nwould get an up-or-down vote in Congress.\n  There is a precedent for doing this. I see the Senator from West \nVirginia on the floor. Back in the 1940s, there was a Senator from West \nVirginia named Harry Byrd. As they were debating whether to raise taxes \nto fund World War II, he came up with an idea and said: Before we do \nthat, we ought to look at savings we can find in our Federal budget. So \nhe proposed a joint committee called the Joint Committee on the \nReduction of Nonessential Federal Expenditures. They went about the \nprocess of scrubbing the Federal budget to see if there might be \nsavings that could be achieved that would prevent having to raise taxes \nto fund the war effort. In the process of doing that, that committee \nachieved a great many things. It was in existence for about 30 years.\n  What this would do is draw on that precedent and create a joint \nstanding committee in the Congress that would be bicameral--10 House \nMembers, 10 Senate Members--bipartisan--10 Republicans and 10 \nDemocrats--and would have a statutory requirement each budget cycle for \ncoming up with a specified amount of savings in deficit reductions \nthrough spending reductions.\n  What would we do in the short term? This proposal would freeze and \ncap spending. It would propose a 10-year spending freeze at 2008 levels \nadjusted for inflation. After all, nondefense discretionary spending \nhas increased at an alarming rate since 2008--a 22-percent increase, \nwhen inflation has been roughly 2 percent. In other words, nondefense \ndiscretionary spending has grown in the last 2 years at 10 times the \nrate of inflation.\n  As I said, this is not a quick fix. No plan is going to solve our \nproblems overnight, and I hope we do not take seriously anyone who \nclaims to have a plan that will. But just the same, I do not think we \nshould take seriously any plan that claims that an annual deficit of \n$607 billion is the same as a balanced budget. It is not the same, and \nit is not good enough. The only thing that is good enough for our \nchildren and for the future prosperity of this great country is for us \nto get our fiscal house in order and to embrace responsible budgeting. \nWe cannot continue to spend money we do not have. We have to learn. \nLike the American people have learned to live within their means, we \nhave to learn how to tighten our belts.\n  I wish to close with a couple of statements.\n  I mentioned earlier the statement by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff, ADM Mike Mullen, with regard to the greatest threat to our \nnational security being our national debt, but I also want to quote \nwhat Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called the unexpected $1.3 \ntrillion U.S. deficit. She referred to it as a ``message of weakness \ninternationally,'' and she went on to say:\n\n       It poses a national security threat in two ways: it \n     undermines our capacity to act in our own interest, and it \n     does constrain us where constraint may be undesirable.\n\n  That is Secretary of State Hillary Clinton with regard to these year-\nover-year massive deficits we continue to run.\n  Just today, we heard that PIMCO, one of the largest mutual funds in \nthe country, has decided to dump government debt--its government debt. \nIn that story that came out today that was discussing that particular \nmove on their part, there was a quote from a gentleman, Jim Rogers, who \nis the cofounder of the Quantum Fund. He said:\n\n       U.S. Government bonds are not a safe haven. I cannot \n     conceive of lending money to the U.S. Government for 30 \n     years.\n\n  Think about that--the United States of America is being viewed \nincreasingly as an unsafe investment because of this massive debt we \nare running and what it could mean to the future with regard to \ninflation and interest rates and the health of our economy and its \nattractiveness to people not only here at home but around the world as \na place for investment.\n  We have a major problem. These are serious times. These are serious \nproblems. These are serious challenges. They require serious solutions \nand serious leadership. I hope here in the Senate we are up to that.\n  As I said before, it starts on several levels. In the near term, we \nneed to get the spending under control. We are trying to do that with \nthe discretionary spending bill that is in front of us. We need to deal \nwith the longer term issue. I hope we can pass a balanced budget \namendment. We have had votes on that in the past here in Congress, \nunsuccessfully, narrowly. But we need to put in place what so many \nStates have that require them on an annual basis to balance their \nbudgets. Then we need to put in place budget process reforms that, in \nmy view, will put more of a straitjacket on the Congress and force us \nto make more of these hard decisions.\n  I think, frankly, because we do this every year, this budget every \nyear, we get very occupied with 12 appropriations bills in the budget--\nalthough last year we did not even pass a budget, nor did we pass a \nsingle appropriations bill, which is a major failure of this Congress \nwhen you are running a $3.7 trillion enterprise called the Federal \nGovernment. But in our annual schedule, we need to provide time to do \noversight, time to look at what we can be doing not to spend more money \nbut to save money.\n  If we had a biennial budget process where we are spending money in \nodd-numbered years and doing the appropriations bills in those years, \nand then in the even-numbered years, when people go home to run for \nelection, instead of looking for ways to spend money, we are actually \nlooking for ways to save money, I think these reforms are long overdue.\n  I hope my colleagues will take seriously this issue of budget process \nreform. I know it is not glamorous subject. In fact, most people's eyes \nglaze over when we talk about budget process reform. But, in my view, \nthere is not anything we could do that would more fundamentally change \nthe way Washington works than reforming this budget process because it \ndrives everything else. If we do not start there, we are never going to \nget this issue of spending and debt under control in the long term.\n  I thank my colleagues who have cosponsored this bill. I hope there \nwill be more colleagues who will join on this bill--if not this one, \nsomething like it--that will once and for all change the way Washington \nworks by undertaking reforms in our budget process that will lead us to \ngreater fiscal responsibility and greater prosperity for future \ngenerations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from West \nVirginia.\n\n[[Page S1528]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/10/senate-section/article/S1528-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                INTEROPERABLE WIRELESS BROADBAND NETWORK\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, tomorrow is March 11. For most of us, \nthis date carries no particular significance. It does, however, reflect \nexactly 6 months before September 11. That date we do remember and will \nnot forget. It is 6 months from the anniversary of the worst terrorist \nattack ever and a day that we as a nation can never forget. It is 6 \nmonths from the date we will honor the memory of those whose lives came \nto an end and the way we came together, at least for a short period of \ntime, as a nation.\n  With that historic date approaching, I think it important that we \nhonor the tremendous bravery of all public safety officials. I believe \nthis is one of the most important issues facing the country, and it is \none we can do something about very quickly and reduce the budget \ndeficit by doing so.\n  Our police, our firefighters, our emergency medical technicians, and \nthe countless others who fought that day to keep us safe and who work \nevery day to protect us from harm--we have essentially forgotten about \nthem.\n  The 9/11 Commission specifically said that you have to have a system \nthat connected all law enforcement across this Nation in an \ninteroperable wireless system. Obviously, therefore, that is a way of \nsaying that the best and simplest way to honor them is to give them the \ntools they need to be successful, to be safe, and to do their job in a \nway that does not expose them to needless dangers. Right now, we are \nnot doing that.\n  Much as in the first gulf war, when the Army and the Navy and the \nMarines and the Air Force could not communicate with each other because \nthey were all on different systems of communications--and we all kind \nof laughed at that as being kind of pathetic. They have solved that, \nsort of, but we have not solved this one at all, involving every single \nAmerican and every single firefighter, policeman, and law enforcement \nofficer, deputies, sheriffs, all across America. When it comes to \npublic safety communications, these everyday heroes do not have the \nnetworks that they could so easily have and that they so desperately \nneed because we have not acted. It is the 10-year anniversary coming up \n6 months from now--we have not acted.\n  Too often, first responders lack that interoperable network that is \nessential to providing an effective response in emergencies, all kinds \nof emergencies--a lot of them very desperate, not all of them \ncatastrophic, but there is always that potential. They don't have the \nability to communicate with one another. They don't have the ability to \ncommunicate with other agencies. They don't have the ability to \ncommunicate with other cities and States across State lines. They \ncannot do that. It is kind of pathetic in the age of the Internet. We \nhave chosen to do nothing. Instructed by the 9/11 Commission to do \nsomething a long time ago, we have done nothing. This hampers our \nability to respond to a crisis, this lack of equipment. Whether that \ncrisis is a terrorist attack or a natural disaster, it puts lives in \nunnecessary peril.\n  I believe it is time to do something about it. In the Commerce \nCommittee, we happen to take that approach. That is why I introduced S. \n28, the Public Safety Spectrum and Wireless Innovation Act. This \nlegislation does two things. First, it sets aside the 10 megahertz of \nspectrum known as the D-block. I don't know why it is called the D-\nBlock, but it is the D-Block. Its 10 megahertz adds on to the 10 \nmegahertz they already had, making 20, which means they could do the \nwhole thing, completely connect with each other, every sheriff, police \nperson, law enforcement, Federal, State, county, municipal. They would \nall be on one system and talk to each other from a common \ncommunications base and a common database. It is an interoperable \nwireless broadband network that we have to have, and it is that which \nwe do not have. We do not have it because we have not made the effort.\n  Secondly, it gives the Federal Communications Commission the \nauthority to do something very interesting: to hold incentive auctions \nbased on the voluntary return of spectrum which is not necessarily \nbeing used by a whole variety of people who just want to hold on to it. \nIt is better to hold on to something than to give it, but we give them \nan incentive on a voluntary basis--crucial word in this legislation--on \na voluntary basis to return that spectrum. In turn, these auctions will \nprovide the funding to support the construction and maintenance of the \npublic safety network which they need and which I have been speaking \nabout, and they free up additional spectrum for innovative commercial \nuses.\n  In short, this bill marries resources for the first responders with \ngood commercial spectrum policy. It can keep us safe and help our \neconomy grow. That is why the legislation has the support of absolutely \nevery major public safety organization across this country, obviously \nincluding those of my State. That is why this bill also has strong \nsupport from all Governors and all mayors across this country. They \nhave to deal with this. We do not; they do. That is why we now have the \nsupport of the administration.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Public Safety Spectrum and \nWireless Innovation Act. To those who say we cannot afford to do this \nnow, obviously I would say we cannot afford not to. The role of \nintelligence reveals all kinds of things going on not only outside the \ncountry but inside the country, implying there is a target, or many of \nthem, within this country.\n  But if this is not compelling enough, I think it is important for \npeople to know this. This legislation pays for itself, plus does not \ncost a dime. According to the White House and even the industry itself, \nthe telecommunications industry, incentive auctions will bring in \nrevenue so much above what funding public safety requires, it will \nleave billions over that amount for, for example, deficit reduction. I \nam talking a whole lot of deficit reduction. Billions and billions. So \nit is a win-win-win.\n  I close. Let me say we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to \nprovide our public safety officials with the spectrum they need to \ncommunicate when tragedy strikes. We have chosen not to do that. Now \nthere is this sort of malicious pressure of the 9/11 Commission's \ndirective to us to do our duty as a country to the people who keep us \nsafe.\n  More than that, we do need to keep this country safe, and it is not \nalways going to be safe. We do not know when the next attack will come. \nSo we have the incentive auctions, which are voluntary, but they will \nwork. They can be sold for lots of money, and we will have, therefore, \nlots of money over and above what it costs to build this interoperable \nwireless broadband system across the entire country, connecting every \nlaw enforcement official to every other one.\n  To my colleagues I say, let's seize this moment. This is not \nRepublican, this is not Democrat, it is simply the right thing to do. I \nask people to think back to those images of 9/11, of that day, not just \nthe 9/11 Commission report that emanated from that, why we could not \nstop that, but to think of the images of that day, of what those people \nabsorbed in their lungs, the natural instinct for firefighters to come \nfrom all over the country, policemen to come from all over the country, \nambulance people to come from all over the country, to New York City, a \ncity which they do not start out loving generally out there in the \nhinterlands. But they knew this was a crisis, they reacted, they saved \nlives, they imperiled their own, and many of them lost their lives.\n  Let's do something historic, and let's do it together, and let's do \nit here in this Congress. And, certainly, let us get this all done \nbefore the 10th anniversary of September 11.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/10/senate-section/article/S1528-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1528-S1530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, We are borrowing over $5 billion per day.\n  That's $35 billion borrowed per week to run our government, totaling \nover $1.5 trillion in borrowed money just to run for a year.\n  Harvard's great economic historian, Niall Ferguson, noted that the \ndecline of a country can be marked when it pays its moneylenders more \nthan its army. His classic case comes from the French monarchy of the \n1780s who failed to make interest payments on\n\n[[Page S1529]]\n\ntheir debt, causing the financial collapse that triggered the \nRevolution. Recently, Carmen Reinhard and Kenneth Rogoff wrote a \nbrilliant book called ``This Time is Different, Eight Centuries of \nFinancial Folly.'' Their vast study revealed that most government \nofficials believe they are always unique and different, causing them to \nmake the same mistakes that crippled past nations and empires.\n  Using Ferguson's tipping point, where are we today?\n  This year, the total cost of maintaining our army will equal $137 \nbillion. This same year, we will pay $225 billion in interest to our \nmoney lenders for the use of $14 trillion borrowed from China, Japan \nand elsewhere. The startling conclusion is that we have already passed \nFerguson's tipping point by paying America's money lenders more than \nour own Army.\n  It gets worse.\n  In just 6 years, the administration says that we will have to pay \nover $661 billion to our money lenders for interest on our rapidly \nexpanding debt. With the expected cost of our Army at $195 billion, our \nAir Force at $201 billion and our Navy/Marines at $217 billion, the \ntotal cost of $613 billion to provide for our common defense will be \nsmaller than the $661 billion due to the money lenders. In simple \neconomic terms, we will be forced to pay our lenders their interest \nmoney first, before caring for our own safety, or risk seeing the value \nof the dollars in our own wallets disappear.\n  Remember, these numbers are optimistic. They assume no severe spike \nin interest costs and no other war.\n  Recently, the Senate agonized over a short-term, 2-week spending bill \nthat made a $4 billion cut to spending. We should see that bill's cuts \nas modest knowing that we already pay $616 million daily in interest \nand over $4 billion per week. In sum, the cuts of the 2-week bill saved \njust 1 week of interest payments.\n  As dire as this situation is, there is a bright side. Our country has \nseen this movie before. Washington, Lincoln and Roosevelt all \naccumulated economy-crushing debts as the fate of the United States \nhung in the balance. Our best example of what to do next comes from our \nown grandparents, rightly called the ``Greatest Generation.''\n  Tom Brokaw coined the title for Americans of the 1930s and 1940s who \ndefeated the Depression, Japanese and Nazis simultaneously. I would add \na fourth, largely unnoticed victory that Brokaw missed. After three \ngreat victories for freedom, our grandparents spent the next 20 years \npaying the debts incurred to win the contests of the Depression, \nPacific and Europe. Their accumulated debts of 1946 totaled over 120 \npercent of our national income. Economists report that between economic \ngrowth and some inflation, the Greatest Generation reduced the \ncrippling World War II debts that secured our victory during the late \n1940s and 1950s. The return to more fiscally responsible government \nsparked an economic boom that built the super power called the United \nStates of America.\n  The lesson of history is clear. Each generation of Americans faces \nconflict, war and debt. Each generation is tested. The looming debt \ncrisis facing this government is our generation's test. While some \ngovernment officials and bankers may still counsel ineffective action \nsaying ``we owe this money to ourselves'' or ``because the dollar is \nthe reserve currency, we can owe this amount,'' we know that the crisis \nwe face is not that different from the ones that crippled other \nnations. With spending cuts and discipline we can master this danger, \nas our grandparents did. The need to do the hard things, like \nentitlement reform, is similar to the dramatic moves our grandparents \nmade to secure our future.\n  But there is one difference between us and other nations. From the \ndawn of our revolution, the United States became the greatest force for \nhuman liberty and individual dignity ever known. The U.S. ended \nslavery, gave women the right to vote and spread freedom across Europe, \nLatin America and Asia. We are now challenged by 21st century world \nviews in the Middle East and China that do not hold the western value \nof the individual as high as we do. It is therefore doubly important to \ndo the work needed to reduce spending and balance the books so that we \nrestore the vitality of a free people and their cause of expanding \nliberty and individual dignity.\n  Next time you talk to a member of the Greatest Generation, do not \njust say thank you. Ask them for advice on how to trim budgets and \nrestore growth in the face of extraordinary debts, just as they did.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I too take the floor of the Senate to urge \nall of us, Democrats and Republicans alike, to focus on the single \nbiggest domestic threat to our country, our single greatest challenge \nin the eyes of every Louisianan and every American I know, and that is \nto stop this runaway spending and debt.\n  Americans all around the country, certainly Louisianans all around my \nState, understand this is a grave threat to our economic future. It is \nnot some vague threat to generations two and three away from us. This \nis an immediate threat because the path of spending and debt we are on \nis completely unsustainable.\n  For example, we must come together in a bipartisan way. We must act. \nWe must solve this real and pressing problem before it is an immediate \ncrisis. We should clearly do that well before any need for an increase \nin the debt limit arises, well before this Congress reaches a crisis \natmosphere over the need for an increase in the debt limit.\n  For all of these reasons, I have joined with many of my colleagues. I \nsent the majority leader a letter today. First, let me thank my \ncolleagues who joined me on the letter: Senators Sessions, Rubio, \nDeMint, Paul, Lee, Toomey, and Ensign. The letter is very simple and \nstraightforward. It says this is the greatest challenge we face. It \nsays because of that, we need to face it. We need to debate and talk \nabout it and act. We need to start doing that now, well before any \nsignificant deadline like when the debt limit may have to be increased.\n  The letter says: Mr. Leader, we are going to oppose moving to any \nother bill that doesn't directly address this crisis when we need to \nact on this grave threat.\n  Let me read relevant portions that go right to the point:\n\n       Dear Leader Reid:\n       Yesterday, the Senate voted on two proposals to fund the \n     government for the rest of the fiscal year. This debate gave \n     only a limited (three hours) opportunity to debate what many \n     Americans believe is the issue of our time--cutting \n     government spending and dramatically reducing our national \n     debt. Additionally, no member of the Senate was permitted to \n     offer amendments under the structured process, which in our \n     opinion prevents a full, open, and robust debate.\n       With our national debt poised to reach its $14.3 trillion \n     limit in the very near future, taxpayers expect Congress to \n     work together to reduce wasteful and unnecessary spending and \n     be more vigilant about how we spend public funds. The \n     American people want Congress to deal with the tough issues \n     of cutting spending, and almost every member of the Senate \n     has agreed that we must address our fiscal situation \n     immediately.\n       While there are certainly many issues that warrant the \n     Senate's consideration, we feel that the Senate must not \n     debate and consider bills at this time that do not \n     affirmatively cut spending, directly address structural \n     budget reforms, reduce government's role in the economy so \n     businesses can create jobs, or directly address this current \n     financial crisis.\n       The American people resoundingly rejected the way the \n     Senate waited until Christmas Eve as a mechanism to force \n     hurried debate on President Obama's massive health care \n     legislation. Voting to proceed to another legislative measure \n     effectively runs away from the central issues of spending and \n     debt and repeats that flawed process.\n       We, therefore, are notifying you of our intention to object \n     to the consideration of any legislation that fails to \n     directly address this crisis in a meaningful way. Our \n     objections would be withheld if the Senate agrees to dedicate \n     significant floor time to debate this issue well in advance \n     of the federal government reaching our statutorily mandated \n     debt limit.\n\n  It is signed ``Sincerely'' from both myself and Senators Sessions, \nRubio, DeMint, Paul, Lee, Toomey, and Ensign, to the majority leader.\n\n[[Page S1530]]\n\n  The statement is clear. This is a crisis. We need to act before we \nreach the statutory debt limit. So what are we waiting for? Let's act \nnow. Let's not move to other cats and dogs bills that may be positive \nlegislation but can certainly wait. Let's move to the people's \nbusiness. Let's move to the absolute top challenge we face \ndomestically. Let's come together and debate, vote on, and hopefully \nbegin to solve this problem of unsustainable spending and debt.\n  To do that we also need leadership, ideas, suggestions. I believe we \nhave provided that on this side of the aisle, and we would welcome \nideas, suggestions, and concrete proposals from all Members.\n  Let me list the more than two dozen pieces of legislation that go \ndirectly to this issue:\n  S. 14, by Senator Ensign, establishes a commission on congressional \nbudgetary accountability and review of Federal agencies.\n  S. 81 is an Isakson bill to direct unused appropriations for Senate \nofficial personnel and office expenses to be deposited in the Treasury \nand actually used to reduce the Federal debt.\n  S. 102 is a McCain bill which requires OMB to transmit to Congress a \nmessage with specified information requesting any recession the \nPresident proposes under the procedures instituted under that act.\n  S. 162 is a Paul bill to cut $500 billion in Federal spending from \nfiscal year 2011.\n  S. 163, by Senator Toomey, is the Full Faith and Credit Act to \nprioritize principle and interest payments when and if the debt limit \nis reached.\n  S. 178, by Senator DeMint, reduces Federal spending by $2.5 trillion \nthrough fiscal year 2021.\n  S. 245 is a Corker bill, the CAP Act, to create a discretionary \nspending cap for Congress.\n  S. 259 is my bill to prioritize Social Security payments if and when \nthe debt limit is reached.\n  S. 360, by Senator Inhofe, creates a point of order to exceed \nnonsecurity discretionary limits and to create spending limits for \nfiscal years 2017 to 2021.\n  S. 389, by Senator Kirk--and Senator Hatch has a similar bill--\nestablishes a commission to review cost control.\n  S. 391, by Senator Moran, rescinds all unobligated balances of \nPresident Obama's stimulus bill.\n  S.J. Res. 3, by Senator Hatch, is a balanced budget amendment.\n  S.J. Res. 4, by Senator Shelby, is on the same topic.\n  And S.J. Res. 5, by Senator Lee, is on the same topic.\n  This is a long list, but it is certainly not exhaustive. I have read \na partial list to make the point. We are coming up with ideas, \nproposals, and solutions. We encourage every Senator of both parties to \ncome up with ideas, proposals, and solutions. Let's actually talk about \nthe greatest threat we face. Let's talk about it now. Let's debate it \nnow. Let's exchange ideas in a positive atmosphere now, well before we \nreach any crisis atmosphere over the debt limit.\n  I respectfully urge the distinguished majority leader, Senator Reid, \nto heed our call to arms, to read our letter and react by creating an \nidentified time on the Senate floor, well before we reach the statutory \ndebt limit, to debate and pass solutions on this crucial topic.\n  I don't believe there is debate that this isn't the greatest \nchallenge we face, that this isn't the greatest economic threat we \nface. Quite simply, what are we waiting for? We need time to bring \nforth these ideas and exchange them and debate them and act. We need \ntime to do this well before the statutory debt limit is reached. We \nneed to do the people's business in a reasonable way, in a sober \natmosphere, not in an atmosphere of hysteria or threats when the debt \nlimit would be reached in a matter of days.\n  I urge all colleagues to join us in this effort, to come to the floor \nwith their ideas, their proposals. Let's do the people's business.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a partial list of Republican solutions \nand proposals be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       S. 14--an Ensign bill to establish the Commission on \n     Congressional Budgetary Accountability and Review of Federal \n     Agencies. Directs the President to designate two Commission \n     co-chairpersons.\n       S. 81--an Isakson bill to direct unused appropriations for \n     Senate Official Personnel and Office Expense Accounts to be \n     deposited in the Treasury and used for deficit reduction or \n     to reduce the Federal debt.\n       S. 102--a McCain bill which requires OMB to transmit to \n     Congress a message with specified information requesting any \n     recission the President proposes under the procedures \n     established in this Act.\n       S. 162--a Paul bill to cut $500 billion in federal spending \n     from FY 2011.\n       S. 163--Toomey's Full Faith and Credit Act to prioritize \n     principle and interest payments when the debt limit is \n     reached.\n       S. 178--DeMint bill to reduce federal spending by $2.5 \n     trillion through 2021.\n       S. 245--Corker's CAP act to create a discretionary spending \n     cap on Congress.\n       S. 259--Vitter bill to prioritize Social Security payments \n     when the debt limit is reached.\n       S. 360--Inhofe bill to create a point of order to exceed \n     non-security discretionary limits; also creates spending \n     limits for FY 2017-2021.\n       S. 389--Kirk and Hatch bill to establish a commission which \n     will conduct a review of cost control in the federal \n     government every two years with respect to improving \n     management and reducing costs.

Mr. President, I rise to talk in morning business \nabout the energy issue facing the country. Anyone who has filled up the \ncar or truck in the last month knows we have an energy crisis that is \nbuilding and needs to be addressed. Last week I filled up my pickup \ntruck. It cost about $50. Across the Nation, parents are driving in \ncarpools. Farmers, small business owners, and commuters are \nexperiencing sticker shock at the rising cost to put gas in their \nvehicles. Today oil is over $104 a barrel. That means on average \nAmericans are paying $3.52 a gallon. It is going in the upward \ndirection from there. We are clearly in an economic downturn. We have \nhigh unemployment. Now is not the time to sit back and do nothing as \nthe price of gasoline goes up at the pump.\n  In response, the White House is beginning to talk about tapping the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve. We know that will not work. The Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve is available for natural disasters and global \ndisasters. But experience has shown that any gain from releasing oil \nfrom the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is small and temporary, and prices \nquickly go right back up to their high and rising levels. If we \ndiminish our resources, our reserves in the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve, we are even more vulnerable to those who would do mischief to \nthe country because they would know we have a diminished supply, or to \nthe natural disasters for which we are supposed to be prepared.\n  Our problem is, we are the only Nation on Earth that has vast natural \nresources which we will not use. American energy is out there. It is \nunder our land. It is under our waters. It is ready to be tapped, and \nit can be tapped environmentally safely. We could bring the prices down \non our own accord. We know there is upheaval in the Middle East right \nnow that could affect further the gasoline prices because of potential \nshortages. We are too dependent on foreign sources for our energy \nneeds. It is a little more than 50 percent. That is not strategically \nsound, and it is most certainly not in our national security interest \nto leave us at that level.\n  The Gulf of Mexico is one of the biggest resources we have. The Gulf \nof Mexico accounts for nearly 30 percent\n\n[[Page S1531]]\n\nof total U.S. oil production and 13 percent of natural gas production. \nBy failing to take full advantage of that resource, we are putting our \nenergy security on the line.\n  Mr. President, 400,000 jobs across the gulf coast are tied to the \noffshore energy industry. Nearly a year after issuing its moratorium \nand months since the moratorium was lifted, the Department of the \nInterior last week approved its first, its one and only, deepwater \npermit--one in a year. It's one and one only. There are thousands of \nidled leases, people sitting in the Gulf of Mexico idle that should be \nable to be at least exploring to determine if it is worth drilling. Yet \nthe gulf is facing a permitorium.\n  My constituents know the pain of this ``permitorium.'' One \nunfortunate case is the Houston-based Seahawk Drilling Company. Seahawk \nDrilling used to be the second largest shallow water drilling \ncontractor in the United States. It provided high-paying jobs to men \nand women in Texas and across the Gulf of Mexico. I say ``used to'' \nbecause in February bureaucratic delays in shallow water permitting \nforced Seahawk Drilling to declare bankruptcy. They could not continue \nto have the costs associated with their employment levels, and with \ntheir company being there without the opportunity to drill and produce \nand keep their employee base. They declared bankruptcy. It destroyed \n1,000 high-paying Texas jobs.\n  I received a letter describing the pain and distress the company felt \nwhen it had to inform the dedicated Seahawk employees they no longer \nhad a job. According to the letter, on the day Seahawk was forced to \nsell its assets and lay off workers, the chief operating officer had to \n``fight back the emotions of the day. He took a deep breath and he left \nthe conference room for a room full of Seahawk employees to tell them \nthat their company was bankrupt.''\n  These are real people with real families who lost real jobs--American \njobs--and it could have been prevented.\n  Since the moratorium was enacted, at least 13 rigs--deepwater and \nshallow water--have departed the Gulf of Mexico, taking with them good \nAmerican jobs, and, furthermore, putting us in the position of having \nto import now from the foreign countries where these rigs have gone, \nnot only taking away American jobs but forcing us to be even more \ndependent on foreign imports for our energy needs.\n  Offshore energy production is expected to decrease by 13 percent in \n2011, due to the slow pace of permitting. This is unacceptable, and we \nmust do something that is productive.\n  Yesterday, Senator Landrieu and I introduced the LEASE Act, the Lease \nExtension and Secure Energy Act of 2011. All our bill does is extend \nthe offshore leases that are impacted by the moratorium and the lack of \npermitting for 1 year.\n  The LEASE Act returns to lessees the lease time taken from them \nduring the moratorium. This will increase domestic energy production \nand protect some American jobs--those that have not already left. \nDespite being unable to explore for energy resources, the leaseholders \nare continuing to pay the expenses, as time ticks away on their lease.\n  The LEASE Act will prevent leases from running out, and it gives the \nlessees the certainty they deserve that they will have the full amount \nof the lease for which they have paid bonus payments to secure.\n  In 2009, the industry accounted for $70 billion in economic value and \nprovided $20 billion in revenue to Federal, State, and local \ngovernments through royalties, bonuses, and tax collections.\n  I hope our bill will be noncontroversial. It would seem to me that \nanyone would agree that if you paid for a 10-year lease, and you have \nthe expenses of exploring to see if that lease has potential, before \nyou drill to see if the lease has potential, you would have the full 10 \nyears, and not 9 years because you have not been able to use the year \nwe have had the moratorium and the lack of permitting.\n  There has been another suggestion by the administration that perhaps \nwe should be proposing energy taxes--up to $90 billion over the next 10 \nyears. The President suggested that in his State of the Union message. \nMuch of the taxes that would go on the oil and gas industry for \nexpenses--that any industry, any business can write off, but would \nsingle out the oil and gas industry not to be able to expense their \nexploration and drilling costs--what would happen? If the prices go up, \nof course, who is going to pay those high prices? The families and \nbusinesses that are having to fill their cars with gasoline.\n  In fact, the administration, through the EPA, is trying to bring more \nexpenses to the refining industry by purporting to regulate greenhouse \ngas emissions. The administration is also adding to the refiners by \nsaying they should not get the manufacturing tax credit.\n  We have been trying to encourage manufacturing in America because we \nwant manufacturing jobs in America, and so many of those have gone \noverseas. But the administration proposes to tax refiners who are \nmanufacturing the gasoline from the oil and add more expense to the \nproduct, which is gasoline, and, oh, by the way, take away the \ncapability for these refiners to have the same treatment as any other \nmanufacturer in our country.\n  Raising taxes on our domestic oil and energy industry is wrong, \nparticularly at this time. We need to assure that we are not going to \ndrive our energy jobs overseas. Yet what the administration is doing is \ncounterintuitive if we all agree we want to keep the jobs in America.\n  So here we are with gas at $3.52 a gallon, and the summer driving \nseason is upon us. We are looking now at estimates from the experts \nthat gasoline could be $4 a gallon. What is that going to do to the \nfamily who wants to take a vacation at a reasonable price? What is that \ngoing to do to the workers who have to get to work and who are already \nstrapped, and, for Heaven's sake, the poor people who are unemployed \nwho are trying to go and interview for jobs with gas at $4 a gallon?\n  We cannot sit here and let this happen. It is time we get together \nwith the President of the United States and have proactive energy \nideas, programs, and solutions that are going to keep jobs in America, \nthat will allow us to use our natural resources to begin to set the \nstage if we have upheaval in the Middle East that causes the supply to \ngo down at a great rate. We need to have our supply go up to meet the \ntest we should have of lowering energy prices for our people with our \nown natural resources. It is not to put the SPR out and put us in an \neven more vulnerable position. No. It is to use our resources, with \nAmericans to take the jobs, and increase our supply so the price of \ngasoline at the pump goes down for the American people, and so we can \nhave the jobs we should have in America stay in America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 12 years ago this very day, the Senate \npassed a joint resolution that honored Harriet Tubman, with Harriet \nTubman Day, on March 10. That resolution was sponsored by Senator \nCarper and then-Senator Biden. In the House of Representatives, I \nserved and I cosponsored a similar resolution.\n  Harriet Tubman was a remarkable woman. She was born in Dorchester \nCounty, MD, in 1822. She was a slave for greater than 25 years of her \nlife. At age 25, she married John Tubman. She escaped slavery in 1849. \nShe returned to the eastern shore of Maryland, not once but 19 times \nthat we know of within a 10-year period, in order to rescue slaves and \nto set them free.\n  She rescued slaves in Dorchester County and Caroline County in \nMaryland and throughout the entire Northeast. She was known as the \nmodern day ``Moses'' for the Underground Railroad.\n  In the Civil War, she joined Union forces as a spy, as a scout, and \nas a nurse, operating in Virginia, Florida, and South Carolina.\n  After the Civil War was over, she settled in Auburn, NY, and was very \nactively involved in the women's suffrage movement, and she established \none of the first African-American homes for the aged.\n  She died in 1913.\n  Harriet Tubman embodies the American spirit. She was a strong-willed \nperson who fought for the rights and freedom of those who were \noppressed in the barbaric institution of slavery.\n\n[[Page S1532]]\n\n  Her personal freedom was not enough for her because she recognized \nthere was injustice in this country, and she wanted to be involved. As \nthe joint resolution that passed the Senate 12 years ago said:\n\n       . . . Harriet Tubman--whose courageous and dedicated \n     pursuit of the promise of American ideals and common \n     principles of humanity continues to serve and inspire all \n     people who cherish freedom. . . .\n\n  A major part of learning and understanding the significance of \nhistory is being able to experience the places where that history \noccurred.\n  From Fort McHenry in Baltimore, MD, to the Lincoln Memorial here in \nthe Nation's capital, we have preserved our history for future \ngenerations. Millions of visitors and schoolchildren visit these iconic \nplaces in American history.\n  The Harriet Tubman National Historical Park and the Harriet Tubman \nUnderground Railroad National Historical Park is legislation I have \nfiled so we can preserve the history of Harriet Tubman with these \nhistoric places for future generations.\n  I am joined in this effort by Senator Mikulski, Senator Schumer, and \nSenator Gillibrand. The natural landscape on the eastern shore that \nexisted during Harriet Tubman's day exists today. Her homestead, where \nher father was born, Ben Ross, exists today. Stewart's Canal, where her \nfather worked, exists today. The Brodess Farm, where Harriet Tubman \nworked as a slave, exists today. Right adjacent to it, and including \npart of that property, is the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge. So \nwe have the landscape in which the Underground Railroad was operating \nto free slaves in the 19th century. It exists today on the eastern \nshore of Maryland.\n  In Auburn, NY, the home in which Harriet Tubman lived still exists, \nthe home for the aged that she started still remains. The Thompson \nMemorial AME Zion Episcopal Church is still there, and the Fort Hill \nCemetery, where she is buried. They are all intact, and all are \navailable for preservation.\n  The legislation we have filed will preserve these places in American \nhistory under our National Park System for future generations. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this legislation, to honor a great American, \nand to preserve our heritage for future generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/10/senate-section/article/S1532-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1532-S1533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ASTHMA AND THE IMPACT OF HEALTH DISPARITIES\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about asthma and the \nimpact of health disparities. I have pointed out on the floor before \nthat race and ethnic health disparities exist in America. I have talked \non the floor before about sickle cell disease. Well, the same thing is \ntrue with the chronic inflammatory diseases of the body's airways that \nimpede breathing, such as asthma.\n  As I pointed out before, the Affordable Care Act includes a provision \nI helped write that establishes the Institute for Minority Health and \nHealth Disparities at NIH. The purpose for including this information \nabout asthma in the Record is to point out that we still have \nchallenges that need to be met. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on that issue.\n  Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the body's airways that \nimpairs breathing and affects more than 20 million Americans. People \nwith this condition have overly reactive airways that constrict in \nresponse to allergens, temperature changes, physical exercise, and \nstress. During asthma attacks, the airways spasm and prevent oxygen \nfrom getting to the lungs. This leads to chest tightness, shortage of \nbreath, wheezing and mucus production. Severe attacks can require \nintubation and even result in death. Of the 20 million Americans \naffected by asthma, about 7 million are children. In fact, about 10 \npercent of all American children have asthma.\n  Genetics play a significant role in the development of asthma in \nchildren and adults, but asthma is also influenced by environmental \nfactors and racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic factors. Asthma is \nconsistently found to be more prevalent among certain minority groups, \nparticularly among Blacks, Native Americans, and Puerto Ricans. To be \nmore precise, research indicates that asthma is 30 percent more \nprevalent in Blacks than in Whites; American Indians and Alaska Natives \nare 20 percent more likely to have asthma than Whites; Asian/Pacific \nIslander children are three times more likely to have asthma than White \nchildren; and Puerto Rican Americans have twice the asthma rate as the \nLatino American population overall.\n  In addition to occurring more often, asthma is also more severe in \nminority populations, and this leads to higher mortality rates for \nBlack Americans. Asthma accounts for more than 4,000 deaths in the \nUnited States each year. Blacks are 2.5 times more likely to die from \nasthma-related causes than Whites. Among children, this ratio is even \nmore staggering--Black children are 7 times more likely to die from \nasthma-related causes than White children. Interestingly, although \nLatino Americans and American Indian/Alaskan Natives are more likely \nthan Whites to have asthma, they have a 50 percent lower mortality \nrate.\n  As I noted earlier, the gap in asthma outcomes is also influenced by \nseveral socioeconomic factors. Health disparities can be attributed to \ndifferences in education level, independent of race or ethnicity. \nResearch shows that children whose mothers have not completed high \nschool are twice as likely to develop asthma as children whose mothers \nhave a high school diploma, and this difference remains significant \neven when controlling for race and ethnicity.\n  Economic status also influences the incidence of asthma. Studies have \nshown that unemployment is correlated with increased incidence, and \nthat people with incomes below the Federal poverty level are 30 percent \nmore likely to develop asthma as those who are above the Federal \npoverty level.\n  One reason is that income level is correlated with quality of \nhousing, and substandard housing is strongly associated with poor \nasthma outcomes. Substandard housing exposes residents to environmental \ntriggers for asthma such as dust mites, roaches, mold, and rodents.\n  A study in the journal Pediatrics showed that eliminating these \nindoor pollutants could prevent 39 percent of asthma cases in children. \nOther studies have shown that substandard housing accounts for up to a \n50-percent increase in asthma cases.\n  In addition to indoor triggers, outdoor pollutants are also \ncontributing factors. Researchers have shown that among people living \nwithin 50 yards of major car traffic, people living near a road \ntraveled by 30,000 vehicles per day are three times more likely to \ndevelop asthma that those who live near a road traveled by 10,000 \nvehicles per day. To put these figures into perspective, the average \nsegment of I-495, our Capital Beltway, carries about 200,000 cars per \nday.\n  The built environment comprising roads, factories, and other human-\nmade surroundings is a substantial risk factor for asthma. Many people \nare stuck in unhealthy living conditions because they can't afford to \nmove elsewhere, particularly in the case of public housing projects, \nwhich are often situated in the most polluted locations. Initiatives \nsuch as the Healthy Homes Program run by the U.S. Department of Housing \nand Urban Development are encouraging, but greater effort must be \ndevoted to raising the quality of the home environment for people \nliving in poverty.\n  Whether due to one or more of these factors, the impact of \ndisparities in asthma is profound because asthma is such a crippling \ncondition. Untreated or inappropriately treated, asthma makes it \ndifficult to concentrate at school and work, limits physical activity, \nand often results in absenteeism. It also reaches beyond the patient to \nfamily members, as parents are often required to miss work to care for \nsick children. The Nation's 20 million asthma patients account for more \nthan 100 million days each year in lost productivity due to absence \nfrom school and work, according to the American Academy of Allergy, \nAsthma, and Immunology. Yearly, asthma patients account for more than \n11 million office visits and 500,000 hospitalizations. That is an \nannual cost of more than $6 billion in direct and indirect medical \nexpenditures. Much of this expense could be avoided with proper asthma \nmanagement.\n  Patients who are diagnosed at an early age and whose conditions are \nwell\n\n[[Page S1533]]\n\nmanaged by a primary care physician and an asthma specialist can avoid \nmany of the complications associated with the condition. The ability to \nsecure medications, such as an albuterol inhaler to alleviate attacks \nand steroids to suppress inflammation, can allow patients to play \nsports and live normal lives.\n  But patients who lack access to specialists or can't afford needed \nmedicines will frequently miss school, must forgo physical activity, \nand are often hospitalized. So the effect of access to affordable, \ncomprehensive care is apparent.\n  Even so, coverage is not enough. Asthma disparities have multiple \ninterrelated causes, as I have outlined. We often view health \ndisparities through the narrow lenses of genetic differences and \ndifferences in medical care. But upstream determinants such as social \ninequalities and neighborhood conditions can have a significant impact \non health outcomes as well.\n  Even though we know this, national policies have not effectively \naddressed the problem of health disparities pertaining to asthma. \nNational asthma guidelines that are supported by the National \nInstitutes of Health recommend preventive services and asthma care by a \nspecialist. These guidelines have been found to save money and improve \nquality of life. But data still show that patients covered by Medicaid \nare offered less preventive care and fewer referrals to asthma \nspecialists compared to patients in the private insurance market. This \nmatters when it comes to outcomes because specialists are more likely \nto prescribe controller medications than primary care providers, \nregardless of the patient's racial or ethnic background. Decreased \naccess to specialists has been associated with higher rates of \nhospitalization, emergency room use, and mortality. The bottom line is \nthat Medicaid patients have been receiving lower quality treatment for \nasthma, despite the guidelines put forth by NIH and the American \nCollege of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology.\n  I am encouraged that there are significant efforts taking place to \nclose the gaps at the local level. In Maryland, the University of \nMaryland Medical Center has developed an innovative approach to \nbringing specialized care to children who otherwise would not have \naccess to it. Their BreathMobile program, led by Dr. Mary Beth \nBollinger, is an asthma clinic on wheels. It is staffed by a pediatric \nallergist, a pediatric nurse practitioner, a registered nurse, and a \ndriver who regularly travels to over two dozen schools in Baltimore \nCity. The BreathMobile has provided ongoing care to more than 800 \nstudents.\n  At Johns Hopkins University, the Harriet Lane Clinic provides a \ncomprehensive medical home for asthma patients. Over 90 percent of \nHarriet Lane's caseload are Medicaid patients, and they are provided \nwith pulmonary specialists, social workers, and case managers who help \nthem secure healthy housing, and seek help from other programs for \nwhich they may be eligible.\n  With the passage of the Affordable Care Act, we have additional tools \nto address the problem of health disparities at a national level. I \nhelped write into that law the new Institute for Minority Health and \nHealth Disparities at NIH as well as the Offices of Minority Health at \nCMS and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.\n  These offices are charged with evaluating, coordinating, and \nadvocating for efforts to eliminate disparities, and they can do much \nto close the gaps with respect to asthma.\n  The new Institute will be instrumental in overseeing the coordination \nof asthma research at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and \nensuring that the focus of biomedical research sufficiently addresses \nhealth disparities. We must encourage participation in clinical trials, \nparticularly for underrepresented populations, so that we can speed the \ndiscovery of the most effective treatments. Provisions to encourage \nphysicians to practice in underserved areas can improve access to care. \nThe Office at AHRQ can help translate these findings into practice, and \nthe Office at CMS can be instrumental in ensuring that eligible CHIP \nand Medicaid beneficiaries are enrolled in these programs and that they \ncan receive the best possible care. With the Affordable Care Act, we \nhave the momentum and the tools needed to make a difference in asthma \nhealth disparities.\n  I look forward to returning to the floor soon to explore the issue of \nhealth disparities further by focusing on another condition that \ndisproportionately affects minorities.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/10/senate-section/article/S1533-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1533-S1534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               TOXIC TEA\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, everyone is aware of how deeply \nconcerned the American people are about staying in their homes, about \nhaving adequate health care, and about providing education and a better \npath for the lives of their children. But everyone also knows there is \na group calling themselves the tea party, and they are busy trying to \neliminate those opportunities.\n  In Wisconsin, a tea party Governor is trying to take away workers' \ncollective bargaining rights to be represented. It is like going into a \ncourtroom without a lawyer.\n  In Florida, another tea party Governor has killed the critical high-\nspeed rail project by rejecting Federal grants of $2.4 billion to move \nit along. He threw it away, threw it back--$2.4 billion. Here in \nCongress, tea party activists have seized control of the Republican \nside of the aisle. But it is far from a tea party for lots of jobless \npeople and those qualified to study in college but unable to pay the \nfreight. Now that they are in power, we see them brewing a toxic tea--a \ndangerous concoction that will create pain for our children and \nultimately bring shame to our country.\n  We know cutting critical programs now brings sky-high prices later--\nin more illnesses and a less educated society. So we look at the \nfuture, we say we have to invest in our children, our environment, and \nmedical research. But every time they hear something we need, they say \nno. They insist on saying no to 200,000 little kids who now go to Head \nStart Programs that help them in the earliest stages of life, when \nlearning is fun and curiosity abounds. Look here. We see a young \nchild's face through the window. They are holding back 218,000 Head \nStart kids from learning to learn. They ought to visit these \nschoolrooms and be upfront with these children and their parents and \nsay, Sorry, America can't help you.\n  That is not all. Look at what they want to do to higher education. We \nsay we must invest in Pell grants which make the dream of college a \nreality for millions of disadvantaged Americans. They say, Sorry, your \ncountry can't help you. They say no to future employers. Too bad we \ndon't have enough qualified workers, so maybe the employers then can \nappropriately say, Oh, well, ship the jobs overseas. That is the \nalternative. Is that what we want America to do? They say no, even \nthough the unemployment rate is twice as large for those who lack a \nbachelor's degree as for college graduates.\n  They are unable to look at a simple chart such as this one: There we \ncan see the way the arrow is pointed, with the year 2000 over here and \nthe year 2009 over here, and we see rising tuitions. That is what is \nhappening. Therefore, it tells us how difficult it is for those who \ndon't have the money, the family support financially, and won't able to \ntake advantage of the Pell grants, because they want to slash them. \nThey want to get them off the record as much as they can.\n  The chart shows between a $10,000 and $15,000 tuition rate in 2001. \nIn 2008 and 2009, we are somewhere close to $20,000 a year. Do we want \nto force middle-class citizens to take on more debt in order to attend \ncollege or slam shut the campus doors on them altogether?\n  I know the value of government investment in college education \nfirsthand. I came from a poor working-class family. I was a teenager \nwhen I enlisted in the Army. My father was on his deathbed. He died and \nleft a 37-year-old widow, myself, and my 12-\n\n[[Page S1534]]\n\nyear-old sister. Thanks to the GI bill, I attended college at Columbia \nand later cofounded a company with two other fellows--a company that \nwas started with nothing. We had zero in funding. We put together a few \nhundred bucks. Now that company employs 45,000 employees in 23 \ncountries, based in New Jersey. Jobs in this country. We built the \n``greatest generation'' out of those educational opportunities we had \nin the military, and we were moving America to the top of the economic \nladder.\n  Government investment in my education made all the difference in my \nlife, and now the 45,000 people who work for ADP. Now Republicans want \nto take away opportunities such as that from young people. These are \npeople who go into a business, have an education, learn something about \nhow to operate a business, but also learn how we ought to be creating \njob opportunities and economic development for all in our country.\n  That is not all the House Republicans have in store for our country. \nWe have to protect women's health, but they won't listen. They want to \nwipe out funding for title X. Title X offers women access to critical \nhealth services, including cervical cancer tests, breast cancer \nscreenings, encouragement to think about family planning and how they \nare going to get by. But these people on the other side don't want to \nhear it. They don't care. They don't care that title X offers women \naccess to take care of their health at all times.\n  Millions of poor women benefit from title X. So killing it will take \ncare away from those who need it most. Title X funding for women's \nhealth: House GOP, tea partiers, lots of them, eliminate $1 billion for \nwomen's care. They cancel funding for 2 million breast cancer \nscreenings. How cruel is that in this country of ours? If you have \nmoney, you can take care of yourself. If you don't, too bad. Well, that \nis not the way we want to do it. That is not the way we want to do it \non this side of the aisle. They are cutting off resources for 2.2 \nmillion cervical cancer screenings. What a horror that is. What did \nthese women do to deserve higher health risks during their lifetimes?\n  But it gets worse. The Republicans are also going after medical \nresearch. We say we must invest in finding cures and treatment for \nmillions of children suffering from asthma, diabetes, autism, and \npediatric cancer, to name a few of those health-damaging afflictions. \nTo these children they say, You know what. If you don't feel good, \nmaybe you should go to an emergency room with your parents. Stand in \nline. Too bad. We would like to help, but we can't do that.\n  The National Institutes of Health is making strides in fighting \nchildhood diseases, but the Republicans want to reduce NIH's ability to \ndo their research by taking $1 billion out of the their budget. If you \nwant to see bravery, look into the eyes of a child struggling with \nleukemia, and look in the parents' eyes, and you will see tears, often \nno hope.\n  Look at what the Republicans want to do to our environment. We say we \nmust invest in the Clean Air Act, a law that spares millions of \nchildren from suffering from asthma, and the Republicans say, No can \ndo. They say you can't restrict polluters with regulations. It is too \ncumbersome. And if you don't like regulations, for instance, take a \nlook at this bothersome thing we have in America called red lights. \nThey are cumbersome. They stop traffic. These people don't want \nregulations, so we ought to get rid of the red lights and let the \ntraffic move, but watch yourself when you get to the intersection.\n  Maybe they want to get rid of the air traffic control system. Pilots \nhave to wait for some government bureaucrat to tell them where and when \nthey can fly? What a nerve that is to interfere with these regulations \nand rules.\n  The Republicans also want to let mercury back into our air. Mercury \nis brain poisoning for children. They also want to stop us from \nrestricting soot pollution. Look at the picture. Soot is ugly when it \nis pouring from a smokestack, but it is even uglier inside a child's \nlungs. This is a picture we see in many places in our country.\n  Several years ago I wrote a law called the Right to Know. It says to \npeople who live in areas where there are chemicals present--either \nmanufacturing, chemicals being stored or transported--so people could \nknow if they hear a particular alarm, they have to respond to it and \nreport it to the fire department. We had an incident in Elizabeth, NJ, \nsome years ago when a group of firemen responded to a chemical fire \nand, in some instances, their protective uniforms melted. That is the \nkind of situation we want to avoid. We want people to know what is \nbeing stored, what is being released into the air in case of a fire.\n  Finally, when we say we have to clean the water our children drink, \nthe Republican answer is, Oh, we can't handle that. It costs too much. \nSo they cut the funding that helps States protect our drinking water \nfrom E. coli, arsenic, and other dangerous substances. The water is not \nsafe for dishwashing, much less consumption.\n  The House GOP keeps on brewing their toxic tea for America. Ask any \nparent if they want their kids to drink from that teapot. They don't, \nand we shouldn't make them do it. We need to gather together for things \nsuch as birthday parties and school graduations and lots of smiles \ninstead of their toxic tea parties.\n  Let's reject the House Republican tea party approach to funding our \ngovernment. When they say, hey, join us for a cup of toxic tea, we must \nsay, no, we have had this long enough, and we are not going to stand \nfor it anymore.\n  Mr. President, you know very well that what we are looking at is very \nconstricted budgets. One doesn't have to be an economist or a business \nexecutive to know that when there is a financial statement, it comes in \ntwo parts. One part is the expenses you need with which to operate. The \nother is the revenues that permit the companies and the organizations \nto function. What we are looking at is revenues. I know the Chair \nshares that position with me. We have discussed it.\n  Why should people who have the means, who have the good fortune to \nmake lots and lots of money--we saw something this afternoon on a chart \nthat had janitors in New York City at some locations paying a higher \ntax rate on their earnings than those who earn a million dollars or \nmore. That is not fair. So if we want to do the right thing, we have to \nintroduce revenues into the budget. We have to restore the cuts they \nwant to make on the other side. We want to restore children's health. \nWe want to make sure the NIH is producing as much as it can, and we \nwant to turn America back to a lot more smiles than we have seen.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. It is my understanding that at 2:15 morning business \nexpires.

Mr. President, I rise today to once again speak out \nagainst what I consider to be and many others consider to be a \nregulatory assault on our Nation's economy. I have previously discussed \nmy concerns with regulations having a negative impact on our \nagriculture community. That was last week. Earlier this week, I spoke \nabout what I consider to be the egregious regulations that are being \npromulgated by the EPA, or what Senator Grassley calls the ``end of \nproduction agriculture agency.''\n  Today, I rise to talk about health care regulations that patients and \nproviders have brought to my attention. I have listed a number of these \nregulations in a letter I sent earlier today to President Obama. I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 10, 2011.\n     President Barack Obama,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Obama: I write you today to express my \n     sincere appreciation for the Executive Order that you issued \n     on January\n\n[[Page S1535]]\n\n     18, committing all federal agencies to review regulations and \n     remove any that place unreasonable burdens on our nation's \n     business community and/or impact the ability of our economy \n     to grow. I agree that in light of our current economic \n     crisis, establishing a regulatory environment that promotes \n     growth and job creation should be the number one priority for \n     this Congress and Administration. To that end, I would like \n     to offer some suggested areas related to health care that \n     patients and providers have communicated are of the most \n     concern to them, and would urge you and your Administration \n     to consider these and their impact when implementing your \n     Executive Order.\n       While the majority of this communication will focus on \n     regulations already on the books, I would also like to take \n     this opportunity to share with you what seems to be an even \n     greater concern within the patient, provider and stakeholder \n     community. When discussing regulations in general and your \n     Executive Order more specifically with my constituents and \n     those representing the patient and provider community, the \n     number one concern that I hear is related to a fear of the \n     impact of future regulations. While there is still a large \n     concern with the burden of regulations that have already been \n     issued, I have heard time and time again that there is an \n     even greater concern with the uncertainty of future \n     regulations, especially those regulations for implementing \n     the ``Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act'' (PPACA) \n     and their potential to have a further and greater impact on \n     jobs and the economy. While I regularly hear concerns about \n     the compounding costs related to implementing any and all of \n     these regulations, the specific areas that are mentioned the \n     most include, but are not limited to:\n\n       Individual Mandate and related penalties\n       Employer Mandate and related penalties\n       Defining Essential Health Benefits and related coverage \n     mandates\n       Accountable Care Organizations\n       New taxes and fees including the ``Cadillac Tax'' and new \n     excise taxes on industries\n       1099 reporting\n\n       Additionally, I hear often that patients and providers feel \n     that they do nut have a voice in the regulatory process and, \n     more specifically, that a number of regulations are being \n     issued through a shortened process. This shortened process \n     allows limited or no input from those most affected by the \n     regulations, prior to their implementation, and may result in \n     greater costs and economic impact if changes are necessary \n     based on comments that the Administration receives. It is my \n     understanding that the PPACA rules that have been issued as \n     interim final rules, and therefore with limited input are:\n\n       National Provider Identifier\n       Web Portal Requirements\n       Early Retiree Reinsurance Program\n       Coverage of Children to Age 26\n       Underserved Rural Communities\n       Grandfathered Health Plans\n       Pre-Existing Condition Exclusions\n       Preventive Services\n       Internal Claims/Appeals and External Review Processes\n       Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan Program\n       Amendment to Grandfathered Health Plans Rule\n       Medical Loss Ratio Requirements\n\n       While there may have been instances in which a shortened \n     process was necessary or appropriate I would strongly \n     encourage your Administration to limit the use of this \n     regulatory process and take every available opportunity to \n     get feedback from those who would be most affected by these \n     regulations and allow for ample time to review and consider \n     that feedback prior to implementing future regulatory \n     priorities. I would also strongly encourage you to review any \n     comments you have received on these regulations for any \n     concerns that indicate a potential to further our economic \n     crisis.\n       Without fail in my conversations with patients, providers, \n     advocates, and stakeholders, which include my Kansas \n     constituents, I hear about their concerns with the burden of \n     government ``red tape'' and the impact of regulations on \n     their ability to maintain and grow their businesses. While \n     this is not an exhaustive list, I will share the health care \n     regulations that I have been hearing about the most and would \n     ask you to review them for their potential economic impact \n     and modify or remove them to ensure the least burden on our \n     struggling businesses, individuals, and economy.\n       It should come as no surprise the regulations that I am \n     hearing the most about are related to the impact of PPACA. \n     Although the full impact of recently passed health care \n     legislation is still uncertain, it is clear that additional \n     employer costs will be substantial, as will the burden of \n     what promises to be extreme complexity in compliance. Already \n     patients, providers and advocates have cited a number of \n     regulations related to PPACA that would have profound impact \n     on jobs and our economy. Specifically:\n\n       The ``Preexisting Condition Insurance Plan'' and the \n     concern that it is not being utilized efficiently to provide \n     an option for those unable to afford coverage;\n       The ``Patients Bill of Rights'' and the concern that it has \n     resulted in the loss of child-only insurance markets in over \n     20 states;\n       ``Grandfathered'' health plan regulation and a concern that \n     the regulation is drafted too narrowly to allow businesses to \n     keep their current coverage and maintain current costs of \n     coverage and are too cumbersome and don't allow plans to \n     comply with ``the early requirements over a period of time'';\n       ``Medical Loss Ratio'' and the concern that the calculation \n     of the standard will increase cost of care for patients and \n     the concern that it will directly result in lost employment \n     and more specifically the omission of health care fraud work \n     as part of ongoing quality improvement activities;\n       ``Rate Review'' and the concern that this requirement will \n     do nothing to control costs and that there are a number of \n     areas within the rule that could cause significant and \n     negative disruption to States and consumers;\n       ``Annual and Lifetime limits'' and the concern over the \n     impact on businesses and individuals the more than 1,000 \n     waivers already issued will have.\n\n       Additionally, I have heard that the combination of the \n     regulations being issued to implement the PPACA statute have \n     resulted in an increase in premiums for individuals and \n     businesses, which as you know results in increased costs and \n     tough choices. Related to this, I am deeply concerned by \n     signals from your Administration that regulations being \n     issued to implement the PPACA statute will not be held under \n     the scrutiny of your Executive Order. I would strongly \n     encourage your Administration to review all of the \n     regulations that have been issued, past, present and future, \n     while considering their impact on our economy and jobs.\n       Finally, patients and providers have expressed a number of \n     concerns related to the regulatory burdens that they face. \n     Generally, they have asked that while the Administration may \n     measure indirect benefits for regulatory proposals, that \n     there is a lack of willingness to analyze and make publicly \n     available the indirect costs to consumers, such as higher \n     energy costs, jobs lost, and higher prices and would request \n     that a reasonable estimate of indirect impact and the \n     methodology used in determining those impacts be made \n     available. They would prefer that agencies be accountable for \n     providing a balanced statement of costs and benefits in \n     public regulatory proposals. Also, I have heard that a number \n     of patients and providers are being buried by the paperwork \n     burden of complying with all of the regulations. \n     Specifically, I have heard about the compliance burden of \n     having to adjust to the sheer volumes of changes that the \n     Administration issues every year and the impact on providers \n     to do their jobs and provide care for patients.\n       The regulations that I have been hearing about their \n     negative economic impacts and would suggest you review are:\n\n       The 2011 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Final Rule, which \n     requires that laboratory requisition forms are signed by the \n     ordering physician. This rule could have potentially serious \n     implications on patient care and business practice. Under \n     this new policy, laboratories will face a difficult decision \n     when they receive a patient specimen with an unsigned \n     requisition. Laboratories will have to decide not to provide \n     their needed services and therefore be unable to provide a \n     physician the information necessary to make health care \n     decisions--or--provide the services without a guarantee of \n     payment and then work to obtain signatures in order to submit \n     claims to Medicare. As you can imagine, in the former \n     situation, care may be significantly delayed; in the latter \n     scenario the laboratories who serve a high percentage of \n     Medicare beneficiaries could spend a large amount of time \n     contacting providers to gather the required signatures and \n     could see their payments delayed or face the possibility of \n     being unable to receive payment.\n       On November, 17, 2010, CMS issued a final rule, as directed \n     by PPACA (P.L. 111-148). The rule conditions payment for home \n     health and hospice services based upon a face-to-face \n     encounter between patients and their physicians or certain \n     non-physician practitioners prior to certification for home \n     health or hospice services. This is resulting in burdensome \n     requirements for our rural home health and hospice patients.\n       Physicians Assistants are an important part of care for \n     rural communities especially hospice and palliative care; \n     however, they are often not considered when drafting \n     regulations related to providers allowed to provide services.\n       Anti-Switching Rule in Medicare's Competitive Bidding \n     Program (CBP) for Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, \n     Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS). Specifically, the proposal \n     to enforce the rule in subsequent rounds of the CBP, but not \n     Round 1, may compromise beneficiary access to appropriate \n     diabetes testing supplies and leave beneficiaries vulnerable \n     to pressure from suppliers to switch testing systems.\n       DMEPOS Competitive Bidding implementation continues to be a \n     concern. We originally had over 400 DME providers in KS; \n     however, now that Round 1 has been implemented I am concerned \n     that patients, especially in rural areas, are facing issues \n     related to access.\n       Two sets of regulations and guidance--one for hospices and \n     one for rural health clinics--that may have resulted in an \n     oversight in the Medicare billing regulations is creating \n     obstacles for individuals in rural, underserved communities \n     to receive hospice care. In these communities, the primary \n     care physicians are often (and sometimes exclusively) members \n     of Medicare-certified ``rural health clinics.'' However, when \n     a hospice patient's attending physician also happens to be a \n     rural health clinic physician, Medicare\n\n[[Page S1536]]\n\n     is not reimbursing either the physician or the clinic for the \n     physician's services.\n       Health IT rules related to implementing the Health \n     Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health \n     (HITECH) Act which I am hearing are creating uncertainty and \n     confusion, jeopardizing the goal of the rapid adoption of \n     electronic health records. Without policy changes, innovation \n     will be marginalized and job creation threatened.\n       Privacy and security regulations adopted by HHS under the \n     Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIP AA) \n     and the HITECH Act expand the accounting of disclosures \n     requirement to include all disclosures, even daily, routine \n     disclosures. While patient safety and privacy should be a \n     high priority, businesses are concerned that maintaining \n     detailed records would require an overwhelming amount of \n     information to be stored.\n       The short amount of time to comply with new ICD10 and 5010 \n     coding requirements impose an incredible administrative \n     burden that I am hearing will increase administrative costs \n     significantly.\n       CMS regulations that restrict the ability of non-physician \n     practitioners to meeting the CMS requirement for supervision \n     for cardiac and pulmonary rehab. These rules are limiting \n     access to cardiac and pulmonary rehab, particularly in rural \n     and Critical Access Hospitals.\n\n       Clearly this is not a comprehensive list, but it represents \n     a number of areas that patients, providers and constituents \n     have expressed concerns on.\n       Again, thank you for the opportunity to share my \n     recommendations on what rules and regulations pose serious \n     negative consequences to the growth of our nation. As the \n     112th Congress gets under way, I will continue to identify to \n     your Adminitration regulations that handicap American \n     businesses and halt American job creation. It is my hope that \n     we can create a regulatory environment that provides American \n     businesses with the necessary tools to hire and thrive in \n     this global market.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Pat Roberts,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. As I have already discussed on the Senate floor, an \nExecutive order was issued by the President on January 18. It was a \ngood order. I applauded that order. It committed all Federal agencies \nto review regulations and then to try to remove any that placed \nunreasonable burdens on our Nation's businesses and/or impact the \nability of our economy to grow, to recover.\n  I agree that, in light of our current economic crisis, establishing a \nregulatory environment that promotes growth and job creation should be \nthe No. 1 priority for this Congress and the administration. I applaud \nwhat the President said when he issued the Executive order--that there \nare some regulations that are duplicative, costly, and unnecessary and, \nas he said, downright dumb. There was loud applause in farm country, \nmanufacturing, health care, education--you name it. However, after \nreviewing the Executive order, I remind my colleagues that I was left--\nand I hope if you read it you are left--with some larger concerns. \nSpecifically, the order left open a number of very large loopholes. It \nwas an Executive order without teeth.\n  When I was in Kansas over this last work period, I talked to \nvirtually all of our Kansas patients, providers, and advocates about \nthe President's Executive order and my legislation, which is called the \nRegulatory Reform for Our Economy Act. I held a stakeholder roundtable \nin Topeka. I held a roundtable in our State capitol, in order to get \nfeedback from patients and provider groups on their thoughts related to \nhealth care reform. I was not surprised to hear that every \nrepresentative at that meeting had a concern with regulations, but the \nsheer volume of regulatory concerns as seen by my staff and myself was \ntruly extraordinary.\n  I was already aware of regulations, such as those put forth by the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, along with the Department of \nLabor and Treasury, that have resulted in the child-only insurance \nmarket effectively disappearing in 20 States. Which I believe is the \nresult of overregulation or overrequirements.\n  I have already sent letters to the administration detailing my \nconcerns with regulations, such as--stick with me now--first, the 2011 \nMedicare physician fee schedule final rule, which requires that \nlaboratory requisition forms are signed by the ordering physician. This \nrule could have potentially serious implications on patient care and \nbusiness practice.\n  Second, on November 17, 2010, CMS, the Center for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services, issued a final rule which, as required by the new \nhealth care law--the acronym for that is PPACA--conditions payment for \nhome health and hospice services based upon a face-to-face encounter \nbetween patients and their physicians or certain nonphysician \npractitioners prior to certification for home health or hospice \nservices. On top of about a $11 billion cut to hospice, which is rather \nincredible, this is resulting in burdensome requirements for our rural \nhome health and hospice patients. For those who need this help the \nmost, this is truly hard to understand.\n  Third, the antiswitching rule in Medicare's competitive bidding \nprogram--the acronym is CBP; there is an acronym for everything--for \ndurable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies. \nSpecifically, that proposal to enforce the rule in subsequent rounds of \nthe competitive bidding program, but not round one, may compromise \nbeneficiary access to appropriate diabetes testing supplies and leave \nbeneficiaries vulnerable to pressure from suppliers to switch testing \nsystems.\n  I am going to try to get rid of the gobbledygook and say that during \nthe initial round of competitive bidding for medical equipment, some of \nthe suppliers didn't even know there was an initial round of \ncompetitive bidding. In Kansas City, there were 424 suppliers, and 20 \nsubmitted bids this time around. We delayed it to this year because it \nwas so onerous. Then this year came around and CMS selected 20. What \nhappened to the other 404? What happened to the people who depended on \npharmacists and home health care providers for that walker, that \ncrutch, or whatever they need--or oxygen tank, for that matter? We are \nleft with huge holes in the home health care industry and a need for \nproviding DME equipment.\n  I was surprised to hear that every representative at this stakeholder \nmeeting--and all representative groups were invited, including hospital \nadministrators, doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and hospice folks. I \nbelieve it was the first time they met at the same time. I was \nsurprised to hear that every representative at this stakeholder meeting \nto discuss the impacts of health care reform had concerns with \nregulations, some of which are buried in the volumes of regulations \nbeing put out every day, and many that defy comprehension.\n  When discussing the President's Executive order and regulations with \nmy constituents and those representing the patient and provider \ncommunity, the No. 1 concern I heard was a fear not just of the current \nregulations, which they are trying to keep up with, but of future \nregulations.\n  While there is considerable concern with the burden of regulations \nthat have already been issued, I heard time and again that there is an \neven greater concern with the uncertainty of future regulations, \nespecially those implementing the Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act, or PPACA, and their potential to have further and greater \nimpact on jobs and the economy and health care--even greater than the \nimpacts we discussed during the health care reform debate. At the \nstakeholder meeting we had meaningful dialog about that. This is akin \nto a second health care reform earthquake. If you are a health care \nprovider, hang on.\n  Additionally, I have heard that the combination of the regulations \nbeing issued to implement the PPACA statute has resulted in an increase \nin premiums--to repeat that, an increase in premiums, not cost \nsavings--for individuals and businesses, which, as you know, results in \nincreased costs and very tough choices.\n  Related to this, I am concerned by reports that I am hearing that \nstaff within the administration have signaled that regulations being \nissued to implement the PPACA statute already comply with the \nPresident's Executive order and would not need to be included in a \nreview. Does that mean all the health care regulations pouring out of \nCMS are not going to be subject to the President's Executive order? \nWhat is that? This is one of the biggest worries we have throughout the \ncountry regarding health care, and the President issues an Executive \norder and says let's take a look. Do the costs outweigh the benefits? \nAre they duplicative, unnecessary, or just plain dumb?\n\n[[Page S1537]]\n\nThose are his words. CMS is exempted? Health care is exempted? That is \nunreal.\n  I believe otherwise, and this belief is being verified by personal \nstories from Kansans. In my letter to the President today, I strongly \nencouraged him to review all of the regulations that have been issued, \npast, present, and future, while considering their impact on the \neconomy and jobs. Sure, it would be a tough job. It is time, with the \n``Katrina'' of regulations pouring out of the various agencies in \nWashington.\n  Understanding this, last month, I, along with Senators Barrasso and \nCoats, and with the support of 38 Senate colleagues--have introduced \nthe Regulatory Responsibility for Our Economy Act, S. 358. I urge my \ncolleagues on the other side, who I am going to engage in the next \nweek. We will go face to face and I will try to convince you.\n  My bill moves to codify and strengthen President Obama's January 18 \nExecutive order that directs agencies within the administration to \nreview, modify, streamline, expand, or repeal those significant \nregulatory actions that are, in the President's words, duplicative, \nunnecessary, overly burdensome, or would have significant economic \nimpacts on Americans. I have given President Obama credit for saying \nthat, but I don't give him credit for including the loopholes.\n  While I agree in principle with the President that we need to take a \nserious look at both current and proposed Federal regulations, I don't \nthink his Executive order actually does what it purports to do. I have \nsome loopholes listed. In Dodge City, where I come from, coming close \nto the truth is coming pretty close, but it still ain't the truth. I \nthink this is where this fits.\n  The Executive order states--and I want everybody in the Senate, if \nyou are listening, or if your staff is listening, provide this to your \nmember. Figure this out:\n\n       In applying these principles, each agency is directed to \n     use the best available techniques to quantify anticipated \n     present and future benefits and costs as accurately as \n     possible.\n\n  That is a good thing.\n\n       Where appropriate and permitted by law, each agency may \n     consider (and discuss qualitatively)--\n\n  and this is the part where I had the most concern, and I hope \nsomebody can explain it.\n\n     values that are difficult or impossible to quantify, \n     including equity, human dignity, fairness, and distributive \n     impacts.\n\n  What is that? ``But,'' as the Wall Street Journal captured so \neloquently in their response to President Obama's editorial, ``these \namorphous concepts are not measurable at all.'' They are not.\n  On the surface, I feel this language has the potential to be a very \nlarge loophole--probably is already. I believe this is the loophole \nbeing used to exempt the PPACA regulations from this review. That is \nunfortunate. In fact, upon reading and rereading it, it could be better \ndescribed as gobbledygook.\n  As a matter of fact, it got my gobbledygook award of the month this \npast month. My legislation would close the loopholes in President \nObama's Executive order and would close other existing loopholes, \nincluding those the administration has been using--or the Secretaries \nfor the various agencies have been using--to bypass valuable \nstakeholder input on regulations. In fact, I hear often that patients \nand providers believe they do not have a voice in the regulatory \nprocess.\n  More specifically, I hear that a number of regulations are currently \nbeing issued through a shortened process which allows limited or no \ninput from those most affected by the regulations prior to their \nimplementation--that is wrong--and they may result in an even greater \nconfusion and burden which then results in greater costs and economic \nimpact, especially if changes are necessary based on later comments \nthat the administration does receive.\n  It is my understanding the PPACA rules that have been issued as \ninterim final rules and, therefore, with limited input--and they will \nprobably become final--are the national provider identifier, Web portal \nrequirements, Early Retiree Reinsurance Program, coverage of children \nto age 26. Underserved rural communities, grandfathered health plans, \npreexisting condition exclusions, preventive services, internal claims/\nappeals and external review processes, Pre-existing Condition Insurance \nPlan Program, amendment to grandfathered health plans rule, and medical \nlost ratio requirements. That is a bunch of them--all regulations \nthrough a shortened process.\n  While there may have been instances in which a shortened process was \nnecessary or appropriate, this lengthy list is why passage of my \nlegislation is so critically important.\n  I ask the Presiding Officer if I have exceeded my time. If I have, I \nwould like 2 additional minutes to close.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. May I have 2 additional minutes, and I will close.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. In my letter to the President today, I have encouraged \nthe administration to limit the use of this shortened regulatory \nprocess and take every available opportunity to get feedback from those \nwho would be most affected by these regulations--that just makes \nsense--and allow for ample time to review and consider that feedback \nprior to implementing the future regulatory priorities. We are going to \nhave better regulations if, in fact, you ask folks: Is this going to \nwork? Maybe tweak it, maybe repeal it. Who knows. The President himself \nsaid that.\n  In addition, I have encouraged the administration to review any \ncomments received on these regulations that have already been issued \nfor any concerns that indicate a potential to further our economic \nproblems and crises.\n  In closing, I invite my friends on both sides of the aisle to sign on \nas a cosponsor of my legislation, realizing the immense opportunities \nit creates for meaningful review and possible revocation of regulations \ncounter to our Nation's growth.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his suggestion of \nthe absence of a quorum?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I will be delighted to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/10/senate-section/article/S1537-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Max Oliver Cogburn, Jr., \nof North Carolina, to be United States District Judge for the Western \nDistrict of North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I wish to talk about Max Oliver Cogburn, \nJr., judicial nominee for the U.S. district court in the Western \nDistrict of North Carolina.\n  Judge Cogburn was nominated for the second time by President Obama on \nJanuary 25, 2011, and was favorably reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee by voice vote on February 3, 2011.\n  It is extremely important to me that North Carolina has highly \ncapable representation on our Federal courts. Judge Cogburn is exactly \nthe type of legal mind we need as a judge on North Carolina's Western \nDistrict Court.\n  Since coming to the Senate, I have worked to increase the number of \nNorth Carolinians on the Federal judiciary. Unfortunately, it has \nturned out to be a rather slow and arduous process. After months of \nmaking the case that North Carolina deserves more representation on the \nFourth Circuit last year, Judges Jim Wynn and Al Diaz were confirmed \nunanimously by the Senate.\n  North Carolina is better off because Judges Jim Wynn and Al Diaz--\nhighly qualified, experienced, and fairminded judges--are now serving \non the Fourth Circuit. It is my hope that very soon North Carolina will \nhave another Federal judge with the confirmation of\n\n[[Page S1538]]\n\nJudge Cogburn. All of these judges have received bipartisan support, \nand I am pleased that Senator Burr has joined with me in recommending \nthese judges.\n  I recommended Judge Cogburn because of his distinguished record as a \njurist and attorney in both the public and private sectors. After \nearning degrees from Samford University Cumberland School of Law and \nUNC Chapel Hill, he entered private practice.\n  Judge Cogburn has worked in private practice off and on since 1976, \nhandling criminal felonies and misdemeanors, civil torts, domestic \ncases, and corporate work. Judge Cogburn also served as an assistant \nU.S. attorney from 1980 to 1992 where he prosecuted murder cases, drug \ntrafficking, voter fraud, and a wide variety of Federal crimes.\n  During his time with the U.S. Attorney's Office, Judge Cogburn served \nas the lead attorney of the Organized Crime and Drug Task Force, as \nwell as the chief assistant U.S. attorney.\n  From 1995 to 2004, Judge Cogburn served as a magistrate judge on the \nU.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina. As a \nmagistrate judge, he ruled on cases involving sexual harassment, racial \ndiscrimination in employment, fraud, age discrimination, products \nliability, and medical malpractice.\n  Judge Cogburn has received the American Bar Association's highest \nrating of ``well-qualified.'' He has the skills and legal experience \nthis position requires.\n  I am pleased to speak about Judge Cogburn's outstanding \nqualifications to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Western \nDistrict of North Carolina. I am confident that Judge Cogburn will \nserve on the bench with clarity and distinction. I have worked steadily \nto see that he is confirmed quickly. I look forward to casting that \nvote shortly. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me and Senator Burr in \nsupport of Judge Cogburn's nomination and vote in favor of his \nconfirmation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I also wish to talk about this historic day. \nIt is historic because we are actually going to confirm Max Cogburn \nfaster than it took for the nomination to come through. Today, in this \naustere body, that is an accomplishment. But in large measure it says a \nlot about the President's nominee.\n  Max Cogburn has been nominated to the Federal bench in North \nCarolina's Western District. He is an excellent choice and I believe \nwill be a needed but great addition to the court.\n  The Cogburn family roots are in western North Carolina's mountains, \nand they run deep. It is an impressive family history, but Max has made \na name for himself in his legal career and his public service: \nAssistant U.S. attorney, chief assistant U.S. attorney, magistrate \njudge, and in private practice.\n  In addition to his legal career, which certainly qualifies him for \nthe bench in his own right, the Cogburn's other business cannot help \nbut be a benefit. You see, he and his family run a dude ranch outside \nof Asheville, NC.\n  I thank the Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, as I said, for \nacting so quickly on this nomination. Nominees to the Federal bench are \nbestowed with a high honor but also a high amount of uncertainty and \nstress as they and their families go through a sometimes never-ending \nprocess. I am grateful this process has been relatively short and sweet \nfor Max.\n  He was nominated in May of 2010, had his hearing during the lameduck \nsession, and was reported out in December, still during the lameduck \nsession. I am sorry this body missed the opportunity at that time to \nfinalize his confirmation. He did not get a vote in the last Congress, \nbut that, of course, is not unusual for a nominee of either party who \nis reported by the committee late in the process.\n  He was reported out again in February and is actually getting a vote \nin less time, as I said, than it took the White House to nominate him, \nespecially following the departure and retirement of Judge Thornburg.\n  I appreciate the Judiciary Committee's commitment to move quickly. I \njoin my colleague, Senator Hagan, in encouraging all of our colleagues \nto unanimously support this appointment to the Federal bench.\n  I might say, in conclusion, the underlying reason Max Cogburn should \nget the overwhelming support of all the Members of the Senate and \nshould be the newest member of our court in the Western District is \nbecause Max Cogburn is a good man. He comes from good stock, but on his \nown he is a good man and a great American. Today he deserves this House \nto unanimously support this nomination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Hagan on the \nSenate's consideration of the nomination of Max O. Cogburn.\n  Max O. Cogburn is nominated to sit on the U.S. District Court for the \nWestern District of North Carolina, the very district where he has \nserved for 9 years as a magistrate judge and for 12 years as an \nassistant U.S. attorney. Mr. Cogburn is currently a partner in the \nAsheville, NC, law firm of Cogburn and Brazil, and also serves as an \nappointed member of the North Carolina Education Lottery Commission.\n  This nomination could--and in my view should--have been considered \nand confirmed last year. Instead, it was unnecessarily returned to the \nPresident without final Senate action, despite the nominee's \nqualifications and the needs of the American people to have judges \navailable to hear cases in the Federal courts. The President has had to \nrenominate him, the Senate Judiciary Committee has had to reconsider \nhim and now, finally, the Senate is being allowed to consider him.\n  I suspect the Senate will now confirm him unanimously or nearly so. \nHe has the support of both his home state Senators, one a Democrat and \nthe other a Republican. The nomination of Max Cogburn to fill a vacancy \nin the Western District of North Carolina is one that was reported \nwithout opposition by the Judiciary Committee both last year and, \nagain, earlier this year.\n  Besides this nomination, there are two nominees ready to fill \nvacancies in the District of Columbia. Recently, Seth Stern reported in \nCongressional Quarterly criticism from Chief Judge Lamberth of the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia, who warned that the \nbreakdown in the judicial confirmation process is ``injuring the \ncountry.'' The two judicial nominees to fill longstanding vacancies for \nhis court are still waiting for final consideration by the Senate. \nThey, too, were reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee last \nyear and again this year. They, too, are being needlessly delayed. The \nSenate should consider and confirm them without further delay. I will \nask that a copy of the article be printed in the Record.\n  Also reported from the Judiciary Committee and before the Senate are \nnominees to fill a judicial emergency vacancy in New York, a judicial \nemergency vacancy on the Second Circuit and a judicial vacancy in \nOregon. They should be debated and confirmed without delay, as well. \nEarlier today, the Judiciary Committee moved forward to vote on two \nadditional Federal circuit nominees and four additional district court \nnominees. They are now available to the Senate for its consideration, \nas well.\n  After the confirmation of Mr. Cogburn, there will be 11 judicial \nnominees left waiting for Senate consideration having been reviewed by \nthe Judiciary Committee. We are holding hearings every two weeks and \nhope finally to begin to bend the curve and start to lower judicial \nvacancies across the country. We can do that if the Senate continues to \nconsider judicial nominations in regular order as they are reported by \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  Federal judicial vacancies around the country still number too many \nand they have persisted for too long. That is why Chief Justice \nRoberts, Attorney General Holder, White House Counsel Bob Bauer and \nmany others--including the President of the United States--have spoken \nout and urged the Senate to act.\n  Nearly one out of every eight Federal judgeships remains vacant. This \nputs at serious risk the ability of all Americans to have a fair \nhearing in court. The real price being paid for these unnecessary \ndelays is that the judges that remain are overburdened and the American \npeople who depend on them are being denied hearings and justice in a \ntimely fashion.\n\n[[Page S1539]]\n\n  Regrettably, the progress we made during the first 2 years of the \nBush administration has not been duplicated, and the progress we made \nover the 8 years from 2001 to 2009 to reduce judicial vacancies from \n110 to a low of 34 was reversed. The vacancy rate we reduced from 10 \npercent at the end of President Clinton's term to less than 4 percent \nin 2008 has now risen back to over 10 percent. In contrast to the sharp \nreduction in vacancies we made during President Bush's first 2 years \nwhen the Democratically controlled Senate confirmed 100 of his judicial \nnominations, only 60 of President Obama's judicial nominations were \nallowed to be considered and confirmed during his first 2 years. We \nhave not kept up with the rate of attrition, let alone brought the \nvacancies down. By now they should have been cut in half. Instead, they \ncontinue to hover around 100.\n  The Senate must do better. The Nation cannot afford further delays by \nthe Senate in taking action on the nominations pending before it. \nJudicial vacancies on courts throughout the country hinder the Federal \njudiciary's ability to fulfill its constitutional role. They create a \nbacklog of cases that prevents people from having their day in court. \nThis is unacceptable.\n  We can consider and confirm this President's nominations to the \nFederal bench in a timely manner. President Obama has worked with \nDemocratic and Republican home state Senators to identify superbly \nqualified, consensus nominations. None of the nominations on the \nExecutive Calendar are controversial. They all have the support of \ntheir home State Senators, Republicans and Democrats. All have a strong \ncommitment to the rule of law and a demonstrated faithfulness to the \nConstitution.\n  During President Bush's first term, his first 4 tumultuous years in \noffice, we proceeded to confirm 205 of his judicial nominations. We \nconfirmed 100 of those during the 17 months I was Chairman during \nPresident Bush's first 2 years in office. So far in President Obama's \nthird year in office, the Senate has only been allowed to consider 71 \nof his Federal circuit and district court nominees. We remain well \nshort of the benchmark we set during the Bush administration. When we \napproach it we can reduce vacancies from the historically high levels \nat which they have remained throughout these first three years of the \nObama administration to the historically low level we reached toward \nthe end of the Bush administration.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe article to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       [From CQ Today Online News--Legal Affairs, Feb. 28, 2011]\n\n   Judges: `Totally Broken' Confirmation Process Causing `Dire' Case \n                                Backlogs\n\n                            (By Seth Stern)\n\n       Two federal judges criticized the slow pace of judicial \n     confirmations Monday, saying cases are backlogged and judges \n     overwhelmed at the trial court level.\n       Speaking at a Brookings Institution event on judicial \n     nominations, Royce Lamberth, the chief judge of the U.S. \n     District Court for the District of Columbia, said the \n     confirmation process is ``totally broken'' and that the \n     pattern of ``paybacks and the bickering have been thoroughly \n     bipartisan.''\n       Lamberth, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan in \n     1987, raised similar concerns in a speech in March 2009, just \n     after the start of the Obama administration. But he said he \n     was increasingly concerned by the delays in the confirmation \n     of federal trial judges, which has only worsened in the two \n     years since.\n       ``I say to both Democrats and Republicans, you are injuring \n     the country,'' Lamberth said.\n       Lamberth was joined on the panel by William Furgeson Jr., a \n     Texas district court judge who said judges' growing caseloads \n     resulting from the vacancies in his district in western Texas \n     are a ``desperate problem'' that results in ``assembly-line \n     justice.''\n       Furgeson called the situation on the border ``dire,'' \n     adding it was a ``giant mystery'' why senators now fight over \n     trial court judges.\n       Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. had also emphasized the \n     ``persistent problem'' of vacancies on the federal bench in \n     his annual report on the state of the judiciary released in \n     December.\n       ``Each political party has found it easy to turn on a dime \n     from decrying to defending the blocking of judicial \n     nominations, depending on their changing political \n     fortunes,'' Roberts wrote in the report.\n       Only 67 percent of Obama's district court nominees were \n     confirmed during his first two years in office, compared to \n     92 percent for George W. Bush and 87 percent for Bill \n     Clinton, according to statistics compiled by Russell Wheeler, \n     a visiting fellow at the liberal-leaning Brookings \n     Institution, and 83 of 677 district court seats were vacant \n     as of Feb. 25.\n       The Senate has confirmed six district court judges so far \n     this year, including two more Monday: Amy Totenberg and Steve \n     C. Jones to the Northern District of Georgia.\n       On Wednesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee will hold a \n     second confirmation hearing for President Obama's most \n     controversial judicial nominee: Goodwin Liu, who was first \n     nominated for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th \n     Circuit in 2009.\n       The University of California law professor has faced \n     intense criticism from Republicans for his liberal views and \n     for repeatedly amending the materials he has provided to the \n     Judiciary Committee.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business, with the understanding that I will yield the floor if \nanyone comes to the floor to speak on the Cogburn nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Belarus Resolution\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of a \nbipartisan resolution that has been submitted by our colleague, Senator \nDurbin, and of which I am proud to be a cosponsor, which concerns the \nsituation in the country of Belarus.\n  As the winds of democratic change have been sweeping now across North \nAfrica and the Middle East ousting autocratic rulers who have been long \nentrenched there, it is important for us to remember there is still one \nremaining dictatorship in Europe, and that is in the country of \nBelarus.\n  In the 20 years since the fall of the Soviet Union, Belarus's \nneighbors to the north and west have become successful, prosperous \ndemocracies. But, tragically, while Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia have \nbroken the chains of tyranny and joined the flagship institutions of \nthe Euro-Atlantic world, NATO, and the European Union, Belarus and its \npeople have been left behind--held back by its despot ruler Alexander \nLukashenko, who has ruled his country through repression and rigged \nelections for nearly two decades.\n  Some in the United States and Europe had hoped in recent years that \nLukashenko might be prepared to open up Belarus and change his ways. \nThese hopes, however, came to an abrupt end on December 19 of last year \nwhen Belarus held Presidential elections. As it quickly became clear \nthat the votes in those elections were neither free nor fair, thousands \nof Belarusian people took to the streets of Minsk in protest, and the \nLukashenko regime responded with violence and brutality.\n  This resolution would put the Senate on record in response to the \ncrackdown launched in Belarus on December 19--a crackdown, I add, that \ncontinues in significant ways to this day.\n  More than 600 people were swept up by Belarusian security forces on \nelection day and its immediate aftermath--among them journalists, civil \nsociety representatives, political activists, and several opposition \nPresidential candidates. It is hard to believe this kind of behavior \nstill exists in this world today. The detained continue to be denied \naccess to family, lawyers, medical treatment, and open legal \nproceedings, while their relatives and attorneys endure harassment by \nLukashenko's security forces.\n  This resolution will do several significant things. First, it will \nsend a strong and clear message to Lukashenko that his actions are \nunacceptable and will carry significant costs. It tells him we do not \nconsider the December 19 election to be legitimate and that he is, \ntherefore, not the legitimately elected leader of Belarus, and that \nthere should be new elections that are free, fair, and meet \ninternational standards. I would add that the European Parliament \npassed a resolution not long ago that says precisely the same thing \nthat I have just said here in the Senate.\n\n  Perhaps even more important, this resolution will send a message to \nthe people of Belarus who were struggling to secure their fundamental \nfreedoms.\n\n[[Page S1540]]\n\nIt tells the dissidents there that we have not and will not forget them \nor their cause; that we remember their names, in fact, and we will \nstand in solidarity with them until they achieve their goal, which is a \nfree and democratic Belarus.\n  Last month, Senator McCain and I and others traveled to Vilnius, \nLithuania, where we met with Belarusian students and opposition \nmilitary leaders. This was an extremely powerful experience for all of \nus. We heard directly from them about the repression taking place in \ntheir home country. The substance of the resolution Senator Durbin has \nwritten and submitted, with cosponsorship by several of us, reflects \nwhat the Belarusians we met with in Vilnius told us, as well as what we \nheard here in Washington from other dissidents from that country.\n  The resolution specifically calls for the immediate and unconditional \nrelease of all political prisoners in Belarus. It also urges a \ntightening of the sanctions against Lukashenko, and we are urging the \nObama administration to offer the strongest possible material and \ntechnical support for Belarusian civil society, and that includes, of \ncourse, the political opposition.\n  This resolution is broadly bipartisan in its sponsorship and reflects \nwhat I think is a wide consensus in the Senate about the situation in \nBelarus today. I know there are some who may look at the resolution and \nsay it is merely symbolic, who say there is nothing we can do to help \nthe people who are living such repressed and unfree lives in Belarus, \nand that we should simply accept the reality of Lukashenko's \ndictatorship after all these years. But if the historic events in \nTunisia and Egypt have taught us anything about our foreign policies, \nit is that the United States does best when we stand with our values \nand with the people who share them--and that what appear to be even the \nmost impregnable regimes can fall with remarkable speed.\n  Obviously, I cannot say exactly when Belarus will be free, but I have \nno doubt that someday it will be free. I am confident the future of \nBelarus belongs not to Lukashenko and his cronies but to the people of \nthat great country--to the dissidents who are in jail, to the students \nwe met in Vilnius last month, to the civil society activists who are \nbeing harassed by the KGB as we speak. It belongs to the people in \nBelarus who want a future of democracy and economic opportunity, not \nSoviet-style repression.\n  This resolution--put together, again I say with thanks, by Senator \nDurbin--puts the Senate on the side of the people of Belarus and \nagainst the Lukashenko regime that is oppressing them. I hope we can \ncome together and swiftly pass this bipartisan measure.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, soon we will be voting on another \nnominee for district court. We continue our rapid pace in which the \nSenate has been confirming President Obama's judicial nominees. This \nvote will mark the 11th judicial nominee to be confirmed this Congress. \nThat is more than double the number confirmed in the 108th Congress, \nwhich only saw five confirmations at this point. Obviously, actions \nspeak louder than words. So far, our actions have had concrete results.\n  The Judiciary Committee met this morning and reported six more \njudicial nominees. That puts the total at 22 nominees reported \nfavorably so far. We continue to hold hearings every 2 weeks and have \nheard from 31 nominees currently pending before the Senate. As I have \nsaid in the past, we will continue to move consensus nominees through \nthe confirmation process. However, we will continue to do our due \ndiligence in evaluating the nominees. What we will not do is put \nquantity confirmed over quality confirmed. These lifetime appointments \nare too important to the Federal Judiciary and the American people to \nallow rubberstamping.\n  Just this past Monday, the Senate confirmed three district court \njudges. In his statement for the record, the chairman of the committee, \nSenator Leahy, stated:\n\n       Nearly one out of every eight Federal judgeships is vacant. \n     This puts at serious risk the ability of all Americans to \n     have a fair hearing in court.\n\n  However, what the chairman neglected to mention is the fact that \nPresident Obama has not put forth a nominee for every vacancy the court \ncurrently faces. In fact, of the 95 judicial vacancies, the Senate only \nhas 45 nominees. That is 53 percent of vacancies without a nominee from \nthe White House.\n  Today, we vote on a nominee to sit on the Western District of North \nCarolina court. While this is an important vacancy, and a vacancy we \nneed to fill, it is not a judicial emergency. However, there is a \njudicial emergency in the Eastern District of North Carolina. That \nseat, which has been vacant since 2005, does not have a nominee \ncurrently pending. President Bush nominated Thomas Alvin Farr to that \nseat twice, but he was never afforded a hearing, let alone an up-or-\ndown vote. I am happy this side of the aisle is not repeating the same \nregrettable treatment Mr. Farr received.\n  With regard to Mr. Cogburn, the nominee we will be voting on, the \nAmerican Bar Association has rated him ``majority well qualified, \nminority qualified.'' He received his B.A. from the University of North \nCarolina at Chapel Hill and his juris doctorate from Cumberland School \nof Law. Mr. Cogburn has practiced law in many capacities. Through his \nwork in private practice, he has worked on a wide range of issues, \nincluding criminal litigation, personal injury, civil litigation, and a \nsignificant amount of mediation.\n  As an assistant U.S. attorney for over a decade, Mr. Cogburn gained \nsubstantial appellate experience. While there, he also served as drug \ntask force attorney and chief assistant U.S. attorney. Mr. Cogburn also \nholds judicial experience. He was appointed to serve an 8-year term as \na U.S. magistrate judge by the U.S. District Court for the Western \nDistrict of North Carolina.\n  After careful evaluation, the Judiciary Committee reported this fine \nnominee by voice vote on February 3, 2011. I congratulate Mr. Cogburn \nand his family on this important lifetime appointment and his \nwillingness to continue in public service.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN.

I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Max Oliver Cogburn, Jr., of North Carolina, to be United States \nDistrict Judge for the Western District of North Carolina?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, I rise to acknowledge the second \nanniversary of a tragic event that happened on March 11, 2009, in the \nnation of Benin in Africa. On that tragic day, a young lady by the name \nof Kate Puzey was tragically murdered in her sleep in her house at \nnight.\n  Kate Puzey was a Peace Corps volunteer from Georgia, who went to \nBenin with all the dreams, hopes and aspirations of the program John F. \nKennedy created over a half century ago. She had served there for \nmonths. She was teaching young African children. She was sharing \nwisdom. She was sharing knowledge. She was sharing her love of mankind. \nShe was representing the United States in the way the Peace Corps \nintended it.\n  Unfortunately, her life was lost. I did not know Kate Puzey before \nher death. I only know her after her death. But I know her through her \nparents, through her schoolmates, and through her fellow Peace Corps \nvolunteers in Africa who told me the story of Kate Puzey, and also, \ntragically, stories of other Peace Corps volunteers who have lost their \nlives or have sacrificed in the service of our country.\n  Tomorrow night, at 6:30, on the steps of the Capitol, there will be a \ncandlelight vigil, acknowledging the second year anniversary of the \ndeath of Kate Puzey. Kate's mother will be here, as well as Peace Corps \nvolunteers, as well as people from the Peace Corps organization. It \nwill be a solemn moment, but it will also be a very sacred moment.\n  As the ranking member of the Africa Subcommittee, I have traveled to \nAfrica on a number of occasions, and I have been in a number of African \ncountries. On each visit, I arrange either a breakfast or a lunch, \nwhere I host the Peace Corps volunteers from the United States in that \ncountry.\n  Without exception, and in every case, these are the finest of \nAmericans.\n  Just 2 years ago, when I was in Tanzania, I met a couple--73 and 72 \nyears old--who in their retirement decided they wanted to give back and \nhelp their country and serve their mankind. They volunteered to go to \nTanzania and build a library where there was not even a library, a book \nor a school, and they built it.\n  In Kenya, I visited with young people who went to Kenya to help carry \nthe message of democracy, to help share, in the terrible slum of \nKibera, the promise and hope of education, of good nutrition, of \nknowledge, of hard work, and of democracy.\n  We as a country are blessed to have men and women who serve us in \nmany capacities--those who may serve in the House or the Senate, those \nwho serve in the branches of the military overseas in harm's way--but \nequal to their service is the service of our Peace Corps volunteers. \nKate Puzey is an example of what those Peace Corps volunteers do--at \nits height.\n  When I attended her funeral, I sat and listened, for over 2 hours, to \nher fellow volunteers, her former classmates tell about the Kate Puzey \nthey knew: the academic genius, the committed volunteer, the person who \nloved life and loved people and wanted to share that love wherever she \ncould.\n  The volunteers in Benin told of her countless sacrifices to help \nyoung people and children in their troubled land, in their difficult \ncountry, to understand better their life's future and to not look to \npoverty as a lifetime of shackles but to look to opportunity as a \nlifetime of hope.\n  Tomorrow night, when the vigil takes place on the steps of the \nCapitol, I will not be here, unfortunately, but I will be saying a \nspecial prayer for the life of Kate Puzey, for her family, and for what \nshe and all volunteers who have sacrificed in the Peace Corps have done \nfor the United States of America, and, better than that, for mankind.\n  We have many great people to be thankful for in this world, but \ntomorrow, at 6:30 p.m., on the steps of the Capitol, there will be a \npause to recognize the life, the legacy, and the sacrifice of Kate \nPuzey and I will be there in spirit and I will be with her in prayer.\n  I yield back and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/10/senate-section/article/S1541-5", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1541-S1542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RESTORING DISCIPLINE TO THE BUDGET PROCESS\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, today our Nation faces a very difficult \npolitical landscape when it comes to addressing the major challenges to \nour country, such as unemployment and the deficit. The American public \nis demanding that the House and Senate work with the President to \naddress these concerns.\n  I believe the American people's understandable and growing concern \nover the national debt is shared by every Member of this body. But in \norder for the Congress to address our fiscal crisis, we must fix our \nbroken budget process.\n  Today, with fiscal year 2011 nearly halfway over, as a result of the \nCongress's inability to finish its work, the Federal Government is \nstill operating on stopgap funding designed to avert a government \nshutdown.\n  This is no way to govern. Continuing resolutions make it difficult \nfor Federal agencies to perform their duties. As the Secretary of \nDefense, Mr. Gates, has stated very clearly, operating under a CR \nplaces a great burden on the Department of Defense. The same can be \nsaid for every Federal agency. Our failure to act responsibly makes the \neveryday functioning of government more difficult and less responsive \nto the needs of the American people.\n  Moreover, continuing resolutions make a mockery of our constitutional \nresponsibility to allocate taxpayer funding wisely. Putting the country \non budgetary autopilot is simply unacceptable. It is well past the time \nto cast aside the blistering campaign rhetoric of the fall and find the \nmeans to compromise.\n  Many new Members of this body were elected on the promise of a return \nto fiscal responsibility. I would suggest that returning to regular \norder in our budget process is a necessary component to achieve this \ngoal.\n  The Appropriations Committee produces 12 individual bipartisan \nspending\n\n[[Page S1542]]\n\nbills, but when the Congress fails to act on them through regular \norder, we wind up with a $1 trillion omnibus bill or a $1 trillion \ncontinuing resolution that cedes the power of the purse to the \nexecutive branch.\n  Neither the most liberal nor the most conservative Member of this \nbody should prefer an omnibus or a CR over the regular order in our \nbudget process.\n  Several weeks ago, I had the opportunity to sit down with the new \nchairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Congressman Hal Rogers \nof Kentucky, to congratulate him on his new position.\n  During our discussion, we both agreed that the Congress needs to \nreestablish regular order in the appropriations process. Both Chambers \nneed to pass its bills and allow us to work out our differences in \nconference.\n  I believe if we adopt this approach, we can do our part to help this \nNation regain its economic health.\n  The first step in the process is the adoption of a budget to provide \nthe framework for appropriations bills. The House must step up to the \nplate with a budget that is workable. It cannot hide behind vague \nrhetoric and arbitrary spending caps, and it should not insist upon \nirrational, problematic cuts that would devastate the lives of the \nAmerican people. Likewise, it is imperative that the Senate do its part \nin moving a budget through a responsible and regular order process, \nincluding the timely adoption of a budget resolution. If a budget \nresolution is not adopted by early May, the appropriations process will \nbe delayed. Every week of delay further diminishes our ability to \nfinish our work prior to the end of the fiscal year.\n  In recent years, all too often appropriations bills have been held \nhostage, as Members offered message amendments, knowing they would not \npass, while the time needed to complete 12 freestanding bills slipped \naway. By September, we had abandoned any hope of finishing all 12 bills \nas the calendar simply did not give us enough time.\n  We Democrats must recognize that regular order cannot exist without \nbipartisan cooperation. Last year, despite the lack of a budget \nresolution, the committee completed almost all of its work, preparing \n11 of the 12 appropriations bills for full consideration in a timely \nmanner. However, gridlock on the Senate floor eliminated any further \nprogress.\n  If a more open amendment process for relevant amendments will enable \nthese bills to move forward, we should be open to such an approach even \nif that means taking some uncomfortable votes. This Chamber is split 53 \nto 47. Both sides need to give a little bit, and in so doing, it is my \nhope that we can get the bipartisan appropriations process back on \ntrack.\n  Certainly, no Member of this body wants to explain to his or her \nconstituents why we have failed yet again to responsibly fund the \ngovernment or ceded our constitutional authority to the administration \nor even why we are unable to work together responsibly to avoid a \ndisastrous government shutdown. We must find a way to accomplish the \ntasks the Constitution has assigned to us. To do this, we need a budget \nresolution, we need the House to send over appropriations bills in a \ntimely fashion, we need floor time, and we need a willingness to vote \non amendments. Without these four things, there is no doubt in my mind \nthat I will be standing in this Chamber in late September, yet again, \nseeking passage of a continuing resolution in order to avoid shutting \ndown the government.\n  The House and the Senate need to find a way to work together to pass \nour bills under the regular order and send them to the President. This \nis the only way we can restore discipline to the budget process. It is \nthe only way we can maintain our constitutional responsibility to \ndetermine how taxpayers dollars are spent. It is truly the only way we \ncan avoid repeating the catchall spending bills none of us wants.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/10/senate-section/article/S1542-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1542-S1543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          REDUCING THE DEFICIT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, yesterday the Senate rejected two bills \nto provide funding for the rest of this fiscal year. I voted against \nboth bills, and I want to explain why and to explain what I believe is \nthe only course open to us if we are to be serious about reducing the \nbudget deficit.\n  It was a victory for the American people when the Senate voted \noverwhelmingly to reject the spending bill sent to us by the House. \nHouse Republicans who tell us they want to reduce the deficit have \nproposed a cure that does little to cure our budget disease and does \ngreat damage to the patient in the meantime.\n  The House bill proposed cuts in nondefense discretionary spending, \nand in that area alone. Simple math suggests that we cannot \nmeaningfully reduce the deficit in this manner. These programs \nrepresent less than 15 percent of the total budget. Not surprisingly, \nthen, the Republican proposal would reduce our projected budget deficit \nthis year by only a token amount. As a matter of fact, it would reduce \nour budget deficit this year by less than 1 percent.\n  The Republican plan fails the test of seriousness about the deficit, \nbut it would have done significant damage to programs that Americans \ndepend on. It would have cut more than $1 billion from Head Start. It \nwould have eliminated early childhood education programs for more than \n200,000 American children. It would have cut or eliminated Pell grants \nfor hundreds of thousands of college students. It would have cut $61 \nmillion from the budget request for food inspections, despite the fact \nthat thousands of Americans every year suffer from foodborne illnesses. \nIt would have cut $1 billion from the Women, Infants and Children \nProgram, weakening a program that helps poor families put food on the \ntable. It would cut $180 million from the Securities and Exchange \nCommission budget and more than $100 million from the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission budget. And those are the regulators. Those are the \ncops we need on the beat to make sure we oversee the financial markets \nthat recently devastated our economy.\n  It would have cut nearly $290 million from the Veterans' \nAdministration efforts to provide better service to our veterans.\n  The House budget would have cut $1 billion of funding for community \nhealth centers, eliminating primary care for millions of Americans.\n  The proposal of the House of Representatives, which we soundly \ndefeated here yesterday, would have cut $550 million from National \nScience Foundation research, another $1 billion plus from Department of \nEnergy research, and almost $900 billion from our support for renewable \nenergy sources and energy conservation. All of that would make us even \nmore dependent than we now are on foreign oil.\n  The Republican proposal from the House would have cut $2 billion from \nclean water programs, putting public health at risk, and it would have \ncut $250 million from the Great Lakes restoration efforts.\n  The House proposal would have cut more than $120 million from the \nPresident's request and more than $350 million from the fiscal 2010 \nlevel from border security efforts. That is the very issue--border \nsecurity--which the Republicans, including the Speaker of the House, \nhave called their No. 1 priority. Yet their budget would have cut more \nthan $350 million from the 2010 level for border security.\n  We need to make spending cuts, and I think all of us know that. We \nhave to reduce and remove redundancy and inefficiency in the \ngovernment, and it exists. The President has proposed cuts. We need to \nseek more cuts and we need to act. But the cuts the Republicans \nproposed aren't about increasing efficiency. Their proposal, as Senator \nManchin pointed out yesterday, blindly hacks at the budget with no \nsense of our priorities or of our values as a country. So we wisely \nrejected that path.\n  We also rejected a second proposal, and I voted against that one as \nwell. I rejected it because while it avoided the\n\n[[Page S1543]]\n\nblind hacking at the budget in which the House Republicans engaged, it \nfocused solely on cuts in nondefense discretionary spending. We had two \nchoices yesterday, Draconian cuts or more targeted cuts. But those are \nnot the only two choices available to us. We can choose to seriously \naddress our budget deficit by acknowledging that it cannot be \nsignificantly reduced until we understand that increased revenue as \nwell as spending cuts is part of the solution.\n  How can we raise additional revenue without slowing the economy? We \ncan end the excessive tax cuts for the upper income taxpayers President \nBush put in place. We can close tax loopholes that not only drain the \nTreasury but send American jobs abroad to boot.\n  The cost of the government to continue that upper bracket income tax \ncut President Bush was able to obtain is about $30 billion a year. \nEnding that $30 billion tax cut, which goes to roughly 2 percent of \nAmericans at the very top--those earning more than $200,000--could \nallow us to avoid the drastic cuts in important programs I have \nmentioned, and much more besides.\n  Increasing revenue makes sense not only from a deficit reduction \nperspective, it is also fair. Those at the top, incomewise, have done \nvery well as a group in recent decades, while incomes for most \nAmericans have stagnated. To be specific, the top 1 percent of all \nincome earners has more than doubled their share of total U.S. income \nin the last few decades--from 8.2 percent in 1980 to 17.7 percent in \n2008. Meanwhile, median household income--the income of the typical \nAmerican family--is now 5 percent lower than it was in the late 1990s. \nTo eliminate programs that are critically important to working families \nwhile maintaining tax cuts for those whose incomes have soared would be \na grave injustice.\n  There are also other revenues we could look to if we are truly \nserious about deficit reduction. There are a number of tax loopholes we \ncan close. For example, we should not continue to give corporations a \ntax deduction when they send American jobs overseas. We should not \nallow corporations and wealthy individuals to avoid U.S. taxes by \nhiding assets and income in offshore tax havens. We should not allow \nhedge fund managers to earn enormous incomes and yet pay a lower tax \nrate than their secretaries pay.\n  The American people are looking to us. They are concerned about the \nsize of the deficit and the effect it might have on future generations. \nBut they also reject the notion that Draconian cuts--cuts that fall \nhardest on working families--are the answer. They see the wisdom and \nthe fairness in making sure all Americans share in the sacrifices that \nwill be required as we seek to reduce our deficit.\n  We have an opportunity now to show the American people that we \nunderstand too. We can craft a plan now that preserves vital programs, \nthat makes prioritized and necessary cuts in spending, but also a plan \nthat recognizes the need for comprehensive approaches that address \nrevenue as well as spending. In the coming days, we need to adopt such \na comprehensive approach.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am disappointed that I had to file cloture \non a bill as important as this one. We were going to have a new day in \nthe Senate. I think it is really too bad. This is the small business \ninnovation bill, and everyone knows we have had an open amendment \nprocess. People can offer amendments on anything they want. I think \nthis is suggestive of maybe something I do not understand.\n  Why wouldn't my Republican colleagues want us to move to a small \nbusiness bill to help create jobs? We are told that 85 percent of all \njobs in America are small business jobs. Should we not be trying to \nhelp them? That is what we have been working on. We have not been doing \nall of these things, these ``messages,'' cutting out programs for \nlittle boys and girls who want to learn to read, cutting Pell grants \nfor young men and women who are in college, cutting the ability of \nrenewable energy projects to go forward, and all of these other \nmessages they are sending the American people. We are trying to create \njobs.\n  We have spent this Congress, over here in the Senate, on bipartisan \nissues creating jobs: FAA, 280,000 jobs. We just finished, within the \nlast few hours, the bill that will change the patent system in this \ncountry. That has needed changing for 60 years, and we have done that.\n  Now they are blocking our going to a small business bill, another \nbipartisan bill. Senator Snowe, the ranking member of that committee, \nhas worked with Senator Landrieu to move this bill forward. Who is \nholding up our going to this very important jobs bill? I hope the \nRepublicans in the House are understanding what we are doing over here, \ncreating jobs.\n  With those two bills I have just mentioned, the patent bill and the \nbill dealing with the Federal Aviation Administration, that is 580,000 \njobs. So I am very disappointed I had to file cloture on proceeding to \na small business jobs bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/10/senate-section/article/S1543-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I have introduced legislation, with my\n\n[[Page S1544]]\n\ncolleague Senator Webb, to repeal corn ethanol subsidies and reduce \nethanol tariffs.\n  This legislation has two major provisions.\n  First, it repeals the 45 cent per gallon corn ethanol blender \nsubsidies--26 U.S.C. 6426(b) and 26 U.S.C. 40(h)--as of July 1, 2011, \neliminating the corn ethanol subsidy six months early and saving \napproximately $3 billion for American taxpayers.\n  The bill would not affect the credit for noncorn, second generation \n``advanced biofuels'' through 2011.\n  Second, the bill would lower the tariff on imported ethanol to the \nper gallon level of ethanol subsidies, to reestablish parity between \nthe subsidy and the offsetting tariffs.\n  This removes the real trade barrier on imported ethanol, but also \nprevents foreign producers from benefitting from U.S. subsidies.\n  This legislation is necessary because the 54 cent-per-gallon tariff \non ethanol imports and the 45 cent-per-gallon corn ethanol subsidy are \nfiscally irresponsible and environmentally unwise.\n  And their recent, 1-year extension in December 2010 made our country \nmore dependent on foreign oil.\n  Subsidizing blending ethanol into gasoline is fiscally indefensible.\n  If the current subsidy were to exist through 2014 as the industry has \nproposed, the Federal Treasury would pay oil companies at least $31 \nbillion to use 69 billion gallons of corn ethanol that the Federal \nRenewable Fuels Standard already requires them to use under the Clean \nAir Act.\n  We cannot afford to pay industry for following the law.\n  According to this month's Government Accountability Office report on \n``Opportunities to Reduce Potential Duplication in Government Programs, \nSave Tax Dollars, and Enhance Revenue'':\n\n       The ethanol tax credit and the renewable fuel standard can \n     be duplicative in stimulating domestic production and use of \n     ethanol, and can result in substantial loss of revenue to the \n     Treasury.\n\n  GAO found that the ethanol tax credit, which will cost about $5.7 \nbillion in 2011, is largely unneeded to ensure demand for domestic \nethanol production.\n  The agency recommends that Congress reconsider the necessity of the \ntax credit, given the effectiveness of the renewable fuel standard, \nwhich is administered by EPA.\n  This legislation would simply implement the GAO's recommendation by \nrepealing this wasteful subsidy 6 months early.\n  In addition, this legislation would address the tariffs on ethanol \nthat make our country more dependent on foreign oil.\n  The combined tariffs on ethanol are 11 to 15 cents per gallon higher \nthan the ethanol subsidy it supposedly offsets, and this lack of parity \nputs imported ethanol at a competitive disadvantage against imported \noil.\n  This discourages imports of low carbon biofuel from Brazil, India, \nAustralia, and other sugar producing countries, and it leads to more \noil and gasoline imports from OPEC countries that enter the United \nStates tariff-free.\n  Reducing the ethanol tariff will diversify our fuel supply, replace \noil imports from OPEC countries with low carbon biofuel from our \nallies, and expand our trade relationships with democratic states.\n  The data overwhelmingly demonstrate that the costs of the current \ncorn ethanol subsidy and tariff far outweigh the benefits.\n  The Center for Agricultural and Rural Development at Iowa State \nUniversity recently estimated that a 1-year extension of the ethanol \nsubsidy and tariff would lead to only 427 additional direct domestic \njobs at a cost of almost $6 billion, or roughly $14 million of taxpayer \nmoney per job.\n  According to a July 2010 study by the Congressional Budget Office, \nethanol tax credits cost taxpayers $1.78 for each gallon of gasoline \nconsumption reduced, and $750 for each metric ton of carbon dioxide \nequivalent emissions reduced.\n  The ethanol subsidy and the ethanol tariffs also threaten our \nenvironment.\n  They support and protect significantly more corn production in the \nMississippi River watershed, which experts believe is a primary cause \nof a ``dead zone'' in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  The current ethanol subsidy lacks any requirement that the subsidized \nfuel lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas pollution.\n  And the tariff on ethanol imports also prevents greater use of \nimported ethanol made from sugarcane.\n  Both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air \nResources Board agree that putting sugarcane ethanol in our current \ncars and trucks results in the least greenhouse gas pollution, of all \nwidely available options.\n  In contrast, the legislation I am introducing would--for the first \ntime--limit subsidies only to ``advanced biofuels'' that reduce \npollution at least 50 percent and are produced from noncorn biomass, \nsuch as cellulose, switchgrass, or algae.\n  And it would level the playing field for low carbon biofuel imports, \nwhich must compete against dirty oil from OPEC.\n  Historically our government has helped a product compete in one of \nthree ways: subsidize it, protect it from competition, or require its \nuse.\n  To my knowledge, corn ethanol is the only product receiving all three \nforms of support from the U.S. government at this time.\n  By eliminating ethanol subsidies and trade barriers, this legislation \nwould produce a smaller budget deficit; a healthier Gulf of Mexico \necosystem; less global warming pollution; and reduced dependence on \nimported oil.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to advance responsible \nenergy tax policies that reduce pollution, create jobs, and improve our \ninternational relationships.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the Senate \nvotes on H.R. 1 and Inouye amendment No. 149 regarding spending levels \nfor the remainder of this fiscal year.\n  I opposed H.R. 1 because it called for severe cuts with little or no \nthought to the economic consequences. By cutting programs that support \nour seniors and veterans, as well as programs that contribute to our \neconomic activity, H.R. 1 would have jeopardized our economic recovery \nat a critical time.\n  I voted for the necessary spending cuts included in the Inouye \namendment because I saw it as a start, not an end. I believe additional \ncuts are needed to address our fiscal challenges. I am very\n\n[[Page S1545]]\n\nsupportive of the bipartisan negotiations that are taking place for a \nlonger term comprehensive deficit reduction plan and I would like us to \nmove forward with the more difficult task of addressing our long-term \nfiscal challenges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/10/senate-section/article/S1545-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMERICA INVENTS ACT\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I would like to discuss my amendment, No. 139, to S. \n23, the America Invents Act, on pending claims in false marking cases. \nI want to raise the issue so we can consider it in the future as this \nlegislation progresses.\n  The Patent Act provides a cause of action against those who ``falsely \nclaim that their products are patented. A successful false-marking \nclaimant must prove two elements: first, that an unpatented article has \nbeen marked as patented; and second that the marking was done with \nintent to deceive the public. These actions can hurt small businesses, \nstart-ups and inventors who will be deterred from competing with such \nproducts.\n  The underlying bill alters the false marking provision by stipulating \nthat the statute may only be privately enforced by a person who has \nsuffered a competitive injury. In addition, damages would be limited to \nthose that are adequate to compensate for the injury.\n  However, the legislation would also apply the newer rules to pending \nclaims. These include claims that are now in the court system and under \nnegotiation. By changing the rules in pending claims, the legislation \nallows potential wrongdoers to use the new law to protect themselves \nfrom past conduct.\n  This sets a bad precedent for our legal system and could absolve \npotential wrongdoers. My amendment would simply require that the \nchanges to false marking provisions to apply only to prospective cases \ngoing forward. Small businesses and inventors that have expended \nconsiderable resources to protect themselves should not be penalized by \na provision that retroactively eliminates pending claims.\n  My amendment is not an attempt to gut or strike the false markings \nprovision. It is simply a modification to address the concerns of \ncurrent litigants, consumers and small businesses. I urge my colleagues \nto strongly consider this issue going forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/10/senate-section/article/S1545-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            EYE DONOR MONTH\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, March is National Eye Donor Month--\na month--to honor those who have restored sight to blind or vision-\nimpaired Americans across the country.\n  For the last 28 years, since National Eye Donor Month was first \nestablished in 1983, the eye donor community has raised public \nawareness about the need for eye donation.\n  Every March for each of the past 28 years, our Nation has honored \ndedicated individuals who work tirelessly at hospitals, medical \ncenters, doctors' offices, and eye banks across the country to educate \nthe public on the need for cornea donations and work with the \ntransplant teams.\n  We continue to give thanks to eye donors--and their families--who \noffered one last remarkable gift because they had the foresight to \nbecome organ donors.\n  Eye donation provides a precious second chance at clear vision for \nthose with ocular diseases. Approximately 11.4 million Americans \nexperience severe visual problems that are not correctable by glasses. \nA parent or grandparent cannot see their children or grandchildren play \na little league game or walk across the stage at graduation. And many \nchildren experience momentous life events--and everyday happenings--\nwithout the eyesight that many of us take for granted.\n  Thankfully and miraculously, through eye donation and corneal \ntransplants, vision that has been lost to disease or injury or \ninfection can be restored. Since 1961, more than 700,000 corneal \ntransplants have been performed to restore sight to children as young \nas 1 day old and adults as old as 103. And corneal transplants are \nhighly successful; 90 percent of all corneal transplant operations \neffectively restore sight to the patient. Each year, eye banks across \nthe country provide 52,000 corneal grafts for transplantation.\n  Ohio's Central Ohio Lions Eye Bank, COLEB, in Columbus performed \ncorneal transplants for 340 patients in 2010. COLEB gave these 340 \npatients an opportunity to regain their sight and, with that, the \nability to see their loved ones again--or for the first time. In \nsouthern Ohio, the Cincinnati Eye Bank for Sight Restoration, Inc., \npartnered with physicians at the University of Cincinnati to establish \nprograms for public and professional education as well as conduct \nocular medical research. The Cincinnati Eye Bank is able to serve 30 \nhospitals in southwestern Ohio, northern Kentucky, and eastern Indiana. \nIn northern Ohio, the Cleveland Eye Bank, which serves nearly 5 million \npeople and more than 60 hospitals in northern Ohio, created the Lasting \nLegacy program to honor the families of eye donors by publicly \nrecognizing the donors' amazing gift of sight.\n  Simply put, corneal transplants--made possible through eye donors--\nchange people's lives.\n  But more must be done. Some 1,600 Ohioans each year could have their \nsight restored through corneal transplants but are unable to because \nthere are not enough organ donors.\n  I encourage all Americans to consider becoming eye donors. Even those \nwithout 20/20 vision or who have cataracts can donate. In Ohio, you can \nbecome an eye organ donor when you renew your driver's license. It is \nthat easy.\n  I also urge my colleagues to work with local eye banks and the Eye \nBank Association of America to promote the precious gift of eye \ndonation. While 700,000 people have had their sight restored since \n1961, tens of thousands more are waiting.\n  During this year's Eye Donor Month, I thank all those who continue to \npromote and advocate for eye donation and the gift of sight it gives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/10/senate-section/article/S1545-3", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1545-S1546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JD WAGGONER\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a \ndedicated professional who has worked at the West Virginia Library \nCommission for 40 years, including 9 years as its executive director, \nMr. JD Waggoner.\n  JD Waggoner is a true leader and effective advocate for libraries. I \nhave been extraordinarily proud to work closely with him over many \nyears, and I understand and appreciate the special role that libraries \nplay in communities across our State. In addition to his leadership at \nthe commission, JD also has been a volunteer fireman which is another \nsign of his community service.\n  Thanks to the leadership of JD and others, our libraries are \nconnected to the Internet and provide quality services to West \nVirginians. We worked together on the program I helped to create in the \n1996 Telecommunications Act known as the E-Rate. This discount program \nprovides $2.25 billion in discounts for telecommunications, Internet \naccess and internal connections to libraries and schools nationwide. In \nWest Virginia, it provides over $10 million each year to libraries and \nschools. JD Waggoner and his team have done an amazing job in managing \nthis program and helping the smaller, rural libraries deal with the \npaperwork and challenges. Thanks to this access, our libraries now \nprovide access to thousands of current publications for patrons to \nenjoy and learn.\n  The Library Commission also has a special initiative known as \nLearning Express. This program provides access to practice tests on a \nwide range of programs from the GED, ACT and SAT, and other \nprofessional licenses. This means that individuals can visit their \nlibraries and, for free, take practice online exams to prepare for the \nreal tests rather than pay expensive fees. This is a truly wonderful \nopportunity to help West Virginians advance their education. The \ndirector and the Library Commission are the support network for our \nlibraries and the services range from Internet access to story hours \nand literacy efforts to hosting community groups and special events \ninclude movies or presentations. Libraries are hubs of activity and \nrecent studies indicate people looking for work are more comfortable \nlooking for work online at the library rather than an employment \noffice.\n\n[[Page S1546]]\n\n  Our West Virginia libraries are true treasures because of the \ndedication and leadership of JD Waggoner, his team and local librarians \nacross our states. While JD Waggoner will be deeply missed, he most \ncertainly deserves that chance to relax and enjoy his retirement. I \nwish him the very best and wanted to share his history with my Senate \ncolleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/10/senate-section/article/S1546-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United State were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/10/senate-section/article/S1546-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/10/senate-section/article/S1546-3", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:04 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that pursuant to 15 \nU.S.C. 1024(a), and the order of the House of January 5, 2011, the \nSpeaker appoints the following Members of the House of Representatives \nto the Joint Economic Committee: Mr. Hinchey of New York, Mrs. Maloney \nof New York, Ms. Loretta Sanchez of California, and Mr. Cummings of \nMaryland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/10/senate-section/article/S1546-4", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-856.

A bill to amend the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation \nAct to reauthorize the Act; to the\n\n[[Page S1549]]\n\nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Neotropical \nMigratory Bird Conservation Act. This bill promotes long-term \nconservation, education, research, monitoring, and habitat protection \nfor more than 350 species of neotropical migratory birds that breed in \nNorth America in the summer and spend our winters in tropical climates \nsouth of our border. Through its successful competitive, matching grant \nprogram, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service supports public-private \npartnerships to countries mostly in Latin America and the Caribbean. Up \nto one quarter of the funds may be awarded for domestic projects.\n  This legislation aims to sustain healthy populations of migratory \nbirds that are not only beautiful to look at but help our farmers by \nconsuming billions of harmful insect pests each year. These vulnerable \nbird populations face many environmental factors such as pesticide \npollution, deforestation, sprawl, and invasive species that threaten \ntheir habitat and, ultimately, their survival. As good indicators of a \nhealthy ecosystem, it is troubling that, according to the National \nAudubon Society, at least 29 species of migratory birds are \nexperiencing significant population declines. For example, populations \nof the Cerulean Warbler and Olive-Sided Flycatcher have declined as \nmuch as 70 percent since surveys began in the 1960s.\n  The Baltimore Oriole, the State bird of my home state of Maryland, \nhas been experiencing a decline in population despite being protected \nby Federal law under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 and the \nState of Maryland's Nongame and Endangered Species Conservation Act. \nDestruction of their domestic breeding habitat and tropical winter \nhabitat, coupled with the toxic pesticides ingested by insects which \nare then eaten by the Oriole, has significantly contributed to this \ndecline. It is essential that we invest in conservation efforts in our \ncountry as well as others along the migratory route of the wide range \nof migratory birds. This legislation accomplishes this goal.\n  The Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act has a proven track \nrecord of reversing habitat loss and advancing conservation strategies \nfor the broad range of neotropical birds that populate the United \nStates and the rest of the Western hemisphere. According to the U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service, between 2002 and 2010, this program has \nsuccessfully supported 333 projects, coordinated by groups in 48 U.S. \nState/territories and 36 countries. Additionally, it is a great value \nfor taxpayers as it leverages over $4.00 for each Federal dollar spent. \nSince 2002, the U.S. has invested more than $25 million in 262 projects \nand leveraged an additional $112 million in partner funds to support \nthese projects.

Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Space \nAvailable Equity Act.\n  Members and retirees of the National Guard and Reserve, their \nfamilies, and surviving military spouses make great sacrifices for our \nnation. However, too often these individuals do not receive the \nbenefits they have earned for their service.\n  In Alaska, the National Guard conducts more search and rescue \nmissions in the most challenging terrain than any other state. They \nsave lives every day in their state role and frequently deploy just \nlike their active duty counter-parts. The demands on our reserve \ncomponent have been higher than ever before. Yet members of the reserve \ncomponents and ``gray area'' retirees, National Guardsman or Reservist \neligible for retirement but under the age of 60, have limited travel \nprivileges on Department of Defense aircraft under current regulation. \nTheir space-available travel benefits are restricted to the continental \nUnited States and are not extended to their dependents, unlike active \nduty members and retirees.\n  Surviving spouses of a military member eligible for retired pay \nretain no space-available travel privileges at all after the death of \ntheir spouse, despite having made a lifetime commitment to the military \nor in many cases, lost their loved one in war. In Alaska, we understand \nhow important surviving spouses are. The Tragedy Assistance Program, or \nas it's more commonly known--TAPS, was founded in my State.\n  To correct these inequities, I am re-introducing the National Guard, \nReserve, ``Gray Area'' Retiree, and Surviving Spouse Space-available \nTravel Equity Act. This bill will give these deserving individuals \ncomprehensive and equitable space-available travel privileges on \nDepartment of Defense aircraft. The bill is endorsed by the National \nGuard Association of the United States.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in giving parity to our reserve \ncomponent members and surviving military spouses.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 542\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to restrict any State or local jurisdiction from \nimposing a new discriminatory tax on cell phone services, providers, or \nproperty; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Wireless Tax \nFairness Act and I am delighted and honored to be joined in this effort \nby Senators Snowe, Gillibrand, Ensign, Menendez, McCain, Burr, and \nSenator Nelson from Florida.\n  I want to start with an interesting fact that I read a few months \nago, which is that over 20 percent of Americans have gotten rid of \ntheir land line telephone service in favor of wireless mobile \ntechnology. Unfortunately, as more and more people make this shift, \nthey are being forced to pay higher and higher state and local taxes \nfor their wireless service. Since 2007 the average wireless tax rate \nconsumers have to pay rose by 1.1 percentage points, from 15.2 percent \nto 16.3 percent. At a time when the Federal Government is trying to \nimprove consumer access to developing technologies and broadband \nInternet in particular, does it make sense to have local, state, and \nFederal Governments forcing higher taxes on them? The answer is no, \nespecially as 3G and 4G emerge as dominant wireless technologies. These \ntaxes only act to hurt consumers, stifle innovation in the wireless \nindustry, and restrict access to the Internet.\n  In order to make sure that wireless technology can continue to \nflourish I am introducing the Wireless Tax Fairness Act. This \nlegislation will keep American companies competitive by putting the \nbrakes on unfair wireless tax increases--allowing American companies to \nremain leaders in innovation, making it easier for Americans to afford \nthese services and providing an affordable way for consumers to access \nthe Internet. The technology that is developed and deployed in America \npaves the way for the same American technology to be deployed overseas, \ncreating and sustaining good American jobs.\n  In an era when a new cellphone, smartphone, or tablet is introduced \nnearly every month it is essential that the market for these products \nis determined by consumers and not by disproportionately high taxes. 17 \npercent of American families earning less than $30,000 rely on a \nwireless device to access the Internet. The deployment and availability \nof such services needs to be encouraged by keeping prices affordable \nfor both individuals and businesses through a fair and reasonable tax \nregime.\n  In order to make sure that our walk is consistent with our talk on \npromoting American innovation, it is time to place a moratorium on \ndiscriminatory wireless taxes and fees. I hope our colleagues will join \nus in supporting this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 544. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct \na study of alternatives for commemorating and interpreting the role of \nthe Buffalo Soldiers in the early years of the National Parks, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resoruces.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenator Boxer to introduce the Buffalo Soldiers in the National Parks \nStudy Act. This legislation is an important step in preserving the \nlegacy of the Army's first all-black infantry and cavalry units and \ntheir unique role in the creation of our National Park system.\n  The Buffalo Soldiers served bravely in campaigns both at home and \nabroad before being stationed at the military Presidio in San Francisco \nand being given charge of patrolling the National Park system. Although \nfirst tasked with taming the frontier, these troops also took on the \nresponsibility of preserving that wilderness for future generations. \nEach summer, Buffalo Soldier regiments traveled roughly 320 miles from \nSan Francisco to either Sequoia or Yosemite National Park, where they \npatrolled the parks for poachers and loggers, built trails, and \nescorted visitors. They were, in essence if not in name, the nation's \nfirst park rangers.\n  In a time of segregation and adversity, these soldiers served their \ncountry bravely and the National Parks they worked to establish are \npart of the legacy they leave behind. Unfortunately, this unique aspect \nof their history is neither widely recognized nor remembered. This \nlegislation would address that by authorizing a study to determine the \nmost appropriate way to memorialize the Buffalo Soldiers. Money \nprocured under the act would be used to determine the feasibility of \nestablishing a national historic trail along the route traveled by the \nBuffalo Soldiers, scout for properties to add to the National Register \nof Historic Places, and develop educational initiatives and a public \nawareness campaign about the contribution of African-American soldiers \nafter the Civil War.\n  Although the experiences of the Buffalo Soldiers are an important \npiece of our national history, we are in danger of losing their legacy \nto the passage of time unless we take conscious steps to preserve the \nmemory. This legislation works to ensure that the contributions of the \nBuffalo Soldiers will be remembered and shared by all. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in their support for this measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 544\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Buffalo Soldiers in the \n     National Parks Study Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In the late 19th century and early 20th century, \n     African-American troops who came to be known as the Buffalo \n     Soldiers served in many critical roles in the western United \n     States, including protecting some of the first National \n     Parks.\n       (2) Based at the Presidio in San Francisco, Buffalo \n     Soldiers were assigned to Sequoia and Yosemite National Parks \n     where they patrolled the backcountry, built trails, stopped \n     poaching, and otherwise served in the roles later assumed by \n     National Park rangers.\n       (3) The public would benefit from having opportunities to \n     learn more about the Buffalo Soldiers in the National Parks \n     and their contributions to the management of National Parks \n     and the legacy of African-Americans in the post-Civil War \n     era.\n       (4) As the centennial of the National Park Service in 2016 \n     approaches, it is an especially appropriate time to conduct \n     research and increase public awareness of the stewardship \n     role the Buffalo Soldiers played in the early years of the \n     National Parks.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to authorize a \n     study to determine the most effective ways to increase \n     understanding and public awareness of the critical role that \n     the Buffalo Soldiers played in the early years of the \n     National Parks.\n\n     SEC. 3. STUDY.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Interior shall \n     conduct a study of alternatives for commemorating and \n     interpreting the role of the Buffalo Soldiers in the early \n     years of the National Parks.\n\n[[Page S1551]]\n\n       (b) Contents of Study.--The study shall include--\n       (1) a historical assessment, based on extensive research, \n     of the Buffalo Soldiers who served in National Parks in the \n     years prior to the establishment of the National Park \n     Service;\n       (2) an evaluation of the suitability and feasibility of \n     establishing a national historic trail commemorating the \n     route traveled by the Buffalo Soldiers from their post in the \n     Presidio of San Francisco to Sequoia and Yosemite National \n     Parks and to any other National Parks where they may have \n     served;\n       (3) the identification of properties that could meet \n     criteria for listing in the National Register of Historic \n     Places or criteria for designation as National Historic \n     Landmarks;\n       (4) an evaluation of appropriate ways to enhance historical \n     research, education, interpretation, and public awareness of \n     the story of the Buffalo Soldiers' stewardship role in the \n     National Parks, including ways to link the story to the \n     development of National Parks and the story of African-\n     American military service following the Civil War; and\n       (5) any other matters that the Secretary of the Interior \n     deems appropriate for this study.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 3 years after funds are made \n     available for the study, the Secretary of the Interior shall \n     submit to the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources of the Senate a report containing the study's \n     findings and recommendations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Ms. Collins,  Mr. Carper, and Mr. \n        Brown of Massachusetts).\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S1551, March 10, 2011, the Record reads: By Ms. Collins, \nMr. Cardin, . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: By Ms. Collins, \nMr. Carper, . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  S. 550. A bill to improve the provision of assistance to fire \ndepartments, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today Senators Collins, Carper, Brown, \nand I are pleased to introduce the Fire Grants Reauthorization Act of \n2011 to ensure that firefighters and emergency medical service \npersonnel serving communities across the nation are repaid for the \nsacrifices they make every day with the best possible training and \nequipment--particularly given the budget cuts many communities have \nbeen forced to make in these economically uncertain times.\n  The bill we present to the Senate reauthorizes the Assistance to \nFirefighters, AFG, program and the Staffing for Adequate Fire and \nEmergency Response program, SAFER, two highly successful programs I \nworked to establish in 2000 and 2003. This is bipartisan legislation \nthat has won overwhelming Senate support in previous years. As we all \nknow, our first responders make great sacrifices for us. Firefighters \nin communities of all shapes and sizes have assumed a greater role in \noverall national emergency preparedness since September 11 and the \nHurricane Katrina catastrophe. They now serve as the frontline of \ndefense in many communities for disasters of all types. More than ever, \nfirefighters need the training and equipment to deal not only with \nfires but also with hazardous materials; nuclear, radioactive, and \nexplosive devices; and other potential threats.\n  The responsibilities placed on firefighters have only grown more \ndemanding. Firefighters respond more and more to medical emergencies--\n15.8 million in 2008, a 213 percent increase from 1980. Right here in \nWashington, D.C., at Fire Engine Company 10--known as the ``House of \nPain'' for its grueling schedule--80 percent of the calls are for \nmedical emergencies. Our nation's firefighters--like other first \nresponders--are the first to arrive and the last to leave whenever \ntrouble hits. They deserve all the support we can give them.\n  Unfortunately, they do not always get it. Firefighters often lack the \nequipment and vehicles they need to do their jobs safely and \neffectively. In 2006 the U.S. Fire Administration reported that 60 \npercent of fire departments did not have enough breathing apparatuses \nto equip all firefighters on a shift, 65 percent did not have enough \nportable radios, and 49 percent of all fire engines were at least 15 \nyears old.\n  We can and must do more for these brave men and women. We must make \nsure they have what they need to protect their communities and \nthemselves as they perform a very dangerous job. Our bill takes much-\nneeded steps to ensure that they do.\n  To start with, because career, volunteer, and combination fire \ndepartments all suffer from shortages in equipment, vehicles, and \ntraining, our bill requires that each type receives at least 25 percent \nof the available AFG grant funding. The remaining funds will be \nallocated based on factors such as risk and the needs of individual \ncommunities and the country as a whole. This creates an appropriate \nbalance, ensuring that funds are directed at departments facing the \nmost significant risks while guaranteeing that no department is left \nout.\n  We have also taken a number of steps in our bill to help fire \ndepartments in communities struggling with economic difficulties. In \nmany cases, local governments have reduced spending on vital services, \nincluding fire departments. Among other things, these cuts have \nprevented many departments from replacing old equipment and forced them \nto lay off needed firefighters. To help departments rebuild, we have \nlowered the matching requirements for AFG and SAFER. Departments are \nstill required to match some of their grant awards with funds of their \nown--ensuring they have some skin in the game--but the reduced amount \nwill make it easier for them to accept awards.\n  We have similarly created an economic hardship waiver for both grant \nprograms that will allow FEMA to waive certain requirements, such as \nrequiring that grantees provide matching funds, for departments in \ncommunities that have been especially hard hit by tough economic times.\n  Our bill contains a number of other important provisions. It raises \nthe maximum grant amounts available under AFG. As commonsense would \nsuggest, large communities often require a substantial amount of \nequipment, and they will now be able to apply for funding in amounts \nmore in line with what they need.\n  Our bill would provide funding for national fire safety organizations \nand institutions of higher education that wish to create joint programs \nestablishing fire safety research centers. There is a great need for \nresearch devoted to fire safety and prevention and improved technology. \nThe work these centers do will help us reduce fire casualties among \nfirefighters and civilians and make communities safer.\n  But as important as it is to help our firefighters, we must also \ndemand accountability when we spend taxpayer dollars. For this reason, \nwe require that FEMA create performance management systems for these \nprograms, complete with quantifiable metrics that will allow us to see \nhow well they perform. Going forward, this will allow us to see what \nworks in these programs and what does not so that we can make needed \nimprovements when required.\n  We have also included provisions to prevent earmarks from being \nattached to these programs. AFG and SAFER have never been earmarked--an \nimpressive accomplishment--and we want to keep it that way. The funding \nfor these programs needs to go to firefighters, not pet projects.\n  Finally, this legislation authorizes $950 million each for these \nvital programs. This is actually less than what was authorized in the \npast. We believe that supporting our Nation's firefighters and \nemergency medical service responders ought to be a priority, but we \nrecognize that these tough fiscal times require some belt-tightening. \nAuthorizing funding for AFG and SAFER at these amounts sends the \nmessage that Congress can direct funding where it is needed while also \nshowing discipline.\n  This legislation ensures that fire departments get the support they \nneed to protect their communities while also protecting taxpayer \ndollars. It addresses a vital national need while increasing \naccountability to the public. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting the reauthorization of these important programs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 550\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am proud to once again cosponsor the \nFire Grants Reauthorization Act. I am pleased to join with Senators \nLieberman, Brown, and Carper in this effort to reauthorize these vital \nprograms. I have always been an ardent supporter of our Nation's fire \nservices. In addition to serving as a cochair of the Congressional Fire \nServices Caucus, I was a cosponsor of the original FIRE Act, and an \noriginal cosponsor of the FIRE Act reauthorization bills in 2004 and in \n2010. Unfortunately, last year's bill did not become law.\n  The FIRE Act grants program provides fire departments with the \nsupport they need to purchase equipment and vehicles, and to conduct \nthe training and exercises necessary to perform their jobs well. \nIndeed, this is one of the most successful programs administered by the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  The FIRE Act grants program is an efficient and effective model for \ndelivering grant funding because it has a competitive process for \nevaluating applications, which are peer-reviewed. It is also successful \nbecause monies are provided directly to local fire departments. This \nbipartisan legislation would retain and build upon these aspects of the \nFIRE Act program that made it successful in the first place.\n  In visits across the State of Maine, I have seen first-hand how these \ngrants build the critical response capabilities of local fire \ndepartments. Maine has received more than $50 million through the FIRE \nAct grants program--a testament to the needs of our often rural, \nvolunteer fire departments and proof that the program is succeeding in \ndelivering funds to communities that need it most.\n  Independent analyses have confirmed that the FIRE Act grants program \nhas been effective. To quote a 2007 study by the National Academy of \nPublic Administration, ``From the standpoint of administrative \nefficiency, there is broad agreement among stakeholders and observers \nthat the program has been well run. It is a positive case study in the \nmanagement of a grant program by a government agency.''\n  I believe this bill will increase the capabilities of our Nation's \nfire services, and protect the thousands of firefighters and EMTs who \nput their lives on the line every day.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANDERS (for himself and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 552. A bill to reduce the Federal budget deficit by creating a \nsurtax on high income individuals and eliminating big oil and gas \ncompany tax\n\n[[Page S1556]]\n\nloopholes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I will try to bring this budget debate \ndown to Earth and talk a little bit about the reality of what is \nhappening and go beyond the amount of numbers that are out there.\n  My good friend from Alabama who sits with me on the Budget Committee \nmakes the point that this country has a severe budget crisis. He is \nright. The question is, How did we get to where we are today and how do \nwe go forward in a way that is fair and responsible to address it? In \nthat regard, the Senator from Alabama and I have very strong \ndisagreements.\n  How did we get to where we are today when not so many years ago, the \nday George W. Bush became President, we had a significant surplus? We \nhad a surplus when Clinton left office. Now we have a major deficit \ncrisis. There are a number of reasons:\n  No. 1, against my vote, we are fighting a war in Iraq which, by the \ntime we take care of our last veteran, is going to cost us some $3 \ntrillion. I didn't hear any of my Republican friends saying we can't go \nto war unless we figure out a way to pay for it.\n  No. 2, my Republican friends for years have been pushing huge tax \nbreaks for the very wealthiest people. I didn't hear them ask how that \nwas going to be paid for.\n  No. 3, under President Bush, with strong Republican support and \nagainst my vote, Congress passed a $400 billion-plus Medicare Part D \nprescription drug program, written by the insurance companies and the \ndrug companies. It drove up the deficit.\n  No. 4, against my vote, Congress voted for a massive bailout of Wall \nStreet. I didn't hear too many people talking about how we would pay \nfor that, $700 billion to bail out Wall Street. I didn't hear them \narguing that it was too much money and it would drive up the deficit.\n  Yesterday, the Republicans brought forth and voted on H.R. 1. Almost \nall of them voted for it. Those who did not actually wanted to go \nfurther.\n  The main point I wish to make is, A, we do have to address the \ndeficit crisis, but, B, we have to address it in a way that is fair and \nresponsible and not solely on the backs of working families, the middle \nclass, the elderly, the sick, and the poor. That is immoral. That is \nwrong. That is bad economics.\n  To my mind, it is absolutely absurd that when my Republican friends \ntalk about deficit reduction, they forget to talk about the reality \nthat the wealthiest people have never had it so good; that the \neffective, the real tax rate for the richest people is the lowest on \nrecord; and that the wealthiest people, the top 2 percent, have \nreceived many hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks.\n  I ask my Republican friends, why do they want to balance the budget \non the backs of low-income children, low-income senior citizens, those \nwho are sick, those who are vulnerable, without asking the wealthiest \npeople who have never had it so good to put one penny into deficit \nreduction? I think that is wrong, and the American people think that is \nwrong. When we talk about deficit reduction, we have to talk about \nshared sacrifice, everybody playing a role, not just little kids, not \njust the elderly, not just the sick, but even--dare I say it--people \nwho have a whole lot of money and who have never done so well.\n  I have not been impressed at how the media has been covering this \nissue. They have not made it clear to the American people how \ndevastating the cuts are that Republicans want to impose on working \nfamilies. Let me briefly tick off some of them.\n  The Republicans want to throw over 200,000 children off of the Head \nStart Program. Every working family in America knows how hard it is \ntoday to come up with affordable childcare, early childhood education. \nWe have the highest rate of childhood poverty in the industrialized \nworld. The Republican solution is to slash Head Start by 20 percent, \ncut 218,000 kids off of Head Start, and lay off 55,000 Head Start \ninstructors.\n  The cost of college education today is so high that many young people \nare giving up their dream of going to college, while many others are \ngraduating deeply in debt. Republican solution: Slash Pell grants by \n$5.7 billion and reduce or eliminate Pell grants for 9.4 million low-\nincome college students. Middle-class families, working-class families, \ndo they hear that? We are going to balance the budget by either \neliminating or lowering Pell grants--the ability of young people to go \nto college--for over 9 million college students.\n  I know in my office we get calls every week from senior citizens, \npeople with disabilities, widows who are having a hard time getting a \ntimely response toward their Social Security claims. It takes too long \nto process the paperwork. What the Republicans want to do is slash the \nSocial Security Administration, the people who administer Social \nSecurity for seniors and the disabled, widows and orphans, by $1.7 \nbillion. That means half a million Americans who are legally entitled \nto Social Security benefits will have to wait significantly longer \ntimes in order to receive them.\n  We have 50 million Americans with no health insurance today, and \n45,000 Americans die because they don't get to a doctor in time. Last \nyear, as part of health care reform, I worked very hard with many \nMembers to expand community health centers so that more and more low-\nand moderate-income people could walk into a doctor's office, get \nhealth care, dental care, low-cost prescription drugs, mental health \ncounseling. In H.R. 1, the bill they voted for yesterday, Republicans \nwant to deny primary health care to 11 million Americans at a time when \nState after State is cutting back on Medicaid. What are you supposed to \ndo if you are 50 years old, you have a pain in your chest, and you \ndon't have any health insurance? Where do you go? Republicans want to \ndeny health care to another 11 million Americans.\n  For the poorest people, community services block grants provide the \ninfrastructure, the ability to get out emergency food help, emergency \nhelp to pay the electric bill, LIHEAP. They are the infrastructure of \nthis country that protects the poorest and most vulnerable. Republicans \nwant to slash $405 million from the Community Services Block Grant \nProgram. That is wrong. And the President's proposed cut to the \ncommunity services block grant is also wrong.\n  In real terms, 16 percent of our population today is really \nunemployed, if we add together the official unemployment--those people \nwho have given up looking for work, those people who work part time and \nwant to work full time. Republicans want to slash $2 billion in Federal \njob-training programs.\n  Republicans want to slash $400 million in LIHEAP. That is the program \nthat in my State and all over the country enables people to stay warm \nin the winter. We have a lot of senior citizens in Vermont getting by \non $13,000 or $14,000 a year in income. They need help. It gets cold in \nVermont. It gets 20 below zero. People don't have the income. LIHEAP is \na very valuable tool. Republicans want to slash $100 million for \nLIHEAP.\n  They want to slash the EPA by 30 percent. These are the people who \nhave successfully enforced the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, so \nthat the air we breathe does not give us asthma, doesn't provide us \nwith the soup that makes us sick. The Clean Air Act has been an \nenormous success in cleaning up our air. Republicans want to slash that \nby 30 percent.\n  Republicans want to cut the WIC Program. This is the program that \nprovides supplemental nutrition for women, infants, and children. They \nwant to cut that by $750 million. Poverty in America is increasing. \nWhat we understand is that if pregnant women and little kids do not get \ngood nutrition, the likelihood is that births might be low weight or \nthe little babies might come down with illnesses if they don't have \ngood nutrition. Poverty is increasing. Yet the Republicans want to cut \nthe WIC Program by $750 million--10 percent.\n\n  Title I education funding. Everybody understands we have problems \nwith education right now, with large dropout rates. Republicans want to \ncut $5 billion from the Department of Education.\n  On and on and on it goes.\n  What do I think? Do I think it is appropriate we balance the budget \non low-income pregnant women and infants who need nutrition? Do I think \nyou should throw 200,000 kids off the\n\n[[Page S1557]]\n\nHead Start Program? Do I think we cut the Social Security \nAdministration severely? Do I think we cut Planned Parenthood, which \nhas done such a good job in preventing unwanted pregnancies? Does that \nmake sense? I do not think so. I do not think that is good for America.\n  But I do believe we have to move toward a balanced budget. So what is \none way to go forward, other than savage cuts on programs for the most \nvulnerable people in this country? That is, I think we have to begin \ntalking about revenue, not just cuts.\n  Today I am introducing legislation which does two things. No. 1, it \ncreates a millionaire's surtax, which will be used strictly for deficit \nreduction. It will be a 5.4-percent surtax on income over $1 million. \nThat says that all households that have income over $1 million will pay \na 5.4-percent surtax on that income, which will go into an emergency \ndeficit reduction fund. Just doing that--asking millionaires to pay a \nlittle bit more in taxes, after all the huge tax breaks they have \nreceived--will bring in approximately $50 billion a year.\n  I think that is a good idea, but it is not just me who thinks it is a \ngood idea. Recently, last week, there was an NBC News/Wall Street \nJournal poll, and they asked the American people: What is the best way \nto go forward on deficit reduction? Mr. President, 81 percent of the \nAmerican people believe it is totally acceptable or mostly acceptable \nto impose a surtax on millionaires to reduce the deficit.\n  The American people get it. They understand you cannot move toward \ndeficit reduction just by cutting programs that working families, the \nmiddle class, and low-income people desperately need in order to \nsurvive in the midst of this terrible recession. They understand \nserious, responsible deficit reduction requires shared sacrifice. It is \ninsane--and I use that word advisably--it is insane to be talking about \ndeficit reduction, as my Republican friends do on one hand, and then \nsay: Oh, yes, we have to give hundreds and hundreds of billions of \ndollars in tax breaks to the top 1 percent, the top 2 percent, when \nthose guys are doing phenomenally well, are seeing an effective tax \nrate lower than it has been in decades and have received huge tax \nbreaks already.\n  Why does anyone think it is moral or right to move toward deficit \nreduction on the backs of the weak and the vulnerable? I understand--\nand I know something about politics--I do understand the parents of \nkids who are in Head Start do not make large campaign contributions. I \nknow the senior citizens of this country who need some help with Social \nSecurity do not make large campaign contributions. I understand that. I \nunderstand college students, desperately trying to go through college \non a Pell grant, do not make large campaign contributions.\n  But there is a sense of morality we have to deal with. I think it \nmakes no sense, I think it is immoral, I think it is bad economics to \nbalance the budget on the backs of working families, while we give \ncontinued tax breaks to those people who do not need it.\n  So today we are introducing a piece of legislation which I hope will \nhave strong support. I think it paves the way for us to go forward with \nserious deficit reduction in a way that is fair. Do we need to make \ncuts? Absolutely. But do we also need to ask the wealthiest people in \nthis country to start contributing toward deficit reduction? I think we \ndo.\n  Once again, the legislation I am introducing today creates a \nmillionaire's surtax of 5.4 percent, which would bring in about $50 \nbillion a year, to be used exclusively for an emergency deficit \nreduction fund.\n  We also end tax breaks for big oil and gas companies, which will \nbring in about $3.5 billion a year. Over the past decade, the five \nlargest oil companies in the United States have earned nearly $1 \ntrillion in profits. Meanwhile, in recent years, some of the very \nlargest oil companies in America have paid absolutely nothing in \nFederal income taxes. In fact, some of them have actually gotten a \nrefund, a rebate from the IRS.\n  So that is my plea. My plea is that, yes, the need for deficit \nreduction is real. It is urgent. Let's go forward, but let's go forward \nin a way that is fair and responsible and not simply on the backs of \nthe most vulnerable people in this country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRANKEN (for himself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Murray, \n        Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \n        Bennet, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Udall of Colorado, Ms. Mikulski, \n        Mr. Leahy, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. \n        Cardin, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Akaka, \n        Mr. Schumer, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Begich, Mr. Casey, Ms. Cantwell, \n        Mr. Brown of Ohio, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Reed, and Mr. Coons):\n  S. 555. A bill to end discrimination based on actual or perceived \nsexual orientation or gender identity in public schools, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I wish to tell you about a teenager whom \nI think you know about--Justin Aaberg--from our home State of \nMinnesota. Yesterday should have been Justin's 16th birthday. Justin \nwas a kind young man, friendly and cheerful, a budding composer, but he \nwas also the target for bullies at his high school, who targeted him \nbecause he was different--because he was gay.\n  I never had the opportunity to meet Justin. His family lost him to \nsuicide last summer. The Presiding Officer knows that. But you and I \nhave been privileged to meet his mother Tammy. I have been privileged \nto meet her a few times. She is incredible. She has been speaking out \nto protect other kids. Because, unfortunately, there are a lot of other \nkids out there struggling to get through school as they suffer from \nbullying and harassment and discrimination at their public schools. \nNine out of ten LGBT students are harassed or bullied or taunted in \nschool. This harassment deprives them of an equal education. They are \nmore likely to skip school, they are less likely to perform well \nacademically, and they are more likely to drop out before they graduate \nfrom high school.\n  In some tragic cases, such as Justin's, the harassment of LGBT \nstudents can even lead to suicide. We have seen this in all too many \ncases all over the country, because, sadly, this problem is so much \nbroader than Justin. More than a third--more than a third--of lesbian, \ngay, and bisexual youth have made a suicide attempt. More than a third. \nThat is horrifying beyond belief to me.\n  We are failing these kids. That is why I, along with 29 of my Senate \ncolleagues, including the Presiding Officer, have reintroduced the \nStudent Nondiscrimination Act today. While Federal civil rights laws \nprohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, \ndisability, and national origin, they do not expressly cover sexual \norigin or gender identity. As a result, parents of LGBT students have \nlimited legal recourse when schools fail to protect their children from \nharassment and bullying.\n  You might be wondering why I am mentioning bullying and \ndiscrimination in the same breath. It is simple: When a school acts to \nprotect kids with disabilities from bullying but looks the other way \nwhen LGBT kids are harassed by their peers, that is discrimination. \nWhen school staff members participate in or encourage bullying of LGBT \nyouth, that is discrimination. When a principal excuses a bully who \ntorments an LGBT kid with ``boys will be boys,'' this is discrimination \nand needs to stop. It needs to stop before more kids are hurt.\n  The Student Nondiscrimination Act would prohibit discrimination and \nharassment in public schools based on sexual orientation and gender \nidentity. It would give LGBT students similar civil rights protections \nagainst bullying and harassment as those that currently apply to \nstudents based on characteristics such as race and gender.\n  This legislation would also provide meaningful remedies for \ndiscrimination in public schools based on sexual orientation or gender \nidentity, modeled on Title IX's protection against discrimination and \nharassment based on gender. Fifty years of civil rights history shows \nthat similar laws that contain such remedies are often most effective \nin preventing discrimination from occurring in the first place. Like \nother civil rights laws, the one we introduce today would prompt \nschools to\n\n[[Page S1558]]\n\navoid liability by taking proactive steps to prevent the discrimination \nand bullying of students protected by the bill.\n  I guarantee you that when this bill is passed, nearly every school \ndistrict in this country is going to go to its lawyer and ask, ``How do \nwe come into compliance?'' I guarantee you that the U.S. Department of \nEducation will issue regulations, as it has under Title IX, so that \nschools have guidance in how to protect these kids. The goal isn't for \nany school to be sued for failing to protect kids from bullying and \nharassment. The goal isn't for any school to come under Department of \nEducation scrutiny. The goal is for schools to do all they can to \nensure these incidents never happen in the first place.\n  Parents in Minnesota and across the country entrust their children to \npublic schools with the understanding that these schools will do \neverything in their power to keep their children safe. When 9 in 10 \nLGBT kids are bullied at school, when they are three times more likely \nthan straight kids to feel unsafe at school, when one third of LGBT \nkids say they have skipped a day of school in the last month because of \nfeeling unsafe, then we know that our public education system is not \nfulfilling its most basic obligation to parents to keep children safe. \nWe have an obligation to do something about it.\n  Yesterday, Justin Aaberg from Minnesota should have celebrated his \n16th birthday with family and friends. But instead, I know that his \nfamily and friends were missing him terribly--are still missing him \nterribly.\n  No child should have to go through the pain that Justin went through \nat school. No mom or dad should have to go through the heartbreaking \npain that Justin's family has gone through. It is time. It is time that \nwe extend equal rights to LGBT students. We have the opportunity now, \nas we reform No Child Left Behind--the ESEA, the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act--to include this legislation. Our children \ncannot afford for us to squander this opportunity. I urge my colleagues \nto join me today in supporting the Student Non-Discrimination Act and \ndemanding protection for all of our children under the law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 555\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Student Non-Discrimination \n     Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Public school students who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, \n     or transgender (referred to in this Act as ``LGBT''), or are \n     perceived to be LGBT, or who associate with LGBT people, have \n     been and are subjected to pervasive discrimination, including \n     harassment, bullying, intimidation, and violence, and have \n     been deprived of equal educational opportunities, in schools \n     in every part of the Nation.\n       (2) While discrimination, including harassment, bullying, \n     intimidation, and violence, of any kind is harmful to \n     students and to the education system, actions that target \n     students based on sexual orientation or gender identity \n     represent a distinct and especially severe problem.\n       (3) Numerous social science studies demonstrate that \n     discrimination, including harassment, bullying, intimidation, \n     and violence, at school has contributed to high rates of \n     absenteeism, dropping out, adverse health consequences, and \n     academic underachievement, among LGBT youth.\n       (4) When left unchecked, discrimination, including \n     harassment, bullying, intimidation, and violence, in schools \n     based on sexual orientation or gender identity can lead, and \n     has led, to life-threatening violence and to suicide.\n       (5) Public school students enjoy a variety of \n     constitutional rights, including rights to equal protection, \n     privacy, and free expression, which are infringed when school \n     officials engage in or are indifferent to discrimination, \n     including harassment, bullying, intimidation, and violence, \n     on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.\n       (6) While Federal statutory provisions expressly address \n     discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, \n     disability, and national origin, Federal civil rights \n     statutes do not expressly address discrimination on the basis \n     of sexual orientation or gender identity. As a result, \n     students and parents have often had limited recourse to law \n     for remedies for discrimination on the basis of sexual \n     orientation or gender identity.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to ensure that all students have access to public \n     education in a safe environment free from discrimination, \n     including harassment, bullying, intimidation, and violence, \n     on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity;\n       (2) to provide a comprehensive Federal prohibition of \n     discrimination in public schools based on actual or perceived \n     sexual orientation or gender identity;\n       (3) to provide meaningful and effective remedies for \n     discrimination in public schools based on actual or perceived \n     sexual orientation or gender identity;\n       (4) to invoke congressional powers, including the power to \n     enforce the 14th Amendment to the Constitution and to provide \n     for the general welfare pursuant to section 8 of article I of \n     the Constitution and the power to make all laws necessary and \n     proper for the execution of the foregoing powers pursuant to \n     section 8 of article I of the Constitution, in order to \n     prohibit discrimination in public schools on the basis of \n     sexual orientation or gender identity; and\n       (5) to allow the Department of Education to effectively \n     combat discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender \n     identity in public schools, through regulation and \n     enforcement, as the Department has issued regulations under \n     and enforced title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and \n     other nondiscrimination laws in a manner that effectively \n     addresses discrimination.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS AND RULE.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--For purposes of this Act:\n       (1) Educational agency.--The term ``educational agency'' \n     means a local educational agency, an educational service \n     agency, and a State educational agency, as those terms are \n     defined in section 9101 of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7801).\n       (2) Gender identity.--The term ``gender identity'' means \n     the gender-related identity, appearance, or mannerisms or \n     other gender-related characteristics of an individual, with \n     or without regard to the individual's designated sex at \n     birth.\n       (3) Harassment.--The term ``harassment'' means conduct that \n     is sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive to limit a \n     student's ability to participate in or benefit from a program \n     or activity of a public school or educational agency, or to \n     create a hostile or abusive educational environment at a \n     program or activity of a public school or educational agency, \n     including acts of verbal, nonverbal, or physical aggression, \n     intimidation, or hostility, if such conduct is based on--\n       (A) a student's actual or perceived sexual orientation or \n     gender identity; or\n       (B) the actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender \n     identity of a person with whom a student associates or has \n     associated.\n       (4) Program or activity.--The terms ``program or activity'' \n     and ``program'' have the same meanings given such terms as \n     applied under section 606 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 \n     U.S.C. 2000d-4a) to the operations of public entities under \n     paragraph (2)(B) of such section.\n       (5) Public school.--The term ``public school'' means an \n     elementary school (as the term is defined in section 9101 of \n     the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965) that is a \n     public institution, and a secondary school (as so defined) \n     that is a public institution.\n       (6) Sexual orientation.--The term ``sexual orientation'' \n     means homosexuality, heterosexuality, or bisexuality.\n       (7) Student.--The term ``student'' means an individual who \n     is enrolled in a public school or who, regardless of official \n     enrollment status, attends classes or participates in the \n     programs or activities of a public school or educational \n     agency.\n       (b) Rule.--Consistent with Federal law, in this Act the \n     term ``includes'' means ``includes but is not limited to''.\n\n     SEC. 4. PROHIBITION AGAINST DISCRIMINATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--No student shall, on the basis of actual \n     or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity of such \n     individual or of a person with whom the student associates or \n     has associated, be excluded from participation in, be denied \n     the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any \n     program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\n       (b) Harassment.--For purposes of this Act, discrimination \n     includes harassment of a student on the basis of actual or \n     perceived sexual orientation or gender identity of such \n     student or of a person with whom the student associates or \n     has associated.\n       (c) Retaliation Prohibited.--\n       (1) Prohibition.--No person shall be excluded from \n     participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected \n     to discrimination, retaliation, or reprisal under any program \n     or activity receiving Federal financial assistance based on \n     the person's opposition to conduct made unlawful by this Act.\n       (2) Definition.--For purposes of this subsection, \n     ``opposition to conduct made unlawful by this Act'' \n     includes--\n       (A) opposition to conduct reasonably believed to be made \n     unlawful by this Act;\n       (B) any formal or informal report, whether oral or written, \n     to any governmental entity, including public schools and \n     educational agencies and employees of the public schools or \n     educational agencies, regarding conduct made unlawful by this \n     Act or reasonably believed to be made unlawful by this Act;\n\n[[Page S1559]]\n\n       (C) participation in any investigation, proceeding, or \n     hearing related to conduct made unlawful by this Act or \n     reasonably believed to be made unlawful by this Act; and\n       (D) assistance or encouragement provided to any other \n     person in the exercise or enjoyment of any right granted or \n     protected by this Act,\n\n     if in the course of that expression, the person involved does \n     not purposefully provide information known to be false to any \n     public school or educational agency or other governmental \n     entity regarding conduct made unlawful, or reasonably \n     believed to be made unlawful, by this Act.\n\n     SEC. 5. FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT; REPORT TO \n                   CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES.\n\n       (a) Requirements.--Each Federal department and agency which \n     is empowered to extend Federal financial assistance to any \n     education program or activity, by way of grant, loan, or \n     contract other than a contract of insurance or guaranty, is \n     authorized and directed to effectuate the provisions of \n     section 4 with respect to such program or activity by issuing \n     rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability which \n     shall be consistent with achievement of the objectives of the \n     statute authorizing the financial assistance in connection \n     with which the action is taken. No such rule, regulation, or \n     order shall become effective unless and until approved by the \n     President.\n       (b) Enforcement.--Compliance with any requirement adopted \n     pursuant to this section may be effected--\n       (1) by the termination of or refusal to grant or to \n     continue assistance under such program or activity to any \n     recipient as to whom there has been an express finding on the \n     record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure to comply \n     with such requirement, but such termination or refusal shall \n     be limited to the particular political entity, or part \n     thereof, or other recipient as to whom such a finding has \n     been made, and shall be limited in its effect to the \n     particular program, or part thereof, in which such \n     noncompliance has been so found; or\n       (2) by any other means authorized by law,\n     except that no such action shall be taken until the \n     department or agency concerned has advised the appropriate \n     person or persons of the failure to comply with the \n     requirement and has determined that compliance cannot be \n     secured by voluntary means.\n       (c) Reports.--In the case of any action terminating, or \n     refusing to grant or continue, assistance because of failure \n     to comply with a requirement imposed pursuant to this \n     section, the head of the Federal department or agency shall \n     file with the committees of the House of Representatives and \n     Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program or \n     activity involved a full written report of the circumstances \n     and the grounds for such action. No such action shall become \n     effective until 30 days have elapsed after the filing of such \n     report.\n\n     SEC. 6.

The tolling of any such limitations \n     period shall be determined in accordance with the law \n     governing actions under section 1979 of the Revised Statutes \n     (42 U.S.C. 1983) in the State in which the action is brought.\n\n     SEC. 7. STATE IMMUNITY.\n\n       (a) State Immunity.--A State shall not be immune under the \n     11th Amendment to the Constitution from suit in Federal court \n     for a violation of this Act.\n       (b) Waiver.--A State's receipt or use of Federal financial \n     assistance for any program or activity of a State shall \n     constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity, under the 11th \n     Amendment or otherwise, to a suit brought by an aggrieved \n     individual for a violation of section 4.\n       (c) Remedies.--In a suit against a State for a violation of \n     this Act, remedies (including remedies both at law and in \n     equity) are available for such a violation to the same extent \n     as such remedies are available for such a violation in the \n     suit against any public or private entity other than a State.\n\n     SEC. 8.

A bill to limit the use of cluster munitions; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and \ncolleague from Vermont, Senator Leahy, and 20 co-sponsors to introduce \nthe Cluster Munitions Civilian Protection Act of 2011.\n  Cluster munitions are large bombs, rockets, or artillery shells that \ncontain up to hundreds of small submunitions, or individual \n``bomblets.''\n  They are intended for attacking enemy troop formations and armor \ncovering over a half mile radius.\n  But, in reality, they pose a deadly threat to innocent civilians. \nBefore I discuss our legislation, I would like to share a few stories \nthat show what these weapons can do.\n  Several months after the end of the Iraq war, Ahmed, 12 years old \nfrom Kebala, Iraq, was walking with his 9-year-old brother and picked \nup what he thought was just a shiny object, but was, in fact, a cluster \nbomb.\n  It exploded and Ahmed lost his right hand and three fingers off his \nleft hand.\n  He also lost an eye and suffered shrapnel wounds to his torso and \nhead.\n  A young shepherd, Akim, 13 years old, from Al-Radwaniya, Iraq, was \nplaying on his parents' farm when it was hit by a cluster bomb attack.\n  He suffered burns to his lower limbs and multiple fractures to his \nright leg.\n  His wounds became infected and he developed pressure ulcers.\n  In 2003, 30 years after the Vietnam war, Dan, 9 years old from \nPhalanexay, Laos, was injured when he picked up and played with a \ncluster bomb. It exploded.\n  He suffered massive abdominal trauma, multiple shrapnel wounds, and a \nbroken arm and leg.\n  Waleed Thamer, 10 years old, is from Iraq. In 2003, he was wounded by \na cluster bomb on his way to the local market.\n  He lost his right hand and suffered shrapnel wounds to his eyes, \nneck, torso, and thighs.\n  These stories are deeply distressing. But they show us why our \nlegislation is necessary.\n  Our legislation places commonsense restrictions on the use of cluster \nbombs. It prevents any funds from being spent to use cluster munitions \nthat have a failure rate of more than 1 percent; and unless the rules \nof engagement specify the cluster munitions will only be used against \nclearly defined military targets; and will not be used where civilians \nare known to be\n\n[[Page S1560]]\n\npresent or in areas normally inhabited by civilians.\n  Finally, our legislation includes a national security waiver that \nallows the President to waive the prohibition on the use of cluster \nbombs with a failure rate of more than 1 percent, if he determines it \nis vital to protect the security of the United States to do so.\n  If the President issues the waiver, he must issue a report to \nCongress within 30 days on the failure rate of the cluster bombs used \nand the steps taken to protect innocent civilians.\n  If our bill is enacted, it will have an immediate impact.\n  Out of the 728.5 million cluster submunitions in the U.S. arsenal, \nonly 30,900 have self-destruct devices that would ensure a less than 1 \npercent dud rate.\n  Those submunitions account for only 0.00004 percent of the U.S. \ntotal.\n  So, the technology exists for the U.S. to meet the 1 percent standard \nbut our arsenal consists overwhelmingly of cluster bombs with high \nfailure rates.\n  Simply put, our bill will help save lives.\n  As the above stories demonstrate, cluster bombs pose a real threat to \nthe safety of civilians when used in populated areas because they leave \nhundreds of unexploded bombs over a very large area and they are often \ninaccurate.\n  Indeed, the human toll of these weapons has been terrible:\n  In Laos, approximately 11,000 people, 30 percent of them children, \nhave been killed or injured by U.S. cluster munitions since the Vietnam \nwar ended.\n  In Afghanistan, between October 2001 and November 2002, 127 civilians \nlost their lives due to cluster munitions, 70 percent of them under the \nage of 18.\n  An estimated 1,220 Kuwaitis and 400 Iraqi civilians have been killed \nby cluster munitions since 1991.\n  In the 2006 war in Lebanon, Israeli cluster munitions, many of them \nmanufactured in the U.S., injured and killed 343 civilians.\n  During the 2003 invasion of Baghdad, the last time the U.S. used \ncluster munitions, these weapons killed more civilians than any other \ntype of U.S. weapon.\n  The U.S. 3rd Infantry Division described cluster munitions as \n``battlefield losers'' in Iraq, because they were often forced to \nadvance through areas contaminated with unexploded duds.\n  During the 1991 Gulf War, U.S. cluster munitions caused more U.S. \ntroop casualties than any single Iraqi weapon system, killing 22 U.S. \nservicemen.\n  Yet we have seen significant progress in the effort to protect \ninnocent civilians from these deadly weapons since we first introduced \nthis legislation in the 110th Congress.\n  In December 2008, 95 countries came together to sign the Oslo \nConvention on Cluster Munitions which would prohibit the production, \nuse, and export of cluster bombs and requires signatories to eliminate \ntheir arsenals within 8 years.\n  This group includes key NATO allies such as Canada, the United \nKingdom, France, and Germany, who are fighting alongside our troops in \nAfghanistan.\n  It includes 33 countries that have produced and used cluster \nmunitions.\n  To date, 108 countries have signed the convention and 48 have \nratified it.\n  It formally came into force on August 1, 2010.\n  In 2007, Congress passed and President Bush signed into law a \nprovision from our legislation contained in the fiscal year 2008 \nConsolidated Appropriations Act prohibiting the sale and transfer of \ncluster bombs with a failure rate of more than 1 percent.\n  Congress extended this ban as a part of the Omnibus Appropriations \nAct for fiscal year 2009 and the Consolidated Appropriations Act of \n2010.\n  These actions will help save lives. But much more work remains to be \ndone and significant obstacles remain.\n  For one, the United States chose not to participate in the Oslo \nprocess or sign the treaty.\n  The Pentagon continues to believe that cluster munitions are \n``legitimate weapons with clear military utility in combat.''\n  It would prefer that the United States work within the Geneva-based \nConvention on Certain Conventional Weapons, CCW, to negotiate limits on \nthe use of cluster munitions.\n  Yet these efforts have been going on since 2001 and it was the \ninability of the CCW to come to any meaningful agreement which prompted \nother countries, led by Norway, to pursue an alternative treaty through \nthe Oslo process.\n  A lack of U.S. leadership in this area has given cover to other major \ncluster munitions producing nations--China, Russia, India, Pakistan, \nIsrael, and Egypt--who have refused to sign the Oslo Convention as \nwell.\n  Recognizing the United States could not remain silent in the face of \ninternational efforts to restrict the use of cluster bombs, Secretary \nof Defense Robert Gates issued a new policy on cluster munitions in \nJune 2008 stating that after 2018, the use, sale and transfer of \ncluster munitions with a failure rate of more than 1 percent would be \nprohibited.\n  The policy is a step in the right direction, but under the terms of \nthis new policy, the Pentagon will still have the authority to use \ncluster bombs with high failure rates for the next 10 years.\n  That is unacceptable and runs counter to our values. The \nadministration should take another look at this policy.\n  In fact, on September 29, 2009, Senator Leahy and I were joined by 14 \nof our colleagues in sending a letter to President Obama urging him to \nconduct a thorough review of U.S. policy on cluster munitions.\n  On April 14, 2010, we received a response from then National Security \nAdvisor Jim Jones stating that the administration will undertake this \nreview following the policy review on U.S. landmines policy.\n  The administration should complete this review without delay.\n  Let us not forget that the United States maintains an arsenal of an \nestimated 5.5 million cluster munitions containing 728 million \nsubmunitions which have an estimated failure rate of between 5 and 15 \npercent.\n  What does that say about us, that we are still prepared to use, sell \nand transfer these weapons with well-known failure rates?\n  The fact is, cluster munition technologies already exist, that meet \nthe 1 percent standard. Why do we need to wait 10 years?\n  This delay is especially troubling given that in 2001, former \nSecretary of Defense William Cohen issued his own policy on cluster \nmunitions stating that, beginning in fiscal year 2005, all new cluster \nmunitions must have a failure rate of less than 1 percent.\n  Unfortunately, the Pentagon was unable to meet this deadline and \nSecretary Gates' new policy essentially postpones any meaningful action \nfor another 10 years.\n  That means if we do nothing, by 2018 close to 20 years will have \npassed since the Pentagon first recognized the threat these deadly \nweapons pose to innocent civilians.\n  We can do better.\n  Our legislation simply moves up the Gates policy by 7 years.\n  For those of my colleagues who are concerned that it may be too soon \nto enact a ban on the use of cluster bombs with failure rates of more \nthan 1 percent, I point out again that our bill allows the President to \nwaive this restriction if he determines it is vital to protect the \nsecurity of the United States to do so.\n  I would also remind my colleagues that the United States has not used \ncluster bombs in Iraq since 2003 and has observed a moratorium on their \nuse in Afghanistan since 2002.\n  We introduce this legislation to make this moratorium permanent for \nthe entire U.S. arsenal of cluster munitions.\n  We introduce this legislation for children like Hassan Hammade.\n  A 13-year-old Lebanese boy, Hassan lost four fingers and sustained \ninjuries to his stomach and shoulder after he picked up an unexploded \ncluster bomb in front of an orange tree.\n  He said:\n\n       I started playing with it and it blew up. I didn't know it \n     was a cluster bomb--it just looked like a burned out piece of \n     metal.\n       All the children are too scared to go out now, we just play \n     on the main roads or in our homes.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. We should do \nwhatever we can to protect more innocent children and other civilians \nfrom these dangerous weapons.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S1561]]\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 558\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Cluster Munitions Civilian \n     Protection Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. LIMITATION ON THE USE OF CLUSTER MUNITIONS.\n\n       No funds appropriated or otherwise available to any Federal \n     department or agency may be obligated or expended to use any \n     cluster munitions unless--\n       (1) the submunitions of the cluster munitions, after \n     arming, do not result in more than 1 percent unexploded \n     ordnance across the range of intended operational \n     environments; and\n       (2) the policy applicable to the use of such cluster \n     munitions specifies that the cluster munitions will only be \n     used against clearly defined military targets and will not be \n     used where civilians are known to be present or in areas \n     normally inhabited by civilians.\n\n     SEC. 3. PRESIDENTIAL WAIVER.\n\n       The President may waive the requirement under section 2(1) \n     if, prior to the use of cluster munitions, the President--\n       (1) certifies that it is vital to protect the security of \n     the United States; and\n       (2) not later than 30 days after making such certification, \n     submits to the appropriate congressional committees a report, \n     in classified form if necessary, describing in detail--\n       (A) the steps that will be taken to protect civilians; and\n       (B) the failure rate of the cluster munitions that will be \n     used and whether such munitions are fitted with self-destruct \n     or self-deactivation devices.\n\n     SEC. 4. CLEANUP PLAN.\n\n       Not later than 90 days after any cluster munitions are used \n     by a Federal department or agency, the President shall submit \n     to the appropriate congressional committees a plan, prepared \n     by such Federal department or agency, for cleaning up any \n     such cluster munitions and submunitions which fail to explode \n     and continue to pose a hazard to civilians.\n\n     SEC. 5. APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES DEFINED.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``appropriate congressional \n     committees'' means the Committee on Foreign Relations, the \n     Committee on Armed Services, and the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign \n     Affairs, the Committee on Armed Services, and the Committee \n     on Appropriations of the House of Representatives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Brown of Ohio, and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 560. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \ndeliver a meaningful benefit and lower prescription drug prices under \nthe Medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this Congress, members from both sides of \nthe aisle recognize the need to reduce the national deficit. Today, I \nam introducing the Medicare Prescription Drugs Savings and Choice Act \nof 2011, a bill that would save taxpayer dollars by giving Medicare \nbeneficiaries the choice to participate in a Medicare Part D \nprescription drug plan run by Medicare, not private insurance \ncompanies.\n  In 2003, Congress enacted the Medicare Modernization Act, which added \na long overdue prescription drug benefit to Medicare. Senior citizens \nand people with disabilities were relieved to finally have coverage for \nthis important aspect of their healthcare needs.\n  The way the Part D program was structured under the original law, it \nincluded a coverage gap known as the ``donut hole.'' Once an initial \ncoverage limit was reached, beneficiaries had to absorb 100 percent of \ntheir drug costs until catastrophic coverage kicked in. That meant that \napproximately 3.4 million seniors nationwide with the heaviest reliance \non prescription drugs faced the prospect of paying up to $4,000 out of \npocket before they qualified for further assistance from Medicare.\n  When Congress passed the Affordable Care Act last year, we made \nsignificant improvements to the Medicare Part D program. Seniors who \nhit the ``donut hole'' in 2010 received a one-time $250 check. This \nhelped 109,421 seniors in Illinois pay for their prescriptions during \nthe coverage gap. In addition, this year Medicare beneficiaries will \nreceive a 50 percent discount on brand name drugs in the donut hole, \nand the donut hole will be fully closed by 2020. This means that \nIllinois seniors will save $1.2 billion in out of pocket costs over the \nnext decade.\n  The bill I am introducing today would make yet another improvement to \nthe Medicare prescription drug benefit. The Part D program is not \nstructured like the rest of Medicare. For all other Medicare benefits, \nseniors can choose whether to receive benefits directly through \nMedicare or through a private insurance plan. The overwhelming majority \nchoose the Medicare-run option for their hospital and physician \ncoverage.\n  No such choice is available for prescription drugs. Medicare \nbeneficiaries must enroll in a private insurance plan to obtain drug \ncoverage.\n  In many regions, dozens of plan choices are available and each plan \nhas its own premium, cost-sharing requirements, list of covered drugs, \nand pharmacy network. After you have identified the right drug plan, \nyou have to go through the whole process again at the end of the year \nbecause your plan may have changed the drugs it covers or added new \nrestrictions on how to access covered drugs. Anyone who has visited a \nsenior center or spoken with an elderly relative knows that the \ncomplexity of the drug benefit has created confusion.\n  Adding to the frustration with the program so far is accumulating \nevidence that private drug plans have not been effective negotiators, \nwhich means seniors and taxpayers end up paying more than they should.\n  We know that drug prices are higher in private Medicare drug plans \nthan drug prices available through the Veterans Administration, \nMedicaid, and other countries like Canada.\n  The Veterans Administration has authority to directly negotiate with \ndrug companies, and as a result it has cut drug prices by as much as 50 \npercent. A study published in 2008 found that if Medicare negotiated \ndrug prices on behalf of seniors, $21.5 billion could be saved \nannually.\n  The Medicare Prescription Drug Savings and Choice Act of 2011 would \nprovide a simple and stable way to obtain drug coverage, since the plan \nMedicare-operated prescription drug plan would be available nationwide \nevery year, and would charge everyone the same premium.\n  It would also save money because the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices would have the tools to design a formulary and negotiate \nprices with drug companies. The best medical evidence would determine \nwhich drugs are covered in the formulary, and it would be used to \npromote safety, appropriate use of drugs, and value.\n  The bill would establish an appeals process that is efficient, \nimposes minimal administrative burdens, and ensures timely procurement \nof non-formulary drugs or non-preferred drugs when medically necessary.\n  The Secretary would also develop a system for paying pharmacies that \nwould include the prompt payment of claims.\n  Seniors want the ability to choose a Medicare-administered drug plan. \nLet us give them this option--just as they have this choice with every \nother benefit covered by Medicare.\n  A Medicare administered drug plan would create a ``win-win'' \nsituation that could save billions of taxpayer dollars and provide a \nhigh-quality affordable option to seniors.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 560\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Prescription Drug \n     Savings and Choice Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF MEDICARE OPERATED PRESCRIPTION DRUG \n                   PLAN OPTION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subpart 2 of part D of title XVIII of the \n     Social Security Act is amended by inserting after section \n     1860D-11 (42 U.S.C. 1395w-111) the following new section:\n\n\n           ``medicare operated prescription drug plan option\n\n       ``Sec. 1860D-11A.

A bill to designate the Valles Caldera National Preserve as a \nunit of the National Park System, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce legislation \nthat would transfer administrative jurisdiction of the Valles Caldera \nNational Preserve from the Valles Caldera Trust to the National Park \nService. I am pleased that my colleague from New Mexico, Tom Udall, is \nagain a cosponsor of this bill.\n  For those not familiar with this area, the Valles Caldera in Northern \nNew Mexico is one of only three supervolcanoes in the United States, \nthe other two being Yellowstone, WY, and Long Valley, CA. Spanning more \nthan 100,000 acres, the caldera contains lush and expansive grassland \nvalleys, ponderosa pines in the foothills and mixed conifer forests in \nthe higher elevations of the volcanic domes and peaks. Numerous \ncultural and archaeological sites are scattered throughout the \nlandscape that provides quality habitat to elk, trout, golden and bald \neagles, and myriad other species. In 1975, the Valles Caldera received \nformal recognition as an outstanding and nationally significant \ngeologic resource when it was designated a National Natural Landmark.\n  More recently in 2000, the Valles Caldera Preservation Act authorized \nthe Federal Government to acquire the property and established the \nValles Caldera Trust--an independent government corporation led by a \nboard of trustees appointed by the President whose mission is to \nprovide for public access and protection of the Preserve's natural and \ncultural resources. The Trust is also directed to manage the Preserve \nin a manner that would achieve financial self-sustainability after \nfifteen years.\n  While the individual board members have done their best to fulfill \nthe original legislative directives, time has shown in my opinion that \nthis management framework is not the best suited for the long-term \nmanagement of the Preserve. These issues have been laid out at length \nin two GAO reports, during the hearing we held on this legislation in \nthe 111th Congress, and in previous statements I have made on the \nsubject.\n  In weighing the various alternatives, the conclusion was reached that \nmanagement by the National Park Service--an agency with a mission of \nprotecting natural, historic, and cultural resources while also \nproviding for public enjoyment of those resources--is more appropriate \nfor the long-term future of the Valles Caldera. In my view, it would \nalso best serve the public's desire for increased public access, \nbalanced with the need to protect and interpret the Preserve's unique \ncultural and natural resources.\n  Senator Udall and I first introduced this legislation during the \n111th Congress, during which time the bill received a hearing in the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources and was reported out \nfavorably by that Committee. The reported legislation, which is what we \nare introducing today, incorporated the many comments we received \nduring the hearing process. This includes improvements to the \nprovisions on hunting and fishing and cattle grazing as well as changes \nmade based on recommendations by tribal governments. Other stakeholder \ncomments, including those from the friends group, Los Amigos de Valles \nCaldera, led to modifications that will ensure the ecological \nrestoration of the Preserve remains a priority under Park Service \nmanagement. I also appreciated the valuable comments we received from \nthe staff at the Valles Caldera Trust who remain steadfast in their \ncommitment to the highest management standards at the Preserve.\n  Beyond these changes, however, the original framework and intent of \nthe legislation remains the same. The existing character of the \nPreserve would be maintained and protections for tribal cultural and \nreligious sites would be strengthened. The Park Service would manage \nthe Preserve to protect and preserve its natural and cultural \nresources, while increasing public access and continuing to permit \nhunting and fishing and grazing. The National Park Service would also \nestablish a science and education program similar to the highly \nsuccessful program created by the Trust.\n  While the full Senate was unable to take action on this bill during \nthe last Congress, I remain hopeful that we will find an opportunity \nduring this one to bring it before the Senate for consideration. Public \nsupport in my State remains very high for the Park Service to manage \nthis unique resource, and it is my hope that the enactment of this \nlegislation will allow more Americans as well as future generations to \nenjoy this special place.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 564\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, today I join Senator Bingaman \nin reintroducing a bill to designate the Valles Caldera National \nPreserve in New Mexico as a unit of the National Park System. The \nValles Caldera is one of the largest volcanic calderas in the world. \nThe vast grass-filled valleys, forested hillsides, and numerous \nvolcanic peaks make the area a treasure to New Mexico, and a landscape \nof national significance millions of years in the making. It is \nappropriate that an area of such value be protected in perpetuity as a \nunit of the National Park Service.\n  Around 1.5 million years ago a series of explosive rhyolitic \neruptions created the massive caldera and dropped hundreds of meters of \nvolcanic ash for miles. This volcanic activity gave the Pajarito \nPlateau its distinctive cliffs of pink and white tuff overlaying the \nblack basalts of the Rio Grande Rift.\n  In the millennia following the caldera's explosive creation, erosion \nand weathering carved vibrant canyons and left pinion-topped mesas \nstretching like fingers away from the massive crater. In time, magma \nand water drained from the great valley, and a diversity of plants and \nwildlife took their place. With such resources and natural beauty, it \nis no wonder that for millennia people have also been an integral part \nof the Valles Caldera.\n  For the Pueblo Tribes of northern New Mexico, the Valles Caldera has \nbeen a part of life from time immemorial. The continued cultural and \nreligious significance of the area must and will be respected and \nprotected as the preserve moves into the management of the National \nPark Service.\n  Private ownership of the Caldera began with Spanish settlers who \nintroduced livestock to the grassy valleys that continue to fatten elk \nand cattle in the summer months. After a series of owners managed the \ncaldera, the Federal Government finally purchased the area in 2000 \nthrough the Valles Caldera Preservation Act, which I was proud to help \nshepherd through Congress with Senator Bingaman and then-Senator \nDomenici. The subsequent creation of the Valles Caldera National \nPreserve included the establishment of a board of directors and the \nValles Caldera Trust to manage the area, and mandates for stakeholder \ninvolvement and eventual financial self-sufficiency of the Trust.\n  I applaud the decade of work that both the Board of Trustees and the \nValles Caldera Trust have dedicated to the preserve. The exceptional \ndedication of Caldera employees has led to the creation of a robust \nscience and research program, to the development of incredible \neducational opportunities for visiting schools and universities, to a \nrestoration of natural resources, and to an expansion of cutting-edge \nscientific research.\n  Since 1939, the National Park Service has deemed the area of \nsignificant national value because of its unique and unaltered geology, \nand its singular setting, which are conducive to public recreation, \nreflection, education, and research. By utilizing the resources and \nskills within the National Park Service, I believe the Valles Caldera \nNational Preserve will continue to prosper as a natural wonder full of \nsignificant geology, ecology, history, and culture.\n  The bill that we introduce today reflects the comments and proposals \nthat emerged through a successful committee process on a similar bill \nthat Senator Bingaman and I introduced last year. In September 2010, \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources reported the bill out \nfavorably, and it is my hope that the Committee will act quickly to \nmove this reintroduced bill to the Senate floor for a vote. I look \nforward to working with Senator Bingaman and all of the stakeholders \nwho care about the future of this preserve to complete our efforts to \nestablish Park Service management of the preserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/10/senate-section/article/S1565-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1565-S1566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 98--TO EXPRESS THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n                        SCHOOL BREAKFAST PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. KOHL (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Harkin, Mrs. \nGillibrand, and Mr. Brown of Ohio) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was referred to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry:\n\n[[Page S1566]]\n\n                               S. Res. 98\n\n       Whereas participants in the school breakfast program \n     established by section 4 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 \n     (42 U.S.C. 1773) include public, private, elementary, middle, \n     and high schools, as well as rural, suburban, and urban \n     schools;\n       Whereas in each of the school years beginning July 1, 2008, \n     and July 1, 2009, 86.3 percent of schools that participated \n     in the school lunch program established under the Richard B. \n     Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.) \n     also participated in the school breakfast program;\n       Whereas in each of the school years beginning July 1, 2008, \n     and July 1, 2009, approximately 10,800,000 students in more \n     than 86,000 schools participated in the school breakfast \n     program on a typical day;\n       Whereas in fiscal year 2009, approximately 9,100,000 low-\n     income children in the United States consumed free or reduced \n     price school breakfasts on an average school day;\n       Whereas for every 100 children receiving free and reduced \n     price lunches, approximately 47 children receive free and \n     reduced price breakfasts;\n       Whereas in each of the school years beginning July 1, 2008, \n     and July 1, 2009, less than half of eligible low-income \n     children received breakfasts at school each day;\n       Whereas in fiscal year 2009, 62 percent of school lunches \n     served, and 81 percent of school breakfasts served, were \n     served to students who qualified for free or reduced priced \n     meals;\n       Whereas the current economic situation (including the \n     increase in families living below the poverty line) is \n     causing more families to struggle to feed their children and \n     to turn to schools for assistance;\n       Whereas implementing or improving classroom breakfast \n     programs has been shown to increase the participation of \n     eligible students in breakfast consumption dramatically, \n     doubling, and in some cases tripling, numbers, as evidenced \n     by research conducted in the States of Minnesota, New York, \n     and Wisconsin;\n       Whereas making breakfast widely available through different \n     venues or combinations, such as in the classroom, obtained as \n     students exit a school bus, or outside the classroom, has \n     been shown to lessen the stigma of receiving free or reduced \n     price breakfasts, which often deters eligible students from \n     obtaining traditional breakfasts in the cafeteria;\n       Whereas providing free universal breakfasts, especially in \n     the classroom, has been shown to significantly increase \n     school breakfast participation rates and decrease absences \n     and tardiness;\n       Whereas studies have shown that access to nutritious meals \n     under the school lunch program and the school breakfast \n     program helps to create a strong learning environment for \n     children and helps to improve the concentration of children \n     in the classroom;\n       Whereas providing breakfast in the classroom has been shown \n     in several instances to improve attentiveness and academic \n     performance, while reducing tardiness and disciplinary \n     referrals;\n       Whereas students who eat a complete breakfast have been \n     shown to make fewer mistakes and work faster in math \n     exercises than students who eat a partial breakfast;\n       Whereas studies suggest that eating breakfast closer to \n     classroom and test-taking time improves student performance \n     on standardized tests relative to students who skip \n     breakfasts;\n       Whereas studies show that students who skip breakfasts are \n     more likely to have difficulty distinguishing among similar \n     images, show increased errors, and have slower memory recall;\n       Whereas children who live in families that experience \n     hunger have been shown to be more likely to have lower math \n     scores, face an increased likelihood of repeating a grade, \n     and receive more special education services;\n       Whereas studies suggest that children who eat breakfasts \n     have more adequate nutrition and intake of nutrients, such as \n     calcium, fiber, protein, and vitamins A, E, D, and B-6;\n       Whereas studies show that children who participate in \n     school breakfast programs eat more fruits, drink more milk, \n     and consume less saturated fat than children who do not eat \n     breakfast;\n       Whereas children who fail to eat breakfasts, whether in \n     school or at home, are more likely to be overweight than \n     children who eat a healthy breakfast on a daily basis; and\n       Whereas March 7 through March 11, 2011, is National School \n     Breakfast Week: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the importance of the school breakfast \n     program established by section 4 of the Child Nutrition Act \n     of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1773) and the overall positive impact of \n     the program on the lives of low-income children and families, \n     as well as the effect of the program on helping to improve \n     the overall classroom performance of a child;\n       (2) expresses support for States that have successfully \n     implemented school breakfast programs in order to improve the \n     test scores and grades of participating students;\n       (3) encourages States--\n       (A) to strengthen school breakfast programs by improving \n     access for students;\n       (B) to promote improvements in the nutritional quality of \n     breakfasts served; and\n       (C) to inform students and parents of healthy nutritional \n     and lifestyle choices;\n       (4) recognizes that the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of \n     2010 (Public Law 111-296) and amendments made by that Act \n     provide low-income children with greater access to a \n     nutritious breakfast nationwide;\n       (5) recognizes the impact of nonprofit and community \n     organizations that work to increase awareness of, and access \n     to, breakfast programs for low-income children;

Res. 99\n\n       Whereas the Senate affirms the commitment of the people and \n     the Government of the United States to the well-being, \n     protection, and advancement of children, and the protection \n     of the inalienable rights of all persons of all ages;\n       Whereas the Constitution and laws of the United States and \n     those of the several States are the best guarantees against \n     mistreatment of children in this Nation;\n       Whereas the Constitution, laws, and traditions of the \n     United States affirm the rights of parents to raise their \n     children and to impart their values and religious beliefs;\n       Whereas the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the \n     Child, adopted at New York November 20, 1989, and entered \n     into force September 2, 1990, if ratified, would become a \n     part of the supreme law of the land, taking precedence over \n     all State laws and constitutions;\n       Whereas the United States, and not the several States, \n     would be held responsible for compliance with this Convention \n     if ratified, and as a consequence, the United States would \n     create an incredible expansion of subject matter jurisdiction \n     over all matters concerning children, seriously undermining \n     the constitutional balance between the Federal Government and \n     the governments of the several States;\n       Whereas Professor Geraldine Van Bueren, the author of the \n     principal textbook on the international rights of the child, \n     and a participant in the drafting of the Convention, has \n     described the ``best interest of the child\n\n[[Page S1567]]\n\n     standard'' in the treaty as ``provid[ing] decision and policy \n     makers with the authority to substitute their own decisions \n     for either the child's or the parents'';\n       Whereas the Scottish Government has issued a pamphlet to \n     children of that country explaining their rights under the \n     Convention, which declares that children have the right to \n     decide their own religion and that parents can only provide \n     advice;\n       Whereas the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the \n     Child has repeatedly interpreted the Convention to ban common \n     disciplinary measures utilized by parents;\n       Whereas the Government of the United Kingdom was found to \n     be in violation of the Convention by the United Nations \n     Committee on the Rights of the Child for allowing parents to \n     exercise a right to opt their children out of sex education \n     courses in the public schools without a prior government \n     review of the wishes of the child;\n       Whereas the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the \n     Child has held that the Governments of Indonesia and Egypt \n     were out of compliance with the Convention because military \n     expenditures were given inappropriate priority over \n     children's programs;\n       Whereas these and many other interpretations of the \n     Convention by those charged with its implementation and by \n     other authoritative supporters demonstrates that the \n     provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of \n     the Child are utterly contrary to the principles of law in \n     the United States and the inherent principles of freedom;\n       Whereas the decisions and interpretations of the United \n     Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child would be \n     considered by the Committee to be binding and authoritative \n     upon the United States should the United States Government \n     ratify the Convention, such that the Convention poses a \n     threat to the sovereign rights of the United States and the \n     several States to make final determinations regarding \n     domestic law;

Mr. President, I am proud to rise today to submit a \nresolution designating March 11 as World Plumbing Day.\n  Water is our planet's most precious resource, and it is also a \nresource the developed world often takes for granted. When we stop at a \ndrinking fountain, or when we prepare dinner for our families, we are \nconfident that the water emerging from the tap is free of harmful and \ndangerous contaminants.\n  Yet a reliable supply of water needed to maintain life is not readily \navailable to nearly one billion people around the world. In fact, the \nravages of water insecurity and inadequate sanitation claim 6,000 lives \nevery day. The majority of these casualties are children. Nearly one in \nfive child deaths worldwide is due to waterborne illness.\n  Modern plumbing technologies can prevent deaths and combat sickness. \nBy supporting access to safe drinking water and proper sanitation \nthrough sound plumbing infrastructure and minimum plumbing codes, we \ncan significantly raise quality of life and help to eliminate a \nhistoric cause of human suffering.\n  Today I stand in gratitude to our skilled, licensed plumbers and pipe \nfitters who work hard every day to ensure that the plumbing systems and \ninfrastructure in our homes, places of business, and communities \ncontinue to function properly and provide us with water safe for \nconsumption.\n  I would like to thank the International Association of Plumbing and \nMechanical Officials, IAPMO, for raising awareness of this important \nissue. These individuals work diligently to create and maintain the \nUniform Plumbing Code, which serves as the foundation for all plumbing \ninstallation and inspection activities for over half the world's \npopulation.\n  IAPMO is the only model code developer in America utilizing an open \nconsensus process accredited by the American National Standards \nInstitute, ANSI, for plumbing and mechanical codes. Worldwide, IAPMO \nand its members are on the front lines of public health and safety in \nassisting cities, counties, states, and countries with developing \nplumbing codes and providing training that protects our communities and \nsaves lives.\n  I submit this resolution in recognition of the importance of clean \nwater and the important contribution to America being made every single \nday by those men and women who maintain our plumbing infrastructure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/10/senate-section/article/S1567-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1567-S1568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      Committee on Armed Services\n\n  Mr. SANDERS.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about the issue of \ninterchange fee reform. Last year, Congress enacted landmark reform of \nthe swipe fees that Visa and MasterCard impose on the debit card \nsystem. An amendment I offered to Wall Street reform passed the Senate \nwith 64 votes--47 Democrats, 17 Republicans--and was later signed into \nlaw. It was the first amendment out of the first 26 on that bill that \nwas held to a 60-vote standard. Every other amendment before was held \nto a simple majority. But I was lucky enough, when I offered the \namendment, that there was an insistence that we had to reach 60 votes. \nWe did it, 47 Democrats and 17 Republicans. It was a great victory, and \none that came as a surprise to Wall Street, because Main Street--the \nretail merchants, the restaurants, the convenience stores, and many \nothers--had worked hard for this amendment.\n  Never before had Visa and MasterCard, the duopoly of credit cards, \nand their big bank allies lost a vote such as this in Congress. \nNormally, the credit card companies and the big banks are used to \ngetting their way in this town. Visa and MasterCard have such power \nthat they control over 75 percent of all credit and debit card \ntransactions in America. Last year, $1.39 trillion was transacted on \nVisa and MasterCard debit cards. According to the American Bankers \nAssociation, the U.S. banking industry is a $13 trillion industry. That \nis trillion with a ``t.''\n  Many Members in this body are being lobbied right now by banks and \ncard companies to repeal this law, to undo the interchange reform \nCongress passed last year. It is one of the most active lobbying \nefforts I have ever seen.\n  I want to explain why interchange reform is so important, not just \nfor the concepts of competition and transparency but also for the \npeople and businesses affected, for small businesses and consumers and \nthe American economy.\n\n[[Page S1569]]\n\n  A little background on the debit card industry: Debit cards are \nsimply a way for accountholders to access funds stored in an account. \nThey are the electronic version of a check.\n  Debit cards are issued by banks, such as Bank of America, where the \naccount is held. The cards are also part of a card network such as Visa \nor MasterCard, which set certain fees and rules about using their \ncards.\n  The banks that issue the debit cards can make money in several ways. \nThey make loans based on deposits and earn interest. They charge fees \nto consumers for maintaining and accessing accounts such as ATM, \nmonthly, overdraft, and transfer fees. They also receive interchange \nfees from merchants every time one of their debit cards is used.\n  If you look at any bank's Web site, you can find the loan interest \nrates and the account fees the bank charges customers. Banks compete \nwith one another for this consumer business. That competition keeps \ntheir fees in check. It is called the free market. But ask any bank to \nshow you on their Web site where you can find the interchange fees that \nthe bank charges merchants, restaurants, universities, charities, \nconvenience stores, ask them what they charge as an interchange fee for \nthe use of their debit cards, the bank will say: Well, you will have to \ncall Visa or MasterCard.\n  Card companies such as Visa fix the interchange fee rates received by \nissuing banks, the banks that have their name on the card next to the \nVisa symbol. In other words, thousands of banks that compete with one \nanother in all other aspects of business do not compete with one \nanother when it comes to how much in so-called swipe fees or \ninterchange fees they get from merchants. The banks let Visa set the \nprices for all of them.\n  Visa has decided that every bank that issues Visa cards will get the \nsame rate as every other bank, no matter how efficient a bank is, no \nmatter how much fraud a bank allows. Rather than a competitive system, \nthis is a system which subsidizes inefficiency. In fact, the only \ncompetition in the interchange system right now is the competition \nbetween card networks to raise interchange fees. They raise the rates \nin order to get banks to join the network and issue more of their \ncards.\n  It is easy to see why banks and card networks set up this system. It \nmakes the banks happy because they get billions of dollars a year in \nhigh fees, and they don't have to worry about competition. It makes the \nnetworks happy because they get their own network fee each time a card \nis swiped, and high interchange means banks will issue more cards.\n  But it is unfair to those who are receiving the cards--for example, \nthe restaurants, the merchants, the shops, the book stores, \nuniversities, charities, convenience stores--because they have no power \nto negotiate this fee. They can't hold off and say: Wait a minute, if \nyou want us to take Visa at our store, we want to know how much you are \ngoing to charge us every time a customer uses a Visa card. There is no \nway to have any conversation on that. Visa establishes what the swipe \nfee will be.\n  It is also unfair to consumers, particularly low-income consumers and \nthose without banking accounts, who pay billions per year in hidden \ninterchange fees that are passed on to them in higher prices for gas \nand groceries. How about that. I had some people in my office today \ntalking about the price of gasoline. They said: Understand, every time \na customer uses a Visa or a MasterCard, they are taking a percentage of \nthat cost on the gallon of gasoline. Their percentage keeps going up, \nand in order to have a profit, to keep the lights on, we have to keep \nraising the price of gasoline to keep up with the credit card \ncompanies, let alone the national oil companies.\n  The Federal Reserve estimated that in 2009, about $16.2 billion was \ncharged in debit interchange fees, a massive amount of money that is \nbeing paid to the banks by merchants and their customers, about $1.3 \nbillion a month. I will get back to that number in a moment. It didn't \nused to be that way in America. It isn't that way in many other \ncountries that use Visa and MasterCard.\n  Back when the debit card system was started several decades ago, \ndebit fees were minimal. It wasn't until Visa entered the market in the \n1990s that we started seeing debit card interchange fees that looked \nlike credit card interchange fees.\n  They are two different worlds. When I use a credit card, ultimately, \nthe bank and credit card company have to collect from me. If I dodge \nthem or don't pay, there is a loss. A debit card comes directly out of \nmy account. There is no question whether the money is there. It is \nalready there.\n  There is an excellent New York Times article by Andrew Martin from \nlast year titled ``How Visa, Using Card Fees, Dominates a Market.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 5, 2010]\n\n      The Card Game--How Visa, Using Card Fees, Dominates a Market\n\n                           (By Andrew Martin)\n\n       Every day, millions of Americans stand at store checkout \n     counters and make a seemingly random decision: after swiping \n     their debit card, they choose whether to punch in a code, or \n     to sign their name.\n       It is a pointless distinction to most consumers, since the \n     price is the same either way. But behind the scenes, billions \n     of dollars are at stake.\n       When you sign a debit card receipt at a large retailer, the \n     store pays your bank an average of 75 cents for every $100 \n     spent, more than twice as much as when you punch in a four-\n     digit code.\n       The difference is so large that Costco will not allow you \n     to sign for your debit purchase in its checkout lines. Wal-\n     Mart and Home Depot steer customers to use a PIN, the debit \n     card norm outside the United States.\n       Despite all this, signature debit cards dominate debit use \n     in this country, accounting for 61 percent of all such \n     transactions, even though PIN debit cards are less expensive \n     and less vulnerable to fraud.\n       How this came to be is largely a result of a successful if \n     controversial strategy hatched decades ago by Visa, the \n     dominant payment network for credit and debit cards. It is an \n     approach that has benefited Visa and the nation's banks at \n     the expense of merchants and, some argue, consumers.\n       Competition, of course, usually forces prices lower. But \n     for payment networks like Visa and MasterCard, competition in \n     the card business is more about winning over banks that \n     actually issue the cards than consumers who use them. Visa \n     and MasterCard set the fees that merchants must pay the \n     cardholder's bank. And higher fees mean higher profits for \n     banks, even if it means that merchants shift the cost to \n     consumers.\n       Seizing on this odd twist, Visa enticed banks to embrace \n     signature debit--the higher-priced method of handling debit \n     cards--and turned over the fees to banks as an incentive to \n     issue more Visa cards. At least initially, MasterCard and \n     other rivals promoted PIN debit instead.\n       As debit cards became the preferred plastic in American \n     wallets, Visa has turned its attention to PIN debit too and \n     increased its market share even more. And it has succeeded--\n     not by lowering the fees that merchants pay, but often by \n     pushing them up, making its bank customers happier.\n       In an effort to catch up, MasterCard and other rivals \n     eventually raised fees on debit cards too, sometimes higher \n     than Visa, to try to woo bank customers back.\n       ``What we witnessed was truly a perverse form of \n     competition,'' said Ronald Congemi, the former chief \n     executive of Star Systems, one of the regional PIN-based \n     networks that has struggled to compete with Visa. ``They \n     competed on the basis of raising prices. What other industry \n     do you know that gets away with that?''\n       Visa has managed to dominate the debit landscape despite \n     more than a decade of litigation and antitrust investigations \n     into high fees and anticompetitive behavior, including a \n     settlement in 2003 in which Visa paid $2 billion that some \n     predicted would inject more competition into the debit \n     industry.\n       Yet today, Visa has a commanding lead in signature debit in \n     the United States, with a 73 percent share. Its share of the \n     domestic PIN debit market is smaller but growing, at 42 \n     percent, making Visa the biggest PIN network, according to \n     The Nilson Report, an industry newsletter.\n\n\n                          The Risk of Refusing\n\n       Critics complain that Visa does not fight fair, and that it \n     used its market power to force merchants to accept higher \n     costs for debit cards. Merchants say they cannot refuse Visa \n     cards because it would result in lower sales.\n       ``A dollar is no longer a dollar in this country,'' said \n     Mallory Duncan, senior vice president of the National Retail \n     Federation, a trade association. ``It's a Visa dollar. It's \n     only worth 99 cents because they take a piece of every one.''\n       Visa officials say its critics are griping about debit \n     products that have transformed the nation's payment system, \n     adding convenience for consumers and higher sales for \n     merchants, while cutting the hassle and expense of dealing \n     with cash and checks. In recent years, New York cabbies and \n     McDonald's restaurants are among those reporting higher sales \n     as a result of accepting plastic.\n\n[[Page S1570]]\n\n       ``At times we have a perspective problem,'' said William M. \n     Sheedy, Visa's president for the Americas. ``Debit has become \n     so mainstream, some of the people who have benefited have \n     lost sight of what their business model was, what their cost \n     structure was.''\n       Visa officials said the costs of debit for merchants had \n     not gone down because the cards now provided greater value \n     than they did five or 10 years ago. The costs must not be too \n     onerous, they say, because merchant acceptance has doubled in \n     the last decade.\n       The fees are ``not a cost-based calculation, but a value-\n     based calculation,'' said Elizabeth Buse, Visa's global head \n     of product.\n       As for Visa's market share, company officials maintain that \n     it is rather small when considered within the larger context \n     of all payments, where, for now at least, cash remains king.\n       While Visa may be among the best-known brands in the world, \n     how it operates is a mystery to many consumers.\n       Visa does not distribute credit or debit cards, nor does it \n     provide credit so consumers can buy flat-screen televisions \n     or a Starbucks latte. Those tasks are left to the banks, \n     which owned Visa until it went public in 2008.\n       Instead, Visa provides an electronic network that acts like \n     a tollbooth, processing the transaction between merchants and \n     banks and collecting a fee that averages 5 or 6 cents every \n     time. For the financial year ended in June, Visa handled 40 \n     billion transactions. Banks that issue Visa cards also pay a \n     separate licensing fee, based on payment volume. MasterCard, \n     which is roughly half the size of Visa, uses a similar model.\n       ``It's a penny here or there,'' said Moshe Katri, an \n     analyst who tracks the payments industry for Cowen and \n     Company. ``But when you have a billion transactions or more, \n     it adds up.''\n       With debit transactions forecast to overtake cash purchases \n     by 2012, the model has investors swooning: Visa's stock \n     traded at $88.14 on Monday, near a 52-week high, while shares \n     of MasterCard, at $256.84 each, have soared by more than 450 \n     percent since the company went public in 2006.\n       While there is little controversy about the fees that Visa \n     collects, some merchants are infuriated by a separate, larger \n     fee, called interchange, that Visa makes them pay each time a \n     debit or credit card is swiped. The fees, roughly 1 to 3 \n     percent of each purchase, are forwarded to the cardholder's \n     bank to cover costs and promote the issuance of more Visa \n     cards.\n       The banks have used interchange fees as a growing profit \n     center and to pay for cardholder perks like rewards programs. \n     Interchange revenue has increased to $45 billion today, from \n     $20 billion in 2002, driven in part by the surge in debit \n     card use.\n       Some merchants say there should be no interchange fees on \n     debit purchases, because the money comes directly out of a \n     checking account and does not include the risks and losses \n     associated with credit cards. Regardless, merchants say they \n     inevitably pass on that cost to consumers; the National \n     Retail Federation says the interchange fees cost households \n     an average of $427 in 2008.\n       While the cost per transaction may seem small, at Best Buy, \n     the biggest stand-alone electronics chain, ``these \n     skyrocketing fees add up to hundreds of millions of dollars \n     every year,'' said Dee O'Malley, director of financial \n     services. ``Every additional dollar we are forced to pay \n     credit card companies is another dollar we can't use to hire \n     employees, or pass along to our customers in the form of \n     savings.''\n\n\n                      Weighing Rules on Merchants\n\n       The Justice Department is investigating if rules imposed by \n     payment networks, including Visa, on merchants regarding \n     ``various payment forms'' are anticompetitive, a spokeswoman \n     said. Several bills have been introduced in Congress seeking \n     to give merchants more ability to negotiate interchange, \n     which is largely unregulated.\n       While interchange remains legal despite repeated \n     challenges, a group of merchants is pursuing yet another \n     class-action suit, this time in federal court in Brooklyn, \n     against Visa and MasterCard that seeks to upend the system \n     for setting fees.\n       ``Visa and MasterCard have morphed into a giant cookie jar \n     for banks at the expense of consumers,'' said Mitch \n     Goldstone, a plaintiff in the case.\n       Fees were not an issue when debit cards first gained \n     traction in the 1980s. The small networks that operated \n     automated teller machines, like STAR, Pulse, MAC and NYCE, \n     issued debit cards that required a PIN. MasterCard had its \n     own PIN debit network, called Maestro.\n       Merchants were not charged a fee for accepting PIN debit \n     cards, and sometimes they even got a small payment because it \n     saved banks the cost of processing a paper check.\n       That changed after Visa entered the debit market. In the \n     1990s, Visa promoted a debit card that let consumers access \n     their checking account on the same network that processed its \n     credit cards, which required a signature.\n       To persuade the banks to issue more of its debit cards, \n     Visa charged merchants for these transactions and passed the \n     money to the issuing banks. By 1999, Visa was setting fees of \n     $1.35 on a $100 purchase, while Maestro and other regional \n     PIN networks charged less than a dime, Federal Reserve data \n     shows. Visa says the fee was justified because signature \n     debit was so much more useful than PIN debit; at the time, \n     roughly 15 percent of merchants had keypads for entering a \n     PIN.\n       Merchants said they had no choice but to continue taking \n     the debit cards, despite the higher fees; because Visa's \n     rules required them to honor its debit cards if they chose to \n     accept Visa's credit cards.\n\n\n                          A Seven-Year Battle\n\n       Wal-Mart, Circuit City, Sears and a number of major \n     merchants eventually sued. After seven years of litigation, \n     Visa and MasterCard agreed to end the ``honor all cards'' \n     rule between credit and debit and to pay the retailers a \n     settlement of around $3 billion, one of the largest in \n     American corporate history. Visa paid $2 billion, and \n     MasterCard the remainder.\n       Since then, only a handful of retailers have stopped \n     accepting Visa debit cards, an indication that the crux of \n     the lawsuit was ``much ado about nothing,'' Mr. Sheedy says.\n       And while some merchants said they thought the lawsuit \n     would pave the way to a new era of competition, a curious \n     thing happened instead: while Visa temporarily lowered its \n     fees for signature debit, it raised the price on PIN debit \n     transactions and passed the funds on to card-issuing banks, \n     and its competitors soon followed.\n       The current class-action lawsuit joined by Mr. Goldstone \n     contends that Visa's PIN debit network, called Interlink, is \n     offering banks higher fees as an incentive to issue debit \n     cards that are exclusively routed over this network. \n     Interlink, which has raised its PIN debit fees for small \n     merchants to 90 cents for each $l00 transaction, from 20 \n     cents in 2002, is often the most expensive, especially for \n     small merchants, Fed data shows.\n       One large retailer, who requested anonymity to preserve its \n     relationship with Visa, provided data that showed Interlink's \n     share of PIN purchases rose to 47 percent in 2009, from 20 \n     percent in 2002, even as its fees steadily increased ahead of \n     most other networks--to 49 cents per $100 transaction in \n     2009, from 38 cents in 2006.\n       Visa officials say its PIN debit network is taking off \n     despite rising costs because it offers merchants, banks and \n     consumers a level of efficiency and security that regional \n     networks cannot match. ``We are motivated as a company to try \n     to drive value to each one of those participants so that they \n     accept the card, issue more cards, use the card,'' Mr. Sheedy \n     said.\n       At checkout counters, meanwhile, consumers are quietly \n     tugged in one direction or the other.\n       Safewasy, 7-Eleven and CVS drugstores automatically prompt \n     consumers to do a less costly PIN debit transaction. The \n     banks, however, still steer consumers toward the more \n     expensive form of signature debit. Wells Fargo and Chase are \n     among those that offer bonus points only on debit purchases \n     completed with a signature.\n       Visa says it does not care how consumers use their debit \n     card, as long as it is a Visa. But for now at least, the \n     company says the only way to ensure that a purchase is routed \n     over the Visa network is to sign.\n       ``When you use your Visa card, you have a chance to win a \n     trip to the Olympic Winter Games,'' a new Visa commercial \n     promises.\n       The commercial does not explain the rules, but the fine \n     print on Visa's Web site does: nearly all Visa purchases are \n     eligible--as long as the cardholder does not enter a PIN.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I urge my colleagues to read it. It shows how Visa \nleveraged its dominance in the credit card industry to enter into and \ndominate the debit card industry. Visa then changed the debit \ninterchange fee system so it looked like the credit card fee system. \nThe result: the United States has the highest interchange fees in the \nworld.\n  We also have some of the worst fraud prevention technology in the \nworld. This is because Visa gives banks higher interchange rates for \nso-called signature debit transactions instead of PIN debit \ntransactions. So the banks tell their customers to pay with signature \ndebit, even though far less fraud occurs with the use of PIN numbers.\n  It doesn't have to be this way. Many countries such as Canada have \nthriving debit card systems with zero interchange fees. Canada has low \nfraud and wide consumer debit usage. Other places such as the European \nUnion carefully regulate interchange rates to keep them to a reasonable \nlevel. But in this country, we have let dominant card networks--and \nthey are a powerful bunch--take over our debit card system. They are \ndriving that system on an unsustainable course.\n  I have worked for years to reform interchange fees and to bring \ntransparency, competition, and choice to the credit card and debit card \nindustry. I first introduced a bill on this in 2008. In 2009, I joined \nwith Senator Kit Bond of Missouri to file a modest floor amendment to \nthe Credit CARD Act. The amendment simply said interchange fees should \nbe reported to the Federal Reserve and that Visa and MasterCard should \nnot be allowed to stop merchants from offering discounts for debit \ncards against credit cards. The card companies and bank industry hated \nthat idea like the devil hates\n\n[[Page S1571]]\n\nholy water. They did everything they could to kill the amendment. They \nused their standard talking points, saying this amendment would hurt \nconsumers, small banks, credit unions, the economy, everything one \ncould think of. The amendment never reached a vote. Instead, in 2009, \nthe banks and card companies said they would support a study. We love \nto study things in Washington. So Congress delayed real reform and \nsaid: Let's get on with the study.\n  Last year, I said: Enough is enough. We can't continue to let Visa, \nMasterCard, and the big banks use price-setting schemes to turn our \ndebit card system into their own large piggy bank at the expense of \nmerchants and consumers. The amendment I offered last year said: If \nbanks are going to let a card network set interchange rates for them, \nthose rates must be reasonable and proportional to the cost of \nprocessing a debit transaction over that network's wires.\n  Why would we bring the Federal Reserve in to establish a reasonable \nand proportional interest change fee? Because there is no competition \nin this market. Visa and MasterCard, recently under investigation by \nthe Department of Justice for their practices, establish what these \ninterchange fees are going to be. They impose them on merchants who \nmany times are told late in the game how much the fee is. They don't \nbargain. Merchants can't shop around. There is no competition when it \ncomes to the establishment of interchange fees.\n  The amendment will end this inefficient subsidy that Visa and \nMasterCard have created for banks, and it will incentivize banks to \noperate their card systems efficiently. The amendment directs the Fed \nto issue regulations to implement this reasonable and proportional \nstandard. The Fed issued draft regulations in December and is now \nworking on final regulations to be completed in April and take effect \nin July.\n  Do my colleagues know what they found in their initial cut at this? \nThe average interchange fee is in the range of 40 cents, and the \naverage cost to use a debit card is about 10 cents. Think of the \novercharge that is going on with every single transaction. The next \ntime you are standing in the airport and somebody hands a debit card to \nthe cashier to pay for a pack of gum, think about that retailer just \nhaving lost money. The only ones who made money in the transaction were \nVisa, MasterCard and the issuing bank.\n  Last year, when I was drafting this amendment, I knew we had to be \ncareful about the way the reform would affect small banks and credit \nunions that currently benefit from the rates Visa and MasterCard set. I \ndidn't want to drive small issuers out of the debit card market. So my \namendment specifically exempted them from regulation. That means that \nnow, just like before, networks will compete by raising interchange \nrates to win the business of those small, unregulated issuers.\n  I know the small banks and credit unions are also lobbying on the \nHill, saying that interchange reform will hurt them. For years, they \nhave been making this argument against any type of reform. I have been \non the Hill for a while, in the House and in the Senate.\n  I used to really believe there was a qualitative--not just \nquantitative but a qualitative--difference between community banks and \ncredit unions and the big boys, the Wall Street banks. Over the years, \nI am sorry to say when it comes to these issues, they are the same. It \nis just a quantitative difference. Credit unions and community banks \nare smaller, but in terms of the way they look at issues, there is not \na dime's worth of difference.\n  When it comes to this issue, there is an interesting phenomenon at \nwork. Visa and MasterCard do not dare raise their head on Capitol Hill. \nIf there are two more unpopular companies with American consumers, it \nis hard to think of what they might be. Maybe today it is oil \ncompanies. But it is a close second with credit card companies and the \nway they treat people. So they do not come in and lobby.\n  Well, how about the Wall Street banks? Do you think they are going to \nshow up here and say: You cannot regulate these interchange fees? Two-\nthirds of the debit cards come from the biggest banks out of Wall \nStreet, not the community banks and credit unions. So the big money in \nthis whole transaction is on Wall Street. But you do not hear from the \nWall Street banks. Why? Because they are not going to win any \npopularity contests either.\n  It was not that long ago we were shoveling billions of taxpayer \ndollars at these banks to keep the lights on after they made some \npretty stupid investment decisions that drove our economy into the \nditch. So they cannot lobby, the big banks, with the big money involved \nin this issue. The credit card companies cannot lobby because they have \nno popularity with the American consumer. So what do they do? They have \nsome beards, and the beards in these circumstances are the credit \nunions and the community banks. Those specifically exempted are now \ncoming to Congress, coming to Capitol Hill, saying this could hurt us \nin the future.\n  We drew a line and said if the asset value of the financial \ninstitution is below $10 billion--$10 billion--they are not affected by \nthis law. There are, if I recall, only three credit unions in America \nwith assets over $10 billion. The vast majority, the overwhelming \nmajority, of credit unions in this country do not have anywhere near \nthat kind of asset value. The same thing is true with community banks.\n  So Wall Street banks and credit card companies have found their great \nagents. Their agents are the credit unions, community banks, presenting \ntheir case to the Members of Congress as if they are directly regulated \nwhen they are specifically exempted from this.\n  I know the small banks and the credit unions are working the Hill. \nFor years, they have been using these arguments against any type of \nreform. When we tried to get bankruptcy reform to deal with \nforeclosures a few years back--and I honestly think it could have had a \ndramatically positive impact to slow down foreclosures in this Nation--\nwe specifically exempted credit unions and community banks, and they \nstill lobbied against it. They are in concert when it comes to issues \nwith the biggest banks in America. I do not understand it. It is a \ndramatic departure from where they have been historically.\n  Independent analysts agree that the reform Congress passed last year \nwill give small banks actual competitive advantages over big banks. I \nask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a recent op-ed by \nAndrew Kahr in the American Banker newspaper entitled ``Never Mind the \nLobbyists, Durbin Amendment Helps Small Banks.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From American Banker--BankThink, Mar. 3, 2011]\n\n      Never Mind the Lobbyists, Durbin Amendment Helps Small Banks\n\n       The Durbin Amendment in Dodd-Frank lowers the interchange \n     paid to large banks on debit card purchase transactions, and \n     hence takes money away from these banks to give it to \n     merchants, almost dollar for dollar. When passed, this \n     provision was politically popular. It was a time for bank-\n     bashing.\n       Now this component of Dodd-Frank is much less popular. \n     Maybe legislators have noticed that even if Wal-Mart passed \n     through every last penny of the 0.7% of debit card sales it's \n     apt to save to customers in the form of lower prices, the \n     consumer benefit is likely to be invisible to voters. In any \n     event, the banks have made themselves highly audible to \n     voters in shrill but absurd threats to cap debit card \n     purchases at $50 and the like. Another form of lobbying.\n       One of the arguments made against the Durbin restriction on \n     interchange is that it will hurt community banks.\n       Poppycock.\n       Since Durbin explicitly excludes banks with assets under \n     $10 billion from the restriction on interchange, it takes a \n     hyperactive imagination to see how these banks could be hurt \n     by it. Lobbyists have the requisite inventiveness.\n       If large banks get 75% less interchange than they do now \n     and small banks continue to get today's interchange rates, \n     then obviously this confers a substantial competitive \n     advantage on the small banks. They can impose lower fees, pay \n     more interest, and give greater rewards to depositors. \n     Anything that reduces revenue for big banks but not for small \n     ones should help the latter compete more effectively against \n     the former.\n       In opposition to common sense, bank lobbyists have put \n     forward some very far-fetched arguments about how, in some \n     upside-down world, small banks are still going to be losers \n     rather than winners from Durbin.\n       One argument is that the clearing networks, of which there \n     are only four that\n\n[[Page S1572]]\n\n     matter, will not support the ``two-tier'' interchange system \n     envisaged by Durbin. Ridiculous. Visa is the largest of the \n     networks. It's already announced that it will implement \n     Durbin. (Maybe this is an object lesson as to why Visa \n     remains No. 1.)\n       For the small banks, MasterCard is the only other \n     significant player. If MasterCard finds it politic not to add \n     one more wrinkle to a skein of interchange levels that is \n     already of Byzantine complexity, then let the small banks \n     gravitate to Visa in order to benefit from Durbin.\n       A second argument of the big-bank lobbyists is that \n     merchants will reject the debit cards of small banks if these \n     carry a 1% interchange cost, versus 0.3% for the large banks. \n     Really? Then why don't these merchants reject all credit \n     cards, with interchange of 2% or more, if the customer could \n     instead use a debit card? When is the last time a merchant \n     politely asked you whether you could pay with a debit card \n     instead of a credit card?\n       The reason merchants don't do this, apart from association \n     rules that purport to prohibit it, is that the retailer's top \n     priority is sales, not interchange. Selective ``suppression'' \n     of cards by merchants has occurred with extreme rarity. One \n     instance took place long ago when merchants in Boston \n     revolted against higher interchange rates from American \n     Express. This can't happen now. Are cashiers in stores going \n     to look at a list of small banks in order to discriminate \n     against their cards--and then have customers walk out and \n     leave their would-be purchases at the cash register? The \n     fraction of customers who would be persuaded to change banks \n     or carry two debit cards is infinitesimal.\n       The notion that merchants will give discounts on big-bank \n     debit cards but not small-bank debit cards is equally silly. \n     Since when did they offer an incentive to use debit rather \n     than credit cards? If they are not motivated to do so by 2.3% \n     versus 1% interchange, then why should they be motivated by \n     1% versus 0.3%?\n       Finally, we are warned that a second, utterly unrelated \n     provision of Durbin that mandates competitive network routing \n     will somehow injure small banks. Impossible. It is \n     predominantly the biggest banks that have negotiated \n     exclusive or volume-dependent routing deals with Visa or \n     others. This too gives them an advantage over small banks \n     that Durbin will undermine or erase--to the benefit of the \n     small banks.\n       The charm of the Durbin debate on interchange is that it \n     largely amounts to ``Who's going to get the money, big banks \n     or merchants?'' (In other words, ``Which do you like less, \n     Congressman, big banks, or big merchants?'')\n       Outside the realms of taxation and appropriations, it is \n     unusual to see such a choice so sharply focused for our \n     representatives in Washington.\n       Ben Bernanke and other regulators would like to see less \n     pressure on big-bank earnings and capital. That's \n     understandable. Maybe it's even a winning--though illogical--\n     argument.\n       But let's not talk nonsense about bogeyman danger to \n     community banks.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Now, Kahr is no mouthpiece for merchants. He is a \nfinancial consultant who is recognized as the creator of many aspects \nof the modern card industry. But he says what I have been saying for \nmonths--that the arguments small banks have been making against my \namendment defy economic logic and common sense.\n  I also believe interchange reform is essential for consumers. Banks \nwill tell you consumers will be hurt by reform because banks will have \nto raise consumer fees to make up for lost revenue.\n  First, when did we start listening to banks and credit card companies \nto tell us what is good for consumers? Second, read the headlines for \nthe past few years and you will see that banks were already raising \nconsumer fees to record highs in 2008, 2009, and 2010--before my \namendment became law. They are always looking for ways to raise fees on \nconsumers as high as the market will allow.\n  Third, consumers are already paying for the current interchange \nsystem. Soaring interchange fees are passed on to consumers in the form \nof higher prices for gasoline and groceries. And the current system \nparticularly hurts unbanked consumers who pay with cash.\n  I believe consumers benefit from transparency, competition, and \nchoice. The current interchange system has been designed specifically \nto avoid these features. That is why consumer groups agree with me and \nsupport the interchange reform which we have on the books.\n  I know the financial industry lobbyists are out there now storming \nthe Halls of Congress. They are saying: Let's delay the Fed's \ninterchange rulemaking for a year or two. Let's study this issue some \nmore. Study, study, study; this is one great study hall, this U.S. \nSenate. But there comes a point when we need to act, and we are \nprepared to act now with the Federal Reserve in April and in July.\n  There is no need to delay these rules. Read the comments I submitted \nto the Fed about their draft rulemaking. You will see how the new law \nprovides reasonable timeframes for implementing every part of the Fed's \nrules.\n  I saw this call for delay and study before, on the Credit CARD Act \nback in 2009, and it does not surprise me we are hearing it again.\n  If my colleagues remember nothing else, they should remember this: \nDelaying interchange reform will have significant consequences to \nemployers, small businesses, and consumers all across America. Not only \nwill businesses, universities, government agencies, and charities keep \npaying the current $1.3 billion per month in debit interchange fees, \nthe fees will keep going up further. There will be nothing to constrain \nVisa and MasterCard from setting higher and higher fees. There is no \ncompetition in this industry.\n  Some of my colleagues say they are concerned about small banks and \nconsumers. So am I. That is why I drafted the amendment to exempt them. \nIndependent analysts and consumer groups agree that the reform we \npassed protects small banks and consumers.\n  I say to my colleagues, do not tell me you are worried about small \nbanks and consumers and then push for a delay that will serve to \nprovide $1 billion a month in more fees primarily to the largest banks \nin America.\n  A delay in this implementation would give Visa and MasterCard and the \nbig banks a multibillion-dollar handout--have we heard this song \nbefore?--while leaving merchants and consumers worse off than they \nalready are. I am not going to sit by and let the big banks and card \ncompanies get away with trying to kill this reform. They have been \nbailed out enough already.\n  I urge my colleagues in Congress: Do not bail out the big banks on \nWall Street another time. Once in a political lifetime is enough for \nmost of us.\n  I am standing with the consumers and merchants on this issue. I hope \nmy colleagues will join me and find it is a good place to stand.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/10/senate-section/article/S1572-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, MARCH 14, 2011, AT 2 P.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
