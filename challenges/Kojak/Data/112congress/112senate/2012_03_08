Mr. President, last night the two parties reached an \nagreement on amendments to the highway bill. As the majority leader \nwill indicate shortly, or may already have before I came to the floor, \nwe will be able to move forward on that later today.\n  I am also happy to report there are a number of strong, very strong, \njob-creating measures in the mix. One that stands out is Senator \nHoeven's amendment on the Keystone XL Pipeline, that massive private \nsector project that will create 20,000 jobs almost immediately.\n  Most Americans strongly support building the pipeline and, of course, \nthe significant number of construction jobs that would come along with \nit. It is incomprehensible to me that the President of the United \nStates, as I read, is actually lobbying against the Keystone Pipeline \namendment. There is a report this morning that the President is \npersonally making phone calls to Democratic Senators he thinks might \nvote for the amendment, asking them not to. Frankly, it is hard to \ncomprehend how completely out of touch he is on this issue.\n  Think about it. At a moment when millions are out of work, gas prices \nare\n\n[[Page S1496]]\n\nliterally skyrocketing, and the Middle East is in turmoil, we have a \nPresident who is up making phone calls trying to block a pipeline here \nat home. It is almost unbelievable. What we are seeing in Congress this \nweek is a study in contrasts. On the one hand, you have a Republican-\ncontrolled House that is about to pass a bipartisan jobs bill that \nwould help entrepreneurs and innovators by getting Washington out of \nthe way, and today we have a Democratic-controlled Senate trying to \nline up votes against an amendment that would create jobs, and a \nDemocratic President lobbying against the biggest private sector job \ncreation project in our country.\n  We have an opportunity to work together to create jobs. We can do \nthat with these amendments and we can do that by taking up the \nbipartisan jobs bill the House will pass later today.\n  Let me say a word about that. The bipartisan jobs bill the House will \npass later today is supported by the President. It is ready to go. I \nhope that once it gets over to the Senate we will simply take it up and \npass it. It is an example of a measure supported by Republicans and \nDemocrats and the President that we believe will clear the House with a \nvery large majority. I think the sooner we pass that here in the Senate \nand send it down to the President for signature, the better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/08/senate-section/article/S1496-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1496-S1497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SURFACE TRANSPORTATION ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was reminded this morning as I came to the \nfloor about an old standard political joke. When I looked at my papers \nI had here, my outline of what I was going to say, I was missing a \npage. That is what the Republican leader and I were joking about here \nthis morning. That is why he went first, because I didn't have my \nspeech. The old political joke, as we have all heard many times--this \npolitician was giving a speech and he is flipping through his pages and \nhe is in the midst of giving it. After he gets wound up in his speech, \nhe is going through the speech and he is waving his hands and shouting \nand he comes to the third or fourth page of his speech and it says: \n``You are on your own, you SOB.'' His speechwriter had had enough of \nhim.\n  But that is not what happened here today. Phoebe prepared the speech \nfor me and I left a part of it in my office.\n  I am pleased to say Democrats and Republicans reached an agreement to \nadvance the highway bill that has been before this body for a month. It \nis a bipartisan bill. As I have said here over this past month, this is \na piece of legislation that was prepared the way legislation should be \nprepared. A very conservative Member, Jim Inhofe from Oklahoma, and a \nvery liberal Member, Barbara Boxer, managed this bill. They have worked \nvery hard.\n  Just a little side note; as we were struggling, trying to come up \nwith these amendments, I was happy to hear from Barbara Boxer. She said \nto me privately: I have talked to Senator Inhofe and he thinks, as we \nare coming to this agreement, this is not what should be done.\n  That was important to me in reaching consensus on how we move forward \non this bill. As I have said many times, not everything we do this year \nshould be a big fight. We should be able to move things forward without \nwaiting for a month to get things done. This bill is truly indicative \nof how we have to get these done and why I appreciate the cooperation \nof Senators Boxer and Inhofe.\n  We have a dilapidated system of highways. We have 70,000--I am not \nmisspeaking, not 7,000--70,000 bridges in America that are in dire need \nof repair--or replacement even. Twenty percent, 1 out of every 5 miles \nof your roads in America are not up to safety standards. Thousands of \npedestrians are killed because they relied on unsafe sidewalks or \nnonexisting sidewalks.\n  Every day millions of Americans--a disproportionate number who are \nlow income, minority, disabled, or old--are forced to rely on \novercrowded mass transit systems, straining to meet the demands of a \ngrowing ridership. America's crumbling infrastructure is a terrible \ndrain on our economy.\n  A number of years ago when my wife and I took a few days off around \nChristmas in southern California, rather than fly back I thought why \ndon't we drive back to Las Vegas. We did that. This was a couple of \nyears ago. I hadn't done it in a long time. I 15, this famous road, was \njammed. We came to complete stops on a number of occasions coming back \nfrom San Diego to Las Vegas. Think about that, a complete stop. There \nwere trucks on that road. Drivers were being paid for their time on the \nroad. The cargo they were hauling needed to get someplace. It is not \nonly someone wanting to take a vacation, coming to Las Vegas; it is \nwhat it does to commerce to have these roads that are in a state of \ndisrepair. So this crumbling infrastructure certainly is a drag on our \neconomy.\n  But rebuilding this infrastructure will have the opposite effect. \nInvesting in our transportation system will save or create almost 3 \nmillion jobs. This legislation has to be completed before the end of \nthis month or we have no way of collecting the taxes; when you buy a \ngallon of gasoline, that funds what we need to do here to repair our \nroads, bridges, et cetera.\n  This is not some wild program invented in the last few months here in \nWashington. This is a program that was initiated by President \nEisenhower. This week I received a letter from an organization called I \nMake America. It is a group of more than 850 businesses and 20,000 \nindividuals who support this transportation bill. Many people across \nthis country, some in this Chamber, would write off the rest of this \nCongress, but I am not going to do that. We have a lot more to do and \nwe need to get it done. When we complete our work, we need to look back \nand say what has happened that is good.\n  ``There is no single piece of legislation now before Congress that \nwill do more to create American jobs and sharpen our global \ncompetitiveness'' than this legislation said Dennis Slater on behalf of \nI Make America, the program I just talked about.\n  We need to push this bill over the finish line and I think the finish \nline is now in sight. This is one of the most important pieces of \nlegislation we can consider. I indicated earlier why. But even as I \nrecognize the bipartisanship that made this progress possible, I will \nsound a note of caution. Eighty-five Senators voted to begin on this \nlegislation. Only a handful--it wasn't 15, because we had absent \nSenators that day--said we should not begin voting on it. Yet it has \ntaken a month to begin voting on the amendments. Republican leaders \nhave wasted weeks of the Senate's time directing this valuable jobs \nbill to extract purely political votes on unrelated matters, completely \nunrelated matters. Weeks were wasted on this vital legislation with an \niconic attack on women's health.\n  I suggest to the Republican leader who just left the floor, if it \ntakes more than a month to pass a noncontroversial, bipartisan bill \nthat is supported by almost 90 Senators, how can we ever expect to get \nanything more done?\n  We have to. We have much more to do. Americans are not satisfied with \nthe glacial pace of this body and neither am I. Americans are tired of \ndelay tactics and obstructions and so am I. People across the country \nand in this Chamber would write off this Congress and say we have done \nenough. I am not going to do that.\n  When we complete this legislation on the Transportation bill, we have \nother work to do. We have a score of judges who are waiting, some of \nwhom have been waiting since last year. We have to do something about \nthe post office. The Postal Service in America has changed. People \ndon't pay their bills the way they used to; they don't send letters the \nway they used to. We have to reorganize the post office. We have to do \nthat.\n  We had a demonstration in the classified briefing room to talk about \nwhat is going on in America and what could go on in America with \nbringing down our country. The demonstration last night dealt with \nelectricity, but it could be banking. It could be our hospitals. We \nhave to recognize that we now have new enemies in the world, not \nenemies who are flying airplanes and dropping bombs and shooting us \nwith bullets, but they are prepared to do something that is so damaging \nto our economy, and we were given that illustration last night.\n  We have a cybersecurity bill we have to bring to the floor, which is \nanother\n\n[[Page S1497]]\n\nbipartisan bill. Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins, an Independent \nand Republican, have acknowledged they want to bring this bill forward, \nand they have it done, so we will bring it to the floor. We have all \nour Appropriations bills, and we have to do those. So we have a lot to \ndo to accomplish even a fraction of our to-do list, and it is going to \ntake more cooperation and less conflict. Not everything has to be a \nknock-down, drag-out fight as it was on this highway bill. To think we \nwasted 3 weeks on a matter dealing with the health of women in America, \nbut we did. So we stand ready to work with our Republican colleagues.\n  The Republican leader mentioned the small business jobs bill. We have \nbeen trying to do one for a long time. We are going to do a small \nbusiness jobs bill. The House bill is not perfect. We are glad it is \nmoving forward, and we are going to try to do something here to match \nso we can get it to conference and get this done.\n  I am hopeful that when Democrats reach across the aisle, we will find \nwilling partners on the other side for a change.\n  I thank the Chair. I ask that the Chair announce the business of the \nday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/08/senate-section/article/S1497-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to join my colleagues \nto mark International Women's Day. This day, which across the globe is \ncelebrated in many different ways, is, at its core, a day to reflect on \nthe achievements of women in politics, business, and society. It is a \nday to reflect on what a woman's role was in the not-so-distant past \nand to celebrate how far we have come. But, unfortunately, on this \nInternational Women's Day in the year 2012, we cannot celebrate the \nprogress we have made without also acknowledging the unsettling truth \nthat that progress is under threat.\n  Today a shadow has been cast over this day of celebration by efforts \nto turn back the clock in Washington, DC, and across the country, \nefforts we all must fight against. Only 1 week ago in the Senate, we \nhad a debate on the ability for women across this country to access \ncontraceptives. It is a debate most women believed was settled half a \ncentury ago and one we had all hoped was in the past. However, in a \nscene that was eerily reminiscent of half a century ago, last week one \nwoman brave enough to come forward and give voice to the importance of \nbirth control was targeted. First, her story of a friend's battle with \novarian cancer was purposely left out of a House hearing on women's \nhealth. Then, as we have all heard, she was scorned and ridiculed by a \nrightwing pundit.\n  It was a galvanizing and eye-opening moment for millions of women in \nour country. It was a reminder that some still see women as easy \ntargets, and it awakened many women to the fact that the gains we are \nmeant to celebrate on a day such as today could easily be lost to \npolitical strategy that preys on women.\n  For many of those who watched the last few weeks play out, it may \nhave seemed an isolated incident. It could appear to some as a sudden \nand swift effort by some Republicans--who thankfully have been blocked \nfor the time being--but that is not case. The truth is, women's access \nto care has rarely been at greater risk. From the moment they came into \npower, the Republicans in the House of Representatives have been waging \na war on women's health.\n  If you don't believe me, look at the very first bills they introduced \nwhen they arrived. They campaigned across the country in the last \nelection on a platform of jobs and the economy, but the first three \nbills they introduced when they got here were direct attacks on women's \nhealth. The very first one, H.R. 1, would have totally eliminated title \nX funding for family planning and teen pregnancy prevention. The \namendment also included defunding Planned Parenthood and cutting off \nsupport for the millions of women who count on it. Another one of their \nbills would have permanently codified the Hyde amendment and the DC \nabortion ban.\n\n  Finally, they introduced a bill that would have rolled back every \nsingle one of the gains we made for women in the health care reform \nbill. That Republican bill would have removed the caps on out-of-pocket \nexpenses that literally protect women from losing their homes or their \nlife savings if they get sick. It would have ended the ban on lifetime \nlimits on coverage, which is so important to everyone. It would have \nallowed insurance companies to once again discriminate against women by \ncharging them higher premiums than men or even denying women care \nbecause of so-called preexisting conditions they had, such as \npregnancy. It would have rolled back the guarantee of insurance \ncompanies' coverage of contraceptives.\n  Republicans have shown they will go to just about any length to limit \naccess to women's care, even shutting down the Federal Government. That \nmay seem extreme to all, but that is exactly what happened 1 year ago \nwhen Republicans nearly shut down the Federal Government over a rider \nthat was yet another attempt to go after title X and Planned \nParenthood. I remember sitting in those meetings late at night, after \nmonths of negotiations over the numbers in the budget, astonished that \nRepublicans were willing to throw all those negotiations away over one \nissue, and that was their attack on women's health.\n  The attack on women's rights is not just taking place in the Nation's \nCapital. In State after State across the country, legislators bent on \nputting politics between women and their health care are undoing years \nof important work. A recently enacted law in Texas not only strips \nwomen of their rights but of their dignity. It is a law about which \nNicholas Kristof of the New York Times recently wrote a column.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the article written by Nicholas \nKristof, ``When States Abuse Women,'' printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. MURRAY. It is a law that all women across the country should be \ninsulted by and outraged over. Today, nearly 40 years after Roe v. Wade \nwas passed, a woman in Texas who seeks an abortion--one of the most \ndifficult choices a woman and her family can face--is not met with \ncompassion and care but with humiliation, and that is because they have \npassed a law by Republicans that she is now subjected, against her \nwill, to a vaginal ultrasound. Then she is instructed to listen to a \nfetal heartbeat, watch the ultrasound and numerous other State-mandated \nhurdles and then she has to go home and wait 24 hours before she can \naccess a health care procedure that was made a right for women four \ndecades ago.\n  One would think that after 2 years spent railing against any \ngovernment involvement in health care, Republicans would not want the \nState to dictate procedures a doctor must perform on a woman, whether \nshe wants them or not, but then you would be confused because, clearly, \nwhen it comes to women and their health care choices, these Republicans \nare willing to do whatever it takes for them to call the shots--not the \nwomen, not their doctors, not their families. The sad part is other \nStates across the country are now contemplating similar laws.\n  So the threats to women's health care are very real and they are \ngrowing. We saw it on a panel on contraceptives in the House that \ndidn't include a woman on the panel. We saw it in a young woman being \ncalled horrible names for telling the stories of a friend\n\n[[Page S1498]]\n\nin need. We see it in Republican efforts to allow an employer to \ndictate whether a woman has access to contraceptives, and we are seeing \nit in State laws across the country aimed at stripping women of their \nrights and more.\n  So on this International Women's Day, we celebrate our gains with the \nclear understanding that they must always be defended, and we join with \nwomen everywhere to make sure that progress is not reversed.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                   [The New York Times, Mar. 3, 2012]\n\n                        When States Abuse Women\n\n                        (By Nicholas D. Kristof)\n\n       Here's what a woman in Texas now faces if she seeks an \n     abortion.\n       Under a new law that took effect three weeks ago with the \n     strong backing of Gov. Rick Perry, she first must typically \n     endure an ultrasound probe inserted into her vagina. Then she \n     listens to the audio thumping of the fetal heartbeat and \n     watches the fetus on an ultrasound screen.\n       She must listen to a doctor explain the body parts and \n     internal organs of the fetus as they're shown on the monitor. \n     She signs a document saying that she understands all this, \n     and it is placed in her medical files. Finally, she goes home \n     and must wait 24 hours before returning to get the abortion.\n       ``It's state-sanctioned abuse,'' said Dr. Curtis Boyd, a \n     Texas physician who provides abortions. ``It borders on a \n     definition of rape. Many states describe rape as putting any \n     object into an orifice against a person's will. Well, that's \n     what this is. A woman is coerced to do this, just as I'm \n     coerced.''\n       ``The state of Texas is waging war on women and their \n     families,'' Dr. Boyd added. ``The new law is demeaning and \n     disrespectful to the women of Texas, and insulting to the \n     doctors and nurses who care for them.''\n       That law is part of a war over women's health being fought \n     around the country--and in much of the country, women are \n     losing. State by state, legislatures are creating new \n     obstacles to abortions and are treating women in ways that \n     are patronizing and humiliating.\n       Twenty states now require abortion providers to conduct \n     ultrasounds first in some situations, according to the \n     Guttmacher Institute, a research organization. The new Texas \n     law is the most extreme to take effect so far, but similar \n     laws have been passed in North Carolina and Oklahoma and are \n     on hold pending legal battles.\n       Alabama, Kentucky, Rhode Island and Mississippi are also \n     considering Texas-style legislation bordering on state-\n     sanctioned rape. And what else do you call it when states \n     mandate invasive probes in women's bodies?\n       ``If you look up the term rape, that's what it is: the \n     penetration of the vagina without the woman's consent,'' said \n     Linda Coleman, an Alabama state senator who is fighting the \n     proposal in her state. ``As a woman, I am livid and \n     outraged.''\n       States put in place a record number of new restrictions on \n     abortions last year, Guttmacher says. It counts 92 new curbs \n     in 24 states.\n       ``It was a debacle,'' Elizabeth Nash, who manages state \n     issues for Guttmacher, told me. ``It's been awful. Last year \n     was unbelievable. We've never seen anything like it.''\n       Yes, there have been a few victories for women. The \n     notorious Virginia proposal that would have required vaginal \n     ultrasounds before an abortion was modified to require only \n     abdominal ultrasounds.\n       Yet over all, the pattern has been retrograde: humiliating \n     obstacles to abortions, cuts in family-planning programs, and \n     limits on comprehensive sex education in schools.\n       If Texas legislators wanted to reduce abortions, the \n     obvious approach would be to reduce unwanted pregnancies. The \n     small proportion of women and girls who aren't using \n     contraceptives account for half of all abortions in America, \n     according to Guttmacher. Yet Texas has some of the weakest \n     sex-education programs in the nation, and last year it cut \n     spending for family planning by 66 percent.\n       The new Texas law was passed last year but was held up \n     because of a lawsuit by the Center for Reproductive Rights. \n     In a scathing opinion, Judge Sam Sparks of Federal District \n     Court described the law as ``an attempt by the Texas \n     legislature to discourage women from exercising their \n     constitutional rights.'' In the end, the courts upheld the \n     law, and it took effect last month.\n       It requires abortion providers to give women a list of \n     crisis pregnancy centers where, in theory, they can get \n     unbiased counseling and in some cases ultrasounds. In fact, \n     these centers are often set up to ensnare pregnant women and \n     shame them or hound them if they are considering abortions.\n       ``They are traps for women, set up by the state of Texas,'' \n     Dr. Boyd said.\n       The law then requires the physician to go over a \n     politicized list of so-called dangers of abortion, like ``the \n     risks of infection and hemorrhage'' and ``the possibility of \n     increased risk of breast cancer.'' Then there is the mandated \n     ultrasound, which in the first trimester normally means a \n     vaginal ultrasound. Doctors sometimes seek vaginal \n     ultrasounds before an abortion, with the patient's consent, \n     but it's different when the state forces women to undergo the \n     procedure.\n       The best formulation on this topic was Bill Clinton's, that \n     abortion should be ``safe, legal and rare.'' Achieving that \n     isn't easy, and there is no silver bullet to reduce unwanted \n     pregnancies. But family planning and comprehensive sex \n     education are a surer path than demeaning vulnerable women \n     with state-sanctioned abuse and humiliation.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Murray for her comments, \nand I concur in her observations. What we have seen on women's health \ncare issues in this body is how some are trying to turn the clock back \non the progress we have made. I was listening to my colleague talk \nabout ultrasounds. Virginia just enacted an ultrasound bill this week. \nThe Governor signed it into law, so this is spreading to other States. \nWe talk about big government, but the government mandating ultrasounds \nfor pregnant women? This is outrageous and something that on \nInternational Women's Day, it is right that we bring this to the \nattention of our colleagues. We have seen the same type of action taken \nagainst family planning, contraceptives, those who want to repeal Roe \nv. Wade. We have to stand strong with women and women's health care \nissues as we in America lead the international community.\n  Around the world, International Women's Day is an occasion to honor \nand praise women for their accomplishments. On this International \nWomen's Day, I stand with my colleagues to celebrate women who are \nmaking a difference both in America and around the world, in countries \nwhere they lead in the fight for justice, equality, and fairness for \nall women. All of us, women and men alike, can help by supporting \nwomen's efforts to claim their legal rights, live free from violence, \nearn a decent income, get an education, grow food for their families, \nand make their voices heard in their communities and beyond.\n  I believe in the power of women to change the world and to help them \nhasten that change. U.S. international assistance policies should \naddress and remove barriers between women, women's rights, and economic \nempowerment. Empowering women is one of the most critical tools in our \ntoolbox to fight poverty and injustice. Integrating the unique needs of \nwomen into our domestic and international policies is critical. As \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on International \nDevelopment and Foreign Assistance, Economic Affairs, and International \nEnvironmental Protection, I can attest that this must be the bedrock of \nour foreign assistance programming if it is to be successful.\n  I defy anyone's assertion that women's empowerment should take a \nbackseat to so-called more important priorities. Decades of research \nand experience prove that when women are able to be fully engaged in \nsociety and hold decisionmaking power, they are more likely to invest \ntheir income in food, clean water, education, and health care for their \nchildren. This creates a positive cycle change that lifts entire \nfamilies and communities and nations out of poverty. Simply put, when \nwomen succeed, we all do.\n  Accordingly, I was very pleased by last week's release of the new \nUSAID ``Policy on Gender Equality and Female Empowerment,'' which makes \nintegrating gender and including women and girls central to all U.S. \ninternational assistance. This policy, which updates guidelines that \nwere over 30 years old, recognizes that the integration of women and \ngirls is basic to effective international assistance across all sectors \nsuch as food, security, health, climate change, science, technology, \neconomic growth, democracy and governance and humanitarian assistance. \nIt aims to increase the capacity of women and girls and decrease \ninequality between genders and also decrease gender-based violence. \nThis new policy is as welcomed as it is necessary. As Secretary Clinton \ndeclared earlier this year:\n\n       Achieving our objectives for global development will demand \n     accelerated efforts to achieve gender equality and women's \n     empowerment. Otherwise, peace and prosperity will have their \n     own glass ceiling.\n\n  Unfortunately, as we know, there are still places this glass ceiling \nexists and there are major obstacles to women. Worldwide, one in three \nwomen will experience some form of violence in her\n\n[[Page S1499]]\n\nlifetime. Women and girls in emergencies, conflict settings, and \nnatural disasters often face extreme violence, including being forced \nto exchange sex for food. The World Health Organization has reported \nthat up to 70 percent of women in some countries describe having been \nvictims of domestic violence at some stage in their lives.\n  The United States has the potential to be a true leader in preventing \nand responding to violence against women and girls--an issue that is \ninextricably linked to U.S. diplomacy, development, and national \nsecurity goals.\n  What many people fail to realize is that violence against women and \ngirls is both a major consequence and cause of poverty. Violence and \npoverty go hand in hand. Violence prevents women and girls from getting \nan education, going to work, and earning the income they need to lift \ntheir families out of poverty. We know that one in three women will be \nthe victim of sexual abuse in her lifetime. But we also know that women \nhave the potential to lift their families and communities out of \npoverty.\n  Violence against women and girls is an extreme human rights \nviolation, a public health epidemic, and a barrier to solving severe \nchallenges such as extreme poverty, HIV/AIDS, and conflict. It \ndevastates the lives of millions of women and girls--in peacetime and \nin conflict--and knows no national and cultural barriers.\n  Today let's reaffirm our commitment to end gender-based \ndiscrimination in all forms, to end violence against women and girls \nworldwide, and to encourage the people of the United States to observe \nInternational Women's Day. On this day and every day, I am proud to \nstand in support of women across America and worldwide.\n  Investing in and focusing on empowering women and girls is one of the \nmost efficient uses of our foreign assistance dollars and one of the \nbest ways to make the world more peaceful and prosperous. As Secretary \nof State Clinton pointed out more than 15 years ago, ``Women's rights \nare human rights''--and nothing is more fundamental, in my opinion.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my colleagues \nSenator Cardin and, earlier, Senator Murray this morning in \ncommemorating International Women's Day. It is a day observed around \nthe world, and it celebrates the economic, political, and social \nachievement of women--past, present, and future. It is a day that \nrecognizes the obstacles women still face in the struggle for equal \nrights and equal opportunities.\n  One year ago today, I, along with a group of bipartisan Senators, \nintroduced and passed a resolution in the Senate recognizing the \nsignificance of the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day. \nToday is the 101st anniversary and, as is the centennial milestone \nbefore it, it is a testament to the dedication and determination of \nwomen and men around the world to address gender inequality for the \ngood of all people.\n  There are more than 3.3 billion women in the world today. Across the \nglobe, women are participating in the political, social, and economic \nlife of their communities in an unprecedented fashion, playing a \ncritical role in providing and caring for their families, contributing \nsubstantially to the growth of economies, and advancing food security \nfor their communities.\n  Yesterday I had the wonderful, humbling, and inspiring opportunity to \nrecognize and celebrate the 10 recipients of the 2012 State Department \nInternational Women of Courage Award. This prestigious award, which is \nthe only award in the State Department given only to women, annually \nrecognizes women who have shown exceptional courage and leadership in \nadvocating for women's rights and empowerment around the globe, often \nat significant risk to themselves. These award winners, including \nactivists in the Sudan and Saudi Arabia, politicians in Turkey and \nAfghanistan, and representatives from six other countries, are truly \nremarkable and inspirational women.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have all of their names and brief bios \nprinted in the Record so that they are properly recognized by the \nSenate.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Afghanistan\n\n       Maryam Durani--Director, Khadija Kubra Women's Association \n     for Culture, Kandahar Provincial Council Member.\n       Award Citation: ``For striving to give a voice to women \n     through the power of the media, government, and civil \n     society, despite innumerable security and societal \n     challenges.''\n       Bio: Kandahar Province is among Afghanistan's most \n     conservative and most dangerous--but that has not stopped \n     Maryam Durani from speaking out for the rights of Afghan \n     women and girls. As a member of Kandahar's Provincial \n     Council, director of the non-profit Khadija Kubra Women's \n     Association for Culture, and owner and manager of the only \n     local, female-focused radio station, she is both a leader and \n     a role model for women throughout Afghanistan. A true woman \n     of courage, Ms. Durani has survived multiple attacks on her \n     life, including a suicide attack in 2009 that resulted in \n     serious injury. Although she continues to face regular \n     threats, she is undeterred in her mission to promote basic \n     civil rights for all Afghans.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                 Brazil\n\n       Major Pricilla de Oliveira Azevedo--General Coordinator for \n     Strategic Programs, Rio de Janeiro State Secretariat of \n     Public Security, and Major of Rio State Military Police.\n       Award Citation: ``For courageous and dedicated service to \n     Rio State's innovative ``Favela Pacification Program'' as the \n     first female commander of a Pacification Police Unit \n     (community police station), and as coordinator of UPPs in the \n     State Security Secretariat, where she is integrating \n     previously marginalized populations into the larger Rio de \n     Janeiro community.''\n       Bio: Pricilla de Oliveira Azevedo is a military police \n     officer, currently working as General Coordinator of \n     Strategic Programs for the ``Police Pacification Units'' \n     (UPPs), Rio de Janeiro State Secretariat of Public Security's \n     renowned ``favela'' (slum) pacification program. Major \n     Azevedo joined the Rio de Janeiro Military police in 1998 \n     and, following her graduation in 2000, started working in \n     police battalions and street repression operations. In 2007, \n     Major Azevedo demonstrated extreme courage and commitment to \n     her duties by successfully arresting a gang of criminals who \n     had kidnapped her.\n       As a result of her courage and success, the Rio de Janeiro \n     State Secretary for Security invited her to head the first \n     UPP in Rio de Janeiro, in the ``favela'' of Santa Marta, a \n     position she occupied between 2008 to 2010. In this capacity, \n     she commanded 125 military police officers in an area with \n     9,000 inhabitants and a very low human development index. \n     During her two years in Santa Marta, Major Azevedo shut down \n     drug dealing operations in the favela, established conflict \n     mediation models, worked with state and local government \n     institutions to improve garbage collection and health care, \n     broadened education and technical training opportunities, and \n     developed a successful community arts and crafts fair.\n       In 2009, Rio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Paes invited Major \n     Pricilla to become a member of the Brazilian delegation in \n     the 2016 Olympics Announcement in Copenhagen. In the same \n     year she completed training on Koban community policing \n     techniques, and participated in a citizen safety training in \n     Israel. Major Azevedo is currently completing her law degree \n     in Estacio de Sa University.\n       Major Azevedo is the most senior female officer in the UPP \n     program, and the first woman to occupy a strategic position \n     in the Rio de Janeiro State Secretariat of Security's \n     Superintendence of Operational Planning. She has received \n     honor awards from the city councils of Rio de Janeiro, Tangua \n     and Itaborai. She is also a recipient of the United Nations \n     Brazilian Force's 50th Anniversary Medal.

In \n     2000, she began to uncover an arms smuggling network between \n     government security forces and imprisoned paramilitaries in a \n     maximum security prison. On May 25, 2000, as she arrived at \n     the prison to interview a key paramilitary member, unknown \n     men grabbed Jineth, threw her into a vehicle, drugged her, \n     and drove her to a farm several hours outside Bogota. There, \n     the men repeatedly raped her, bound her, and left her in a \n     garbage dump at the side of a road where a taxi driver \n     discovered her later that evening. As the men raped her, they \n     told her, ``Pay attention. We are sending a message to the \n     press in Colombia.'' Since this horrifying incident nearly 12 \n     years ago, Jineth has continued her work as an investigative \n     journalist while pushing for justice in her own case and \n     other unsolved cases of sexual violence. Jineth has become an \n     inspiration not only for female journalists, but for all \n     women who are demanding justice in their own cases.

While serving as \n     Deputy Minister of Women's Affairs, Ms. Ahmed raised the \n     issue of domestic violence at a time when the subject was \n     taboo in Maldives. As a member of the National Women's \n     Council, she held focus group discussions and worked with a \n     local NGO to produce a series of short documentary films on \n     domestic violence that had a profound impact on altering \n     public views of domestic violence. In 2009, Ms. Ahmed played \n     an instrumental role in organizing a coalition of NGOs and \n     individuals who are advocating pioneering legislation on \n     domestic violence that is currently before the Maldivian \n     parliament. After leaving government service, she founded the \n     NGO ``Hope for Women'' and began conducting interactive \n     sessions on gender-based violence with high school students, \n     Maldives Police Services, and other frontline workers. When \n     religious scholars began identifying female circumcision as a \n     Sunnah in Islam on national radio, Ms. Ahmed asked the \n     government to intervene, and gave an interview to a local \n     news channel about the harmful effects of female \n     circumcision.

This morning I wish to pick just one of these amazing \nwomen and tell her story.\n  Shad Begum is the executive director of the Union of Women's Welfare \nin one of the most extremely conservative districts in all of Pakistan. \nAs the founder and executive director of the program the Union of \nWomen's Welfare, she provides political training, microcredit, primary \neducation, and health services to women throughout her community. She \nnot only encouraged others to run for office, she herself ran for a \ndistrict counselor seat in 2001 and 2005, winning the seat against \nlocal conservatives who tried to ban\n\n[[Page S1501]]\n\nwomen from participating. Despite numerous threats to her life and her \nfamily, including calls for suicide attacks against her by local \nextremists, she continues to work to improve the lives of women \nthroughout Pakistan.\n  Ms. Shad is one of 10 remarkable women the State Department honored \nthis year. Every one of these 10 stories is inspirational, but they \nalso represent literally millions of women around the globe who are out \nthere fighting and suffering to be heard. There are countless women who \ndon't receive the recognition they deserve and who continue to be \nsilenced by persecution and harassment. Today we recognize, honor, and \ncelebrate all of those nameless, faceless women around the world who \nare continuing the fight.\n  Far too many women remain excluded from full participation in \nsociety, to the detriment of their communities, their countries, and \nthe world. Although strides have been made in recent decades, women \nacross the globe continue to face significant obstacles in all aspects \nof their lives, including the denial of basic human rights, \ndiscrimination, and gender-based violence. According to the World Bank, \nwomen make up 70 percent of all individuals living in poverty. Women \naccount for 64 percent of the adults worldwide who lack basic literacy \nskills. Women continue to remain vastly underrepresented in national \nand local governments around the world.\n  So there is no doubt that we have a lot of work to do, but all of \nsociety benefits when women are more fully integrated into their \ncommunities and their villages around the world. In the words of \nPresident Obama, ``Our common prosperity will be advanced by allowing \nall humanity--men and women--to reach their full potential.''\n  As we reflect on the past, present, and future achievements of women, \nI believe it is important to recognize the vital and untapped resource \nthat women represent for our world. The ability of women to realize \ntheir full potential is critical to the ability of a nation to achieve \nstrong and lasting economic growth, political and social stability, and \nenhanced security for all its people.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.

Mr. President, I am proud to stand here today on \nInternational Women's Day, the 8th day of March, 2012, to pay tribute \nto women around the world but also to acknowledge that women around the \nworld, on Monday, March 12, will celebrate the 100th anniversary of the \nfounding of the Girl Scouts of America, founded in Savannah, GA, a \nbeautiful town, by a wonderful Georgia lady, Juliette Gordon Low. Girl \nScouts around the world will be celebrating the founding of that great \norganization, which has had a positive effect on women around the \nworld.\n  Each of us right now is well aware of the Girl Scouts because of \nboxes like this box the Acting President pro tempore gave me permission \nto display, which is what is left of a box of Thin Mints. The Girl \nScouts sell boxes of cookies this time of year to raise money for their \noperations around the world. I eat far too many of them. They are good. \nThey are good for me, they are good for America, and they are good for \nthe Girl Scouts and the fundraising they do.\n  The Girl Scouts is an organization of leadership, developing women \nfor the future. While only 17 percent of this body are women, almost \nall of them were Girl Scouts. Almost all women of business were Girl \nScouts. And almost all women who were in Girl Scouts pay tribute to the \nGirl Scouts of America and the contribution they have made to their \nlives. There are 3.2 million active Girl Scouts in America today, and \nthere are 50 million Girl Scout alumni in America. That has a \ntremendous impact on all that is right about America.\n  The Girl Scouts have been pacesetters. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a \nnative of my city of Atlanta and a native of our State that Juliette \nLow was from, cited the Girl Scouts of America as ``a force for \ndesegregation'' during the troubled times of the 1950s and 1960s. The \nGirl Scouts were at the forefront of integration and leadership for \nyouth.\n  The Girl Scouts of America also pledge themselves and they make a \npromise, which I would like to read.\n\n     On my honor, I will try:\n     To serve God and my country,\n     To help people at all times,\n     And to live by the Girl Scout law.\n\n  Which reads:\n\n     I will do my best to be\n     honest and fair,\n     friendly and helpful,\n     considerate and caring,\n     courageous and strong, and\n     responsible for what I say and do,\n     and to respect myself and others,\n     respect authority,\n     use resources wisely,\n     make the world a better place, and\n     be a sister to every Girl Scout.\n\n  That is not a motto just for the Girl Scouts but one that would serve \nus all well in this body.\n  So on this International Women's Day on March 8, I would like to \nacknowledge that on Monday, when we are not here, around the world \nwomen will celebrate the founding of the Girl Scouts of America, and \nthe 3.2 million Girl Scouts in America today will be building for the \nfuture the Acting President pro tempore and I work for today in this \nbody, the U.S. Senate.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, later today I will be down on the floor to \noffer a budget point of order on the highway bill. I have been down \nhere several times over the course of the last several days.\n  I think most in this body--a large majority of people in this body--\nhave been a part of encouraging us to, in a very bipartisan way, solve \nthe budget problems we have in this country. There were 64 of us--32 on \neach side of the aisle--who signed a letter to the President \nencouraging him to really adopt some of the principles that were laid \nout in Bowles-Simpson. After that, there was a very large number of \nSenators on both sides of the aisle who signed a letter to the \nsupercommittee asking them to go big and really deal in a serious way \nwith the budget issues, the deficit issues with which our country is \ndealing.\n  I have been down here multiple times talking about the various \noddities in this bill. What is getting ready to happen in this bill is \nthat we are actually, over the next 2 years, going to create a $10 \nbillion to $11 billion deficit. Because of the various gimmickry we \nuse, we are figuring out ways to get around that. One of the budget \ngimmicks we are using in the bill is that we are going to spend the \nmoney over a 2-year period but pay for it over a 10-year period--2 \nyears worth of spending, 10 years worth of revenues.\n  I think the Acting President pro tempore was here during the period \nof time we had the health care debate in our Nation, and many of the \nfolks on my side of the aisle, rightfully so, were concerned about the \nhealth care bill because there were 6 years' worth of costs and 10 \nyears' worth of revenues, and a lot of people thought that was a budget \ngimmick. Candidly, many of my friends on the other side of the aisle, \nwhile they may have supported the\n\n[[Page S1502]]\n\nbill, were also concerned about those same types of gimmicks being used \nin the health care bill, and it caused them concern.\n  My point is, in a bipartisan way, we have tried to deal with our \nbudget deficits in this country. I notice the Senator from Illinois \njust stepped on the floor. He has been a major player in those \ninitiatives. What we did last year was we passed something called the \nBudget Control Act. We did so in order to raise the debt ceiling and to \naccomplish discipline in this body so that over the next 2 years we \nestablished overall caps on spending.\n  This bill, believe it or not--here we are in March, with a very \npopular bill, which speaks to the fact, to me, that it is the kind of \nbill that many of us would think, if you really want to pass a highway \nbill, you would prioritize it higher than other spending, that it is \nthe kind of situation that, in a bipartisan way, we would come together \nand say: OK, we really want to see infrastructure spending in this \ncountry, so let's make this of higher priority than other spending.\n\n  That is not what we are doing. Believe it or not, this Senate--which \nhas talked big about deficit spending, written lots of letters, had \nlots of meetings--what this Senate is getting ready to do with this \nbill is violate the Budget Control Act that we passed last year trying \nto show the American people we had at least a modicum of discipline.\n  Let me say it one more time. This highway bill, in March of this \nyear--I think we passed the Budget Control Act last August, in the \nearly part of August, to demonstrate to the American people that this \nSenate, this Congress had the discipline to put caps on spending over \nthe next 2 years to begin the process of addressing deficit reduction. \nWhat we are going to do, if we pass this highway bill, as laid out, is \nviolate that budget cap right now.\n  I want everybody in this body to know that I plan to offer a budget \npoint of order. I hope at least all of those 64 Senators--32 on each \nside--would join me in opposing breaking the Budget Control Act we just \nput in place in an effort to demonstrate to the American people and, \ncandidly, to the world that buys our Treasury bonds that we have the \nability, the discipline to deal with the fiscal issues we have in our \nNation.\n  Mr. President, I know we have the distinguished Senator from Texas in \nthe Chamber, who was to speak exactly right now. I yield the floor and \nthank the Acting President pro tempore for the time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to express my concerns \non behalf of the 26 million constituents I have in Texas about the \nrising gas prices and the administration's failure to take reasonable \nand rational and practical steps to help ease the pain Americans are \nfeeling at the gas pump.\n  Just think about it. We know unemployment is unacceptably high and \nintractable, notwithstanding our private sector economy's best efforts \nto grow and to create jobs. So we know people are out of work. We know \nmany of them are unable to pay their mortgages and are literally losing \ntheir homes to foreclosure. Those who are fortunate enough to have jobs \nare experiencing higher prices when it comes to food, when it comes to \nhealth care, notwithstanding the passage of the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act, of which the President said the average family \nwould save $2,500 in health care premiums. Last year alone, there was \nalmost a double-digit increase in the cost of health care for most \nAmerican families.\n  Now, to add insult to injury, we have higher gas prices, which are \ncrowding out other spending and lowering the standard of living for \nAmerican families who are struggling with the slow economic recovery we \nare experiencing.\n  The average price of gasoline in the United States has more than \ndoubled since the week of the inauguration of President Obama in \nJanuary 2009. In January 2009 a gallon of regular gas was $1.89. Today \nit averages $3.79 a gallon. The Associated Press reports that the \naverage American household spent $4,155 filling up at the pump in 2011. \nThat is the annual cost of gasoline for a typical U.S. household.\n  I remember arguments--passionate arguments--about the payroll tax \nholiday and the President holding press conference after press \nconference saying, if we would just pass the payroll tax holiday, then \nfamilies would have $40 more a month spending money in their pockets. \nWell, higher gas prices have wiped that out and more.\n  Gasoline costs now amount to 8.4 percent of the median household \nincome--8.4 percent. I am not telling anybody something they do not \nalready know and they have not already felt, that they have not already \nexperienced. Everyone has experienced the higher prices. This is the \nhighest price for gasoline since 1981 when costs soared because of \nanother crisis in the Middle East.\n  Weeks ago President Obama said there is very little he could do about \nhigh gas prices in the short term. I tell you, it is good he made those \ncomments in Miami, FL, and not Midland, TX, because Texans know that \ngreater domestic energy production would help reduce oil prices and, \ntherefore, reduce gasoline prices. Roughly 70 percent of the price of \ngasoline is the price of oil from which gasoline is refined. You know, \nsometimes I feel as though in Washington, DC, we are operating in a \nparallel universe that has very little in common with the rest of the \ncountry. And here it is--not to mix my metaphors--ships passing in the \nnight. But the fact is, the laws of supply and demand cannot be \nsuspended by the Congress or the President of the United States. \nPresident Obama used to agree with that.\n  Last March, for example, he said producing more oil in America would \nhelp lower oil prices. Well, lipservice will not produce lower oil \nprices, but, yes, producing more oil will because the greater the \nsupply--we know the laws of economics say, demand being the same, \ngreater supply will lower prices. The fact is, there is greater demand \nall around the world, not just in the United States, as economies are \ngrowing in China, in India, and Brazil and places such as that.\n  To add insult to injury, this administration has adopted policies \nthat have directly conflicted with the goal of lowering oil and \ngasoline prices. I do not know how to reach any other conclusion but to \nsay it appears to me that the administration has intentionally enacted \npolicies that will raise gasoline prices. I know they will deny that. \nThey will say it is not true. But I do not know any other explanation.\n  Let me provide the evidence that leads me to that conclusion and \nperhaps you will agree. Today we learned that President Obama has been \nbusy calling Senators on the other side of the aisle and asking them to \nvote against an amendment being offered by Senator Hoeven of North \nDakota that would allow the Keystone XL Pipeline project to move \nforward--the President, on the phone calling Senators saying: Vote \nagainst the Keystone XL Pipeline amendment offered by Senator Hoeven.\n  The President has previously said there is not a single morning he \nwakes up that he does not think about creating jobs. But, apparently, \nhe woke up today thinking about how to lobby against jobs because the \nKeystone Pipeline, in addition to providing an additional supply of \ncrude oil from the tar sands in Canada that would be transported to the \nUnited States, would be turned into gasoline in places such as Port \nArthur, TX--apparently, the President got up and thought: How can I \nobstruct additional supply? How can I destroy the jobs that would be \ncreated, which is directly contrary to what he professed he does when \nhe wakes up each morning thinking about how to create new jobs.\n  The Keystone XL Pipeline is a $7 billion private investment that will \ncreate 20,000 jobs in construction and manufacturing alone. It will add \ntens of thousands of additional jobs throughout the economy in other \nsectors that will support the pipeline construction.\n  This is kind of personal for me and my constituents in Texas because \nwe\n\n[[Page S1503]]\n\nare an energy-producing State. We actually think that is good because \nit has created a lot of jobs. It has allowed us to weather this \nrecession. People have voted with their feet, and they have moved from \nother parts of the country to Texas because that is where the jobs are \nso they can provide for their families and they can try to achieve the \nAmerican dream.\n  Texas as a whole provides more than one-quarter of America's total \nrefining capacity. Last month, when the subject of the Keystone \nPipeline was very much in the news, I visited with a number of refinery \nworkers in Port Arthur, TX, who expressed concern about the future of \ntheir livelihood. These constituents of mine in Port Arthur, TX, could \ncare less about the politics in Washington, DC--who wins, who loses, \nthe sort of stuff that seems to facilitate an obsession inside the \nbeltway. But they were particularly upset--not just Republicans but \nDemocrats, Independents, unaffiliated folks. They were particularly \nupset with the Obama administration's rejection of the permit for the \nKeystone XL Pipeline which, as I said, would terminate in the Port \nArthur region and allow our State to refine an extra 700,000 barrels of \noil each day and turn it into gasoline and other refined products that \nwould increase the supply and thus, according to the laws of economics, \nhave a tendency to bring prices down as we increase supply.\n  President Obama's behind-the-scenes maneuvers, this crusade, is the \nstarkest reminder yet. He is the only thing standing between this \ncountry and more jobs and energy security. I regret to reach that \nconclusion, but I do not know of any other reasonable conclusion to \nraise.\n  Rather than asking Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries to produce \nmore oil in a region where our troops have been deployed for 10 years \nor more, is it any coincidence that in the oil-producing regions of the \nworld that we depend upon for oil, where our American troops have \nfought and some have made the ultimate sacrifice to protect our \ncountry, to protect our economy, to protect our way of life, that there \nhave been some in this Chamber who have suggested we ought to go, hat \nin hand, to Saudi Arabia, and say: Will you please open the spigot a \nlittle wider? Will you please supply us more oil so we do not have to \ndo it in America? You can do it for us, and we can buy it from you.\n  Well, I believe this administration should work closely with our \npartners in Canada, a friendly country where we do not have to worry \nabout a disruption of supply because if the Iranian threat to block the \nStrait of Hormuz comes to pass, 20 percent of the world's oil supply \npasses through the Strait of Hormuz. You know what that would do to \nprices, not to mention other consequences which are entirely negative.\n\n  Canada is a reliable and geographically secure trading partner. Their \noil exports are insulated from the potential supply disruptions in the \nMiddle East. Rather than demonizing oil and gas companies that employ \nmillions of hard-working Americans, while wagering more taxpayer \ndollars on boondoggles such as Solyndra, the Obama administration \nshould take its regulatory boot off the necks of our domestic energy \nproducers.\n  As I said, this is personal for me and my constituents because Texans \nare proud that our State remains the leading U.S. producer of oil and \ngas. As I stated, it is what has helped us grow and create an awful lot \nof jobs for which people are grateful. We know for a scientific fact \nthat America has just begun to tap the potential of its vast resources. \nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, our country has more \nrecoverable energy resources than Canada, China, and Saudi Arabia \ncombined.\n  As American Enterprise Institute scholar Kenneth Green has noted, the \nOuter Continental Shelf of the United States alone contains enough oil \nto fuel 85 million cars for 35 years. Yet more than 97 percent of that \nterritory is not under lease as a result of Obama administration \npolicies. Expanding access to Federal onshore and offshore lands, \neliminating permit delays in the issuance of leases could help reduce \npolices and strengthen our energy security while creating jobs and \nboosting revenue to the local, State, and Federal Government that would \nhelp us close our budget gap.\n  Unfortunately, the Obama administration's proposed offshore oil and \nnatural gas leasing plan for 2012 to 2017 eliminates--eliminates--50 \npercent of lease sales provided for in the previous plan and imposes a \nmoratorium on developing energy from 14 billion barrels of oil and 55 \ntrillion cubic feet of natural gas in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. \nThe moratorium on the natural resource rich Gulf of Mexico and \npersistent delays in permits for shallow and deepwater leases could \nresult in a 19-percent decrease in production in 2012--a 19-percent \ndecrease in production.\n  So we are not only talking about keeping the production static, we \nare talking about actually decreasing supply as a result of Federal \nadministration policies. Decreasing supply will have the inevitable \neffect of raising gasoline prices as that happens, and then there is \nthe regulatory impact. Everywhere I go in my State, and as I talk to \npeople around the country--they come to visit us in the Capitol. If \nthey are in the private sector, they say the biggest threat to their \nability to start a new business or grow existing businesses and create \njobs is regulatory overreach.\n  We know during the last election the voters gave us divided \ngovernment. They made it harder for the Obama administration to single-\nhandedly pass policies such as the President's health care bill, such \nas the stimulus, such as Dodd-Frank on a partisan basis. So we got \ndivided government. What we did not get is an ability to stop the \nregulatory overreach of executive branch agencies.\n  If the President is serious about looking for every single area that \nwe can make an impact on gas prices, as he pledged in Miami, he must \nreverse the regulatory overreach of the last 3 years. The U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce reports that the Environmental Protection Agency alone is \nmoving forward with 31 major economic rules and 172 major policy \nchanges. That is not something Congress is legislating. That is what \nthe EPA is doing on its own because they are an executive branch \nadministrative agency. But they are going to have a negative impact on \nour energy supply. The Chamber of Commerce rightly calls this an \nunprecedented level of regulatory action. It has a chilling effect not \nonly on energy production, it has a chilling effect on jobs, something \nwe need more than anything else as our economy struggles to recover.\n  Even as gas prices have approached $4 a gallon, the Environmental \nProtection Agency has proposed a tier 3 rule to cut air emissions from \nfuels in light-duty vehicles. This rule alone would force refiners of \noil to gasoline to make dramatic changes in the way they do business.\n  A recent study concluded the rule would increase the cost of \nmanufacturing gasoline by 12 to 25 cents per gallon. So as high as they \nare now, once this rule goes into effect, the price we pay at the pump \ncould go from 12 to 25 cents higher.\n  It could also inflate the refiners' operating costs by $5 billion to \n$13 billion annually and lead to a 7- to 14-percent reduction in gas \nsupplies from U.S. refineries and force as many as seven U.S. \nrefineries to shut down.\n  We have already seen recent reports of a number of refineries on the \nEast Coast that produce gasoline in America shutting down because they \ncannot do business economically under this regulatory burden. Beyond \nthe tier 3 rule, the American energy producers are deeply worried about \nthe EPA's proposed greenhouse gas regulations which will serve as an \nenergy tax on consumers. They are also worried, as if that wasn't \nenough, about the agency's new source performance standards and its \nboiler maximum achievable control technology rule.\n  I know a lot of this sounds arcane and is not something people talk \nabout over the kitchen table. But each one of these cumulatively have \nhad a negative impact on the gasoline prices that are directly harming \nAmerican families in their pocketbooks, lowering their standard of \nliving and making it harder to get by even as they struggle with the \nslow economic recovery.\n  Collectively, if we were to have a moratorium on these regulations at \nleast until we begin to see unemployment come down and the economy\n\n[[Page S1504]]\n\ngrow, gas prices come down--collectively, these regulations will put \nmore U.S. refineries out of business and will lead to ever higher \ngasoline prices at the pump. Conversely, if we were to have a temporary \nmoratorium, it would provide much needed relief to hard-working \nAmerican families.\n  If that weren't enough, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been \nvery active as well. I mentioned Midland, TX, which is part of the \nhistoric Permian Basin, which is a huge source of oil and gas \nproduction. Thanks to new technology and innovation, it is experiencing \na second boom and creating lots of jobs and a lot of American energy. \nWhat a surprise it was when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \nannounced its intention to list the sand dune lizard--a 5-inch lizard \nin the Permian Basin--as an endangered species without adequate \ninvestigation of the science. It threatened the jobs of nearly 27,000 \nTexans in the Permian Basin, which is home to more than one-fifth of \nthe top 100 oilfields in America.\n  Looking at all of the evidence on energy prices, it is hard to come \nto any conclusion other than that higher energy prices are part of \nPresident Obama's plan. He talks about green energy and green jobs. \nThose are great, but they only supply a low single-digit percentage of \nour energy needs. We have to produce American energy, our oil and gas \nreserves.\n  President Obama's policies have intentionally elevated the price of \ngasoline to the detriment of the American consumer. One of the things \nwe can do is pass this Keystone XL Pipeline amendment. It will \neventually provide 700,000 barrels a day of oil from Canada to be \nrefined in America, creating jobs and creating more supply, which will \nhave a beneficial impact on gasoline prices, notwithstanding the other \npolicies I have mentioned this morning.\n  I hope my colleagues will support Senator Hoeven's amendment. I \ncertainly will. I would love to hear the contrary argument. \nUnfortunately, we hear nothing but crickets when we start talking about \nall of the beneficial effects of this policy.\n  I invite my colleagues who might not come from an energy-producing \nState to go on the Internet and Google or use Bing or whatever search \nengine they use and type in ``U.S. oil and gas pipelines'' and look at \nthe picture that comes up. They will be astonished, perhaps, to see all \nof the pipelines that are operating safely, without the public knowing \nabout it, providing the oil and gas and other refined products we need \nin order to keep our economy growing. This pipeline is not a threat to \nthe environment because we have adequate safeguards in place, and have \nfor a long time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/08/senate-section/article/S1504-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 1813, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1813) to reauthorize Federal-aid highway and \n     highway safety construction programs, and for other purposes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will follow up on the comments of the \nSenator from Texas on an issue that we will be voting on this \nafternoon, I understand, regarding the construction of the so-called \nKeystone Pipeline.\n  I have been somewhat frustrated by the debate around this issue. \nUnfortunately, I think we are going to be confronted again with kind of \na bifurcated choice that doesn't get to the possibility of us actually \nputting into place a comprehensive energy policy that will remove this \nNation's dependence upon foreign oil and start to look at the ability \nover the longer haul to bring down the price at the pump and make sure \nwe are truly a participant in the opportunities of a glowing, \nmultifaceted energy policy going forward.\n  I support the construction of the Keystone Pipeline. I believe we \nneed to have an energy policy that has an ``all-of-the-above'' \napproach. I do believe there are appropriate regulatory reviews that \nneed to be made. I also, frankly, think any construction of the \nKeystone Pipeline should take into consideration the very serious \nenvironmental considerations that particularly affect the State of \nNebraska, and there will need to be a route for this pipeline that \nwould avoid that potential environmental damage.\n  However, because of the way this process is being laid out, I will \nnot be voting for the Keystone amendment today because by making this a \nstraight up-or-down issue, without taking advantage of the opportunity \nto put together the beginnings of an energy package, we are missing a \ngreat opportunity.\n  As I have mentioned, if we are truly serious about energy security, \nand if we are truly serious about reducing our dependence upon foreign \noil, I believe we need an energy policy that has an ``all-of-the-\nabove'' approach. Yes, that means more domestic oil and gas. But it \nmeans when we have an opportunity in an issue of controversy such as \nthis regarding Keystone, we could have taken this opportunity to \ninclude a rational approach with appropriate environmental reviews to \nget to, I believe, a positive answer on Keystone but also link that \nwith other energy policies that would make sense.\n  I know the Presiding Officer has in his State a number of wind \nfacilities and solar facilities. Unfortunately, those areas that need, \nas well, to be part of our energy mix--the tax treatment that allows \nthose projects to move forward have been put in limbo because of the \nfailure of Congress to extend the so-called tax provisions, or tax \nextenders, on a going-forward basis. Wind projects all across the \ncountry--in fact, I was visiting with some folks right before coming to \nthe floor, and they have a variety of wind projects that are stopped \ndead in their tracks because of the uncertainty regarding whether \nCongress will act.\n\n  The ability to get the Keystone Pipeline passed, in combination with \npassing, as well, the extension of these appropriate renewable energy \ntax credits could have built the kind of bipartisan consensus around \nenergy policy that would be needed. I also believe the lowest hanging \nfruit in terms of how we save and can have a rational energy policy in \nthis country means a much greater involvement with energy conservation. \nThere is a very strong bipartisan energy conservation bill, the \nShaheen-Portman bill, that could have been included in this package as \nwell.\n  I think if we are going to get serious about reducing our dependence \nupon foreign oil, if we are going to make sure we give the American \ntaxpayers a vision that in the future we are going to see the ability \nto reduce our dependence upon foreign oil that results in higher gas \nprices, we actually could have put together around this Keystone \nproposal a true compromise, a bipartisan consensus that would have \nincluded construction of Keystone, with the appropriate environmental \nreviews, with making sure those key areas of Nebraska are protected, \nwith the inclusion of the energy tax cuts and provisions that we do on \nan annual basis, and that we continue to allow wind, solar, and other \nrenewable energy production to continue, and a meaningful energy \nconservation bill--the Shaheen-Portman bill.\n  I believe those three policies linked together would have resulted in \na vote that would have been overwhelmingly bipartisan and would have \nbeen a demonstration to the American people that we are going to get \nout of our respective fox holes and put the beginnings of a truly \ncomprehensive energy policy in place.\n  Unfortunately, I don't think we are going to have that happen. We are \ngoing to have a straight up-or-down vote on Keystone that dismisses any \nof the appropriate review processes and doesn't bring in the issues \naround the so-called energy tax extenders or the conservation \nbipartisan legislation that was put together by Senator Shaheen and \nSenator Portman. Instead of getting a more comprehensive vote this \nafternoon, which I believe would have passed overwhelmingly, we are \ngoing to end up with one more vote that will, for the most part, break \ndown on partisan lines. I am disappointed in that.\n  I do believe we need construction of the Keystone Pipeline. I believe \nwe need meaningful energy conservation legislation and meaningful tax \npolicy that promotes renewable energy\n\n[[Page S1505]]\n\naround solar, wind, and biomass. Unfortunately, we are going to miss \nthe opportunity today to send that strong signal of a comprehensive \n``all-of-the-above'' energy policy that would actually move this Nation \nforward.\n  I know my friend, the Senator from Texas, is no longer here. I would \nhave loved to have been able to support a comprehensive package that \nwould have allowed the Keystone effort to move forward in conjunction \nwith these other efforts. Unfortunately, that will not happen. Perhaps \nlater in the year we will have the ability to cobble together something \nthat includes more of an ``all-of-the-above'' energy policy and we can \nactually get about the business of making sure we have a national \nenergy policy.\n  But there is no silver bullet. We were going to need to make sure we \ntake advantage of all of the energy resources we have in this country--\noil, gas, offshore oil, nuclear, and appropriate revenue sharing with \nStates--such as my State of Virginia--and energy conservation and \nrenewables as well. The sooner we get to that debate, the sooner we can \nbuild the bipartisan coalitions that will allow that kind of policy to \nmove forward.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1535\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 1535 which is \nat the desk, and I ask it be reported by number.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1535.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide for an extension of the Draft Proposed Outer \n        Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program 2010 2015)\n\n       On page _, between lines _ and _, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. _. EXTENSION OF LEASING PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Draft Proposed Outer Continental Shelf \n     Oil and Gas Leasing Program 2010 2015 issued by the Secretary \n     of the Interior (referred to in this section as the \n     ``Secretary'') under section 18 of the Outer Continental \n     Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1344) shall be considered to be \n     the final oil and gas leasing program under that section for \n     the period of fiscal years 2013 through 2018.\n       (b) Final Environmental Impact Statement.--The Secretary is \n     considered to have issued a final environmental impact \n     statement for the program applicable to the period described \n     in section (a) in accordance with all requirements under \n     section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of \n     1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, amendment No. 1535, the Vitter amendment, \nis very simple and straightforward, and it goes to an awfully important \nissue. It goes to the issue of the price of energy, particularly the \nprice of gasoline at the pump. There will be a vote today on this \namendment. In fact, it will be the first vote we take this afternoon.\n  The amendment is very simple. It would allow us to go back to the \nprevious lease plan for the Outer Continental Shelf, replacing the \ncurrent Obama administration lease plan which cuts that previous plan \nin half and moves us in the wrong direction in terms of producing our \nabundance of domestic energy, including oil and natural gas.\n  Everybody is concerned about the rising price of oil at the pump. It \nis on the rise again. It is significantly increasing. And that hits \nmiddle and lower class families right in their pocketbooks, right where \nit hurts, and it is particularly harmful in a down economy. We are \nstruggling to get out of this recession, we are trying to mount a \nrecovery, we are trying to make positive things happen, and these \nincreasing prices at the pump are hitting at the worst possible time.\n  What can we do about it? Well, there are a lot of things we can do, \nbut certainly increasing supply, including domestic supply, is one \nmajor, positive thing we can do. We know that 88 percent of the price \nof an average gallon of gasoline is attributable to the cost of crude \noil and taxes--88 percent. That only leaves 12 percent that is \nrefining, marketing, and distribution. And, by the way, that 12 percent \nalso includes the compliance cost for a host of mandates required by \nstatutes and regulations related to refining, marketing, and \ndistribution. So again, the huge bulk of that price represents the \nprice of crude oil as well as taxes.\n  I could argue forcefully and present a lot of data that taxes on oil \nand gas are actually too high, but I don't expect a majority of this \nSenate to listen. So what we are left with as a way to impact those \nrising prices at the pump is to find more, develop more, increase \nsupply, and that brings the price down worldwide. And we can do that \nstarting right here at home.\n  Most Americans don't realize it, because of Federal policy, but the \nUnited States is the most energy-rich country in the world, bar none. \nWhen you look at all of our energy resources, certainly including oil \nand gas, the United States is the most energy rich, and we are far \nricher, by a long shot, in terms of those total energy resources, than \nany Middle Eastern country, such as Saudi Arabia. The only other \ncountry that comes close is Russia, and they are well behind.\n  The problem is the United States is also the only country in the \nworld that puts about 90 percent of those resources off limits and says \nno, under current Federal law, under the current Obama administration \nlease plan, to drilling off the east coast, no to drilling off the west \ncoast, no to production of energy in the eastern gulf--at least as of \nnow--no to most things offshore Alaska, no to ANWR--the Alaska National \nWildlife Refuge--and increasingly this administration wants to say no \nand wants to put up hurdles and blockages on lands where a lot of \nenergy production is happening because of enormous shale finds and \nrelatively new technology.\n  One major thing we can do to affect the price at the pump in the \nright direction--which would be to lower it--is to say yes instead of \nno to developing more of our domestic energy. Unfortunately, in the \nlast several years, under President Obama, we have been moving in the \nopposite direction. We have been moving away from that production.\n  An excellent example is the Outer Continental Shelf. This first chart \nI will put up is the last lease plan--prior to the Obama \nadministration--that was actually beginning to say yes in a significant \nway. This was the result of the outcry from the public--the appropriate \noutcry after the summer of 2008--the last time prices at the pump \nspiked so significantly. People said, wait a minute. Why aren't we \nproducing more at home? Washington finally responded to that, and \nthrough this lease plan we were saying yes more and more. We were \nsaying yes--green light--on the east coast; yes, do more in the gulf; \nyes, green light off the west coast; yes, do more in offshore Alaska.\n  Unfortunately, that came to a screeching halt under the Obama \nadministration. One of the first energy actions this administration \ntook--President Obama and Secretary of the Interior Salazar--was to \nvery quickly cancel this lease plan. Once they took office, they \nscrapped this. Then they studied it for quite a while, with no lease \nplan in sight. Finally, several months ago, they announced and put \nforward their own lease plan--the first under the Obama administration. \nAnd what a difference an election makes. What a difference a change in \nadministration makes. All of a sudden the green lights became red \nlights again. We reverted to the old policy of moratoria on production \nagain and the answer, again, was no, no, no, no. No, off the \neast coast; no, for now, in the eastern gulf; no, offshore Alaska; no, \noff the west coast--no, no, no, no.\n\n  This plan is only half as much as the prior 5-year lease plan. So \ninstead of moving in a positive direction, accessing more of our \nenergy, including in the Outer Continental Shelf, we are backing up, we \nare turning around, and we are turning our backs on the needs of the \nAmerican people. Again, we are saying no, no, no, no.\n  The Vitter amendment, No. 1535, would reverse that. It would say yes. \nIt would say, no, this plan isn't a good idea. Let's go back to the \nprior 5-year lease plan. Let's develop, explore, and produce U.S. \nenergy in a responsible way. Again, we are the single most energy-rich \ncountry in the world, bar\n\n[[Page S1506]]\n\nnone. We have enormous resources, including offshore, including oil and \ngas. But we are the only country in the world that says no, no, no, no, \nand that puts over 90 percent of those resources off limits.\n  This amendment will begin to change that. This amendment will reverse \nthat mistaken policy. In so doing, it would significantly increase the \nsupply of oil where we can control it most--right here at home. And \nwhen everything else stays the same--you increase supply, demand is the \nsame--what happens? Price goes down. That is the first law of \neconomics.\n  So let's say yes. Let's say yes to good, reliable U.S. energy, let's \nsay yes to increased energy independence by doing more for ourselves \nright here at home, and let's say yes to great American jobs. Because \nthat is also what this amendment would produce--jobs. And by definition \nthese jobs can't be outsourced. You can't take good U.S. energy jobs \nand ship them to China or India. You can't do that, by definition.\n  Let's also say yes to this amendment because it would help with \ndeficit and debt reduction. This increased activity would do what? It \nwould produce significant Federal revenue. The Federal revenue or \nroyalty on domestic energy production is the second biggest source of \nrevenue to the Federal Government, second only to the Federal income \ntax.\n  Let's say yes. Let's do something about the rising price at the pump, \nand let's take control of our own destiny. Please support amendment No. \n1535. As I said, I urge all of our colleagues to support this important \namendment--Democrats and Republicans. It will be the first amendment \nvote we take this afternoon.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am going to speak against the Vitter \namendment because I think it is a huge danger to our economy, and I \nwill explain why. It is a huge overreach by the Federal Government into \nthe ability of States to determine if they want a recreation industry, \nif they want a fishing industry, if they want a tourist industry. So I \nwill speak more about it.\n  Before I do that, I want to let people know where we are. Thanks to \nthe extraordinary patience of our majority leader, Harry Reid, today, \nwe finally have a path forward to the transportation bill. And normally \nI would name lots of other people--yes, we have all been involved--but \nSenator Harry Reid is extraordinary.\n  He sat in his office last night, 7, 8, 9, 10, I was calling him \nfinding out what was happening. I was calling the great staff he has, \nworking with my staff and Senator Inhofe's staff, whom I have grown to \nrespect so much. Given all the issues that are facing us, we all knew \nthat having a transportation bill is critical. We do debate very \nfiercely on lots of things, and we are going to see that this morning. \nBut when it comes to infrastructure, we have found common ground with \nmost of our Republican friends.\n  I do wish to say, those who tune in to this debate are going to be a \nbit confused because they are going to hear debates on amendments that \nare not about highways, bridges, roads. They are not going to hear too \nmuch about that for a while. Why is that? Because the Senate is the \nSenate is the Senate. We tried very hard to limit the debate to \nrelevant amendments, but we were thwarted a couple times. We couldn't \nget the 60 votes, pretty much party line; colleagues wanted to have \nvotes on very controversial amendments, which I do not think are going \nto pass, but we will find out. One of them is the amendment offered by \nSenator Vitter of Louisiana.\n  This amendment would essentially take the drilling plan that was \nreleased in the last few days of the Bush administration and would open \nfor drilling entire new areas on the Atlantic, Pacific, the eastern \nGulf of Mexico, and Bristol Bay. The fact is, since that plan was \noffered, we have to understand we are drilling more now than ever \nbefore. We have four times the number of rigs out there. We are now \nexporting oil.\n  Does everyone agree we want more oil? I want more oil. I want it to \nstay in America. But I don't want to endanger entire economies by \nsaying to our friends in the States: Uncle Sam says to forget about \ntheir fishing industry, forget about their tourist industry, forget \nabout all the restaurants and the hotels and everybody else who depends \non it.\n  I can tell you, in my State, tourism is one of the biggest industries \nwe have and the beauty of our State and the beauty of our coast is what \ndraws so many people there. So this heavy-handed amendment says we \ndon't care what you think, we are going to just open everything.\n  In 2006, this body passed the Gulf of Mexico Energy and Security Act. \nI know my friend from Florida is on the floor. That act offered 8.3 \nmillion acres for drilling in the central and eastern gulf planning \nareas in exchange for protecting Florida's coast until 2022. We will \nsee, if this were to pass, lease sale No. 220 off the coast of Virginia \ngo forward, despite concerns that this will interfere with the Navy's \nand NASA's activities in the region. The Vitter amendment requires \ndrilling in Bristol Bay, one of the world's richest fishing grounds, \nwhich supports a commercial fishery worth $2 billion a year.\n  Let's be clear, America. We have 2 percent of the world's proven oil \nsupplies and we use 20 percent of the world's energy. So we can't drill \nour way out of this. What one can do, if one votes for Vitter, is maybe \nfeel they are doing something, but we are destroying whole areas of our \nNation that are so dependent upon the beauty of our coastline.\n  On top of it all, this amendment would waive environmental review of \nthis entire plan--no environmental review. So nobody in the country \nwould know what lies ahead.\n  Look, we don't need any more giveaways to Big Oil. They are having \nraging profits even at the height of the recession, raging profits, \nbillions of dollars. Here is the point. They are sitting on 50 million \nacres of onshore and offshore leases they have yet to drill upon.\n  Let me repeat that. Senator Vitter wants to open huge swaths of the \ncoastline to Big Oil companies that are making record profits, the \nprice of gas is soaring, and they are sitting on 50 million acres of \nland, onshore and offshore leases they have yet to drill upon. They \nhave done nothing with more than 70 percent of the offshore acres and \nnearly 60 percent of the onshore acres in which they currently hold \nleases. When they had a chance to bid on more lease sales, they only \nbid on 5 to 6 percent of those offshore acres in 2009 and 2010. So they \nare not taking advantage of the leases they hold. But Senator Vitter \nwants to open huge swaths, waive all environmental review, put at risk \nhow many jobs in California alone--400,000 fishing and recreation--\n400,000 jobs. That is larger than some of our tiny States--well, maybe \na little bit smaller. I think one of our States has about 500,000. This \nis 400,000 jobs, folks. We have to defeat this.\n  It is a great bumper sticker. ``Drill, Baby, Drill'' is a great \nbumper sticker. But I could write another one that says, ``Keep the Oil \nHere in America,'' and they are exporting the oil. We are exporting \noil. We are going to have more of that debate when we come to the \nKeystone Pipeline.\n  Here is the deal. The Vitter amendment is a giveaway to Big Oil. They \nmade a combined $137 billion in profits last year. The American \nconsumer doesn't see a dime of savings at the pump. It would do nothing \nto lower gas prices. It would encourage them to continue to sit on \ntheir assets, and that is what I think this is about. They list their \nassets in their yearly report to their shareholders, and those assets \nhave value. So they just show them year after year and they never \ndrill. In reward for that, we are going to give them even more assets \nthey can brag about.\n  I am going to put again into facts what I said before: Domestic oil \nproduction under President Obama is up. There are 1,272 active oil rigs \nin the United States right now, more than four times the amount than in \n2009. In 2010, for the first time in 13 years, imported oil accounted \nfor less than 50 percent of the oil consumed in America.\n  Why is this happening? It is happening for many different reasons; \none is we are drilling more and we are doing it in a sensible way, not \ndestroying areas that need to be protected and jobs that need to be \nprotected but in a wise way, in the regular order, in the\n\n[[Page S1507]]\n\nregular process. But also, we are driving more fuel-efficient vehicles. \nThat is extremely important because I already told everyone, we can't \ndrill our way out of this mess with only 2 percent of the supply, using \n20 percent of the world's energy. It is a tilt. It is a mismatch. So we \nhave to have more fuel-efficient cars. Of course, our President led the \nway on that, and Detroit has rebounded because of this President and \nthose in this Senate and House who voted to assure they wouldn't go \nbankrupt.\n  The truth is, the Vitter amendment is dangerous. It is very \ndangerous. If he wanted to come here with an amendment that had any \nhope of passing, in my opinion, why doesn't he go after the speculators \non Wall Street who are driving up prices? The CFTC Commissioner, Bart \nChilton, has calculated that consumers pay an additional $7 to $15 on \neach tank of gas due to oil speculation. So if one wants to come and do \nsomething we could all support, come with an amendment that says the \noil companies should drill on the lands they already have leases on; \nthat we are very willing to open more acres that make sense, with the \nunderstanding that oil will stay here. We will work to stop the \nspeculation on Wall Street that is driving up prices. Frankly, I think \nif we see this continued upswing in prices, my belief is we should go \nto the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which has been done time and time \nagain under Republican and Democratic Presidents, and we have seen the \nsalutary impact on gas prices. They go down at least one time was 10 \ncents--I remember 10 cents a gallon right away. One time they \nstabilized the prices. So we have seen it happen before. That is why we \nhave a Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n\n  So one wants to come with a balanced plan and talk about how the oil \ncompanies have to drill on lands they have, how we support drilling \nwhere it makes sense and doesn't put people out of work who are in the \nrecreation and tourism and fishing industry, go after the speculation \non Wall Street, and tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is 97 \npercent full, if it looks like we can't get a handle on these prices. \nThat is a plan, in addition to which we should continue to give tax \ncredits and tax writeoffs to those people who buy fuel-efficient \nvehicles. I would love to see an added benefit for those made in \nAmerica.\n  Vitter should be defeated. It is very controversial. It doesn't help \nus at all, and it would only pad the paychecks of the oil companies.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, will the Senator from \nCalifornia yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I would.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I just wish to underscore the statement of the \nSenator from California with regard to the Outer Continental Shelf and \npoint out that the Vitter amendment would allow drilling in the one \nplace on the Outer Continental Shelf that is off-limits in law; that \nis, the Gulf of Mexico off Florida.\n  There are several reasons that was passed in a bipartisan way with my \ncolleague Senator Mel Martinez back in 2005. In the first place, there \nis no oil out there of any appreciable amount. The Senator has already \npointed out there are 50 million acres under lease that are not \ndrilled. Well, 30 million of those acres under lease that have not been \ndrilled are in the Gulf of Mexico, where the oil is, in the central and \nwestern gulf. There is very little oil and gas in the eastern Gulf of \nMexico. Why? Because Mother Nature had those sediments coming for \nmillions of years down the Mississippi River, and then the Earth's \ncrust compacted for millions of years and made that oil and the oil is \nwhere the sediments were.\n  It is not out there and the oil companies know that and that is why \nthey have 37 million acres under lease and only 7 million in the Gulf \nof Mexico are drilled, are producing of the 37 million acres.\n  That ought to be prima facie evidence of why we don't need to go in \nthe Gulf of Mexico off Florida. But there is more. Didn't we have some \nlessons from the BP oilspill 2 years ago of what happens to tourism \nwhen oil comes up on the beach? It came very little on the Florida \nbeaches, thank the good Lord, but the tourists thought the beaches were \ncovered. So that tourist season on our gulf coast beaches was a bust \nfrom the Alabama-Florida line all the way down the west coast of \nFlorida. We get down to Clearwater Beach, St. Petersburg Beach, lo and \nbehold, they had a devastating dropoff of tourists who didn't come to \nthose hotels and those restaurants and all those ancillary businesses. \nPart of what we have been doing with the BP money is trying to make \npeople whole for all the income they lost. That ought to be reason \nenough. But there is another reason, and this is where people often are \nso surprised when I tell them.\n  The Gulf of Mexico off Florida is the largest testing and training \narea for the U.S. military in the world. This Senator from Florida has \ntwo letters from two successive Secretaries of State--by the way, both \nRepublican--Secretary Rumsfeld and Secretary Gates, that say we can't \nput oil drilling and oil-related activities in the Gulf of Mexico off \nFlorida in the test and training range, which in effect is the Gulf of \nMexico off Florida.\n  I just wanted to bolster the Senator's statements about why we have \nto vote down this Vitter amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I was just going to suggest that Senator Nelson continue \nwith the time because I do not need any more time at this point. So \nplease continue.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1822\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for the restoration of the natural resources, \n   ecosystems, fisheries, marine and wildlife habitats, beaches, and \n coastal wetlands of Gulf Coast States and to provide funding for the \n                   Land and Water Conservation Fund)\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, if I may be recognized, I want \nto point out that later on today we are going to have an amendment that \nis bipartisan. It is an amendment that, of its original filing with 10 \nSenators, 3 of them are Democrat and seven of them are Republican. It \nis called the RESTORE Act. What it does is when the fine is determined \non BP because of the 5 million barrels of oil they spilled--the fine \nallocated according to the Water Pollution Act, which says that a fine \nwill be levied upon anyone who spills a barrel of oil in public waters, \nand, of course, because of the enormous amount of oil that was spilled, \nthis could be a very substantial fine, 5 million barrels of oil--once \nthat fine is determined, then the question is how is it going to be \nallocated.\n  If nothing is done, only about $1.5 billion would go into the Oil \nSpill Liability Trust Fund. The rest of it is undeclared. Naturally, \nwhat the Gulf Coast Senators wanted to do was to have some of that \nmoney come back to restore the gulf--the critters, the water, and the \npeople who are the ones who suffered as a result of the BP oilspill.\n  What we have worked out is a formula, that 20 percent of whatever the \nfine is would go back to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund and the \nremaining 80 percent would be allocated according to a formula devised \nby the National Gulf Restoration Council, appointed by the States and \nthe Federal Government. It would go to make the environment of the gulf \nwhole. It would go to help the economic development along the gulf that \nhad suffered. And, very critically to this Senator, it would go to help \nresearch the long-term health effects on the gulf because there is no \ntelling the effects. With all that oil sloshing around out there, we \nare already seeing enormous effects and we are going to be seeing that \nfor years and years.\n  For example, there are two professors down at LSU with whom I visited \nwho have been doing research on a little fish that roots around in the \nmarshes to get its food. This little fish, called killifish--it is \nabout the size of a silver dollar--they took that little fish and took \nslices of its gills, put them under a microscope, and have shown \ndramatic results in fish that live in the marshes where the oil \npenetrated, such as Barataria Bay, where it is all mixed up down into \nthe sediment, and then taking samples of the killifish that came from \nmarshes where not much oil hit. The dramatic result shows that these \nlittle fish do not reproduce. The ones that are there are stunted in \ntheir growth. They have all kinds of aberrations in their actual \nbiological makeup. This spells bad news for the future of the gulf.\n\n[[Page S1508]]\n\n  It is one of the amendments to the transportation bill. It is about \nfive down on the list. Hopefully we will vote on it this afternoon. \nWith seven Republican Senators being the sponsors of the original \nlegislation, we are going to have this up. I plead with Senators, if \nyou are concerned that you do not want all this money that is being \nfined as a result of the spill in the gulf--if you want it to go \nelsewhere in the country, I plead for you to recognize if you were in \nour shoes what you would want. But acknowledging that you want some of \nthe money--because we had to get a pay-for, and the pay-for is not \ncontroversial, yet it produces about $1.5 billion additional--that can \ngo to the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The pay-for is something \nthat the Senate has extended every year, a portion that was passed back \nin 2004 having to do with the World Trade Organization.\n  It is a very complicated thing. Each year the Senate has put that in \nabeyance for another year. That is our pay-for, to put it in abeyance \nfor the ninth year of the 10 years that this provision is to be in \neffect. What it does is it produces about $1.5 billion for the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund so that it will have an effect for those \nconcerned outside of the area of the Gulf of Mexico.\n  As you know, the Deepwater Horizon oilspill was right at 5 million \nbarrels. It coated the beaches. It seeped into the wetlands. It kept \nfishermen at the dock during one of the busiest fishing seasons. It \nkilled wildlife. It kept the tourists away from the gulf. The long-term \nimpacts are not known because there is still a lot of oil out there at \n5,000 feet, on the floor of the Gulf of Mexico. The fish and the \nwildlife that were not immediately killed are showing the signs of \ndamage, as I have indicated with the killifish.\n  The gulf residents and the communities continue to suffer. In the \nSenate today, we have a chance to take a step to make the gulf coast \nwhole again. As a sign of solidarity for the gulf, of the five Gulf \nCoast States that collectively have two Democratic Senators and eight \nRepublican Senators, all but one Senator of those five States signed as \na sponsor of the bill. It is bipartisan. This commonsense legislation \nis supported by so many people who looked at this: National \nEnvironmental Policy Act groups, sportsmen, chambers of commerce, \nacademic institutions, local governments, the business community. \nToday's vote is going to be a huge step toward making sure that the \nfine that is going to be imposed upon BP, however much it is, ends up \nin the local communities that were harmed by BP's oilspill; otherwise, \nthe money is going to end up in the Federal Treasury, and there is no \ntelling, then, where it is going to be spent.\n  The RESTORE Act amendment provides funding to each Gulf State for \necosystem restoration and economic recovery. It also creates a Federal-\nState council responsible for developing and executing a holistic plan \nto increase the resiliency of the gulf ecosystem. Why were baby \ndolphins dying in record numbers? We don't know. We have to find out. \nWe have to test these results for years to come.\n  The amendment is also going to ensure that each Gulf State would come \nup with a State plan that is consistent with the Federal-State council \nplan.\n  Finally, this bill sets aside funding for science, specifically \ndedicating funding for data collection for our fisheries, for our \nwildlife, for long-term observation and monitoring, and sets up centers \nof excellence to carry out research on the gulf for years to come.\n  But there is also a national component in this bill. It creates a \nset-aside funding for an endowment for the oceans, an endowment for the \nGreat Lakes, so in addition to restoring the gulf where the harm \noccurred, we can better protect all of our coasts from environmental \nharm. It provides substantial investments in the Land and Water \nConservation Fund, which I mentioned, which protects and conserves land \nin each and every State in this Union.\n\n  I believe our people, the whole of America, deserve a healthy and \nproductive gulf too, and the civil fines that are going to be assessed \nto BP can ensure that.\n  I wish to share with my colleagues a vision for a restored Gulf of \nMexico. One of the lessons we learned--and we learned it too late--is \nthat we do not have sufficient understanding of the gulf ecosystem. We \nknow that one-third of our domestic seafood comes from the gulf waters \nbut we did not have a clear picture on the biological status of two-\nthirds of the federally managed fish stocks that call the gulf home, so \nit is important that some of these fines go toward dedicated, long-term \nscience about the gulf ecosystem.\n  That was one of the main things I wanted to get into the RESTORE Act, \nbecause of the obvious implications for the long term. A restored gulf \nis one in which clean water that is free from algae blooms and free \nfrom tar mats, is home to oyster reefs and fish habitat and sea grass \nbeds, where charters ferry tourists from hotels to pristine beaches and \nthen on out to the productive fishing spots. An integral part of the \nrestoration is to shore up the coastal communities that were hardest \nhit by the economic impacts of the oilspill. It is going to take a \nsubstantial investment to achieve those goals.\n  The gulf cannot wait. The rigid partisanship that has sometimes \ngridlocked this body has given way to a spirit of strong collaboration \nand bipartisanship in this Senate when it comes to the RESTORE Act.\n  I thank all the cosponsors of the amendment and the cosponsors of the \nRESTORE Act, and I urge and plead with our colleagues to support this \namendment. It is right for the gulf. It is right for the country.\n  I call up my amendment, No. 1822, which is at the desk, and ask that \nit be reported by number.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment by number.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Nelson] for himself, Mr. \n     Shelby, and Ms. Landrieu, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1822.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1660\n\n   (Purpose: To provide additional time for the Administrator of the \n   Environmental Protection Agency to issue achievable standards for \nindustrial, commercial, and institutional boilers, process heaters, and \n                             incinerators)\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I call up my amendment numbered 1660, \nwhich is at the desk, and ask that it be reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins], for herself, Mr. \n     Alexander, and Mr. Toomey, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1660.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record of Wednesday, \nFebruary 15, 2012, under ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to offer amendment No. 1660, \nthe EPA Regulatory Relief Act, to the highway reauthorization bill. I \nam very pleased to have Senator Alexander, Senator Pryor, Senator \nToomey, Senator Landrieu, and Senator McCaskill joining me as \ncosponsors of this amendment.\n  Last year I introduced the EPA Regulatory Relief Act (S. 1392) to \nprovide the Environmental Protection Agency with the time the Agency \nitself said it needed to rewrite the proposed Boiler MACT rules to \nbetter serve the public interest and to protect vulnerable \nmanufacturing jobs. That legislation had the support of 41 of my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, and a nearly identical bill \npassed the House of Representatives with bipartisan support this fall.\n  The EPA Regulatory Relief Act is straightforward. It will help ensure \nthat the final Boiler MACT regulations will be achievable and \naffordable and that manufacturers will have adequate time to bring \ntheir facilities into compliance, thus preserving jobs. We hear over \nand over again that the top priority of the Senate should be to create \nan environment where jobs are created and preserved. Well, this \namendment is all about saving jobs.\n  Since the EPA proposed these new Boiler MACT regulations in April of \n2010, there has been widespread bipartisan concern over the cost of the \nimplementation and potential job losses.\n\n[[Page S1509]]\n\nIt has been our shared goal to ensure that the final rules crafted by \nthe EPA protect public health and the environment, while preventing the \nloss of thousands of jobs we can ill afford to lose. Enactment of this \nlegislation is necessary to protect and to grow America's manufacturing \nworkforce. This is all about jobs.\n  We have urged the EPA to set emission standards based on real-world \ncapabilities of the best performing boilers currently available. After \nall, that is what Boiler MACT is supposed to be all about. \nUnfortunately, the EPA did not begin its rulemaking with that goal in \nmind, and the consequences are so serious. The forest products industry \nis the lifeblood of many small, rural communities in my State of Maine \nand many others; therefore, I am alarmed by a study commissioned by the \nAmerican Forest and Paper Association which found that implementing the \nEPA rules as originally drafted could cause 36 pulp and paper mills \naround the country to close, putting more than 20,000 Americans out of \nwork. That is 18 percent of the workforce in just this one \nmanufacturing sector.\n  Mr. President, you may have heard that the EPA has revised its rules, \nand it has. But despite these revisions, the Boiler MACT rules remain \nan issue of great concern to manufacturers across the country and to \nmany of my constituents. With the reconsideration process, the EPA has \ntaken some initial steps, but they are not even close to sufficient. \nThe Agency's reproposed rules still do not address the serious and real \nthreat to factories and mills that will be most directly affected. The \nrevised rules are still estimated to cost billions of dollars and \nthousands of jobs. Regions across this Nation already struggling with \nthe decline in manufacturing would be the hardest hit. Furthermore, a \nrecent court ruling has created even more uncertainty and confusion, \nand it has increased the pressure on EPA to just rush through these \nrules without careful consideration.\n  Legislative action is needed to ensure achievable and affordable \nrules, to allow adequate compliance time, and to reduce the risk to \nindustries posed by the pending litigation, which has created so much \nuncertainty that manufacturers are telling me they are putting any job \nexpansions on hold. Enactment of the EPA Regulatory Relief Act remains \nthe best way to provide the time the EPA says it needs to develop and \nimplement Boiler MACT rules that will deliver the intended benefits to \npublic health and our environment without devastating our economy. \nThere is no need for a choice--it is not the environment versus jobs. \nWith carefully crafted regulations, we can protect the environment and \npreserve jobs.\n  There are several factors that reinforce the continuing need for this \nlegislation.\n  First, the overall capital cost to manufacturers of the Boiler MACT \nrules remains a staggering $14 billion and threatens more than 200,000 \ncritically needed, good jobs. Think about that. The revised rules have \nan estimated cost of $14 billion, and 200,000 jobs would be lost.\n  Second, following the January 9 court decision that overturned the \nEPA's stay of the March 2011 rules--and this was a stay that the EPA, \nto its credit, requested but unfortunately was denied--businesses are \nfacing serious and ongoing legal and regulatory uncertainty.\n  Third, the revised rules still do not allow companies adequate time \nto comply with the new standards and install the required equipment.\n  Fourth, important biomass materials are still not listed as fuels. \nThat makes no sense at all. We are trying to reduce the use of fossil \nfuels. We should be encouraging the use of biomass in boilers. In fact, \nthe Department of Energy is doing just that while the EPA is doing the \nopposite through these rules. It makes no sense to force mills to use \nfossil fuels while landfilling renewable biomass material. That makes \nno sense whatsoever.\n\n  Finally, the EPA's current schedule for finalizing the rules is \ninadequate for fully analyzing the comments and data that will be \nreceived during the comment period. The EPA recognizes that, and that \nis why it asked for this stay.\n  So I would ask of my colleagues, do not be deceived by the EPA's \nhollow promises that somehow, some way, everything will be fixed and \nthat we don't need this legislation. The fact is that the EPA \nregulations are a moving target. Who knows what they ultimately will \npropose? Some of the materials of the biomass boilers are still being \nconsidered as solid waste and treated as an incinerator with far more \ncostly and onerous regulations, but then again, this is the same EPA \nthat initially proposed that we no longer treat biomass and wood as \ncarbon neutral, overturning years of treating wood as carbon neutral. \nThat makes no sense either. Under tremendous pressure, the EPA finally \nbacked off on that for 3 years, but we don't know what is going to \nhappen.\n  Let me say that the EPA does perform some vital functions in helping \nto protect public health by ensuring that the air we breathe is clean \nand the water we drink is safe. I have opposed many attempts to delay \nor overturn EPA regulations, but we need to make sure that as EPA \nissues new regulations, it does not create so many roadblocks to \neconomic growth that it discourages private investment, which is the \nkey to maintaining and creating jobs. We need to make sure the EPA both \nprotects the environment and protects our economy and does not impose \nbillions of dollars of new costs on manufacturers, leading to an \nestimated loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs in manufacturing at a \ntime when our economy can least afford it and when there are \nalternatives.\n  I am not saying there should not be Boiler MACT regulations. I am \nsaying we need more time for the EPA to get it right, to work with the \nindustry, to get real-life emission standards. I am saying we need more \ntime for compliance so that we are not imposing these huge costs at a \ntime when our manufacturers are struggling and thus jeopardizing jobs.\n  A coalition of 380 companies and organizations--I don't think I have \never offered an amendment with more support. And this has so many \ncompanies so upset about what this is going to do to the much needed \njobs they are providing. There are 380 companies and organizations, \nincluding the National Federation of Independent Business, the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the \nAmerican Forest and Paper Association, and those are just a few of the \n380 companies and organizations that have called for passage of my \namendment. The members of this coalition are committed to working with \nthe EPA, to being good stewards and supporting the development and \nimplementation of achievable Boiler MACT rules, not rules that don't \nclassify biomass, that force people to use fossil fuels instead of \nbiomass. How is that good for our environment? It is essential that the \nEPA produce final rules that are guided by the same commitment.\n  The EPA is making progress in reducing the costs and coming up with a \nmore practical approach to the Boiler MACT rules, but we have no idea \nwhere they are going to end up. They are a moving target, and we have \nhad promises not fulfilled by the EPA before.\n  I believe we can achieve the health benefits we all desire. And I \nknow we are going to hear on the floor that somehow I am trying to harm \nchildren or delay health benefits, and that is not true. I am trying to \nallow the time the EPA says it needs to get this right. We can achieve \nhealth benefits we desire without putting thousands of people out of \nwork and stifling the economic recovery. The bipartisan dilemma that is \nbefore us will help ensure that result, and I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting this commonsense amendment to preserve jobs and \nstrengthen our environmental protections.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, just for the people who are watching this \ndebate, we are talking about the Transportation bill. We are talking \nabout preserving the jobs that go with that, 1.8 million jobs, and an \nadditional 1 million that will be created. But we are hearing a debate \nabout whether we should roll back a proposed rule that controls the \nfollowing poisons: mercury, arsenic, lead, chromium, benzene, and toxic \nsoot, just to name a few.\n\n[[Page S1510]]\n\n  If anyone believes all this legislation is about is delay, then they \ndon't know because this amendment, which has been called the EPA \nRegulatory Relief Act, would forever change the current standards \nallowed for mercury, arsenic, lead, chromium, benzene, toxic soot, and \nother dangerous pollutants. So it not only delays a rule that is \ncritical--and I will tell my colleagues the numbers of lives that will \nbe saved because of it--but it changes the standards for these toxins \nforever.\n  I don't know about the Senator from Maine, but I have never had one \nconstituent come up to me and say: Senator Boxer, there is one thing \nyou can do for me. I beg you. Increase the arsenic in the air. I need \nmore mercury. Oh, I am desperately in need of more benzene, chromium, \nand lead.\n  I have never heard one say: I am willing to risk the fact that my \ngrandchild, who is going to be born in a few months--I am willing to \nrisk the fact that they may have brain damage. Oh, repeal the Clean Air \nAct. Repeal the rules.\n  I hope we will vote down this amendment. This amendment is described \nas being nothing but a delay when it actually changes the standards for \nthe most poisonous pollution known to humankind. Instead of the EPA \nRegulatory Relief Act, I would call it the Increased Poisonous \nPollution in America Act.\n  My friend read names supporting her amendment. Let me tell my \ncolleagues who opposes it--people from her own State: the National \nAssociation of County and City Health Officials; the American Lung \nAssociation; the American Public Health Association; the American \nThoracic Society; and the Asthma and Algae Foundation of America. That \nis just a partial list.\n  We need to vote this down. My friend makes a number of points about \nbiomass--and we have the great Senator from Oregon here who actually \ntook this issue on in the beginning, and he is going to have some time \nto talk about it--and resolved a lot of our problems with this. He is \nto be credited for a compromise with EPA that will work.\n  I just want to say--and everything I say is fact; it is peer-reviewed \nfact--these toxins cause cancer, heart disease, and premature death.\n  The Senator from Maine said all this amendment does is give EPA \nanother year because they are not ready anyway.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe EPA saying they are ready by spring.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       United States Environmental\n\n\n                                            Protection Agency,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 5, 2012.\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wyden: Thank you for your continuing interest \n     in the air toxics standards for boilers. We are currently in \n     the process of developing final standards and responding to \n     additional, useful information we received during the public \n     comment period on the reconsidered standards we proposed last \n     December. We intend to finalize the standards this spring. In \n     the proposal, EPA proposed to ``reset'' the three year \n     compliance clock to give entities the full amount of time \n     available under the Clean Air Act upon finalization of the \n     rule, and, subject to the formal rulemaking process, expects \n     to do so in the final rule. The Act also gives state and \n     local permitting authorities the ability to provide up to a \n     one-year extension of that deadline, on a case-by-case basis, \n     as necessary, for the installation of controls.\n       While EPA believes facilities can meet compliance \n     requirements within the four years described above, I commit \n     to you that EPA will handle each situation on a case-by-case \n     basis, and work with facilities to determine the appropriate \n     response and resolution. We have authority available to us to \n     resolve concerns that might arise at individual facilities as \n     long as appropriate and timely steps are being taken towards \n     compliance.\n       Additionally, as required by the Clean Air Act, we proposed \n     and will finalize air toxic standards for boilers based on \n     real-life data that industry has provided to us about the \n     level of emissions from their facilities. As EPA reviews the \n     public comments and data as we finalize these standards, we \n     will pay close attention to their achievability. We intend to \n     set standards that can be met by plants operating in the real \n     world.\n       Again, thank you for your continued attention to this \n     matter. It is important to ensure that we achieve these key \n     public health standards in a way that is sensitive to \n     legitimate needs of business interests. If you have \n     additional questions, please feel free to contact me or have \n     your staff contact Arvin Ganesan, Associate Administrator for \n     Congressional and Intergovernmental Relations at (202) 564 \n     5200.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Lisa P. Jackson.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. My friend says EPA needs more time. They have had 20 \nyears--20 years--on this in terms of regulating these pollutants.\n  Senator Carper from Delaware, who is a very moderate Member of this \nbody, has stood in front of our caucus and made a passionate plea: We \ndon't need any more delays. We need action, and we need wise action. \nEPA has said they will work with our States, State by State; they will \nwork with the polluters, polluter by polluter. Because of the \nleadership of the Senator from Oregon, they have written letters to \nmany of us who are concerned saying they will work on this.\n  I am not going to talk too long because I want to leave time for my \nfriend, but I must put in the Record the following facts: If we vote \nfor the Collins amendment and if it were to become the law, A, it \ndoesn't belong on a transportation bill. We should be debating the \nClean Air Act for weeks on end if we are going to start repealing \nstandards for these pollutants. So just on that issue alone we should \nvote against it. If it were to pass, which I don't believe it will, \n300,000 newborns each year may well have increased risk of learning \ndisabilities from toxic mercury exposure in the womb.\n  We know because of peer-reviewed science, if this were to pass and we \nwould not have this rule go into effect, for every year it is delayed \nwe would see 8,100 premature deaths, 5,100 heart attacks per year, and \n52,000 cases of aggravated asthma. I wish to show my colleagues a \npicture of what it looks like when a child has asthma. What does it \nlook like when a child has asthma and they are gasping for air? Too \nmany of our children have asthma. I don't know about my colleagues, but \nwhen I go to the schools I ask the kids: How many of you have asthma or \nknow someone who has asthma? About 50 percent of the kids raise their \nhands. I suggest my colleagues do that.\n  This is our legacy--these kids. They are who we live for. They are \nwhy we are here, to make life better for them.\n  People say we are going to save jobs. First of all, let me tell my \ncolleagues something: If you had a heart attack that you didn't need to \nhave, you are not going to be working. I think there are also 400,000 \nlost workdays per year--scientifically peer-reviewed. If this is \ndelayed, for every year--and it has been 20 years in the making, \ncontrol of these pollutants--400,000 lost workdays per year.\n  Here is another fact: We talk about the cost. Yes, it will cost $1.5 \nbillion per year to clean up this poison. The annual benefits are $67 \nbillion. I would say to my friends, that is a heck of a good ratio--a \ngood ratio.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe American Boiler Manufacturers Association.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                         ABMA,\n\n                                     Vienna, VA, January 27, 2012.\n     Re Manufacturer Opposition to the EPA Regulatory Relief Act \n         of 2011.\n\n       To Members of the United States Senate: In the considered \n     technical judgment of the American Boiler Manufacturers \n     Association (ABMA), and contrary to popular talking points \n     distributed by those less interested in their technical \n     practicality and more interested in killing them outright, \n     the Industrial Boiler MACT Reconsideration Rules proposed by \n     EPA in December 2011 are technically achievable by real-world \n     boilers--the only kind of boiler and combustion equipment the \n     ABMA membership designs and makes.\n       Compliance can be achieved using existing, state-of-the-\n     art, technologically-advanced and fuel-flexible products \n     along with innovatively-designed and engineered application \n     solutions to meet the exigent needs of a host of varied \n     individual boiler facilities.\n       And, contrary to what some too-frequently-cited, yet flawed \n     and discredited [Congressional Research Service, 7 5700, \n     www.crs.gov, R41459], studies would have you believe, these \n     proposed rules are not job-killers--in fact, for the boiler, \n     combustion, pollution-control and for other compliance-\n     related industries, they will be job generators; clearly lob \n     generators for those small businesses on main streets across \n     this country that install, repair and tune-up boilers and \n     boiler systems.\n       As for compliance resources, please be confident that the \n     U.S. boiler and combustion equipment industry--with decades \n     of experience and expertise in meeting tough, state,\n\n[[Page S1511]]\n\n     local, regional and national air-quality codes, standards and \n     regulations with innovative, and real-world design \n     solutions--stands ready and able right now to help those \n     affected by these rules to comply with them in a timely and \n     affordable manner. Arguments that there are insufficient \n     resources available for use in compliance within the time \n     period specified by the rules are specious and uninformed in \n     the extreme. In fact, delay in rule finalization, as \n     envisioned by the EPA Regulatory Relief Act of 2011, will \n     only exacerbate future compliance issues and costs; labor and \n     materials costs and availability are currently stable and \n     domestic boiler and combustion equipment manufacturing \n     capacity is available now to service the full range of \n     compliance options available under the new, more flexible \n     rules as proposed by EPA in December. My manufacturer and \n     supplier members make things and they make them here in the \n     United States--providing high-wage jobs and contributing to \n     tax bases across this country--in states like California, \n     Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, \n     Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, \n     Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, \n     Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, \n     Virginia, and Wisconsin--and they are prepared to meet any \n     compliance challenge that these or any other air quality \n     rules might generate (alone or in tandem)--affordably, and \n     well within any arbitrary compliance time frame.\n       Any small number of remaining technical issues can be well \n     addressed and resolved by stakeholders and EPA during the \n     new, currently on-going 60-day public review and comment \n     period provided by EPA's December 2011 Reconsideration \n     proposals. At this point in time and after more than a decade \n     of information gathering, proposal, and debate, there is no \n     reason for Congressional intervention or for Congressionally-\n     mandated delay in the existing, on-going rulemaking process. \n     Besides fostering continued unreasonable uncertainty, \n     additional delay at this point will only serve as a \n     disincentive to stakeholders to promptly address remaining \n     issues.\n       Therefore, with over 100 small-business domestic \n     manufacturer and supplier members, the American Boiler \n     Manufacturers Association (ABMA)--the companies that actually \n     design, manufacture and supply the commercial, institutional, \n     industrial boilers and combustion equipment in question--\n     strongly urges you to oppose S. 1392 and H.R. 2250, the EPA \n     Regulatory Relief Act of 2011--or any similar legislation--\n     and to resist adding the language of either as part of any \n     payroll tax holiday extension, tax-extender or as part of any \n     appropriations bills coming before the Senate this year We \n     encourage you to let the existing rulemaking process within \n     EPA as envisioned by the December-proposed Reconsideration \n     Rules go forward without Congressional interference.\n       Further delays in the rulemaking process--as mandated by S. \n     1392 and H.R. 2250--will not result in improved rules or \n     insulate the rules from future litigation; further delay of \n     15 or more months only means continued uncertainty and will \n     yield no new jobs, no economic growth, no cleaner air or any \n     more affordable ultimate compliance options than are now \n     feasible and readily available from existing sources.\n       The types of clean, efficient, fuel-flexible, affordable \n     and technologically-advanced products and equipment that can \n     be supplied by the U.S. boiler manufacturing industry are \n     critically important for long-term public health, \n     environmental quality and business stability.\n       Don't let the Preoccupation by some with the inadequacies \n     of past rulemaking efforts lead you into delaying the current \n     December initiated rulemaking process--propsals and a process \n     that provide a flexible, affordable, and achievable pathway \n     to air quality, greater efficiency and the types of long-term \n     boiler room upgrades and modernizations that will lead to \n     sustainable competiveness and bottom line stability.\n       [For a list of the membership of the American Boiler \n     Manufacturers Association and their respective products and \n     services, go to http://boilermactfacts.com, and for \n     questions, please contact me directly via email at \n     randy@abma.com or at 703/356 7172.]\n           Sincerely,\n                                                W. Randall Rawson,\n                                President/Chief Executive Officer.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. The letter from ABMA strongly says the following: ``We \nurge Senators to oppose the EPA Regulatory Relief Act.''\n  This is business. This is American business, made in America. The \nAmerican Boiler Manufacturers Association: ``We encourage Senators to \nvote it down.''\n  I have that letter, and that is what they say. My friend from Maine \nsaid it is not technically feasible to clean up these poisons. They \nsaid anyone who tells you it is not technically achievable by real \nworld boilers ``doesn't know what they are talking about.'' This is not \nme speaking. I didn't say that. This is what the American Boiler \nManufacturers Association said.\n  So everywhere we look, when it comes to this vote, it says: Vote no, \nvote no, vote no. At a minimum, we should do no harm to our people's \nhealth. We have it in our hands now to stop a permanent rollback not \njust of the rule--that is a delay--but a permanent rollback of \nstandards for the most poisonous pollutants there are: chromium, \narsenic, mercury, lead, benzene, toxic soot. I would say all the \narguments we have heard do not hold water.\n  In closing, let me say this: The polls on this are as clear as they \ncan be. The people want us to get out of the way and allow the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to do its work. Lisa Jackson is not a \nradical person. She is one of the most--how can I say--she is a \ncoalition-building type of person. She is someone who reaches out. When \nSenator Wyden called her and said he was very upset about the way this \nrule was going, she sat down with him and, I think, rose to the \noccasion. When other Senators met with her--and I was in the room with \nseveral--she said: We can deal with your problems.\n  So let's vote no. This rollback of the Clean Air Act standards for \nthe most poisonous pollutants doesn't belong on this bill. There is no \nway it belongs on this bill. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, it is opposed by every health entity we know. It is opposed by \nour local county health officials and city health officials. I would \nsay to my colleagues, when we look at the polls, it is opposed by 70 \npercent of the American people. That is the last poll I saw. They want \nto be able to breathe clean air. They know their people suffer when the \nair is filled with soot, and particularly toxic soot, which results in \ndevastation for our families in very, very, very large numbers.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I hope we will vote no on the \nCollins amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to fight for a \npaper company in western Maryland called Luke Mill. I am fighting for \nthe jobs it creates in western Maryland, and I am fighting to make sure \nits workers have a government on their side.\n  I have worked with the leadership at Luke Mill for decades. It is one \nof the last large employers in western Maryland. These jobs provide \ngood wages and good benefits for Maryland workers and their families. \nWhen it was owned by the Luke family, I was in frequent contact with \nJohn Luke about challenges the company was facing. We talked about ways \nthe Federal Government could help his business and where it should just \nstay out of the way.\n  When unfair trade practices of China were threatening the viability \nof Luke Mill and the jobs of its workers, I was on the side of Luke \nMill. I contacted the Department of Commerce and represented Luke Mill \nbefore the International Trade Commission to make sure China and other \ncountries had to play by the rules in trade. As a result, we saved the \njobs of American workers who were threatened by an uneven trade playing \nfield.\n  When the management at Luke Mill called me about EPA's Boiler MACT \nrule, I took their concerns to the highest levels of EPA. Luke Mill \ntold me that the regulations were too expensive to implement companies \nneeded more time to comply and EPA needed to use accurate data to set \nemissions standards.\n  I heard these concerns and took them directly to EPA Administrator \nLisa Jackson. Here is what we accomplished: No. 1, EPA produced more \ntargeted emissions limits under the regulation; No. 2, EPA reduced the \ncost of compliance for businesses by 50 percent; and No. 3, companies \ncould have as much as 4 years to comply.\n  EPA's compromise rule is not perfect, but it is significantly better \nthan the first draft. From the day I heard about EPA's Boiler MACT \nrule, my priorities have been the same. I am fighting to protect the \njobs in western Maryland, and I am working with EPA to reach a \ncompromise that gives flexibility to businesses to comply without \nabandoning my environmental principles. But I also will not abandon \nwestern Maryland or the jobs that depend on Luke Mill's viability.\n  I will continue to fight for American jobs and the viability of \nAmerican business.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1738\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask that the pending amendment be set \naside to call up amendment No. 1738.\n\n[[Page S1512]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1738.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To prevent the creation of duplicative and overlapping \n                           Federal programs)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. CONSOLIDATING UNNECESSARY DUPLICATIVE AND \n                   OVERLAPPING GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law and not later \n     than 150 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall \n     coordinate with the heads of the relevant department and \n     agencies to--\n       (1) use available administrative authority to eliminate, \n     consolidate, or streamline Government programs and agencies \n     with duplicative and overlapping missions identified in the--\n       (A) March 2011 Government Accountability Office report to \n     Congress entitled ``Opportunities to Reduce Potential \n     Duplication in Government Programs, Save Tax Dollars, and \n     Enhance Revenue'' (GAO 11 318SP); and\n       (B) February 2012 Government Accountability Office report \n     to Congress entitled ``2012 Annual Report: Opportunities to \n     Reduce Potential Duplication in Government Programs, Save Tax \n     Dollars, and Enhance Revenue'' (GAO 12 342SP);\n       (2) identify and report to Congress any legislative changes \n     required to further eliminate, consolidate, or streamline \n     Government programs and agencies with duplicative and \n     overlapping missions identified in the--\n       (A) March 2011 Government Accountability Office report to \n     Congress entitled ``Opportunities to Reduce Potential \n     Duplication in Government Programs, Save Tax Dollars, and \n     Enhance Revenue'' (GAO 11 318SP); and\n       (B) February 2012 Government Accountability Office report \n     to Congress entitled ``2012 Annual Report: Opportunities to \n     Reduce Potential Duplication in Government Programs, Save Tax \n     Dollars, and Enhance Revenue'' (GAO 12 342SP);\n       (3) determine the total cost savings that shall result to \n     each agency, office, and department from the actions \n     described in paragraph (1); and\n       (4) rescind from the appropriate accounts and apply the \n     savings towards deficit reduction the amount greater of--\n       (A) $10,000,000,000; or\n       (B) the total amount of cost savings estimated by paragraph \n     (3).\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, the CBO just announced this morning that \nFebruary was the largest deficit month in this country. We have run \n$690 billion worth of deficits through the first 4\\1/2\\ months of this \nfiscal year. We will have a $1.6 trillion deficit.\n  This amendment the Senate has voted on before passed with 64 votes \nthe last time it was voted on. It is a very simple, straightforward \namendment.\n  Before I get into the details of this amendment--we need a highway \nbill. Everybody agrees with that. This is the Senate, and the right to \noffer amendments has been secured, finally, after 2 weeks of \nnegotiation.\n  Where are we as a country? I think it is interesting to look back \nfrom fiscal years 2011 to 2001. In 2001 the total bill for the Federal \nGovernment was $1.86 trillion. It is now almost $3.61 trillion. In 2001 \nwe had a surplus. Now we have a $1.3 trillion to $1.6 trillion deficit \ncoming into this year. I think the American people would like to see us \ndo something about that. Yet, at every turn, on every occasion, we have \nnot risen to the challenge of creating an environment where jobs can \nflourish. One of the reasons is the Federal Government is squeezing the \njobs out of the economy by taking such a large segment of them.\n  This amendment is very straightforward and very simple. The GAO, \nthrough two reports now--one released just this last month and a second \nin a series of three which will become annual--has told Congress where \nthe problems are. The problems are in continuing to do the same thing \nin multiple programs and multiple agencies. They have outlined \nbillions, hundreds of billions--I can calculate at least $100 billion \nworth of duplication that they have outlined and said we didn't do \nanything about it last year when they gave us the first report. Now \nthey are giving us another report that has probably another $30 billion \nor $40 billion worth of savings for the American people because of \nduplication.\n  So this amendment asks--it is very straightforward--it asks OMB to \nlook at the GAO reports and give recommendations to us on what they \nwould recommend that allows the executive branch to participate in \nterms of $10 billion worth of savings this year on duplication.\n  Why is that possible? Here is why it is possible. And this is just a \nsmall sample of what GAO has told us. We have 209 different programs \nspending $4 billion through eight different agencies to encourage \nscience, technology, engineering, and math education in the United \nStates. Can anybody in this body defend the fact that we have 209 \ndifferent programs? No. Nobody will even stand and defend it.\n  So we ought to be able to--there is nothing wrong with us wanting to \nencourage that, incentivize that, help create that, because we know \nthat is for a higher powered workforce in the future. But 209 programs? \nWhy wouldn't we streamline it?\n  We have 200 separate crime prevention programs. As a matter of fact, \nthe GAO said you have enough duplication just in the Department of \nJustice programs--they spent $30 billion over the last 9\\1/2\\ years--\nthat if you would eliminate that duplication, you would find billions \nto save.\n  How do you get rid of a $1.6 trillion deficit? The way you get rid of \nit is a million here, a billion there, $10 billion here, $15 billion \nthere, a billion here. What this amendment would do is save us $10 \nbillion this year through smart government. It does not question the \nmotivation. It does not even question whether it is our authority. But \nit says: Let's do this.\n  The Senate voted 64 to 36 when this was brought up in April of last \nyear--the same amendment. They thought it was a good idea. The reason \nthey voted for it was because it was fresh on their minds, what the GAO \nhad told us.\n  Let's take some others.\n  The Surface Transportation Program. Here we have the highway bill. \nThey did, thankfully, eliminate a few programs. We still are going to \nhave 100 programs involved in surface transportation even when this \nhighway bill is completed. We did not do what we needed to do. We can \ndo better and we can save money. Even if the same amount of money gets \nout to the American public, the administrative cost will shrink \ndramatically.\n  Private sector green buildings. We have 94 separate programs, 16 \ndifferent agencies to incentivize green buildings, and not one of them \nhas ever been tested to see if it has an effect, whether it is \npositive, whether it is efficient, whether it is effective--not one. \nNever. Why would we have 94 separate programs for green buildings?\n  We have 88 different economic development programs. Why? Nobody can \nanswer the question ``Why?'' As a matter of fact, 2 months ago, I \noffered an amendment on this floor that asked of us to have the CRS \ntell us before we pass a new bill whether we are adding another \nduplicative program. Because that was a rule change, it required 67 \nvotes, and 40 of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle said: We \ndo not want to know whether we are creating another duplicative \nprogram, so it only got 60 votes. It required 67 and, therefore, we are \nnot doing it.\n  So we are going to ignore the brains, we are going to ignore the \nknowledge, and we are going to continue to produce and create duplicate \nprograms.\n  Teacher quality. This is one of my favorites. We have 82 separate \nteacher training programs run by the Federal Government, not for \nFederal teachers, for State teachers.\n  Eighty-two separate programs, and not one of them has been tested to \nsee if it is effective or efficient, whether it has value, whether we \nactually get anything out of it, whether there is some teacher \nimprovement coming out of it--and that is run from seven different \nagencies.\n  First of all, why would you have any teacher programs other than at \nthe Department of Education? Yet we have 82. Nobody can tell me why. \nNobody will stand on the floor and defend the fact that we have 82. \nBecause they realize it is the height of stupidity. It is stupid to do \nmultiple programs in multiple directions and waste the overhead. We are \nnot talking about not sending money.\n  We have 47 job training programs. We are in the midst of releasing a \nreport on all the job training programs as to\n\n[[Page S1513]]\n\nhow they affect Oklahoma, and I will tell you it is not a pretty \npicture.\n  There is so much waste, so much ineffectiveness through those 47 \ndifferent job training programs. We are spending $19 billion of \nAmericans' money every year and we are not getting a billion dollars' \nworth of benefit out of it. But nobody wants to do the hard work, \nnobody wants to stand and defend those 47 job training programs, but \nnobody wants to eliminate them either.\n  We have a real problem. This is a first step, a first amendment, \nwhere we can make this bill--by the way, we are having trouble paying \nfor the highway bill. We are going to pay for it--2 years' worth of \nhighway spending--with 10 years' worth of reductions. This amendment \nalone, if we pass it, will pay for the highway bill differential \nbetween the trust fund and what the EPW Committee says we ought to be \nspending on highways--this amendment alone.\n  So when somebody comes down and says they are not going to vote for \nus to eliminate duplication, you have to ask why. Why is it we would \nnot want to eliminate duplication? Why is it we would not want to \nbecome efficient and effective in terms of how we spend not our money \nbut our children's money? Because 40 cents--38 cents this year--of \nevery $1 we spend we are tacking on to a decreased standard of living \nfor our children in everything we do.\n  So tell me why somebody would not want to get rid of some of the \nduplication, would not want to do the commonsense thing that every one \nof the rest of us in our own personal lives does, all our State \ngovernments do, all our personal businesses and all our public \ncompanies are doing: doing more with less every year? The easiest way \nto do that is to consolidate and eliminate duplication.\n  So when you see the vote today, if it does not get 60 votes, what \nshould the American people learn from that? Here is what they should \nlearn: It is not about gridlock. It is not about partisanship. It is \nabout incompetence and a lack of thoughtful consideration for the \npeople who will follow us. This is easy stuff to do. We have hard stuff \nwe have to do in our country. We are going to be making tons of hard \ndecisions over the next 2 or 3 years. Everyone in this body knows it. \nThey will keep kicking the can down the road, hoping they do not have \nto be involved with the very tough decisions we are going to have to \nmake. This is the easy one. This is easy.\n  I would ask my colleagues to consider this. If you voted for it in \nApril of 2011, I would appreciate your vote again. If you do not vote \nfor it, I would ask you to reconsider why you are here. Are you here to \nperpetuate waste? Are you here to perpetuate incompetence? Are you here \nto protect some constituency's little small program that does not work \nyet wastes your children's future? This is an easy amendment to vote \nfor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, today I come to the floor to speak in \nsupport of Coburn amendment, No. 1738, which I cosponsor. This common \nsense amendment would require the Office of Management and Budget--\nOMB--and the executive branch agencies to reduce at least $10 billion \nby eliminating, consolidating, or streamlining government programs and \nagencies with duplicative and overlapping missions.\n  Thankfully, the Government Accountability Office--GAO--has given \nCongress and the administration a blueprint to reduce duplication and \neliminate failing programs by releasing two detailed reports that \nhighlight 132 areas within the Federal Government that are duplicative \nand if consolidated could save billions. With our Nation facing a $15.4 \ntrillion debt, eliminating inefficiency and waste in the Federal \nGovernment to save taxpayer dollars is absolutely imperative and the \nAmerican people expect us to do so.\n  In the most recent report issued by GAO on February 28, 2012, they \nidentified 32 areas of duplication, overlap and fragmentation \nthroughout the Federal Government, as well as 19 additional areas of \ncost-saving and revenue-enhancement opportunities in Federal programs, \nagencies, offices and initiatives. Of the 32 areas highlighted in the \nreport, GAO identifies 10 dealing specifically with the Department of \nDefense, which include Electronic Warfare programs, Unmanned Aircraft \nSystems, Counter-Improvised Explosive Device Efforts, Defense Language \nand Culture Training, Stabilization, Reconstruction, and Humanitarian \nAssistance Efforts, Health Research Funding, Military and Veterans \nHealth Care, Information Technology Investment Management, Space Launch \nContract Costs, and Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics \nEducation--STEM.\n  In addition to the 10 defense areas mentioned above, GAO also \nhighlights 6 areas where the Defense Department could reduce its \noperating costs or increase revenue collections for the Treasury.\n  With new, emerging threats to national security arising every day, \nthe funding needed to support major defense priorities is declining. \nFor this reason, in my view, the Department must implement each of \nGAO's recommendations in this report. Also, implementing these \nrecommendations may reduce the need for ``catastrophic'' defense cuts \nrequired under ``sequestration''--precipitated by Congress' failure to \nenact $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction under the Budget Control Act \nof 2011.\n  I intend to send a letter to Secretary of Defense Panetta asking him \nto tell me how the Department plans to address these vitally important \nrecommendations. I will continue to monitor the Department's \nimplementation efforts and will take necessary steps, including \nlegislative action where appropriate, to ensure their implementation.\n  The Federal Government wastes billions a year on programs with \nduplicative and overlapping missions. Congress and the administration \nmust ensure that the findings in the two GAO reports do not go to \nwaste. Congress should insist that they are implemented to reduce \nspending and eliminate duplicative and failing programs. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Coburn's amendment No. 1738.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1660\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, we had a discussion, a very important \ndiscussion--I know the Presiding Officer cares a great deal about this \ntopic, as well as Senator Collins and also Senator Boxer--on this issue \nabout boilers. I want to be clear about what is at issue in this \ndebate.\n  The debate about boilers stems from the fact that the EPA did not \noriginally get the boiler rules right. The agency admitted they did not \nget them right, and the agency said they needed 15 months to fix the \nboiler rules. But the courts said the agency could not have the time. \nThey said that EPA could have 30 days to fix the rules.\n  As colleagues have said, this debate has gone on for so long there is \nno way it is going to be turned around in 30 days. So I joined in the \nlegislation to give the EPA 15 months to rewrite the rules so as to \nprotect good-paying jobs and communities that are affected by the \nboiler rules, while ensuring the health of our people and the \nprotection of our environment.\n  That was 15 months ago. EPA got the time it said it needed to rewrite \nthe rules, and the new final rules will be out within 90 days. I wish \nto outline for the Senate what the new rules will do.\n  First, the new rules, as proposed in the legislation, change what \nconstitutes solid waste so that boiler fuels, for example, that are \nwood waste can be used for fuels such as biomass; and waste from steel \nmills, as another example, can be used as a fuel, as they are today, \nrather than to be regulated out of existence as a fuel source.\n  Second, as proposed in the legislation, the new rules will create an \nopen-to-the-public list of what can and cannot be burned in a boiler. \nThis is going to provide important predictability and certainty to \nAmerican industry, and it will provide new accountability to our \ncommunities. All across the United States, folks are going to be able \nto know, as a result of these new rules, what can and cannot be \nactually burned in a boiler.\n  Third, again, just like the legislation, the rules address the fact \nthat because EPA was unable to get the rules right at the outset, more \ntime is needed for compliance.\n  I know the distinguished Presiding Officer has been interested in \nthis issue as well: the question of compliance and\n\n[[Page S1514]]\n\nthe time that would be provided for industries to meet the standards.\n  In the final rule, the compliance clock is reset with a rule \nproviding additional time for industry to comply. This is like what was \nin the original legislation. So industry will have 4 years to comply, \nand Administrator Jackson stated in writing that she will assist any \nhard-hit community, any company facing extra duress in terms of \ncomplying. Administrator Jackson has indicated on a case-by-case basis \nshe will provide additional time to help those communities and to help \nthose companies.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Administrator's \nletter to me be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       United States Environmental\n\n\n                                            Protection Agency,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 5, 2012.\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wyden: Thank you for your continuing interest \n     in the air toxics standards for boilers. We are currently in \n     the process of developing final standards and responding to \n     additional, useful information we received during the public \n     comment period on the reconsidered standards we proposed last \n     December. We intend to finalize the standards this spring. In \n     the proposal, EPA proposed to ``reset'' the three year \n     compliance clock to give entities the full amount of time \n     available under the Clean Air Act upon finalization of the \n     rule, and, subject to the formal rulemaking process, expects \n     to do so in the final rule. The Act also gives state and \n     local permitting authorities the ability to provide up to a \n     one-year extension of that deadline, on a case-by-case basis, \n     as necessary, for the installation of controls.\n       While EPA believes facilities can meet compliance \n     requirements within the four years described above, I commit \n     to you that EPA will handle each situation on a case-by-case \n     basis, and work with facilities to determine the appropriate \n     response and resolution. We have authority available to us to \n     resolve concerns that might arise at individual facilities as \n     long as appropriate and timely steps are being taken towards \n     compliance.\n       Additionally, as required by the Clean Air Act, we proposed \n     and will finalize air toxic standards for boilers based on \n     real-life data that industry has provided to us about the \n     level of emissions from their facilities. As EPA reviews the \n     public comments and data as we finalize these standards, we \n     will pay close attention to their achievability. We intend to \n     set standards that can be met by plants operating in the real \n     world.\n       Again, thank you for your continued attention to this \n     matter. It is important to ensure that we achieve these key \n     public health standards in a way that is sensitive to \n     legitimate needs of business interests. If you have \n     additional questions, please feel free to contact me or have \n     your staff contact Arvin Ganesan, Associate Administrator for \n     Congressional and Intergovernmental Relations at (202) 564 \n     5200.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Lisa P. Jackson.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. I want to address the discussion we heard from our \ncolleagues, particularly Senator Collins and Senator Boxer, on the key \npoint.\n  The changes I have described--the fact that we have made the rules \nchanges so that so many of these materials will be treated as fuels, \nwhich is important in timber country that I and the distinguished \nPresiding Officer represent; the fact that we have this new process \nthat provides predictability and certainty about what can be burned in \na boiler; the fact that there is the additional time--all of this, in \nmy view, has been spurred by the legislation introduced by the Senator \nfrom Maine, Ms. Collins. We ought to make no mistake about it. The \nimportant rules changes I have outlined this morning that I think are \ngoing to provide certainty and predictability to our businesses--while \nat the same time protecting the health of our people, the environment \nof our country--have been spurred because Senator Collins was willing \nto pick up the challenge and address this issue.\n  These new rules are going to finally take effect in less than 90 \ndays. But the question I would ask Senators is, who knows what will \nhappen to these important rules that are just about ready for \nimplementation if, in effect, we say, as the amendment does, let's go \nback to the beginning and talk about addressing this again over 15 \nmonths?\n  If the amendment passes, and the EPA is told--as I have been advised \nunder the text of the amendment--to take another 15 months, in my view, \nwhat would happen is, the agency would go back to spending this \nadditional time working to try to get to the point where we are today.\n  That, in my view, just does not add up. It does not add up for the \nindustries that have been concerned about this. It does not add up for \nthe communities. It does not add up for the health of our people and \nthe protection of our environment.\n  Let me close with this. Having been involved in the legislation, No. \n1, having tried to make clear this afternoon that these important \nrules, in my view, have been spurred by the legislation Senator Collins \nhas talked about, I wished to state that I intend, and I know others in \nthe Senate will do as well, to watchdog the rules that will be out \nshortly every step of the way to ensure that they are fully \nimplemented, to hold the Environmental Protection Agency to the \ncommitments that have been made in these rules that are forthcoming, \nand to ensure that all our communities--all our communities--can see \nthat finally this issue is being addressed and it is being addressed in \na way that makes sense for the jobs we are going to need in our \ncommunities and to the public health and the environment.\n  I hope colleagues will look finally at the letter Administrator \nJackson has sent me. I think it addresses, in particular, the timetable \nso many Senators have been concerned about. I have tried to outline \nsome of the other issues that I think are critical, particularly the \nfact that we have the changes in the definition of solid waste that is \nso important. A whole host of materials have been added to that list of \nfuels. That means we can protect the jobs that stem from countries that \nuse--the products that use these materials and at the same time protect \nthe environment.\n  So this makes sense from the standpoint of a realistic rule on what \nconstitutes a fuel, openness and transparency, because the American \npeople will see what actually can be burned in a boiler. To me--and \nSenator Boxer has touched on this question of the years that have \nalready gone into this effort--Administrator Jackson, in my view, has \ngone to substantial lengths to address this timetable that industry has \nbeen so concerned about.\n  In fact, I think it is fair to say that when I add what she has \ncommitted to, it is almost the same timetable as in her original \nlegislation. So why in the world would we want to set aside those rules \nand go back again to the period of starting a new 15-month clock, only \nto see, in my view, that after those additional 15 months, we would be \nback to the place we are today, in terms of the rules that will be \nshortly implemented.\n  I urge the Senate to reject the amendment. We are going to continue \nto watchdog this issue until these rules are fully implemented.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I am very happy to see we are making \nprogress. I still continue to believe that these controversial \namendments did not have to be on this bill. But having said that, we \nhave our agreement. So our understanding is, I want for all Senators to \nsay our hope is to begin voting sometime around the 2 to 2:30 timeframe \nand to do a great number of votes at that time, maybe as many as 8, 9, \n10 votes.\n  We are waiting for people to come to the floor to speak on different \namendments. We expect that Senator Hoeven will be here shortly to call \nup amendment No. 1537. We urge him to do that.\n  Senator Merkley wants to speak on the underlying bill. Senator Corker \nwants to speak for 10 minutes at approximately 12:45. Senator Inouye \nwould like to address us for 10 minutes about one. Senator Lautenberg \nwants to speak about the environmental amendments about 1:15, and \nSenator Landrieu wants to talk about a number of things but \nparticularly the RESTORE Act, I would assume, at 1:15. Senator Sanders \nwants to speak on the issue of Keystone. Senator Durbin also has some \ncomments he wanted to make.\n  So I would urge colleagues, if you wish to speak before we start \nvoting, now would be a very good time. We hope you will come over here. \nWe are making progress. This has been a very convoluted process, a very \ndifficult process to satisfy everyone. Of course, we cannot satisfy \neveryone. But Senator Inhofe and I, when we wrote the\n\n[[Page S1515]]\n\nbill originally, knew he would not get everything he wanted and I \ncertainly would not get what I wanted. We had to find those sweet spots \nwhere we could come together. That is what happened. The other \ncommittees did a wonderful job in doing the same: The Banking \nCommittee, unanimous in their part of this bill; Commerce had some \nbumps, but they resolved those bumps in the road and now they are \nbipartisan; Finance Committee, that is a tough one. They had to raise \nfunds to put into the trust fund. The trust fund needs some more \ndollars in it.\n  I see Senator Hoeven is here. I am so delighted that he is here to \nlay down his amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1537\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I am waiting for my associate who has \nsome charts, but I certainly can proceed at this point. I am here to \nspeak in regard to my amendment No. 1537, which is at the desk. I ask \nunanimous consent that it be reported by number.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Hoeven], for himself, \n     Mr. Lugar, Mr. Vitter, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Johanns, and Mr. \n     Hatch, proposes an amendment numbered 1537.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To approve the Keystone XL pipeline project and provide for \n           environmental protection and government oversight)\n\n       On page 469, after line 22, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

This is an amendment that would provide for approval of \nthe Keystone Pipeline project. Congress has, under the commerce clause \nof the Constitution, express authority to regulate commerce with \nforeign countries. That provides the very clear constitutional \nauthority for Congress to approve the Keystone Pipeline project. That \nis something we absolutely need to do.\n  Today there will be a very clear choice. There will be a very clear \nchoice for the Members of the Senate. Make no mistake, I do not want to \nleave any doubt. This is a clear choice. My amendment provides that the \nKeystone Pipeline project will move forward, authorized by Congress. It \nis very clear that all the protections, all the environmental \nprotections are incorporated, as has been provided over 3\\1/2\\ years--\n3\\1/2\\ years this project has been under review by the EPA, by the \nDepartment of State, by this administration. They have gone through not \none but two environmental impact statement processes.\n  They have met all the environmental requirements. Our legislation \nincorporates all that and in addition provides whatever time is \nnecessary for rerouting the pipeline through the State of Nebraska. \nHere is a schematic of the project. The one issue in terms of the\n\n[[Page S1516]]\n\nrouting was through the State of Nebraska. This legislation provides \nwhatever time is necessary for the Nebraska Department of Environmental \nQuality to work with State, to work with EPA, and reroute the pipeline \nthrough the State of Nebraska.\n  So my point is, we incorporate all necessary environmental safeguards \ninto the project. But it authorizes that the project, after 3\\1/2\\ \nyears, can go forward. So I would like to talk for just a minute about \nwhy that is so important. Because there is another amendment, an \nalternative that has been presented by Senator Wyden. That amendment--\nlet me be clear. That amendment will block this project. That amendment \nwill block this project. Let there be no confusion.\n  The Hoeven-Lugar-Vitter amendment will advance the project. The \namendment that is being put forward by my esteemed colleague Senator \nWyden as a Democratic alternative, that will block the project. This is \na clear choice. Nobody should be confused.\n  Gas prices. This chart is a few days old. So it is a little bit \nbehind the curve. But since this administration took office, gas prices \nhave gone from $1.85 a gallon--more than doubled--to $3.70 a gallon. \nThis is a little bit old, so the national average is actually higher. \nThe last time I checked it was $3.76 a gallon, going up. So it is \nprobably higher than that today. That is from AAA.\n  The projections are that gasoline prices will be $4 a gallon by \nMemorial Day and possibly more than $5 a gallon later this summer. That \nmeans every American is paying that at the pump. They are paying that \nat the pump. That is affecting our American consumers. That is \naffecting our businesses. That is affecting our economy.\n  What is the administration doing about it? What is Congress doing \nabout it? The Obama administration has said, when it comes to energy, \nwe are going to have an all-of-the-above strategy. I agree with that. \nWe should have an all-of-the-above strategy. But the point is, we \ncannot just say it. We have to do it. We cannot just say it. We have to \ndo it. The administration, at this point, not only are they just saying \nit and not doing it, they are, in fact, blocking it. I am giving you as \nclear an example as I can think of. I do not know how it could be any \nclearer that they are blocking energy development in our country.\n  This pipeline project would bring 830,000 barrels a day of crude oil \nto our country. That is more than 700,000 barrels a day from Canada. \nThat is more than 100,000 barrels a day from my home State of North \nDakota and our sister State Montana--830,000 barrels a day of product \ncoming to our refineries.\n  The administration has said no to this project. They continue to say \nno to the project. They have approved this portion of it. That does not \nbring one single drop of product to our country. So I do not know. They \nare kind of confused about exactly what they are doing, but they \ncontinue to block this project. So that means 830,000 barrels a day \nthat we have to get from the Middle East. Everybody knows what is going \non in the Middle East. They have incredible turmoil. They have \nincredible tension in the Middle East. Iran may close the Strait of \nHormuz; they have threatened to do that. As a result, crude oil prices \ncontinue to go up and consumers continue to pay more at the pump.\n  So in the face of all that, in the face of real hardship to working \nAmericans, the administration is saying no to this project. They are \nsaying no to my home State of North Dakota. They are saying no to \nMontana. They are saying, no, we are not going to allow them to build \nthis project that gets that product to market and no to Canada, saying \nwe are not going to allow them to bring that oil into the United \nStates, instead they are going to have to send it to China and we are \ngoing to get oil from the Middle East and our consumers are going to \ncontinue to pay higher prices.\n  Again, make no mistake. This choice today is a choice. It is a choice \nwhether we vote for an amendment to move forward with this project or \nwhether we vote for an amendment to block the project. Again, there \nshould be no confusion about that.\n  Why would the administration hold up this project? Why in the world, \nwith gas prices we know going to $4, maybe $5 a gallon, why in the \nworld would anyone oppose the project? The opponents have put forward \nthree arguments. So let's go through them. Let's go through them and \nsee if they hold water. Let's see if they pass muster. Let's see if \nthey make sense.\n  The first argument is that somehow this pipeline is going to leak.\n  Now here is the route. Somehow we will build this pipeline that is \ngoing to leak. But we built a sister project that is working just fine. \nThere have been no underground leaks in that project. While building \nit, there were minimal leaks as they put it together, and that was in \nthe normal course of construction. But there have been no other ground \nleaks from this sister pipeline. It is working fine. So why would this \none be a big concern about leaking? It doesn't make much sense.\n  If you don't buy that, just look at this chart and the network of \npipelines in this country that carries oil and gas. There are thousands \nof pipelines, millions of miles of pipeline right now operating in this \ncountry right through the very region through which the Keystone XL \nPipeline would pass. But somehow this one is a problem and these \nthousands are not? That is a reason to say no, after 3\\1/2\\ years? Come \non. That doesn't pass anybody's test, and it doesn't make any sense.\n  The second argument that has been put forward is that the crude oil \nwill come from Canada, and it will be then exported to China; we won't \nuse it in the United States; and it won't help with gas prices. For \nstarters, let's use some common sense on that one. I am pretty sure if \nwe don't build the pipeline, it is for sure going to China. That is \njust flat-out common sense, for starters.\n  Even beyond that, the Department of Energy for this administration \ndid a study in June of last year. In that study, they said the oil will \nbe used in this country, and it will--not ``may'' but ``will''--lower \ngas prices on the east coast, the gulf coast, and in the Midwest. I had \nSecretary Chu in front of me at one of our hearings, and he \nacknowledged that, in fact, that is what the Department of Energy of \nthis administration provided--that the product will be used here, that \nwe are going to need more crude, and it will lower gas prices. Of \ncourse, that just stands to reason, doesn't it? If we are importing 30 \npercent of our oil from the Middle East today, obviously, we are going \nto continue to need crude from outside our borders.\n  Let's go to the third argument I have heard against the pipeline \nproject, which is that Canada should not produce oil in the Canadian \noil sands. The reason: Greenhouse gas emissions are 6 percent higher \nthan conventional, and that the excavating process has a negative \nimpact on the boreal forest.\n  Let's deal with the real situation, the current situation. The \ncurrent situation is that 80 percent of the development in the Canadian \noil sands is in situ--80 percent. What does that mean? That means \ndrilling--not excavating but drilling--like we do in the United States. \nSo you have about the same footprint in gas emissions as conventional \ndrilling. Those arguments don't hold muster.\n  Here we are faced with a very clear choice. Do we go ahead and get \noil from our closest friends and trading partner, Canada, or say no to \nthem and have them send it to China? Do we reduce our dependence on \nMiddle Eastern oil and reduce the price of gas for hard-working \nAmerican consumers? How about national security? Would you rather rely \non oil from the Middle East or from Canada? Would you rather have oil \nproduced here, in North Dakota, Montana, and in Canada, or would you \nrather get it from the Middle East?\n  I know how Americans will answer that question. I am looking forward \nto seeing how the Senate answers that question and how the \nadministration answers that question.\n  Again, this is a clear choice. These amendments are clear. They are \nnot similar. One is for the project; the other is against the project. \nThe amendment that my esteemed colleague has put forward, the Democrat \nalternative, will block the project. It says after 3\\1/2\\ years of \nstudy, start over. After 3\\1/2\\ years of studying this project, start \nover.\n  What does that mean? Another 3\\1/2\\ years before we build it or \nanother 5\n\n[[Page S1517]]\n\nyears? How long do we have to study vital infrastructure projects \nbefore we can build them?\n  Do you think that might be one of the problems with our economy? Do \nyou think that might be one of the problems with energy development? \nThat is where it starts, by saying: TransCanada, start over, after 3\\1/\n2\\ years.\n  Then it adds additional impediments. What are they? Well, it says, \nfor starters, none of the crude and none of the refined product can be \nexported from this country--not one drop. We cannot export any of it. \nThe reality is there are refined products that we don't even use in \nthis country. You can't. They are some of the coking products, and so \non and so forth. There isn't demand or we cannot use them. If the \nrefineries cannot sell them, they have to recoup that revenue stream. \nHow? When they sell gasoline and diesel in our country. That pushes \ngasoline prices higher when they are already going higher by the day. \nDoes that make sense to anybody? I don't think so.\n  Another impediment in the legislation is that not one penny of the \ninputs can come from outside the United States, even though 75 percent \nof the steel and 90 percent of all of the other materials in this \nmultibillion-dollar project, paid for by private enterprise--75 percent \nof the steel and 90 percent of the other inputs come from North \nAmerica. But that is not good enough. We are going to say every single \npenny of the inputs has to be bought in the United States. Of course, \nthe companies cannot do that because they have already bought a lot of \nthe steel and other materials. It is just a way to block the project.\n  Think about that absurd level of protectionism. Are we really going \nto grow our economy, create a lot of good jobs with that kind of \nprotectionism? We cannot import anything and we cannot export anything, \nwe are going to grow and expand and diversify this American economy and \nput people to work, and we are going to raise income with that \napproach? I don't think so.\n  Again, I go back to where I started. We have a clear choice to make, \na very clear choice. We can stand with the people of America, stand \nwith the workers, with the families, with the small business, and we \ncan work to grow our economy and create jobs, and we can work to \nstrengthen our national security or we can choose to say: No, we are \ngoing to continue to rely on oil from the Middle East. We are not going \nto increase supply, and we are not only going to turn down Canada, we \nare going to turn down our States such as North Dakota and Montana and \nsay we would rather get that oil from the Middle East.\n  Today we have a clear choice about building a better energy future \nfor our country, more jobs, and more security. I ask my colleagues to \nvote for the amendment I have put forward, to move the Keystone \nPipeline project authority forward so they can advance the project, and \nvote against the amendment offered as a Democratic alternative, which \nwill block the project.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1817\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I have filed an alternative to the \namendment offered by my friend from North Dakota. I ask unanimous \nconsent to call up amendment No. 1817.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Wyden] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1817.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To ensure the expeditious processing of Keystone XL permit \napplications consistent with current law, prohibit the export of crude \noil produced in Canada and transported by the Keystone XL pipeline and \n related facilities unless the prohibition is waived by the President, \n  and require the use of United States iron, steel, and manufactured \n   goods in the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and related \n                  facilities with certain exceptions)\n\n       At the end of subtitle E of title I of division A, add the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. __. KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE.\n\n       (a) Administration.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as otherwise specifically provided \n     in this section, nothing in this section affects any \n     applicable Federal requirements in connection with the \n     Keystone XL pipeline (including facilities for the import of \n     crude oil and other hydrocarbons at the United States-Canada \n     Border at Phillips County, Montana).\n       (2) Expeditious analyses and permit decisions.--In \n     evaluating any new permit applications that may be submitted \n     related to the Keystone XL pipeline and facilities described \n     in paragraph (1) or in carrying out the activities described \n     in this section, the President or a designee of the President \n     shall--\n       (A) act as expeditiously as practicable and, to the maximum \n     extent practicable and consistent with current law, use \n     existing analyses relating to those pipeline and facilities, \n     including the environmental impact statement issued by the \n     Department of State regarding the Keystone XL pipeline on \n     August 26, 2011; and\n       (B) issue a decision on any permit application not later \n     than 90 days after the date on which all analyses and other \n     actions required by current law and applicable Executive \n     Orders are completed.\n       (b) Prohibition on Exports.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), no crude oil \n     produced in Canada and transported by the Keystone XL \n     pipeline or facilities described in subsection (a)(1), or \n     petroleum products derived from the crude oil, may be \n     exported from the United States.\n       (2) Waivers.--The President may grant a waiver from the \n     application of paragraph (1) if the President--\n       (A) determines that the waiver is necessary as the result \n     of--\n       (i) national security; or\n       (ii) a natural or manmade disaster; or\n       (B) makes an express finding that the exports described in \n     paragraph (1)--\n       (i) will not diminish the total quantity or quality of \n     petroleum available in the United States; and\n       (ii) are in the national interest of the United States.\n       (c) Use of United States Iron, Steel, and Manufactured \n     Goods.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraphs (2) through (4), the \n     construction, connection, operation, or maintenance of the \n     Keystone XL pipeline and facilities described in subsection \n     (a)(1) shall not be permitted unless all of the iron, steel, \n     and manufactured goods used for the pipeline and facilities \n     are produced in the United States.\n       (2) Nonapplication.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply if the \n     President or a delegate finds that--\n       (A) applying paragraph (1) would be inconsistent with the \n     public interest;\n       (B) iron, steel, and the applicable manufactured goods are \n     not produced in the United States in sufficient and \n     reasonably available quantities with a satisfactory quality; \n     or\n       (C) inclusion of iron, steel, and manufactured goods \n     produced in the United States will increase the cost of the \n     overall pipeline and facilities by more than 25 percent.\n       (3) Rationale.--If the President or a delegate determines \n     that it is necessary to waive the application of paragraph \n     (1) based on a finding under paragraph (2), the President or \n     delegate shall publish in the Federal Register a detailed \n     written justification for the waiver.\n       (4) International agreements.--This subsection shall be \n     applied in a manner consistent with United States obligations \n     under international agreements.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I yield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I rise to speak about the highway bill. \nI want to start by first thanking the chairmen and ranking members of \nthe EPW Committee, the Commerce Committee, and the Banking Committee, \nall of whom worked to put in place some reforms this bill reflects. \nThere is a component of this bill, though, where work has not been done \nin a satisfactory manner, and that is actually paying for this bill.\n  The Senator from North Carolina, who is in the chair, has been \ninvolved in many discussions about deficit reduction. We have had, ad \nnauseam, meetings about how to get our spending under control. Last \nyear, after Erskine Bowles, from her State, and Alan Simpson came \ntogether with the Bowles-Simpson report, there was a pretty big effort \nin this body to try to adopt the principles laid out therein. As a \nmatter of fact, 32 Republicans and 32 Democrats sent a letter to the \nPresident asking him to embrace those principles.\n  Later on there was another effort by a supercommittee that was put in \nplace. Numbers of people on both sides of the aisle wrote letters \nasking that this supercommittee do something outstanding for our \ncountry and reduce the deficit by $4 trillion, if possible.\n  My point is that there has been a lot of bipartisan effort toward \nreducing the deficit. Yet the only thing we have done thus far--the \nonly thing that had any meat on it at all was the Budget Control Act, \nwhich was passed on August 2. The Budget Control Act was passed in a \ntrade, if you will. At that time, the country's debt was beyond the \ndebt ceiling that was allowed by law. So in order to raise the debt \nceiling, there was an agreement reached by\n\n[[Page S1518]]\n\nthis body to lower the amount of spending that was going to take place \nover the next 2 years by an equal amount.\n  We passed on August 2 of last year the Budget Control Act. That act \nlaid out specifically what we were supposed to do to be responsible in \nreducing our spending. Again, this is something that was passed in a \nvery bipartisan way.\n  As part of that process, because we have not passed a budget in some \ntime, there was a budget resolution--there was a deeming process that \nwas put into place as part of the Budget Control Act. Chairman Conrad \nlaid that down right after the fact, and we are governed by that deemed \nresolution in this body.\n  Unbelievably, we have this very popular program. The highway bill is \nsomething people on both sides of the aisle strongly support. I want to \nsee a highway bill. I was the mayor of a city, and I understand and \nknow how important highway infrastructure and transit spending is to \nthis country. Unbelievably, with a very highly supported bill, what \nthis body is doing is already violating the spending levels that were \ndeemed by virtue of the Budget Control Act passing and a budget \nresolution that came thereafter.\n\n  What I say is that this body already--7 months after this Nation, and \nactually the world, watched as we wrestled with our debt ceiling--they \nwatched us pass the Budget Control Act. They knew it had a deeming \nprocess that took place, where a budget resolution was deemed. We are \nalready in violation of that.\n  All I am doing is asking the Members of this body--so many of us, in \na bipartisan way, have risen and said we have to do these things to get \nour spending under control, to control deficits. So many of us took \ntremendous heat in voting for this debt ceiling that took place last \nAugust. Yet to this body, in passing a very popular bill that we would \nthink would cause us to want to prioritize and say: OK, we do need to \nspend money on highways, so therefore let's spend less on something \nelse, this is a very important piece of legislation. I thank the \nchairman of the EPW Committee for the reforms that have been put in \nplace and the way their committee worked in a bipartisan way. These \ncomments this morning have nothing to do with the work the EPW \nCommittee did.\n\n  The fact is, we are not paying for this piece of legislation in the \nappropriate way, per the guidelines we laid down as a part of the \nprocess put in place by the Budget Control Act. To me, that is \nabsolutely irresponsible, especially when you look at the spending \nlevels that are above that deemed budget resolution. So at this time I \nwant to offer a point of order. I know the chairman is back, and I have \nbeen filibustering slightly until she got here.\n  Madam President, the pending measure, S. 1813, as amended, will \nexceed the aggregate level of budget authority and outlays for fiscal \nyear 2012 as set out in the most recent budget resolution deemed by the \nBudget Control Act of 2011; therefore, I raise a point of order under \nsection 311(a)2(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, with great respect to my friend, and I \nappreciate his opinion on this, this bill is paid for. It is paid for \nthrough the highway trust fund, and it is paid for through bipartisan \nwork in the Finance Committee, which has worked overtime to come up \nwith a plan to ensure this trust fund has enough in it to support the \nwork we need to do to fix our bridges and our highways and to support \n1.8 million jobs and more than 11,000 businesses out there, as well as \nthe real possibility of creating an additional 1 million jobs with an \nenhanced program we call TIFIA, which leverages Federal funds.\n  So, Madam President, with due respect but pursuant to section 904 of \nthe Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the waiver provisions of \napplicable budget resolutions, and section 4(g)(3) of the Statutory \nPay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, I move to waive all applicable sections of \nthose acts and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of the \npending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1785\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, the amendment of the junior Senator from \nTennessee would lower the nondefense discretionary cap established in \nthe Budget Control Act by $20 billion in order to offset transfers from \nthe general fund necessary to replenish the highway trust fund. This \namendment is a clear violation of the Budget Control Act we agreed on \nless than a year ago. In simple terms, the amendment would impose a 4-\npercent cut to nondefense discretionary spending in order to pay for a \nshortfall in mandatory spending.\n  I wish to remind my colleagues that discretionary spending will rise \nat a rate less than the rate of inflation over the next decade, and \nthat is according to CBO. Mandatory spending, on the other hand, is \nslated to rise at three times the rate of inflation. Clearly, if there \nis a desire to offset one area of mandatory spending, the place to find \nsuch an offset should be on the very same mandatory side of the \nspending ledger.\n  In an op-ed published in the Washington Post yesterday, Senator \nCorker said that finding an offset for the highway trust fund was a \nsmall step toward fiscal responsibility and that we should all support \nthis amendment. But in the opening portion of the editorial, the \nSenator noted the solid bipartisan support in the Senate for a balanced \napproach to real deficit reduction. This balanced approach would \ninclude revenues, mandatory spending, and discretionary spending.\n  I agree with the Senator that only a balanced approach would truly \nsolve our long-term challenges. Yet, in this amendment, what do we \nfind? Cuts. Nothing but cuts to nondefense discretionary spending. No \nrevenues, no mandatory spending, just the same approach we have seen \nagain and again from our Republican colleagues--cut discretionary now, \nand we will do other things at a time to be determined later. Even the \nRyan budget did nothing to Social Security or Medicare for 10 years. \nBut the cuts to discretionary spending and to Medicaid Programs that \nsave the lives of hundreds of thousands of elderly and children living \nin poverty took effect immediately, not in 10 years. And that is the \napproach of this amendment.\n  Clearly, there was an opportunity here to present a balanced \napproach. The Senator could have proposed modest cuts to spending, with \nincreased revenue and changes in the rules that would lead to a fully \nfunded highway trust fund for years to come. But that would require \nhard work and compromise, and this amendment requires neither.\n  Across-the-board cuts to discretionary spending are easy. This \namendment is one page. Change one number, and that is it--we can all go \nhome and say what a great job we have done cutting down. But the truth \nis, when it comes time to implement these cuts, agencies will be forced \nto look at reductions in force, at deferring desperately needed \nmaintenance and repairs, and if you were considering upgrading your \ntechnology to better serve the American people, you can forget about \nit. Four percent is no small matter, coming on top of flat budgets for \nthe past 2 years and with no increase for inflation or population \ngrowth.\n  As with so many amendments we have seen this past year, nondefense \nspending is again targeted not because it is good policy but because it \nis an easy policy. As I have done on each of these past occasions, I \nonce again urge my colleagues to reject these unreasonable and reckless \ncuts and to vote no on the Corker amendment.\n  Madam President, if I may, I would like to speak on another \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1738\n\n  Madam President, in September of 2011, this Senate rejected an \namendment very similar to the one offered today by the junior Senator \nfrom Oklahoma. At that time, Members saw this amendment as a backdoor \nattempt to remove more from discretionary accounts than had been agreed \nthrough the deficit reduction deal. Nothing has changed in the \nintervening 6 months, and we should again reject this amendment for the \nsame reason: It violates\n\n[[Page S1519]]\n\nthe deficit reduction agreement reached last fall.\n  Senator Coburn claims that the purpose of this amendment is to reduce \nduplicative programs. In reality, the amendment would require a $10 \nbillion reduction in existing discretionary caps regardless of whether \nthere is actually $10 billion in discretionary savings from \nconsolidating duplicative programs that can be identified only by the \nOMB. Further, the $10 billion figure is completely arbitrary and almost \ncertainly will not be reached. In fact, there is no methodology or \nspecificity that verifies that there is, in fact, $10 billion in \ndiscretionary savings to be found.\n  The Senator's amendment cites two reports from the Government \nAccountability Office--the GAO--on how programs that may be duplicative \nor somewhat duplicative could be streamlined or eliminated. What the \nSenator fails to mention is that the GAO, in its recent report, notes \nthat on 81 issues it raised last year, the Congress or the executive \nbranch has begun to respond to all but 17 of the issues raised. This \namendment also ignores the fact that the majority of the items on which \nno action has been taken are unrelated to discretionary spending but \ncover revenues and mandatory spending.\n\n  Moreover, in reviewing the details of the tens of billions that GAO \nindicates might be saved by eliminating duplication, it is apparent in \nthose areas in which GAO has provided somewhat auditable estimates that \nthe bulk of the savings are in three categories. These categories are \nraising revenues, cutting mandatory spending, and cutting defense. For \nexample, 18 recommendations in 2 reports would come by cutting defense \nprograms, including military retirement, health care, and military \ncompensation. Furthermore, $2.5 billion in annual savings would come \nfrom Social Security and at least $10 billion from eliminating tax \nexpenditures or making other changes to the Tax Code.\n  Madam President, my colleagues on the other side have not \ndemonstrated any zeal for cutting defense or raising revenues. Frankly, \nneither side has expressed much willingness to cut mandatory spending. \nInstead of targeting tax increases or mandatory spending, this \namendment once again goes after the easy target, which is domestic \ndiscretionary spending--the same target that is attacked time after \ntime even though it only represents 15 percent of Federal spending.\n  So we have once again an amendment offered by the Senator from \nOklahoma which has become a familiar pattern in the Senate. On its \nface, the amendment might seem to have some value, but the details of \nthe amendment show that the amendment is a Trojan horse--a disguise \nwith a goal of indiscriminate cutting of discretionary spending without \nany real base or justification. In other words, this is simply another \nattempt to circumvent the deal we reached less than a year ago on \nspending cuts for fiscal year 2013. Understanding that Senator Coburn \ndoesn't believe those cuts went deep enough into discretionary \nspending, I and many of my colleagues believe they went too far. But in \nthe end, a deal is a deal. We must honor the agreement reached by \nleadership and signed into law by the President. Is it really in the \nbest interests of the American people or this institution to force vote \nafter vote on discretionary spending levels because one side did not \nget everything they wanted in the Budget Control Act?\n\n  Clearly, the duplicate programs targeted in this amendment are merely \nthe frosting on the cake of spending cuts to any number of programs of \nwhich the Senator does not approve. But let's be clear--the objective \nhere is not better government, it is cutting discretionary funding to \nprograms that Congress supports, hiding under the guise of good \ngovernment.\n  Setting aside the real intent of this amendment, the irony of the \nCoburn amendment is that the amendment itself is redundant and \nduplicative of existing rescission authority which has been in the law \nsince 1974, the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of \n1974. This act has been successful in addressing this very situation.\n  Setting aside this irony, the problem with this amendment is that by \ncircumventing a well-thought-out process that recognizes the checks and \nbalances between the executive branch and the legislative branch, it \nsimply turns over all decisionmaking in terms of which programs are \nduplicative to the Office of Management and Budget with absolutely no \ndeference to Congress and the programs authorized by Congress.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is constant in his efforts to weaken \nCongress's power by shifting our responsibilities to the executive \nbranch, and I will remain constant in pointing out to my colleagues why \nthis is a bad idea. The power of the purse is the single most important \ncheck on the power of the executive branch. Every time we chip away at \nthat power, we chip away at the Founding Fathers' vision of how our \ngovernment should operate. In addition, we are also disregarding our \naccountability to the American public. The Congress should be held \naccountable for the tax dollars we appropriate and the tax dollars we \nrescind.\n  In closing, we should reject this amendment because it makes no sense \nto reinvent the wheel--and in this case, an inferior one--when we are \ntrying to address duplication in government missions. And we should \nreject it because it violates the spirit, if not the letter, of the \nBudget Control Act which was signed into law just 8 months ago. \nFinally, we should oppose this amendment because it fails to attack the \nreal culprits of our economic woes--revenues and mandatory spending. \nTherefore, I urge a ``no'' vote on the Coburn amendment.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 \nminutes equally divided prior to each vote; that all after the first \nvote be 10-minute votes; that the Baucus amendment relative to rural \nschools be listed as No. 1825; further, that if a budget point of order \nis raised against the underlying bill and a motion to waive the budget \npoint of order is made, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on the \nmotion to waive occur today within the sequence of votes this afternoon \nat a time to be determined by the majority leader after consultation \nwith the Republican leader; that the time until 2 p.m. be equally \ndivided between the two leaders or their designees; finally, that \nSenators on the majority side be permitted to speak for up to 5 minutes \neach, and they would be in this order: Lautenberg, Landrieu, Wyden, \nStabenow, and Merkley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n\n\n                           Indiana Tornadoes\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I rise today in support of American jobs \nand national security.\n  First, I would like to take a moment to express my condolences to \nfamilies who have lost loved ones in the tornadoes that struck Indiana \nand other States on March 2.\n  Last weekend Senator Coats and I toured the damaged areas of southern \nIndiana and met with people who are dedicated to a full recovery from \ntotal devastation. I wish to pay special tribute to advanced \npreparedness by the schools and many others that prevented an even \ngreater loss of life. Also, our gratitude goes out to the first \nresponders who are doing amazing work, in some cases while facing their \nown devastating circumstances.\n  I am returning this weekend to encourage the continuing progress \ntoward recovery, and I am working closely with Governor Daniels and \nother State officials to coordinate Federal assistance that is \nappropriate given the level of devastation.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1537\n\n  Madam President, I rise in support of American jobs and national \nsecurity in a very strong way and to encourage my colleagues to support \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline amendment I have offered with Senators Hoeven, \nVitter, and others. The Hoeven-Lugar-Vitter amendment No. 1537 mirrors \nlegislation that 46 Senators from both parties have cosponsored. Let me \ngive special thanks to John Hoeven for his partnership and his \nleadership in this effort.\n  My own advocacy for the Keystone XL pipeline derives from its \nbenefits for national security, job creation, and economic growth. \nKeystone XL will reduce our vulnerability to oil market\n\n[[Page S1520]]\n\nmanipulation by unfriendly foreign regimes, thereby giving our military \nand diplomats more flexibility in addressing national security \npriorities such as stopping Iran's nuclear weapons capability. Keystone \nXL will create thousands of private sector American jobs almost \nimmediately and without taxpayer subsidy. The more than 7 billion \nprivate sector dollars invested for Keystone XL will benefit American \nworkers far beyond those installing the pipeline.\n  Moreover, analysis from the Department of Energy just last year found \nthat oil supplies coming via Keystone XL would most likely lower gas \nprices.\n  President Obama's denial of the Keystone XL pipeline permit is not in \nthe national interest. Americans are screaming for more affordable oil \nsupplies. The irony is that Democratic Senate leadership is calling for \nmore oil from Saudi Arabia even as they continue to oppose oil from \nCanada.\n  The Obama Administration's failure to approve Keystone XL \ndetrimentally impacts Americans today. If the State Department had \nconducted its review in a timely manner of 18 to 24 months, the \nsouthern half of Keystone XL would already have been in operation, \nrelieving the bottleneck currently keeping more affordable U.S. oil \naway from consumers. The remainder of Keystone XL would have been in \noperation any day now, so today's markets, tighter from supply \nreductions in Iran and Sudan, would have had reliable sources online \nsoon. We should not delay needed market liquidity any longer.\n  The Democratic alternative to our legislation would add more delay to \nAmerican jobs, enable a large government overreach into private \nindustry decisions, and jeopardize the jobs of American refinery \nworkers.\n  It is not the normal course of events that Congress would be acting \non a single private sector project. As ranking member of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, for months I encouraged timely evaluation \nof this the project on the merits, even while sharing my own support \nfor its completion. Historically, pipeline applications have been \ntreated in a technocratic matter by both Republican and Democratic \nadministrations. For that reason, Congress has not generally been \ncompelled to assert its constitutional authority over border crossings \nfor oil pipelines as we have for bridges, ports, and immigration.\n  Regrettably, actions by the Obama Administration to first delay and \nthen deny the Keystone XL application point to election year politics \noverwhelming the need for objective consideration of the national \ninterest.\n  In that circumstance, last December 89 Senators voted to pass into \nlaw the Lugar-Hoeven-Vitter legislation, S. 1932, which required \nPresident Obama to conclude more than 3 years of analysis. In other \nwords, we tried to give President Obama a chance to finish the job. \nImmediately upon passage, the White House complained that they did not \nhave sufficient time to make a decision. In reality, the Obama \nAdministration issued a Final Environmental Impact Statement on August \n26, 2011, and pondered the Keystone XL application for 1,217 days \nbefore rejecting it in January.\n  The lengthy delay in permitting Keystone XL is incongruous with our \ncountry's dire need to diversify oil sources and promote job creation. \nThe first Keystone pipeline's permit was granted in 693 days. The Obama \nAdministration approved the Alberta Clipper permit after an 829 day \nreview.\n  Incredibly, even after 1,217 days the Obama Administration still was \nunable to determine the national interest, even at this time when oil \nmarkets are the tightest they have been in years, gas prices are \nsoaring, and unemployment remains at 8.3%.\n  The only reason that has been given for delay is that the Keystone XL \nroute through Nebraska is being shifted to avoid some sensitive areas. \nBenefiting from the diligent efforts of Senator Johanns and his staff, \nthe Hoeven-Lugar-Vitter amendment protects that state process, giving \nNebraskans all the time they need while not unduly holding up \nconstruction in other states. The Federal government need not tell \nNebraskans where to put the pipeline on their territory; our \nlegislation trusts Nebraskans to do what is best for Nebraska.\n  Mr. President, it may surprise some colleagues to learn that it is \nnot the Federal government's role to decide when an oil pipeline should \nbe built or where it will be placed. The primary Federal role is to \nensure safety and environmental standards are met. Our legislation \ncontains safety and environmental requirements in excess of current law \nand already endorsed by 89 Senators in December. With our bill, \nKeystone XL would be perhaps the most advanced oil pipeline in the \ncountry.\n  It is only by virtue of crossing our international border with Canada \nthat Keystone XL came into the unfortunate situation of requiring \nPresidential permission. Our legislation removes the need for an \ninternational border-crossing permit for Keystone XL, which currently \nis required only by Executive Order and not U.S. law. The pipeline \ncould enter the United States at Phillips County, Montana, and nowhere \nelse. In doing so, it recognizes not only that trade in reliable and \naffordable oil with our closest economic and strategic ally is in the \nnational interest, it also recognizes that in large part the U.S. and \nCanadian energy systems are integrated to our mutual advantage.\n  The Hoeven-Lugar-Vitter bill resets evaluation and permitting for all \nportions of the pipeline to where it was before November 11, 2011, when \nthe President announced he would delay a decision for more than a year \nuntil after the 2012 election. The Final Environmental Impact Statement \nissued by the State Department would be reinstated, along with \nassociated Federal permissions. Keystone XL would still be required to \ngo through regular order in receiving permits that it had not received \nprior to that date, including from the Army Corps of Engineers and \nBureau of Land Management.\n  Importantly, our legislation recognizes the vital role of individual \nstates in approving oil pipelines. Keystone XL must have all State \npermissions required by the States that it proposes to cross. That also \napplies to eminent domain, which is the jurisdiction of the States when \nit comes to oil pipelines.\n  I recognize that there is opposition to Keystone XL among certain \nsegments of the environmental community. I take these concerns \nseriously. That is why our legislation contains perhaps the strongest \nenvironmental and safety safeguards for a pipeline ever put into U.S. \nlaw. It reflects work of the State Department, the Transportation \nDepartment, and other Agencies that identified expansive and specific \nrequirements for pipeline construction and operation. TransCanada has \npledged to follow those guidelines, which would have the force of law \nthrough our legislation.\n  In the course of debate we will likely hear a number of Democratic \ncolleagues attest their support for pipelines and for Keystone XL in \nparticular. Surely more will profess their concern for the thousands of \nworkers that would earn incomes with Keystone XL, as well as for the \nnumerous unions that support them. I have no doubt that many Senators, \nregardless of party affiliation, share those sentiments. Yet, \nsentiments mean little if in the next breath they oppose reasonable \nlegislation we have offered to make it happen, namely the Hoeven-Lugar-\nVitter bill.\n  I understand that there can be reasonable questions, even concerns on \na project of this size. I, along with Senator Hoeven and other \ncosponsors, have repeatedly offered to Democratic colleagues to hear \nany genuine concerns with our legislation and to negotiate changes that \nwould earn their votes. Those offers have been refused. Instead, the \nDemocratic leadership has offered a last minute side-by-side amendment \nthat would add more delay, jeopardize the prospect of any Keystone XL \njobs being created, and undermine the job prospects of American \nrefinery workers.\n\n  I am hopeful that Democratic colleagues will join me in supporting \njobs and energy security by voting in favor the Hoeven-Lugar-Vitter \namendment. Voting against the Hoeven-Lugar-Vitter amendment while \nsimultaneously refusing to negotiate is a vote against Keystone XL, \nagainst the private sector jobs it will produce, against the chance it \nbrings for lower gasoline prices, and against the relief it can provide \nfrom our dangerous dependence on\n\n[[Page S1521]]\n\noil from the Middle East and Venezuela.\n  Mr. President, in my judgment, there is no doubt that the Keystone XL \npipeline would benefit United States national security, energy \nreliability, economic growth, and job creation. It would be the most \nadvanced pipeline in the United States, thus minimizing environmental \nrisks.\n  United States dependence on foreign oil is one of our foremost \nnational security vulnerabilities. Iran's threat to shatter global \neconomic recovery and splinter allied opposition to their nuclear \nweapons program by using their oil exports as leverage is just the most \nvisible example today. The dollars we use to buy oil from autocratic \nregimes complicate our own national security policies by entrenching \ncorruption, financing regional aggression and repression, and inflating \nDefense Department costs. Crude oil from Canada, North Dakota, and \nMontana delivered by Keystone XL will replace a substantial part of \nfuture imports of heavy oil from Venezuela and the Middle East.\n  The less we are directly dependent on oil from unstable and \nunfriendly regimes, the more flexibility we will have in diplomatic and \ndefense options. Consider, for example, some of the flashpoints in oil-\nrich countries over the more than three years that the Obama \nAdministration examined the Keystone XL pipeline application: Iran \nthreats against Israel, the Strait of Hormuz, and the U.S. Navy; \nVenezuelan antagonism; war in Libya; hostilities in Iraq; a stalemate \nin Sudan; unrest in Russia; the Arab Spring; strained relations with \nSaudi Arabia; violence in Nigeria; and the ongoing threat of terrorism \nagainst energy infrastructure.\n  In contrast, the only uncertainty in oil trade with Canada has been \nthe U.S. indecision over Keystone XL. This delay has caused the \nCanadian government to openly question whether the U.S. is a reliable \nmarket and whether it should devote new oil capacity to supplying \nChina's voracious appetite for energy.\n  No single project or policy is a cure-all, but having more \nindependence from unstable regimes will give more options to avoid \nbeing drawn into oil-driven conflicts and to diplomatically advance \nnational security objectives. For example, among the most significant \nchallenges to enforcing strong sanctions on Iranian oil is concern over \nhigh gas prices driven by a weakening global supply margin. More than 3 \nyears of bureaucratic delay on Keystone XL means that the Obama \nAdministration has prevented Keystone XL oil from helping Americans hit \nby high gas prices today. Approval now would send a strong signal to \nmarkets of coming supply, and with our legislation, Keystone XL would \nbe in place to help address future emergencies.\n  Having built-in first access to Canadian crude via pipeline is a \nstrategic and economic advantage when global oil markets are under \nthreat of shortage, as powerfully illustrated by Iranian threats \nagainst 20 percent of world oil that traverses the Strait of Hormuz.\n  The global oil market has fundamentally changed. Booming demand by \nChina, India, and other emerging economies is quickly absorbing new \nsupplies. Old oil fields are running low and new ones are expensive and \nharder to find. World markets are likely to remain tight for the \nforeseeable future, which means that supply disruptions due to \npolitical, terrorist, or weather events can lead to shortages much more \neasily than in the past. Tight global oil markets will invite threats \nto supplies for years to come, whether by Iran or other hostile actors. \nHaving oil flow to the United States, instead of to China, via Keystone \nXL would give Americans the benefits of first access in times of \ntrouble.\n  In Indiana job creation is the number one priority. The situation is \nurgent for families struck by our 9 percent unemployment rate, and many \nmore are underemployed. Having the private sector willing to inject \nmore than $7 billion into the economy for the Keystone XL pipeline is a \ntremendous vehicle for putting people back to work, and it will have a \nmultiplier effect for economic growth. Moreover, it is estimated that \napproximately 90 percent of the money Americans send to Canada for \nimports is returned to the United States, thereby encouraging more \ntrade beyond the energy sector.\n  Keystone XL is perhaps the largest private infrastructure project \navailable for construction almost immediately. It is expected to \ndirectly create 20,000 jobs, particularly in the hard-hit construction \nand manufacturing sectors. In addition, tens--if not hundreds--of \nthousands of other American workers will have their jobs bolstered \nthrough the supply chain. Many of these are small American businesses \nthat manufacture specialty parts or provide services.\n  Already Hoosiers working at Koontz-Wagner in South Bend, IN, have \nbenefited from some of the $800 million that has already been spent for \nKeystone XL supplies. As a subcontractor for Siemens, Koontz-Wagner \nlast week finished the last of 78 equipment shelters for Keystone XL. \nThe largest of the shelters measures 62 feet long, 14 feet wide, and \nweighs about 8,500 pounds. Manufacture of the 78 units for Keystone XL \ngenerated 140,000 ``man hours'' of work, allowing 50 60 new employees \nto be hired. It is the single largest contract for that company in \nSouth Bend. The people of Koontz-Wagner are fortunate that they are an \nearly contractor. Meanwhile, thousands of additional workers are \nwaiting for their chance.\n  Other Indiana firms stand to benefit from the Keystone XL pipeline. I \nvisited Endress+Hauser in Greenwood where they already have \nmanufactured $600,000 worth of flow and temperature devices, \nCaterpillar in Lafayette where they manufacture the engines for the \nheavy equipment developing the oil sands, and Fairfield Manufacturing \nin Lafayette where they manufacture large gears and other components of \nthe Caterpillar machines, in addition to other industrial machinery.\n  More than 2,400 American companies in 49 States, including over 100 \nin Indiana, supply goods and services for oil sands development and \ntransport, according to industry estimates. Virtually all of these \nAmerican companies stand to benefit from robust trade with Canada, and \nstand to lose from Canada turning its trade preferences toward Asia.\n  An important testament to the job-creating opportunities of Keystone \nXL is the strong support of several unions, such as the AFL CIO \nBuilding and Construction Trades Department, United Association of \nJourneymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry of \nthe U.S. & Canada, International Union of Operating Engineers, \nLaborers' International Union of North America, International \nBrotherhood of Teamsters, and the International Brotherhood of \nElectrical Workers.\n  Private sector job creation must be our top domestic priority. Some \nargue that the estimate of 20,000 new jobs from Keystone XL \nconstruction is too high even while they admit that many thousands of \nnew jobs will be created. Even a smaller number of new private sector \njobs are important gains during this time of 8.3 percent unemployment \nnationally and 9 percent in Indiana. Whether it is a pipeline, a road, \nor a house, it is the nature of the construction industry that jobs \ncreated are temporary in the sense that once a single project finishes, \nanother needs to take its place. A benefit of a project as large as \nKeystone XL is that the temporary employment is actually quite long and \ndesperately needed by workers and their families.\n  Keystone XL is privately financed. No taxpayer money is needed to \nbring these jobs--all that is needed is for government to get out of \nthe way.\n  In my judgment, further delaying these benefits is not in the \nnational interest. With the firm go-ahead offered by our legislation, \nAmericans can get to work almost immediately in manufacturing goods and \nin building the pipeline.\n  Kicking the can down the road is not simply a delay in construction. \nDelay opens more rounds of duplicative review with no definite \nconclusion that the pipeline will be built. Meanwhile, the Government \nof Canada is racing ahead with plans to export crude to China. Recent \nhigh-level agreements between Canada and China demonstrate no \nreluctance for oil trade through Puget Sound and across the Pacific.\n  The national imperative to reduce dependence on foreign oil from \nadversarial and unreliable regimes is not a partisan issue. Increased \ndevelopment\n\n[[Page S1522]]\n\nof domestic energy resources, including domestic oil, alternative \nliquid fuels from biomass and coal, and innovation for fuel efficiency \nand electrification are all needed. I have offered my Practical Energy \nPlan, REFRESH farm bill, and Open Fuels Standard with Senator Cantwell \nto aid in those efforts. My legislation, if implemented, would reduce \nour need for foreign oil by 6.3 million barrels per day by 2030--more \nthan two-thirds of current imports.\n  It is ultimately the expected resilience of higher average global oil \nprices and technological breakthroughs that will determine the success \nof alternatives, not the presence of oil pipelines. We must be \nrealistic: Even with rapid improvement in alternatives and efficiency \ninnovations, oil will continue to be an important part of our economy, \nand oil from domestic sources and reliable neighbors will be more \naffordable and secure than far-flung imports.\n  Even if we achieve domestic production and efficiency goals, we \ncannot afford to ignore the source of our foreign oil. Canada is our \nmost reliable and safest oil trading partner. The Keystone XL Pipeline \nalone could virtually eliminate the need for oil from Venezuela. Even \nif in the future we do not ourselves consume all the Canadian oil \nimported, having that crude in the U.S. system would give us tremendous \nflexibility to deal with supply shortages caused by conflict, political \nmanipulation, terrorism, or natural disaster.\n  But perversely, opponents of the pipeline have thrown up a series of \ncanards against the project to distract from the overwhelming arguments \nin favor of it. One such canard is that Keystone XL is intended to use \nAmerican soil to convey Canadian oil to markets abroad. The facts are \notherwise. The United States is a huge net importer of crude oil about \n9 million barrels every day. It is that reality that has perverted our \nnational security policy for decades. Analysis from the Department of \nEnergy finds the likelihood of crude exports from Keystone XL to be \nextremely low because U.S. refinery capacity for heavy oil is expected \nto exceed supply from Canada and because transport of oil via Keystone \nXL, then tanker would be considerably more expensive than domestic \nCanadian export options.\n  Overall U.S. exports of refined products are running at an unusually \nhigh 15 percent of total production because America's struggling \neconomy has sapped domestic demand, and those export levels likely will \nshrink again as the economy gains steam. Simply put, we are keeping \nsome of America's 108,000 refinery workers, including about 2,245 in \nIndiana, employed by selling at home and overseas.\n  Moreover, it is especially curious that the prospect of even a small \namount of exports manufactured at U.S. refineries comes under scrutiny \nsince President Obama has identified the doubling of U.S. exports as a \ngoal. According to the Department of Commerce, the President already \nhas the authority to prohibit petroleum exports if he deems it to be in \nthe national interest.\n  In my view, exporting a small percentage of refined products to \nmaintain refinery capacity is not a problem to be solved. In the event \nof a global energy crisis, exports from U.S. Gulf refineries could \nquickly be diverted back to American gas pumps, providing that their \nsource is a secure supply from the U.S. or Canada, not overseas.\n  Even as Democrats seek to block the prospect of even a small amount \nof manufactured petroleum products from being exported, they are also \narguing to block the import of products through ``domestic content'' \nmandates. The Keystone XL Pipeline is a private project and does not \nreceive taxpayer subsidy. The Federal Government has no place in making \nprocurement decisions of private companies. According to TransCanada, \nof the expected total procurement for Keystone XL, 98 percent is \nalready under contract. In other words, a domestic content requirement \nmay force it to violate existing contracts.\n  In the end, the most vigorous opposition to Keystone XL is not over \nthe pipeline itself; it is against further development of the Canadian \noil sands in an effort to stem greenhouse gas emissions. In considering \nthis issue, it is important to understand that extensive investment in \ncoking capacity at U.S. refineries means that oil from the oil sands \nwill mostly replace other heavy oil, such as that from Venezuela.\n  But more to the point, there is no doubt that Canada will continue to \ndevelop the oil sands regardless of U.S. decisionmaking on Keystone XL. \nThe Canadians have already spent billions of dollars developing this \nresource, which they see as an essential national asset and job \nproducer. The value of this asset will increase over time as the growth \nin global populations and living standards increases the demand for \noil. Shipping the oil to the Canadian Pacific or Arctic coasts and \nonward via tanker for sale to China would compound environmental risks, \nwhile denying our country the strategic and economic benefits \nassociated with oil sands production.\n  The strong majority of American people agree with our support for the \nKeystone XL Pipeline. Polling by Rasmussen and United Technologies/\nNational Journal clearly indicates that a majority of Americans support \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline. The Pew Research Center released a poll on \nFebruary 23, 2012, that found 66 percent of people who have heard about \nKeystone XL support its approval, while just 23 percent oppose. These \nfindings are reinforced by the dozens of Hoosier citizens, mayors, and \nretired service personnel who have written in favor of Keystone XL and \nthe Indiana State Senate that voted in unanimous support.\n  America's overdependence on oil imports from unstable and hostile \nregimes endangers our national security and puts our warfighters and \ncivilian personnel at risk. It also worsens our national budget \nsituation, as we spend billions of dollars to ensure safe passage of \noil around the world. But today we have a dramatic opportunity to \nchange that energy and national security equation by building the \nKeystone XL Pipeline to bring oil from Canada, our good friend, to \nNorth Dakota and Montana and then to the gulf refineries.\n  Better yet, building Keystone XL, a private sector project, will \ncreate thousands of American jobs now. Job creation is the No. 1 issue \nin our Nation. The Keystone XL Pipeline is the country's largest \nshovel-ready infrastructure project. President Obama had the \nopportunity to create thousands of new jobs right away, plus bolster \njob prospects for thousands more throughout the manufacturing supply \nchain, such as our Hoosiers firms Endress+Hauser, Koontz-Wagner, and \nCaterpillar. Allowing $7 billion of private economic activity should be \na no-brainer.\n  Incredibly, even after reviewing Keystone XL for 1,217 days and in \nthe midst of Iranian threats against global oil supplies and the U.S. \nNavy, President Obama caved to pressure from extreme environmentalists \nby rejecting Keystone XL jobs and security. The President ignored \nanalysis from his own Department of Energy that said oil supplies \ncoming via Keystone XL would most likely lower gas prices.\n  President Obama's rejection of Keystone XL implicitly says that the \nadministration prefers to send billions of dollars to unfriendly \nregimes rather than expand trade with Canada. It says that Democratic \nleadership prefers going hat-in-hand seeking more oil from Saudi Arabia \nrather than taking control of our energy future. It is \nincomprehensible. No objective standard of U.S. national security \ninterest could justify such a decision.\n  I recognize there is opposition to Keystone XL among certain segments \nof the environmental community, and I take those efforts and concerns \nseriously. That is why our legislation contains perhaps the strongest \nenvironmental and safety safeguards for a pipeline ever put into U.S. \nlaw. It ensures that the Federal Government will not interfere with \nindividual property rights or tell Nebraskans what to do in their own \nState.\n  Opponents believe that by blocking the pipeline, they will stop \ndevelopment of the oil sands in Alberta. That is a false hope. There is \nno doubt that Canada will continue to develop the oil sands regardless \nof U.S. decisionmaking on Keystone XL. The Government of Canada is \nracing ahead with plans to export crude to China. Recent high-level \nagreements between Canada and China demonstrate no reluctance for oil \ntrade through the Puget Sound and across the Pacific.\n\n[[Page S1523]]\n\n  Others say we should encourage alternatives to oil, and greater fuel \nefficiency, and I agree with that, but even under the most optimistic \nscenarios, oil will continue to be an important part of our economy, \nand oil from domestic sources and reliable neighbors will be more \naffordable and secure than far-flung imports.\n  Crude oil from Keystone XL will replace heavy oil imports from \nVenezuela and the Middle East. The less we depend on oil from \nadversarial and unreliable regimes, the more protection Americans will \nhave from price spikes and shortages and the more flexibility we will \nhave in diplomatic and defense options in oil-rich lands.\n  Finally, let me say that Politico reports that President Obama is so \nanti-Keystone that he is personally calling Senators to oppose our \nbill. The Democratic alternative aligns with President Obama's \nrejection of Keystone XL and is a massive overreach into the private \nsector. Senator Wyden's bill would ultimately hurt the workers it \nclaims to help and would penalize America's 108,000 refinery workers \ndirectly.\n  In sum, the Keystone XL Pipeline will create thousands of private \nsector jobs, and it will help protect the national security interests \nof the United States. It comes at no taxpayer expense, and it will \nstrengthen vital ties with our ally Canada. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Hoeven-Lugar-Vitter Keystone XL amendment.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I rise to speak against three \nRepublican amendments that pose a grave threat to our health, our \nchildren, and our environment.\n  The first seeks to delay and weaken new EPA standards that would \nreduce the pollution produced by industrial boilers. These boilers emit \ndozens of toxins, including lead, which reduces children's intelligence \nlevels, and dioxins, which can cause birth defects. Boilers also \nrelease mercury, which is brain poison for children. And I ask my \ncolleagues here to just think for a moment how lucky you are if all of \nyour children are healthy and feeling good.\n  Under the Republican amendment, polluters will have at least 6 \nadditional years to continue releasing life-threatening toxins into our \nair. We have already waited far too long to see the health benefits \nthese standards would achieve. Back in 1990, both parties came together \nin Congress and told the EPA to set new pollution standards by the year \n2000. If we delay these standards another 6 years, our country will \nsuffer as many as 28,000 premature deaths. We will also see 17,000 \nheart attacks and more than 180,000 asthma attacks.\n  This amendment would also fundamentally weaken the Clean Air Act. It \nforces the EPA to set the least burdensome standards for industry. \nImagine that. Instead of reducing toxins our children breathe, this \namendment orders the EPA to reduce the burden on polluters. Under this \namendment, children lose and polluters win, and that is inexcusable.\n  I also wish to express my strong opposition to Senator Hoeven's \nKeystone XL amendment, which is nothing more than a rubberstamp for a \nproject that poses serious risks to our environment and public safety.\n  The Keystone XL Pipeline will be one of the largest pipelines outside \nof Russia and China. It will be 1,700 miles long, cut through six \nStates, and carry nearly 1 million barrels of tar sands oil each day. \nMake no mistake, the Keystone Pipeline is not ready for approval.\n  The fact is, the people have a right to know the facts about projects \nlike this. This is one of the reasons I wrote the Pipeline Safety Act, \nwhich President Obama signed into law in January. This law requires the \nTransportation Secretary to determine whether we need better rules for \nthe movement of tar sands oil, which is thicker and more corrosive than \nconventional oil.\n  Keep in mind, the existing Keystone Pipeline has had 12 oilspills in \nits first year of operation. So before we take a shot in the dark, \nlet's get the facts about Keystone XL.\n  Finally, I want to express my strong opposition to a Vitter amendment \nto vastly expand offshore drilling in this country. I will not stand by \nwhile Republicans put New Jersey's coast in the hands of oil companies. \nTourism, fishing, and other coastal activities generate $50 billion a \nyear in New Jersey and support a half million jobs. Just like with the \nKeystone Pipeline, the oil industry is telling us don't worry about the \nrisks posed by offshore drilling. They say: Trust us; everything will \nbe fine. But we know how empty the oil industry's promises are.\n  In 1989, before the Valdez spill in Alaska, Exxon told us their oil \ntankers were safe. Two years ago, BP insisted it could handle an \noilspill in the Gulf of Mexico. That is fresh in our memories. We \nshould not forget it.\n  We do not need any more empty assurances from the industry. We need \nto defeat these amendments and pass a clean transportation bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1826\n\n                   (Purpose: Of a perfecting nature)\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside \nthe pending amendment and call up my amendment No. 1826.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Roberts] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1826.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I rise today to ask for support for my \namendment to promote progrowth energy and tax policy, and especially \nconsistency for the remainder of this year.\n  My amendment addresses a significant tax policy concern. Within the \nTax Code there is a long list of provisions simply known as tax \nextenders. Some might ask why I am offering an amendment on tax \nextenders to a bill dealing with the Federal highway program. In a \nnutshell, here is why: These provisions are used by millions of \nfamilies, individuals, and business taxpayers. But these provisions \nexpired over 2 months ago, causing utter chaos in regard to--well, \nreally, what it caused was the lawyer-CPA full employment act. At \npresent, the Senate leadership has no plans to consider these expired \ntax provisions. That is not right.\n  The base of this amendment includes most if not all of the expired \nenergy tax incentives addressed in the amendment offered by my friends \non the other side of the aisle. It is your amendment. In my amendment, \nhowever, we increase these energy production incentives. With spiking \ngas prices hammering families and businesses, this is precisely, it \nseems to me, the time to have a policy which will increase our supply \nof energy.\n  To begin with, addressing the oil supply issues, my amendment would \ncut redtape and open more Federal land for more oil and gas exploration \nand drilling. We are all painfully aware of the President's rejection \nof the Keystone XL Pipeline application. My amendment gives our \nCanadian neighbors the green light to send energy our way.\n  Let me now briefly describe the amendment. This amendment extends \npopular and much needed tax relief ranging from tax deductions for \nfamilies sending kids to college to the adoption tax credit. By \nsupporting my amendment today, we can provide much needed tax relief \nand certainty to millions of families and businesses for the remainder \nof this year.\n  I highlight this point because uncertainty in business and personal \nfinancial planning is something I think all of us hear about daily when \nwe go back home and then come back here. Let's take a look at the \ndeductibility of college tuition. This is a benefit for families who \nsend their kids to college. By definition, this benefit goes to middle-\nincome families. A lot of these folks are not low-income, so their kids \ndo not qualify for Pell grants, but they are not high-income either. A \nlot of these folks are paying significant Federal, State, and local \ntaxes and they get no help in defraying the high cost of their kids' \ncollege education. This tax deduction would make this consistent just \nfor this year. This helps\n\n[[Page S1524]]\n\nfamilies by increasing access to higher education. This deduction ran \nout last year, and if we don't act these families will continue to face \na tax increase.\n  Another very important expired provision is the deductibility of \nState and local sales taxes. Over 10.3 million Americans are paying \nmore in taxes because this provision has expired.\n  On the business side, my amendment would address expiring business \nprovisions, including the research and development tax credit and tax \nincentives for leasehold improvements and restaurant depreciation. It \nalso extends enhanced small business expensing. Many small businesses \nuse this benefit to buy equipment on an efficient aftertax basis. It is \ngood for small business. It is good for small business workers. It is \ngood for our Nation's economic growth.\n  The amendment closes a tax loophole that ensures that taxpayers \nclaiming the refundable child tax credit provide proper identification \non their tax returns.\n  Finally, this amendment includes a special deficit reduction trust \nfund. The trust fund would contain the savings from the energy \nproduction incentives, the refundable child tax credit provision, and \nan extension of the existing Federal employee pay freeze.\n  In summary, this amendment does not add to the deficit. It contains \nrobust energy production incentives and restores expired individual and \nbusiness tax relief provisions. Most of all, it promotes economic \ngrowth and provides much needed consistency as these tax extenders \nsimply do not exist at the present time, and only for this year. \nEverybody knows in 2013 we have the obligation and responsibility to \ndig into a tax reform plan that will certainly serve to put our Nation \nin much better shape in regard to tax policy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1822\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, let me begin by thanking the almost 15 \nMembers of this body who have been working on this very important \nlegislation for almost 2 years, since the Deepwater Horizon tragedy. I \nparticularly want to thank Senator Shelby, who has been the lead on the \nRepublican side, for cosponsoring this important and significant \nenvironmental and economic recovery of the gulf coast. We could not \nhave done it without Senator Vitter and Senator Sessions, who were on \nthe authorizing committee where this bill came out with almost \nunanimous support. I think we didn't get two votes in the committee. \nEveryone else, Republican and Democrat, was supportive.\n  I particularly thank Senator Whitehouse, who led the effort on the \nDemocratic side, as we have shaped, with his help, for the gulf coast, \nwhich is represented in this bill, a way to invest in our oceans by \nsmartly using some of the interest earnings. Of course, we would not be \nhere on the floor without the extraordinary leadership of Senator Boxer \nfrom California, whose coast gets virtually no benefit from the RESTORE \nAct as it was originally introduced, but she was willing to step up \nbecause she knows how important the gulf coast is to the United States.\n  Let me first remind people what this accident looked like. It has \nbeen 2 years, but we remember the horror that we saw on our televisions \nfor months about the largest environmental accident in the history of \nour country--5 million barrels of oil spilled along the coast of \nLouisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and seeped onto the coast of Florida \nand caused economic damage in Texas. Let me tell you, 600 miles of the \ngulf coastline were oiled, and 86,000 square miles of waters were \nclosed to fishing, causing a $2.5 billion loss to the fishing industry. \nWe still have concerns about what that industry will look like.\n  The U.S. Travel Association estimated a $23 billion impact to tourism \nacross the gulf coast. So although Texas did not technically get any \noil, they had an impact along their coast with the tourism decline.\n  Every commission, independent commission--Secretary of the Navy \nCommission, the President's commission, the independent commissions \nhave all advocated that the proper response of the Federal Government \nis not to take this penalty money and stuff it in the General Treasury \nbut, rather, to take a significant portion--our bill says 80 percent--\nand send it back to the gulf coast where our people have great needs, \nboth economically and environmentally.\n  This is the time to act. Louisiana has lost 1,900 square miles since \n1930. If we were the size of Rhode Island--we are not, we are bigger, \nbut if we were, we would not have 50 States anymore; we would only have \n49 because, as the Senator from California knows, we have already lost \nthe size of Rhode Island. This is a national tragedy, not just for the \n4.5 million people who live in our State.\n  But I would like to put into the record for the few minutes that I \nhave that we contribute $3 trillion to the national economy every year. \nThe Gulf Coast States represent 17 percent of the GDP. Nearly 50 \npercent of the oil and gas that we consume every day in States all over \nthis country comes from the gulf coast.\n  We contribute $8 to $10 billion directly every year. All we are \nasking in the RESTORE Act--let's put that up here--is to fund, direct \n80 percent of the penalty money that BP is going to pay--taxpayers are \nnot paying this. This does not come out of any program. It does not \ncome out of any education program, any other program. It is going to be \npaid for by BP. Let's do justice to the gulf coast, America's energy \ncoast and, might I say, the coast that produces the most vibrant \nfisheries, the coast that supports, proudly, ecotourism, the coast that \nrevels in clean beaches.\n  Please give us the resources we need to restore this great coast. \nAgain, I thank Senator Baucus and Senator Bingaman, who have joined now \nwith supporters of this because we have added a portion to the fund, \njust for 2 years, the Land and Water Conservation Fund, for the entire \ncountry. We will be sending money to the gulf coast, creating an oceans \ntrust fund, and fully funding the Land and Water Conservation Fund for \n2 years.\n  I think it is a balanced bill; it is a fair bill. Again, to the \nchairman of the committee, Senator Boxer, I cannot tell the Senator how \nmuch we appreciate her extraordinary leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask for 30 seconds before we turn to \nSenator Vitter. I want to say to the Senator from Louisiana and her \ncolleague, Senator Vitter, what an honor it has been for me to work \nwith them. Senator Landrieu is the most passionate person I have ever \nmet when it comes to fighting for her State. What her State went \nthrough was a disaster manyfold. I was there. I saw it.\n  Senator Vitter on the committee was eloquent in pointing out the \nproblems. Senator Sessions worked hard on the committee as well. Every \nDemocrat supported them.\n  I would only say to my colleagues who may be watching this debate: \nPlease vote yes. We need 60 votes. This is going to take funding from \nBP directly to fix up the areas they wrecked. It is not costing the \ntaxpayers any money. Because of the negotiations, every State will now \nbenefit if it has a coastline.\n  I was honored to do it. I was excited we got this out of our \ncommittee. But we do not have forever. We have to take care of this \ntoday. Vote aye. This is bipartisan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I certainly join with my two colleagues \nand others in strong, passionate support of the RESTORE Act amendment. \nAs has been mentioned, that will be an upcoming vote, the fifth vote in \nline once we start voting very shortly. This approach of dedicating any \npercent of the Clean Water Act fines just from the BP disaster to gulf \ncoast restoration is widely supported on a bipartisan basis. The Obama \nadministration strongly supports it, outside groups who have looked at \nthe devastation in the gulf strongly support it all across the \nspectrum. This has been a concept that has been building for months, \nand there is strong and widespread support for this 80-percent \ndedication. That is reflected in the fact that the RESTORE amendment is \na bipartisan push, a bipartisan bill, and now a bipartisan floor \namendment. As Mary Landrieu and Senator\n\n[[Page S1525]]\n\nBoxer mentioned, it had almost unanimous support coming out of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. The cosponsors are fully \nbipartisan, so I urge all Members to join together in this effort.\n\n  This is completely deficit neutral. We have an offset built into the \nbill such that this bill does not increase the deficit in any way, \nshape, or form. Let me point out, the money we are using, as has been \nsaid, would not exist but for the BP disaster. There are fines paid by \nBP and others, so that money did not exist before the disaster, and yet \nwe still offset that full amount with an offset. In essence, we are \nlowering the deficit compared to what it would have been but for the \ndisaster and before that revenue created only by the disaster.\n  In addition, built into the bill in this latest version is \nsignificant funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund which has \nsignificant bipartisan support in the Senate. Again, all of that is \nfully offset so we are not increasing the deficit in any way, shape, or \nform. This is an offset that has been approved and used before, again, \non a bipartisan basis. One of those previous votes using this same \noffset passed 98 to 0.\n  I urge all Members of the Senate, Democrats and Republicans, to come \ntogether and please do the gulf coast right and do the Nation right in \nterms of this vitally important effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, the Senator from North Dakota earlier \noffered a proposal to develop the Keystone Pipeline. I rise to speak on \nthe alternative this afternoon. The alternative ensures expedited \napproval of the pipeline once the current environmental requirements \nare met. The alternative ensures that the thousands of jobs associated \nwith building the pipeline go to the workers of the United States. The \nalternative says there is to be a ban on the export of all Canadian \ncrude oil transported on the Keystone XL Pipeline. Obviously there may \nbe some exceptions, and we have worked out a process to waive that. But \nif this oil is intended for Americans, then the export restrictions we \noffer in this amendment ought to be very clear, and that is the heart \nof the concern reflected by the backers of this amendment.\n  We believe there is substantial evidence on the Record that this oil \nwill be for the export market. According to the TransCanada application \nto the Canadian Government, the Canadian oil companies expect to reap \nas much as $3.9 billion more in annual revenues from the higher prices \nthey can tap once the oil reaches the gulf coast. Once it reaches the \ngulf coast, it competes at the same prices as other oil supplies on the \nglobal market. It will be extremely lucrative for the company and the \nincentives clearly are for the export market, and that is why the \nTransCanada application to the Canadian Government even admits that.\n  The fact is U.S. gulf coast refineries are already responsible for 75 \npercent of U.S. refined products and those exports are rising rapidly. \nGulf coast refineries also have a cost advantage over struggling \nrefineries along the east coast, and in effect the Keystone XL Pipeline \ncan accelerate that advantage and likely accelerate the closure of east \ncoast refining capacity. Less east coast refining capacity means higher \ngasoline and heating and oil prices for our country.\n  Perversely, according to a separate report we received from the \nEnergy Information Agency, closure of east coast refineries could \nresult in more imports of gasoline and other petroleum products, some \npossibly from as far away as India. That is particularly perverse \nbecause this is the first time since 1949 when we have actually seen \nexports of a number of our refined products, such as gasoline, have \nthat dramatic change compared to previous years when we were always \nimporting so many of those energy resources.\n  So contrary to the assertion by the pipeline backers, more supply \nfrom Canada does not automatically mean more U.S. supply and lower \nprices for U.S. consumers, especially when the evidence indicates that \nthat supply is going to be hardwired by the pipeline and world prices \nand world markets once it reaches the Gulf of Mexico.\n  I simply say to Senators: This debate has always been about domestic \nenergy security. That is the centerpiece of the argument that was made \nby my distinguished friend from North Dakota, and we have heard on \ntelevision commercials for weeks and weeks. The argument is to build \nthis pipeline, the energy is going to go for Americans. This amendment \nguarantees that will be the case. In effect, this amendment puts teeth \nbehind all of the debate that this energy is going to be for the \nAmerican consumer.\n  I think the evidence shows, particularly as you look at how you are \ngoing to see refineries bypassed in the Midwest, that it is going to go \nto the gulf ports and you are going to see this energy used in the \nexport market. That may be good for the Chinese, but the evidence could \nindicate it would produce higher prices for Americans. In fact, this \ntrend with respect to putting the export of American energy on auto \npilot--assuming that it is automatically good--is something I think we \nought to look at more carefully. In this amendment we make it clear we \nwant to protect American workers, American consumers, and we are going \nto have expedited approval of the pipeline.\n  The only point I would make is the Secure Rural Schools legislation--\nwhich we are going to be voting in a few minutes--has always been \nbipartisan. I have been working with Chairman Baucus to ensure that it \nremains bipartisan. I hope colleagues will keep faith with rural \ncommunities, and when it comes up for a vote here in a few minutes, \nsupport the Baucus amendment and our rural schools and law enforcement \nand road programs that are a lifeline to those rural communities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                     Girl Scouts 100th Anniversary\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I rise for a very special honor to be \ngiven to the Girl Scouts of the United States of America on their 100th \nanniversary. One hundred years ago in Savannah, GA, Juliette Gordon Low \nbrought together a group of 18 girls from very different backgrounds to \ngive them opportunities to develop physically, mentally, and \nspiritually. From that meeting, Ms. Low came to recognize the need for \nan organization that would help girls develop self-reliance and \nresourcefulness in the face of a changing society, and in their future \nroles as professional women.\n  From that modest single troop in Savannah, Ms. Low's vision has grown \ninto the largest organization for girls in the world, with 3.2 million \nGirl Scouts and more than 50 million Girl Scout alumnae. Despite their \ngrowth, the Girl Scouts of today have stayed true to Ms. Low's vision, \nfocusing on topics such as leadership, science and technology, business \nand economic literacy, and outdoor and environmental awareness. It is \nadmirable that the Girl Scouts throughout their 100-year history of \nsupporting women's leadership have truly been a voice for all girls \nregardless of background.\n  As Girl Scouts, young women develop their leadership potential \nthrough activities that enable them to discover and develop their \nvalues and skills, and to take action to make a difference in the \nworld. And while we all know about the beloved American institution \nthat is the Girl Scout cookie sale, it is not just about the cookies. \nScouting also provides girls with the skills and self-confidence to \nbecome leaders in their own lives.\n  Girl Scouts have an impressive record of success. Former Girl Scouts \nmake up a majority of women who have served in Congress, and 53 percent \nof all women business owners are former Girl Scouts.\n  We are fortunate that the guidance and opportunities that Girl Scouts \nhave provided during the last 100 years will remain for the next \ngeneration of women leaders for Georgia as well as for the United \nStates.\n  Madam President, I ask our colleagues to join me in congratulating \nthe Girl Scouts of the United States of America, founded in the great \nState of Georgia, on 100 years of supporting female leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1825\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I rise to address the Baucus amendment\n\n[[Page S1526]]\n\nthat maintains the core Federal commitment to our timber counties \nthrough the Secure Rural Schools and the Payment in Lieu of Taxes \nPrograms.\n  Let me give you a sense of what this is all about. This is equivalent \nto a farmer who is told by the Federal Government: We have a new set of \nrules, and you cannot grow crops on your farm any longer, but we are \ngoing to substitute payments that you would otherwise receive. Well, \nthe farmer doesn't like it. He would rather grow crops, but what can he \ndo? Then along comes the government a few years later and says: You \nknow what. You cannot grow crops and you are not going to get \ncompensated for our rules that tell you you cannot grow crops. And, of \ncourse, that is outrageous. That is like a taking of property, and yet \nthat is exactly the situation that exists for our timber counties in \nterms of lands affected by the Secure Rural Schools Program.\n  The timber harvest cannot proceed in its original method, and the \ncompensation is not guaranteed to be in place, so we have to fix that. \nWe have to make sure the Federal Government abides by the deals it has \nstruck. This deal is essential to rural timber counties throughout our \nNation. It is essential to so many counties in Oregon.\n  Five years ago when my colleague Senator Wyden was working to make \nsure this commitment was upheld, I was in the role of a speaker, and in \nthat role I organized the delegation of Democrats and Republicans to go \nout and talk with our county leaders, and there was such mystification \nabout the fact that the Federal Government was not going to stand by \nthe deal it had struck. Today, through the amendment that Senator \nBaucus, Senator Wyden, and others have been working to put forward, we \nhave the chance to make sure that the word of the Federal Government is \ngood. That is why we need to pass this amendment.\n  I wish to tell you that we are going to put forward an amendment that \nsecured the word of the government for a good long time to come but, \nunfortunately, it is only a minimalist, 1-year agreement, but that is \nwhat we have before us and that is what we must do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. At 2 o'clock we are going to start the votes on a mass \nnumber of amendments. The first one will be on the Outer Continental \nShelf. It is my understanding that I have the right to start the voting \nat 2 o'clock; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, everyone should know--staffs, alert your \nSenators--the first vote will be 15 minutes, with 5 minutes for people \nto get here. After that, we will have 10-minute votes. I ask unanimous \nconsent that all subsequent votes be 10 minutes and the first one 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, all subsequent votes will \nbe 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we are going to enforce that. We have 30 \nvotes to get through today. It is going to be a lot of work on the \nclerks to do this, but Senators should stay here rather than wander off \nand do other things; otherwise, they are subject to missing votes. I \nwant to make sure everyone understands that. The only time we would \ndeviate from that is with votes that are separated with one or two \nminutes. Usually we have to take a little longer time on that to make \nsure there are no mistakes. But other than that, we will whip through \nthese votes as quickly as we can.\n  Has the hour of 2 o'clock arrived yet, Madam Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1535\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the Vitter amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, in my one minute, I hope we are going to \nvote down this antijobs amendment that threatens our coastal economies. \nMany of our coastal States treasure their coasts, and they are an \neconomic engine of growth because the tourists come there. We have \nrecreation. We have the fishing industry. Therefore, it is very \nimportant that we vote this down because this amendment is a big \nbrother amendment. It tells the States what they have to do, what they \nmust do, even if their value is to protect those coastal-related \neconomies.\n  We have 2 percent of the proven oil supplies in the world and we use \n20 percent of the world's energy. So we all know we can't drill our way \nout of this. Yet the Senator from Louisiana wants to open every area of \nour State to drilling when the oil companies are sitting on more than \n50 million acres. It is a giveaway to big oil. We should go after the \noil speculators. If we want to bring down gas prices, let's do that. \nLet's vote down this bad amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL.

There is now 2 minutes of debate, equally \ndivided, prior to a vote in relation to the Baucus amendment No. 1825.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n\n   (Purpose: To reauthorize for 1 year the Secure Rural Schools and \n Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 and to provide full funding \n  for the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program for 1 year, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1825.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus], for himself, Mr. \n     Bingaman, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Merkley, and Mr. Tester, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1825.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nCrapo and Risch be added as cosponsors to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. It \ncompensates counties that have the lack of a private land base; that \nis, counties that do not have the ability to collect property taxes \nbecause of Federal land. This revenue goes to schools, it goes to jobs \nand roads. I might add, in the State of Oregon, 20 percent goes to \nhighway spending. This is the highway bill. It has been supported \nstrongly in the past by this body. The offset has been worked out.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support it. This is a good, solid \nprogram.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to my colleague from Oregon, Mr. \nWyden.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the Baucus amendment is a lifeline for \nrural America, particularly for the West and the South, where the \nFederal Government owns so much of our land. This money is absolutely \nessential to keep school doors open, to keep cops out there protecting \nour people, and to provide for our roads program. This program has \nalways been bipartisan since the days when our former colleague Senator \nCraig and I authored it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Chairman Baucus on this amendment to \nprovide a lifeline to rural America.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in 2008, Congress passed the Emergency \nEconomic Stabilization Act of 2008, which established the Troubled \nAsset Relief Program. That act also included a historic 5-year program \nto fund two important programs that support rural counties across the \ncountry.\n  The county payments program included increased and more equitably \ndistributed funding for the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-\nDetermination Act, which provides payments to more than 700 counties in \n42 States for public roads, schools, and collaborative forest \nrestoration projects. In addition and for the first time in many years \nit fully funded the Payments in Lieu of Taxes Program, which provides \npayments to 1,850 local governments in 49 States, the District of \nColumbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. Both programs have \nprovided a life line for struggling rural counties around the country \nduring the recent recession.\n  In October of 2011, I introduced the County Payment Reauthorization \nAct of 2011 to extend the benefits of the county payments programs we \nfunded in 2008 for another 5 years. That bill, S. 1687, currently has \n32 cosponsors, including 8 Republicans and an Independent. Congressman \nHeinrich has introduced a companion measure in the House: H.R. 3599.\n  Today, I would like to express my support for Senator Baucus's \namendment No. 1825 to extend funding for the two programs by 1 year. \nMany of us believe that a multiyear extension is critical to provide \nthe budgetary certainty that our rural counties need, so it is \nunfortunate that we could not get sufficient bipartisan support to move \nforward with a multiyear extension.\n  In addition to important funding, the amendment would make a few \nimprovements to the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-\nDetermination Act that we have developed on a bipartisan basis.\n  In fiscal year 2011, it appears that a number of counties in five \nStates failed to submit elections by the date required by section \n102(d)(3)(A) of the act. The result was that approximately $2.5 million \nin title II and III funding was returned to the Treasury, as required \nby the act. At least some of the counties had compelling reasons for \nfailing to make a timely election, and the amendment provides $2.5 \nmillion to the Secretary of Agriculture to carry out projects in those \ncounties consistent with the purpose of the authorized uses of title II \nproject funds. Since some counties don't participate in title II \nprojects, such projects would not be subject to other specific \nrequirements of title II. However, they are intended to be carried out \nconsistent with the spirit of title II, which emphasizes collaborative \nforest projects. Our expectation is that the Secretary will work \nclosely and collaboratively with those counties in spending that money \nto further the purposes reflected in those counties' untimely \nelections.\n  To avoid such problems going forward, the amendment requires the \nGovernor of each eligible State as opposed to each of the more than 700 \ncounties to formally submit title I, II, and III elections for all of \ntheir eligible counties by no later than September 30 of each fiscal \nyear. Our hope is that this change, along with improved outreach by the \nForest Service, will result in timely elections for the remainder of \nthe Secure Rural Schools Program.\n  Nevertheless, if a Governor does fail to submit an election for any \ncounty, the amendment provides that the county will be presumed to have \nelected to expend 80 percent of its funding through title I. As with \nthe $2.5 million provided to the counties that missed the fiscal year \n2011 deadline, the remainder of the county's payment would go to the \nSecretary concerned for the purpose of entering into and implementing \ncooperative agreements with willing Federal agencies, State and local \ngovernments, private and nonprofit entities, and landowners for \nprotection, restoration, and enhancement of fish and wildlife habitat, \nand other resource objectives consistent with the purposes of the act \non Federal land and on non-Federal land in the county where projects \nwould benefit the resources on Federal land. Again, our expectation is \nthat the Secretary will work closely and collaboratively with such \ncounties and, where they exist, their resource advisory committees, in \nspending that money.\n  We also have added a provision to title II to permit resource \nadvisory committees to expend not more than 10 percent of project funds \non administrative expenses if they so choose. That amendment provides \nadditional flexibility to allow the committees to operate more \neffectively and efficiently.\n  I would like to thank Senator Baucus for his leadership in putting \ntogether the necessary offsets for this important amendment and Senator \nMurkowski for her cooperation in developing the authorizing provisions \nthat are included in the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CRAPO. I yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, this is a very modest bipartisan \namendment. It simply gives the EPA more time to get these regulations \nright, and our struggling manufacturers will get more time to comply \nwith them. It is a false choice to say that this is the environment \nversus the economy. We can have both.\n  If this amendment is not adopted and the current regulations go into \neffect, the estimates are that they will cost manufacturers $14 billion \nto comply, and we will lose 200,000 manufacturing jobs at a time when \nwe can least afford it. All we are asking is for more time to get these \nregulations right.\n  I urge support for the amendment, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, what we do here makes a difference in \npeople's lives. We have peer-reviewed studies that show if the Collins \namendment passes and we go back to square one, we will see 8,100 \npremature deaths per year, 5,100 heart attacks per year, 52,000 cases \nof aggravated asthma, and--talk about jobs--400,000 lost workdays per \nyear. Why is that? What the EPA is trying to do under the Clean Air Act \nis make sure we don't have too much arsenic in the air or too much \nchromium, lead, or mercury. These are devastating toxics, especially to \nour children.\n  The manufacturers of boilers say there will be many jobs created. I \nsubmit this letter for the Record. They say anyone who tells us \notherwise is not a boiler manufacturer and doesn't know what they are \ntalking about. Senator Wyden, an original cosponsor, is off this bill \nbecause the EPA has worked with him and managed to answer his concerns.\n  Please vote no on this amendment.\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, this amendment is very similar to an \namendment we voted on in the small business bill which passed 64 to 30-\nsomething--I can't remember the exact number. It is very \nstraightforward. We ask the OMB to look at the two most recent GAO \nreports, combine $10 billion worth of savings, and send back to us a \nrecommendation so that we can, in fact, accomplish that purpose.\n  The GAO is showing us exactly where we need to go in terms of saving \nmoney. We are involving the executive branch in that. They also have \nother plans they are working on and on which I am trying to work with \nthe administration.\n  If you want to pick up the difference between what we really need to \ndo for infrastructure in this country, the best way to do it is to \nsupport this amendment and go for another $10 billion in \ninfrastructure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, last September we rightly rejected a \nCoburn amendment not much different from this one. Senator Coburn \nclaims that the purpose of this amendment is to reduce duplication, but \nin reality it would just give a $10 billion reduction in discretionary \ncaps regardless of whether there actually is $10 billion in \ndiscretionary savings. In addition, there is an existing rescission \nauthority in place, thus making this amendment on reducing duplication \nredundant.\n  This amendment is a backdoor attempt to lower discretionary spending \ncaps agreed to by the Budget Control Act. So we should not violate the \nBCA, and I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Madam President, this amendment ensures that the Keystone \nPipeline is built by American workers using American steel; that our \npriority is reasonably priced energy for American families and American \nbusinesses, rather than their Chinese competitors. It contains an \nexpedited approval process so that when air and water and environmental \nlaws are complied with, the pipeline application must be approved \nwithin 90 days. Put simply, when you build a pipeline that is 2,000 \nmiles across the Nation, our challenge is to do it right.\n  Madam President, there are two alternatives. This one gives us a \nchance to do it right for our workers, our businesses, the well-being \nof all our communities. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I rise in opposition to this amendment. The Keystone XL \nPipeline will bring more than 830,000 barrels a day of crude oil from \nCanada and also from States like mine, such as North Dakota and \nMontana. We need that crude oil rather than relying on the Middle East.\n  This is a vote to block the project. Make no mistake, this not only \nrequires the TransCanada start-over, it says start over after 3\\1/2\\ \nyears. What does that mean, another 3\\1/2\\ years before they can go \nforward? And it adds additional impediments to the project. With \ngasoline prices going up every day, we need more supply, we need it \nfrom Canada, we need it from North Dakota and Montana, not from the \nMiddle East.\n  Please vote no on this amendment and yes on the next one, which will \nallow us to move forward for American workers, American consumers, for \nour businesses, for our economy, and for national security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

So it addresses the concerns that \nhave been raised as far as the environmental impact statement but \nauthorizes the project to proceed.\n  This project will bring 830,000 barrels a day of crude to our \nrefineries, as I mentioned earlier, not only from Canada but from my \nhome State of North Dakota, as well as from Montana. This is about not \nonly producing more energy both at home and with our closest friend and \nally, Canada, but it is also about national security. It is about \nreducing our dependence on oil from the Middle East.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I urge my colleagues' strong support for this amendment \non behalf of American workers and consumers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I urge opposition to this amendment. I \nwish to outline just very briefly why.\n  First, under this amendment the oil is not going to be going to the \nUnited States. This oil is going to be going to the export market, and \nthe TransCanada application to the Canadian Government showed this \nbeyond any question. The Canadian oil companies expect to reap as much \nas $3.9 billion more in annual revenue from the higher prices they can \ntap once their oil reaches the gulf coast. It competes at the same \nprice as other oil supplies on the global market--no protection for \nworkers, no protection on the environment, and, I believe, higher \nprices for American businesses and American consumers.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1537.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Illinois (Mr. Kirk) and the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Thune).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin).

Under the previous order requiring 60 votes \nfor the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is 4:15 p.m. We have a matter that I \nbelieve will be decided by voice in just a few minutes. This will be \nthe last vote until Tuesday, when we finish this bill. I appreciate \neveryone's cooperation. I have talked before about how fortunate we are \nto have the two managers we have on this bill--Senators Boxer and \nInhofe. They have done a remarkably good job.\n  We have a locked-in set of amendments now. There is no reason to work \ninto the night. We have had a good week. We will have a good week next \nweek, and I wish everyone a good break.\n\n\n                            Motion to Waive\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, prior to the vote on the motion to \nwaive all applicable budget points of order.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, colleagues, we must waive the Budget Act \nin order to continue working on this bill. My friend from Tennessee \nwill tell you otherwise. This bill is 100 percent paid for. The CBO \nscore actually shows a $5 billion surplus over the next 10 years.\n  How is it paid for? I can tell you, my friend Jim Inhofe made sure it \nwould be paid for, and we agreed on it. Through the highway trust fund, \nplus the bipartisan work of the Finance Committee, we have filled this \ntrust fund to cover this bill.\n  Mr. President, 2.8 million jobs hang in the balance. All the work we \ndid today hangs in the balance. We need 60 votes. So if one is for the \nTransportation bill, please vote aye so we can continue our work next \nweek.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, let me first say I am a very strong \nsupporter of a highway bill and of infrastructure but also believe we \nshould have integrity as it relates to this issue of spending.\n  Last August, the world and the country watched as our Nation almost \ncame to a halt, and we agreed, in order to raise the debt ceiling, we \nwould pass the Budget Control Act, which puts strict limitations on \nspending for last year and this year. We are making a mockery of what \nhappened during that time if we waive this Budget Control Act point of \norder that I have put in place.\n  Basically, what we have said--and we have had all kinds of Senators \non both sides of the aisle who have focused on the deficit issue in \ngood faith, but what we basically are saying is we cannot make it 7 \nmonths without violating the Budget Control Act which we put in place \nto create discipline in this body.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on waiving this motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have had rankings as the most \nconservative Member of this body many times, and I have often said \nthere are two areas where I am a big spender: one is national defense, \none is infrastructure.\n\n[[Page S1531]]\n\n  We desperately need this bill. It is interesting to me that so many \nof my good friends--and they are friends, including the Senator from \nTennessee--will vote as they did back in 2008 for $700 billion for a \nbailout and then something such as this comes up and somehow this is an \nexcuse to kill the bill. You can kill the bill and we can go back and \nstart all over again. I wish and I think the Finance Committee is going \nto come up with something that is going to allow us to get this done by \nthe time we get into conference.\n  I urge my conservative friends particularly to go ahead and vote for \nthe highway bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Just 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  The Senator asks for 30 seconds.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, the fact is, the amount of money it would \ntake to not have a budget point of order is so small that we ought to \njust offset discretionary caps for this year by the amount we are \nspending above that for this highway bill.\n  It is ludicrous that we cannot set priorities in a way that calls us \nto live within the Budget Control Act and break it within 7 months of \npassing it and break faith with the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would note--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 10 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. We do not have Senator Thune here, who is doing a great \njob in the Finance Committee. Unfortunately, his mother died and he is \nnot here. We would be able to sit down and solve this problem and not \ndelay this bill. Right now it is set up so we can have a highway bill.\n  This could kill it. I hope folks will talk to their people at home. \nYou cannot do it before this vote, but afterwards I might suggest you \ndo that.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. Most of them have \ngone, but I feel it is important that the Record reflect this last vote \nthat we had. Basically, it was a vote to undo everything we worked so \nhard on all day. It was basically a backdoor way of killing the \ntransportation bill--a bill that is fiscally responsible. It is at \ncurrent levels plus inflation fully paid for. Senator Inhofe and I \nagreed at the outset in the EPW Committee we would only support a bill \nthat was fully paid for.\n  I was honored that we got so many Republican votes on that. I am \nlooking forward to next week when we get this done. I understand the \nSenator from Michigan has something he wants to get accomplished by a \nvoice vote. I ask unanimous consent that he be able to explain that so \nthat we can continue making progress, and then he will yield the floor \nto the Republican side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the next item on the unanimous consent \nagreement is my amendment No. 1818. It is my understanding now that \nthis amendment can be adopted by a voice vote. It has been cleared for \nthat.\n  I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment and I call \nup my amendment No. 1818.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this has been on the list for unanimous \nconsent. I will let the Chair rule on this and see if there is \nsomething else. If not, I will speak for a few minutes afterward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1818) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and I move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will use 3 minutes to very briefly \nexplain.\n  Under the PATRIOT Act, Congress gave the Treasury the power to take a \nrange of measures against foreign financial institutions, or \njurisdictions that are defined as being of primary money-laundering \nconcerns.\n  The Levin-Conrad amendment just adopted would authorize the Treasury \nto impose the same types of measures on the same types of entities if \nTreasury finds them to be impeding U.S. tax enforcement. This amendment \nhad been the subject of a bill for a number of years, and it comes out \nof the hearings of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which \nI chair. Those investigation show each year the United States loses \ntens of billions of dollars in tax revenue from people using offshore \ntax havens to dodge U.S. tax obligations, including through hidden \naccounts at tax haven banks. We issued a lengthy, bipartisan report in \nthe subcommittee. We detailed case history involving tax haven banks \nthat help thousands of U.S. clients dodge their U.S. taxes, banks that \nused a long list of secrecy tricks that make it nearly impossible for \nU.S. tax authorities to trace funds sent to them offshore.\n  Our amendment offers one provision from the Cut Unjustified Tax \nLoopholes Act, S. 2075, which Senator  Conrad and I introduced some \nweeks ago. I continue to hope and believe that momentum is building \nbehind the idea of real tax reform and in support of legislation like \nthe CUT Loopholes Act to comprehensively tackle the many tax loopholes \nthat favor a few taxpayers over ordinary American taxpayers. Closing \ntax loopholes is critical to real deficit reduction, and restoring lost \nrevenue that will allow us to cut the deficit without slashing \nimportant programs. With the threat of sequestration looming at the end \nof this year, it is more vital than ever that we find bipartisan \nagreement on closing tax loopholes.\n  Our amendment hopefully will advance that goal. The full CUT \nLoopholes Act attacks loopholes in two areas. First is closing offshore \ntax loopholes, a subject that the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, which I chair, has explored for years. Second is the \nstock-option loophole, a corporate tax giveaway that forces American \ntaxpayers to subsidize corporations for the stock-options granted to \ntheir executives. The Levin-Conrad amendment takes one provision from \nthe offshore portion of the CUT Loopholes Act.\n  Our amendment would give regulators a powerful tool to stop offshore \ntax havens and their financial institutions that impede U.S. tax \nenforcement from doing business in the United States. The Levin-Conrad \namendment is modeled on the successful provision in the Patriot Act now \nused to combat foreign financial institutions and jurisdictions engaged \nin money laundering.\n  Under section 311 of the Patriot Act, Treasury can take a range of \nmeasures against foreign financial institutions or jurisdictions that \nit finds to be of ``primary money laundering concern.'' The Levin-\nConrad amendment would authorize Treasury to impose the same types of \nmeasures on the same types of entities if Treasury finds them to be \n``significantly impeding U.S. tax enforcement.'' Treasury could, for \nexample, prohibit U.S. banks from accepting wire transfers or honoring \ncredit cards from those foreign banks. The provision would not require \nTreasury to act; it would give Treasury the authority and discretion to \ntake action against foreign jurisdictions or banks that are \nfacilitating U.S. tax evasion and tax avoidance.\n  Over the last several days, we have worked with the administration \nand others to improve our amendment. We have made changes to clarify \nthat it covers significant impediments to tax enforcement, and that \nforeign jurisdictions and financial institutions that are complying \nwith the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act will be viewed favorably \nwith respect to their level of assistance with our tax enforcement \nefforts.\n  Each year, the United States loses an estimated $100 billion in tax \nrevenue from U.S. taxpayers using offshore tax havens to dodge their \nU.S. tax obligations, including through hidden accounts at tax haven \nbanks. My Subcommittee has held several hearings and issued a lengthy \nbipartisan report showing how some tax haven banks have used an array \nof abusive practices to help U.S. clients hide assets and income from \nUncle Sam. We presented detailed case histories involving tax haven \nbanks that helped thousands of U.S. clients dodge their U.S. taxes, \nbanks that used a long list of secrecy tricks to make it nearly \nimpossible for U.S. tax authorities to trace funds sent to them \noffshore. Those tricks included using code names for clients to \ndisguise their identities; directing personnel to use pay phones \ninstead of business phones to make it harder to trace calls back to the \nbank; providing bankers with encrypted computers when travelling to \nkeep client information out of the reach of U.S. tax authorities; \nfunneling money through offshore corporations to conceal incriminating \nwire transfers and make audits difficult; opening accounts in the names \nof offshore shell companies to hide the real owners; and providing \nbankers with counter-surveillance training to detect and deflect \ninquiries from government officials.\n  That kind of conduct, which actively facilitates tax evasion, amounts \nto a declaration of war by offshore secrecy jurisdictions against \nhonest, hardworking taxpayers. It's time to fight\n\n[[Page S1533]]\n\nback and end the abuses inflicted on us by those tax havens. Congress \ntook one step two years ago by requiring foreign banks with U.S \ninvestments to disclose accounts opened by U.S. persons or pay a hefty \ntax on their U.S. income. But that law doesn't apply to tax haven banks \nthat avoid U.S. investments. The United States needs authority to take \nspecial measures against foreign banks that not only refuse to disclose \naccounts opened by their U.S. clients, but also significantly impede \nU.S. tax enforcement efforts. Our amendment would enable the United \nStates to fight back by authorizing the Treasury to tell U.S. banks to \nstop doing business with those aiders and abettors of U.S. tax evasion.\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, we could, by adopting \nthis amendment, reduce the deficit by $900 million over 10 years. That \nis an indication of how closing just one of many loopholes can raise \nsignificant revenue. The CUT Loopholes Act would, conservatively, \nreduce the deficit by $155 billion over 10 years. And other tax \nloopholes not addressed in the CUT Loopholes Act, such as the carried-\ninterest and blended-rate loopholes, offer additional opportunities for \ndeficit reduction.\n  Mr. President, we face difficult choices in the months ahead. We all \nagree that we must reduce the deficit. But the American people also \nexpect us to make sure that we are protecting national security, that \nparents can still send their kids to college, that our citizens still \nhave health care, that we are repairing roads and bridges. We must do \nboth--reduce the deficit and protect important priorities. But we \ncannot accomplish those twin goals unless we restore revenue lost in \npart to the gaping loopholes in our tax law. With this amendment, we \ncan take a step down the path of closing abusive loopholes, and \ncontinue building momentum for the work we must to in the months ahead.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Conrad, Senator Whitehouse, and many \nothers who cosponsored this amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I wish to note for the \nRecord that I agree with Senator Levin on the need to address the \nproblem of tax havens, and it is certainly true that the provision of \nthe Bank Secrecy Act that he seeks to amend has been important in \ndealing with the matters for which it was intended jurisdictions of \nprimary anti-money laundering concern--when it was made part of the \nPATRIOT Act.\n  However, neither I, as Banking Committee Chairman, nor other members \nof the Committee, were consulted by Senator Levin as this amendment was \nbeing developed, although the Bank Secrecy Act is clearly within the \nCommittee's core jurisdiction. Consequently, Committee staff have not \nhad adequate time to review and assess responsibly the amendment and \nits possible ramifications, and have had no chance to vet it with \nappropriate parts of the Treasury Department, including the Office of \nTerrorism and Financial Intelligence, and the Financial Crimes \nEnforcement Network, which administers the Bank Secrecy Act, with the \nNation's tax administrators, with the Department of Justice, or with \nother interested parties. That is normally how changes to the Act are \nmade.\n  Thus it is impossible for us fully to assess the implications of \nthese major changes in the law, or to discern any unintended \nconsequences that may arise from them. Making such significant changes \nshould not be done on the fly, on the floor, without adequate \nconsultation and an appropriate regular order process within the \ncommittee of jurisdiction. While I believe we should address the \nproblem of tax havens, and I understand the urgency of finally, after 4 \nweeks, getting a unanimous consent agreement that allows this bill to \nmove forward, I must also insist that we follow a careful, responsible, \ndeliberative process when making major changes in areas of the law that \nare squarely within the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee.\n  As we move to conference on the transit bill, a conference on which I \nwill play a significant role, I will make sure that we carefully vet \nthis provision and assess whether this is in fact the best solution to \nthe tax haven problem identified by Senator Levin, whether it works as \nit is intended to, and if so whether the provision requires any further \namendment to make it as effective as possible.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

NONHIGHWAY USES IN REST AREAS.\n\n       (a) In General.--A State may permit any nonhighway use in \n     any rest area along any highway (as defined in section 101 of \n     title 23, United States Code), including any commercial \n     activity that does not impair the highway or interfere with \n     the full use and safety of the highway.\n       (b) Private Parties.--A State may permit any private party \n     to carry out a nonhighway use described in subsection (a).\n       (c) Revenues Generated by Nonhighway Uses.--A State may use \n     any revenues generated by a nonhighway use described in \n     subsection (a) to carry out any project (as defined in \n     section 101 of title 23, United States Code).\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to support \nthese amendments. The first one gives the States the freedom to keep \ntheir gas taxes. For decades, Washington has collected State gas taxes \nthrough its highway program, taken its cut off the top, and then \nattached burdensome mandates to the funds before sending them back to \nthe States.\n  It hasn't worked. Since 2008, the highway trust fund has been bailed \nout three times from the Treasury's general fund to the tune of about \n$35 billion. During that time, the Federal Government has required that \n10 percent of all surface transportation funds be spent on wasteful \n``enhancements,'' which has included archeological planning and \nresearch, transportation museums, and scenic ``beautification'' along \nhighways, and so on.\n  The GAO has found that between 2004 and 2008, at a time when our \nbridges and roads have been in disrepair and have needed all the help \nthey could get, the highway trust fund spent $78 billion on projects \nnot related to the support of our Nation's network of highways and \nbridges.\n  With the economy struggling, we need to provide States with the \nability to move quickly and innovatively to implement their \ntransportation priorities instead of a one-size-fits-all solution from \nWashington.\n  Ohio's gas taxes should not be watered down, shouldn't be wasted by \ncostly Federal mandates, regulations, and bureaucracies that Ohio \ndoesn't think are necessary. Rather, States should have the freedom to \nuse the revenue collected from highway users within their own States in \nthe way the State sees fit to get more money into infrastructure.\n  This amendment will give States the freedom they need to do that, \nwhile ensuring that States maintain the current Interstate State \nHighway system in accordance with current standards. We need to pass \nthis amendment today so that States can get back on track.\n  Let me give you an example I recently heard about over the weekend. \nThis comes from Jeff Linkous, who is the Clinton County, OH, engineer. \nIt is an example of how the Federal Government sometimes gets in the \nway and escalates the cost of projects.\n  Todds Fork there is a local stream. It is crossed by two roads, \nPrairie Road and Starbuck Road. For each of the roads, Clinton County \nhas built a bridge over Todds Fork. The same firm designed both \nbridges. They are the same length, but there was one major difference. \nThe bridge for Prairie Road was built using Federal money, while the \nbridge for Starbuck Road was built using Ohio funds.\n  According to Jeff Linkous, the federally funded bridge cost about 20 \npercent more than the State-funded bridge. I hear this all over the \nState, as I am sure my colleagues do as well. It took more time from \ndesign to bid, so it was more expensive and took more time, and was \nmore costly in both respects.\n  The Federal project costs more in a lot of areas, including Federal \nbureaucracy, more environmental studies, more historical and \narchaeological studies, more right-of-way expenses, more design and \nreview costs. The stakes have never been higher. The Federal Government \ncannot continue the current course of wasting our State's gas taxes.\n  Since the last transportation authorization bill, called SAFETY-LU, \nback in 2005, the outlays have exceeded revenues from the gas taxes \nevery single year. We have to get back on a fiscally sustainable path, \neliminate the waste, and allow the States the flexibility to maintain \ntheir roads, bridges, and highways. This amendment would do that. It is \nan opt-out, not a mandate. States could choose to opt out or not.\n  The second amendment also is a fiscally responsible one that helps \nthe taxpayer. It lifts an antiquated one-size-fits-all government \nmandate that dates back to 1956, and it would allow the States the \nfreedom to make their own decisions on how to manage their rest areas, \nwhich the Federal Government forces States to pay to maintain and \nimprove.\n  The current approach would set up a patchwork of exemptions, \nacceptance, and special permits that allows some States to \ncommercialize rest areas, while prohibiting other States from doing the \nsame. Under this amendment, States would have the freedom to \ncommercialize interstate and noninterstate rest areas, as long as they \ndon't impair the highway or interfere with the full use and safety of \nthe highway. At a time when America's core transportation \ninfrastructure--highways, roads and bridges--needs all the help it can \nget, the Ohio Department of Transportation spends $15 million a year on \nrest area upkeep in Ohio alone. The high cost of maintaining and \nimproving these rest areas is handcuffing the ability of Ohio and other \nStates to spend more money on core infrastructure, roads and bridges.\n  This is a fiscally conservative pro-taxpayer amendment that would \nhelp States such as Ohio recover some of these losses or maybe even \nbreak even or maybe add some revenue, by allowing restaurants, gas \nstations, convenience stores, or other entities to lease spaces at rest \nareas. It is a commonsense approach that is supported by the American \nAssociation of State Highway and Transportation Officials and by a lot \nof the private sector as well.\n  This amendment is a way to give core infrastructure projects more \nfunding, while enacting a proposal that actually helps the States to be \nable to make the decision. In Ohio alone, if you take out $50 million a \nyear cost for rest areas and calculate it over the\n\n[[Page S1535]]\n\nnext 20 years, that is $1 billion that could go into highway \ninfrastructure.\n  This amendment doesn't direct or mandate States to commercialize rest \nareas or commercialize in any specific way. It leaves it up to the \nStates, and it gives States the flexibility they want to be able to \nmake their own decisions on how best to use those rest areas.\n  I urge colleagues to join me in voting to lift the Federal mandate \nand give States the freedom to develop their own underused and \nexpensive rest areas.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I now call up my amendment No. 1517, which \nis at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Coats] for himself and Mr. \n     Lugar, proposes an amendment numbered 1517.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To modify the apportionment formula to ensure that the \npercentage of apportioned funds received by a State is the same as the \n            percentage of total gas taxes paid by the State)\n\n       In section 11005(a), in the amendment to section 104(c)(1) \n     of title 23, United States Code, strike ``carry out section \n     134 shall be determined as follows'' and all that follows \n     through subparagraph (B) and insert the following:\n     ``carry out section 134 shall be a percentage of the total \n     amount available for apportionment to all States that is \n     equal to the proportion that--\n       ``(A) the amount of gas taxes paid by the State for a \n     fiscal year; bears to\n       ``(B) the aggregate amount of gas taxes paid by all States \n     for the fiscal year.\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, this amendment No. 1517 is of major \nsignificance to Indiana, as well as to a majority of the States across \nthis country. Most people are familiar with the fact that when they \npull up to the pump, they are not only paying for the cost of gas, they \nare paying the tax on the cost of that gas. The Federal tax on that \ngasoline pumped into the tank is then sent to Washington and put into a \nso-called Federal gas tax fund--a trust.\n  The word ``trust'' is somewhat of a misnomer because, like so many \ntrusts that we create, it doesn't live up to its name. A trust means \nthat it is safeguarded, and nobody else can touch it or use it. The \ntrust fund was designed to collect taxes from the sale of gasoline at \nthe Federal level and then, under a provision, return that tax back to \nthe State.\n  The bottom line is that the majority of States in this country are \nnot getting back what they put in. This amendment is designed to \ncorrect that flaw, or at least that current provision, in terms of the \nway the trust fund is operated. My colleague from Ohio, Senator \nPortman, just announced an amendment that I think makes a great deal of \nsense. I intend to support that. This is somewhat of a similar \namendment, except that what this requires is that a State receives its \nfair share of what it puts into the trust fund.\n  My State, like many across the Nation, draws the short end of the \nstick in terms of getting our money back, in that it turns the trust \nfund into a distribution fund, based upon the outdated formula and \ncontinuation of the broken earmark process. In reality, many States \nreceive less than they put in. The interesting part of this is that \nthere is a formula created by which an average of the amount of money \nspent by States is calculated, and States are rewarded on that basis, \nand the money is distributed on the basis of how that historical \naverage is calculated. So States that have had very efficient Members \nof Congress creating earmarks and pouring more money into their States \nby earmarking end up with a higher historical average. As a result \nthose States benefit now from the distribution from the trust fund to a \ngreater degree. In fact, they are called the donee States because they \nreceive more than what is put in from the donor States.\n\n  So those States that have taken more responsible fiscal measures in \nterms of how they spend their money and how they spend the taxpayers' \ndollars, such as the State of Indiana, end up being shortchanged simply \nbecause we have been more prudent in terms of how we spend our money. \nWe haven't relied on earmarks over the years in Indiana, which under \nthe current version of this bill would have raised our historical \naverage. As a consequence we end up being a donor State donating more \nmoney to Washington than we receive in return.\n  The Senate has recently passed legislation to end the practice of \nearmarking. I think this is a very positive step forward. But we now \nhave a Federal program that, in a sense, is calculated and based on the \npractice of past earmarking. So if we are serious about eliminating \nearmarking, we are also going to need to fix the formulas used in \ncurrent programs that are rewarding States with more money than they \ndeserve because these states received more earmarks in previous years. \nMy amendment fixes this inequity and restores the trust fund to its \noriginal intent--to give taxpayer money back to them in the amount they \ndeposited.\n  Under my amendment each State will get back what it put in out of the \ntotal available funds. It is a fairness issue and the trust fund is \ntruly a trust fund. This amendment will send a message to the American \npeople and the administration that Congress is serious about changing \nthe culture in Washington. The American people have rejected \nearmarking, and it would be irresponsible for this institution to \nreward that practice under this highway bill.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment. It takes \na stand for fairness and fiscal integrity. It will be brought up on \nTuesday. I urge my colleagues to support this both from the standpoint \nof fairness--which gives back to every State and every taxpayer the \nmoney a fair share of what they put into the trust fund as ending the \npractice of rewarding States that benefitted from earmarks and \npunishing those that have been fiscally prudent.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1540\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 1540, which is \nat the desk, and I ask unanimous consent that it be reported by number.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report the \namendment by number.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Blunt], for himself and Mr. \n     Casey, proposes an amendment numbered 1540.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To modify the section relating to off-system bridges)\n\n       Beginning on page 94, strike line 6 and all that follows \n     through page 95, line 7, and insert the following:\n       ``(A) Set-aside.--Of the amounts apportioned to a State for \n     fiscal year 2012 and each fiscal year thereafter under this \n     section, the State shall obligate for activities described in \n     subsection (c)(2) for off-system bridges an amount that is \n     not less than 15 percent of the amount of funds apportioned \n     to the State for the highway bridge program for fiscal year \n     2009.\n       ``(B) Reduction of expenditures.--The Secretary, after \n     consultation with State and local officials, may reduce the \n     requirement for expenditures for off-system bridges under \n     subparagraph (A) with respect to the State if the Secretary \n     determines that the State has inadequate needs to justify the \n     expenditure.\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. I thank the clerk for reporting.\n\n[[Page S1536]]\n\n  Mr. President, this amendment deals with the whole issue of off-\nsystem bridges. These are bridges that are not part of the State \nsystem, are not part of the Federal system, but normally are run by \ncounty governments.\n  In our State, as in most States near or east of the Mississippi \nRiver, we have lots of counties. We have 115. They have large numbers \nof bridges, and for a number of years now they have benefited from 15 \npercent of the bridge funds that go to States. I think most of us, if \nwe meet with county commissioners or those responsible for county \ngovernment about their highway concerns, this would be an issue we have \nall heard about.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania Mr. Casey and I have introduced this \namendment. It doesn't change current law. In fact, it just goes forward \nwith current law in this bill. This bill would eliminate the \nrequirement of States to give 15 percent to counties if counties have a \nuse for it, and I think that would be a mistake. So I join Senator \nCasey and others in hoping we are able to approve this amendment next \nweek.\n  Mr. President, I also would like to speak on another amendment, an \namendment that we apparently will not vote on; that is, amendment No. \n1743. This is not at the desk, I don't think, at this moment, and it \ndoesn't need to be read if it is. But I hope this is an issue that, as \nthis Transportation bill progresses, we can continue to look at.\n  This is an amendment I have introduced with the Senator from South \nCarolina, Mr. DeMint, and the Senator from Utah, Mr. Lee, on the \ncommerce portion of the highway bill. Overall, almost every portion of \nthis bill has gone through the open process of committee hearings, of \nmarkups, and now of floor time. The one part of this bill that hasn't \nhad a committee markup or even a committee hearing in this Congress is \nthe rail portion of the bill. In fact, the first time I saw this \nversion of the bill was just a few weeks ago when the underlying bill \nwas already pending and it was too late to have the normal process to \nlook at what could happen and should happen as it relates to railroads.\n  As a member of the committee of jurisdiction, the Commerce Committee, \nI am concerned we haven't done our due diligence, and my amendment \nwould simply strike this section of the bill in response to this closed \nprocess. I hope that is the final determination of this bill before it \ngoes to the President's desk.\n  Since the Congress abolished the Interstate Commerce Commission in \n1995, there has been no Federal licensing system for entry or exit of \nnew rail passenger operators, only Federal requirements to ensure \nsafety. That meant anybody who wanted to get into this business could, \nas long as they met the safety requirements. Currently, State \ntransportation agencies increasingly use competitive bidding to choose \na contract rail operator who can provide the best value. As a result, \nwe are starting to see an actual competitive and robust rail passenger \nmarket with more than seven companies--which includes Amtrak but isn't \nlimited to Amtrak--competing for these contracts.\n  Unfortunately, the language in the highway bill requires passenger \nrail operators, both public agencies and private businesses, to deal \nwith an expensive and time-consuming licensing process in front of \npolitical employees at the Surface Transportation Board. However, this \nnew regulation will not apply to Amtrak, putting its competitors at a \ndistinct disadvantage. The bill, as it stands, would subject the \npassenger rail industry to an ever-changing political dynamic at the \ndiscretion of the Surface Transportation Board, likely resulting in a \ngovernment-sanctioned passenger rail monopoly. The board would also \nhold broad veto powers to prevent a track-owning railroad to make \nagreements with any preferred operator other than Amtrak.\n  This bill would also require passenger rail operators to obtain a new \nboard license every time a contract operator is replaced. This \nrequirement appears to be aimed at preventing competitive selection of \nprivate sector contract operators, discouraging the replacement of \noperators through competitive bidding.\n  At a time when we are looking to promote private sector job creation, \nI believe this language is simply a step in the wrong direction. If \nthis language becomes law, it will stifle any kind of private sector \ncompetition and job growth. The seven companies that have been formed \nin recent years and that compete actively against each other will no \nlonger be doing that, and it will promote a government-run, taxpayer \nsubsidized rail system.\n  My amendment would take this language out of the bill so that we \ncould go through the normal process and decide if that is what we want. \nIf the Congress, through the normal process, decides that is what we \nwant to do, that is one thing. But putting it in a big bill without \nhearings--a bill we all believe to be important--is the wrong step.\n  The American Public Transportation Association, the American \nAssociation of State Highway and Transportation Officials, the National \nRailroad Construction and Maintenance Association, the United \nBrotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America all support this \namendment.\n  We will not be voting on it next week. But I hope as this bill \nprogresses toward what could be a signature by the President we at some \npoint take another look at this part of the bill and decide if this is \na step that is in the best interest of the country or of rail \npassengers now and in the future. I think the answer to that is no. I \nam prepared to live with whatever the answer is, if it is an answer we \narrive at through the normal process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote \nchanges entered by Senators Murkowski and Collins reflect that the vote \non the Vitter amendment was vote No. 28.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID.

GIRDLER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man \nwho has spent his life working to help build a better Kentucky and a \nbetter United States of America. Mr. Donald E. Girdler of Pulaski \nCounty, KY, better known as simply ``Donnie,'' recently passed away. He \nwas 63 years old.\n  Mr. Girdler was passionate about politics, and he made it his life's \nwork. He entered the political arena when he first worked on the \ncampaign of my good friend Congressman Hal Rogers of Kentucky's Fifth \nCongressional District. Mr. Girdler had worked for Hal as a detective \nfor 5 years before Hal, then a Commonwealth's attorney, decided to make \na run at the U.S. House of Representatives. The political savvy and \ndirection that Mr. Girdler would bring to the table would propel Hal \nRogers to victory.\n  There was a definite sense of gratitude from the Congressman for his \ntrustworthy friend, Donnie Girdler. Mr. Girdler was at home in the \nworld of politics and made connections in Washington, DC, that included \nbecoming personally acquainted with five different Presidents of the \nUnited States and becoming personal friends with President George H.W. \nBush and President George W. Bush.\n  Donnie went on to work for over a quarter of a century for Rogers \nbefore finally retiring and returning to offer his much sought after \ninsight in local politics. He made friends in several southeastern \nKentucky counties and helped many of them get elected to public office. \nMr. Girdler became a distinguished political consultant for the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky because of his years of experience and, most \nimportantly, his absolute love of public service.\n\n[[Page S1537]]\n\n  Donald Girdler made an everlasting contribution to the world of \nKentucky politics, and his motivation and innovation paved the way for \nothers to get involved in their own way by bringing opportunities and \njobs to the Pulaski County area. Donnie loved working in politics. He \nloved serving the public, but he was happiest when he was at his \nfarmhouse in Nancy, KY, and he could fix up a pot of coffee and talk \npolitics with his friends that would drop by from time to time.\n  At this time I would like to ask my colleagues in the Senate to join \nme in commemorating Donald E. Girdler, an individual whose hard work \nand upstanding character, combined with his talents and passion, have \nforever changed the climate of politics in the Commonwealth of \nKentucky.\n  A news story highlighting the eventful life of Donnie Girdler was \nrecently published in the Somerset, KY, area publication, the \nCommonwealth Journal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that said story be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Commonwealth Journal, Jan. 9, 2012]\n\n                Political Icon Donnie Girdler Dead at 63\n\n                            (By Bill Mardis)\n\n       A longtime aide to Congressman Hal Rogers and one of the \n     Lake Cumberland area's most savvy political strategists has \n     died.\n       Donnie Girdler's death Sunday ended a career that evolved \n     through service in the military, local law enforcement, \n     congressional front man, and political adviser to candidates \n     and confidant to presidents. He was 63.\n       ``As one who knew him for 37 years, I will say he was \n     highly motivated,'' said Dan Venters, justice of the Kentucky \n     Supreme Court.\n       ``I have known Donnie Girdler as long as I have known \n     anyone in Pulaski County,'' said Venters. ``When I first came \n     here to work in (then) Commonwealth's Attorney Hal Rogers's \n     office, Donnie was the first person I met. He was serving as \n     Commonwealth's detective in Hal's office.\n       ``There was something about us that bonded . . . he became \n     one of my closest friends and confidants,'' said Venters.\n       Girdler worked for Congressman Rogers for more than a \n     quarter of a century.\n       ``Donnie was one of my closest advisers and served \n     faithfully as a field representative for the Fifth \n     Congressional District,'' said Rogers. ``As a retired member \n     of the honorable U.S. Marine Corps and a former \n     Commonwealth's detective, Donnie was a man of integrity and \n     loyalty.\n       ``With courage of conviction, Donnie played a key role in \n     bringing various opportunities and projects to the region. \n     But it was his passion for politics that many sought during \n     campaigns. His political savvy and insight were invaluable to \n     local, state and federal politicians. He was a true patriot \n     and a true friend,'' said Rogers.\n       Girdler was a friend of presidents. He was personally \n     acquainted with five presidents and was a friend of the two \n     Bushes--George W. Bush and his father, George H.W. Bush. He \n     worked in Bob Dole's presidential campaign and was a \n     presidential elector for George W. Bush.\n       Locally, Girdler managed the successful campaign of Pulaski \n     County Judge-Executive Barty Bullock and served as Bullock's \n     deputy judge for a year and a half.\n       ``I am very saddened by the recent passing of Donnie \n     Girdler,'' Bullock said in a statement. ``I first met him \n     when I ran for county judge-executive in 2006. As we worked \n     and spent numerous hours together, we became very good \n     friends.\n       ``Since the onset of his illness we have not had as much \n     communication as in the past, but I still think of our \n     friendship fondly. I know that Donnie had many friends, and \n     will be sadly missed by all who knew him,'' Bullock said.\n       A political consultant since leaving Congressman Rogers's \n     office, Girdler developed close friendships with politicians \n     and officeholders in wide areas, particularly in McCreary, \n     Whitley, Clay and Knox counties.\n       Said Lori Hines, a political partner, ``He had a great \n     insight into the human mind. He knew how people would react \n     more than anyone I have ever known. He definitely was a \n     people person. His voice was what defined him. People would \n     stop at his farmhouse in Nancy, have a cup of coffee and talk \n     politics,'' said Hines.\n       Girdler has been nominated as a member of the Republican \n     Fifth District Hall of Fame. He will be inducted posthumously \n     in March.\n       His body is at Pulaski Funeral Home where funeral \n     arrangements are pending. A complete obituary will be in \n     Wednesday's Commonwealth Journal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/08/senate-section/article/S1537-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    REMEMBERING JOHN BROOKMAN PERRY\n\n Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I wish to honor the memory of a man \nwhose life was dedicated to serving his community and protecting his \nfellow citizens. One year ago today, Deputy U.S. Marshal John Brookman \nPerry was killed in the line of duty while serving his country and \ncommunity. Deputy Perry was assigned to the U.S. Marshals Eastern \nDistrict of Missouri in St. Louis and was serving a warrant when he was \nfatally shot. Today we honor his memory and the sacrifices he made for \nall of us.\n  Deputy Perry was born on the west side of Chicago in Glen Ellyn, IL, \nand graduated from Southern Illinois University with a bachelor's \ndegree in geology. He went to work for the Madison County probation \noffice in Edwardsville, IL where he served for 16 years.\n  In 2001 he graduated from the U.S. Marshals Academy and went to work \nat the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. Deputy Perry \nreturned to the Midwest in 2005 when he was assigned to the Eastern \nDistrict in St. Louis. There, he served as a team leader on the \nfugitive task force and was the district's firearms instructor.\n  Deputy Perry came from a family dedicated to public service and was a \nnatural fit for the U.S. Marshals Service. His brother, Bart Perry, has \nworked for the State of Illinois for over 25 years as a probation \nofficer, and both his father and grandfather were Federal judges. His \nfather served as a bankruptcy court judge and his grandfather was a \nformer coal miner who became a district court judge. As a young boy, \nDeputy Perry was exposed to the Federal courts and became familiar with \nthe U.S. Marshals Service and their work.\n  We should never forget the sacrifices that men like Deputy Perry and \ntheir families make daily to protect all of us. Our society depends on \nthese dedicated individuals who risk their lives to protect the common \ngood. I want to express my gratitude and thanks and ask the Senate to \njoin me in remembering U.S. Deputy Marshal John Brookman Perry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/08/senate-section/article/S1537-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:01 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2842.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve \noversight of educational assistance provided under laws administered by \nthe Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Defense, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, today, I am introducing The Military and \nVeterans Educational Reform Act of 2012. This bi-partisan bill will \nensure that all educational institutions receiving\n\n[[Page S1542]]\n\nfunding from the Post-9/11 GI Bill and Tuition Assistance educational \nprograms are governed by the appropriate quality standards.\n  I am pleased to be joined in this initiative by Senators Harkin, \nCarper, McCaskill and Senator Scott Brown.\n  I have been working on this legislation for several months. It \nincludes many recommendations made by Veterans service organizations, \nmilitary organizations and various GAO reports on the need to improve \nthe accountability and oversight of educational institutions.\n  This past year marked the second-year anniversary of the \nimplementation of the landmarks Post-9/11 G.I. Bill, which I introduced \non my first day in office. I take pride in saying that we have been \nable to provide the proper investment in the future of those who, since \n9/11, have given so much to this country.\n  History demonstrates clearly that well educated veterans not only \nhave an easier transition and readjustment experience, but also boast \nhigher income levels and enjoy a better quality of life.\n  Since 2009, more than 1.1 million servicemembers and veterans have \napplied to receive their new benefits and nearly 700,000 have received \nbenefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill.\n  For these reasons, I believe that we in the Congress need to do all \nwe can to ensure that we are preserving the integrity of the greatest \nGI Bill our veterans and military members have ever had.\n  Concern with waste in the for-profit sector is not a new issue. If we \nlook back in history, 5 years following the creation of the World War \nII GI Bill in 1944, we saw that more than 5,000 for-profit schools were \ncreated. Many of these schools had questionable outcomes and catered \nexclusively to veterans.\n  The World War II GI Bill was almost derailed because of the thousands \nof for-profit colleges created overnight targeting veterans. Due to the \nconcern with the reported waste and abuse in the system, the Vietnam GI \nBill tuition provision became a flat monthly stipend.\n  Recent data shows that 8 of the 10 largest recipients of Post-9/11 GI \nBill benefits are for-profit institutions. Many of these schools have \nmore than doubled the amount of Post-9/11 GI Bill dollars they received \nfrom 2009 2011.\n  The growth in this sector has been tremendous in the past couple of \nyears. Between 1998 and 2008, for-profit schools grew 225 percent.\n  Last month, the Department of Defense released new data showing that \nfor-profit colleges received half of all military tuition assistance \ndollars--$280 million out of $563 million spent last year on this \nprogram.\n  In 2009, the 15 publicly traded for-profit education companies spent \n$3.7 billion on marketing. A disproportionate share of this money is \ngoing to marketing and recruitment of veterans into poorly performing \nfor-profit schools, and the results of the Veteran's Administration \ndata on the GI Bill reflect this.\n  The problem is not necessarily the growth of the for-profit sector. \nThere are some for-profit institutions that are providing our students \na great education. But with huge Federal dollars being spent in this \nsector, we owe it to the taxpayers and to our veterans to carefully \nmonitor and provide adequate oversight. Even more important, we owe it \nto the men and women who served that the GI benefits they have earned \nwill not be lost or squandered on an education that fails to equip them \nwith the skills and knowledge they need to be successful.\n  In light of these issues, I have introduced the Military and Veterans \nEducational Reform Act of 2012. My legislation requires schools \nparticipating in educational assistance programs through the Department \nof Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense to meet the same \neducational standards currently required for other federal funding, \nsuch as the Pell Grant. This bill strengthens the responsibilities of \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense to assist \nindividuals in making an informed decision to further their continued \nacademic success.\n  This legislation will increase transparency of information about \neducational institutions, provide critical services to assist students \nin the decision-making process and throughout their career, and promote \ninteragency information sharing by requiring all programs receiving \nfunding from Tuition Assistance and Post-9/11 GI Bill be Title IV \neligible. Title IV eligibility strengthens the requirements programs \nmust meet in order to receive Federal funding.\n  By also increasing the transparency of educational institutions by \nrequiring them to provide information to potential students on \ngraduation rates, default rates, and other critical information to \nensure that individuals have the information necessary in choosing the \nbest academic program.\n  By expanding the training and outreach responsibilities of the State \nApproving Agencies by requiring them to conduct outreach activities to \nveterans and members of the Armed Forces, requiring State Approving \nAgencies to conduct audits of schools and to report those findings to \nthe Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n  By requiring that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary \nof Defense develop a centralized complaints process for individuals to \nreport instances of misrepresentation, fraud, waste and abuse and other \ncomplaints against educational institutions.\n  By requiring that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary \nof Defense provide counseling to individuals before they use their \nbenefits.\n  By increasing greater coordination between the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, the Department of Defense and the Department of Education by \nrequiring information sharing among these agencies.\n  This is a bill that I hope both sides of the aisle will support. It \nnot only aims at preserving the greatest educational benefits for our \nveterans and military students but it also ensures that our Federal \ndollars are being spent on quality education.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BEGICH:\n  S. 2180. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na tax credit for professional school personnel in early childhood \neducation, to expand the deduction for certain expenses of teachers to \nteachers in early childhood education, and to modify the credit for \ndependent care services; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a package of legislation, \nthe Keep Investing in Developmental Success, KIDS, Act of 2012. These \nthree early childhood bills will address access, quality and \naffordability in early education programs.\n  These bills, S. 2180, S. 2181, and S. 2182, are a step towards a \ncommitment to effective early education programs. We all want America's \nkids ready to learn and ready to succeed when they enter school.\n  All the data shows early education is one of the strongest predictors \nof graduation.\n  The payoff is clear: every dollar invested in early education \nprograms today returns $16 in better outcomes for individuals, families \nand communities. You can't find a better investment and the payoff is \nvery clear when you see and talk to the kids who have gone through Head \nStart.\n  One snowy night about a month ago in Anchorage, I met with about 50 \nstrongly committed Alaska educators to talk about how to improve our \nschools and prepare our students for the competitive 21st century \neconomy.\n  From that conversation arose the idea for three bills I am \nintroducing today.\n  First, we will amend the tax code to provide a tax credit for early \nchildhood educators. The Tax Relief for Early Educators Act will expand \nthe deductions for certain expenses for early childhood education and \nincrease the child care tax credit so more parents can afford to put \ntheir children in quality early child development programs.\n  Right now, a family pays more than $1,400 a month for two young \nchildren. For most working families, that is not only a hardship, that \nis out of reach. Because employees of early childhood programs tend to \nearn low wages, we also will offer them a tax credit of up to $3,000 \nand expand the deduction for certain expenses to early childhood \neducators.\n  Second, we will create a new student loan forgiveness program for \ngraduates of associate's or bachelor's programs in early education. The \nPreparing and Reinvesting in Early Education Act, or\n\n[[Page S1543]]\n\nPRE ED, will provide needed relief for early educators and encourage \nmore to work with kids through age five. Well-trained educators \nproviding quality early education to our children makes all the \ndifference in a child's success.\n  Third, we need to reward companies offering onsite or near-site \nchildcare with a company cost-share. We know it works for the company \nand for the employee--just look around our state.\n  In Alaska BP, Credit Union One and Fairbanks Memorial Hospital are \ngreat examples. They all offer quality onsite centers. They know it \nmakes more productive employees.\n  The Child Care Public-Private Partnership Act will establish a \nprogram to provide child care through partnerships. Through new grant \nincentives for small and medium companies, we can help more Alaska \ncompanies do the same.\n  This package of bills, the KIDS Act, is not a new idea, and I \nappreciate my colleagues who have come before this body with similar \nproposals. However, this is the time to pass these bills--for working \nfamilies struggling to make ends meet. Parents should have access to \naffordable, high-quality early care and learning services, early \nchildhood educators should have liveable wages and benefits and \nbusiness will be more productive.\n  In closing, let me say I feel very privileged to be involved with \npolicy discussions and the formation of bills such as these.
