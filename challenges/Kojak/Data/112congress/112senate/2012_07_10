Objection having been heard, the \nbill will be placed on the calendar.\n\n\n                        Small Business Tax Cuts\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my Republican colleagues talk a good game on \ntaxes, but Democrats' record of cutting taxes for small businesses \nspeaks louder than Republican rhetoric.\n  Since President Obama took office, taxes have been cut for small \nbusinesses 18 times. Today he will advance a plan to cut taxes for \nsmall firms for the 19th time in just 3\\1/2\\ years.\n  The Small Business Jobs and Tax Relief Act would put money back into \nthe coffers of true job creators. Under our plan business owners who \nhire new workers or give raises to current employees would get a 10-\npercent tax credit. Our legislation would also cut taxes for firms that \ninvest in new equipment, allowing more than 2 million businesses to \ngrow faster.\n  These two proposals will create almost 1 million new jobs, and \neconomists from across the political spectrum agree this is the most \neffective and efficient way to give the economy a badly needed boost. \nIf my Republican colleagues want their record to match their rhetoric, \nthey will end their filibuster of this worthy measure, and they will \nvote to support the real job creators.\n  Unfortunately, while Republicans agree we should cut taxes, their \napproach is completely different from ours. Congressional Republicans \nwant to lavish huge across-the-board tax cuts on billionaire hedge fund \nmanagers and mega-rich celebrities such as Donald Trump.\n\n[[Page S4794]]\n\n  Unlike our proposal, the Republican plan, which passed the House of \nRepresentatives, would not do a thing to encourage hiring. More than 99 \npercent of businesses in America would qualify for this extravagant tax \nbreak--even if they didn't create a single new job or raise wages for \none solitary employee. In fact, fabulously rich so-called small \nbusiness owners such as Kim Kardashian and Paris Hilton could qualify \nfor these wasteful giveaways. Even though three-quarters of Americans \noppose more tax breaks for the wealthiest few, nearly half of the \nbenefits of this $46 billion Republican proposal would go to \nmillionaires and billionaires.\n  Mr. President, we Democrats want to cut taxes for small businesses, \nbut the Republican alternative that passed the House of Representatives \nis simply the wrong way to do it.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, last Friday morning the American people \nwoke up to the news that the economy is on life support. The first \nresponse of the President of the United States was that we are headed \nin the right direction.\n  Let's just think about that for a second. The President's first \nreaction to the news that more Americans signed up for disability last \nmonth than got jobs was to flash a thumbs up and head back to the \ncampaign trail, just like his first reaction to a question about the \neconomy at a recent White House press conference was to say that the \nprivate sector is doing just fine.\n  Well, obviously, answers like that just aren't going to cut it. The \nPresident's advisers must be telling him that much. So yesterday the \nPresident--the man at the wheel--changed his tune by doing his \nWashington best to change the subject.\n  For 3\\1/2\\ years, this White House has shown an utter lack of \nimagination when it comes to jobs and the economy. If the solution \ndoesn't involve more government, they are not interested. That is all \nthey have. So yesterday the President went back to the same well one \nmore time. After 3\\1/2\\ years of more government, more debt, more \nspending, more taxes, and more regulations, he demanded even more.\n  Yesterday the President issued an ultimatum: Raise taxes on about 1 \nmillion business owners to fund more government, and I will not raise \ntaxes on the rest of you. That was his considered response to this \ncrisis.\n  Let's leave aside for a second the complete and total absurdity of \nraising taxes on job creators in the middle of what some are calling \nthe slowest recovery ever. Leave that aside and ask yourself a more \nfundamental question: Whose money is it in the first place?\n  Why should small businesses be put on the defensive about keeping \nmoney they have worked for and earned? It seems as though every day for \nthe past 3\\1/2\\ years we have woken up to stories about waste and abuse \nin government--whether it was a bankrupt solar company or the $800,000 \nparty some government agency threw for itself or this week's report \nthat we overspent on unemployment benefits by about $14 billion.\n  As far as I am concerned, there should not even be a debate. The \ngovernment doesn't need any more money. It is the government that \nshould be answering to us for the tax dollars it has wasted and \nmisdirected. It is the President who should be on the defensive. He is \nthe one who pledged he would cut the deficit in half by the end of his \nfirst term but doubled it instead. He is the one who spent the first \n3\\1/2\\ years of his administration shattering spending records.\n  Now he wants us to believe he will direct new tax revenue toward \ntackling the deficit? Look, yesterday's announcement was many things, \nbut let's be honest. It wasn't a plan for deficit reduction, and it \nsure wasn't a plan for job creation. First and foremost, it was a \ndistraction. By any standard the President has a nightmarish economic \nrecord. By demanding higher taxes on the few, he is trying to direct \nattention from it.\n  Second, it is deeply ideological. The President has already admitted \nthat the last thing we need to do in the middle of a recession is raise \ntaxes. He knows that yesterday's proposal would only make the economy \nworse. He knows that. His goal isn't jobs, it is income redistribution. \nIt is his idea of fairness, which means you earn and he takes. His \ndefinition of fairness means you earn and he takes.\n  Third, it is purely political. The President's top priority for the \nlast year hasn't been creating jobs; it has been saving his own. Let me \nsay that again. The top priority of the President hasn't been creating \njobs for anybody else; it has been saving his own job. His advisers \nseem to think if they create enough scapegoats that he will slip by in \nNovember.\n  That is why he has spent the past year trying to convince the public \nthat somehow his predecessor is more responsible for the economic \nfailures of the past 3\\1/2\\ years than he is; that all the bailouts and \nthe trillions in borrowed money and the government takeover of health \ncare and the onslaught of bureaucratic redtape and regulations are \nsomehow irrelevant to the fact that we are mired in the slowest \neconomic recovery in modern times; that we are just one more stimulus \naway from an economic boom; that the fact that we have had unemployment \nabove 8 percent for 41 straight months has nothing to do with the \npolicies he put in place in his first 2 years in office; that all these \nmassive pieces of legislation he touted were somehow hugely historic \nyet, at the same time, completely unrelated to the joblessness, \nuncertainty, and decline we have seen almost every day since.\n  It is this kind of economic thinking that leads to the kind of \nproposal the President announced yesterday, which says a tax hike is \nharmful to middle-income earners but somehow meaningless for the \n940,000 business owners who will get slammed by this tax hike, as well \nas all the other tax hikes the President has in store for them at the \nend of this year.\n  The sad truth is the President isn't just ignoring the economic \nproblems we face; he is exacerbating them. He is running us headlong to \nthe cliff that is fast approaching in January. Frankly, it is hard to \nimagine a President deliberately doing all these things he knows will \nonly make things worse, but that is where we are. Now it is incumbent \nupon the rest of us to outline a better path. And that is what we \nsupport--commonsense progrowth policies that liberate the private \nsector. It starts by repealing a health care law that is stifling \nbusinesses, by ending the senseless regulations that are crushing \nbusinesses, by ending the threats of tax hikes on businesses that can't \nafford them, and by putting our faith in free enterprise over the \ndictates of a centralized government. In the Obama economy, we need \npolicies that are designed to create jobs, not destroy them.\n\n  No one should see an income tax hike next year--no one--not families, \nnot small businesses, no one. We should extend all income tax rates \nwhile we make progress on fundamental tax reform.\n  It is time to put the failed policies of the past 3\\1/2\\ years aside \nand try something else. Washington has done enough damage to the \neconomy already. Let's focus on the kinds of progrowth jobs proposals \nthe Republican-led House has already passed. And above all, let's do no \nharm. It is time to give the private sector and the innovators and the \nworkers who drive it a fighting chance.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n\n\n                           Order of Business\n\n  Under the previous order, the following hour will be equally divided \nand controlled between the two leaders or their designees, with the \nmajority controlling the first half and the Republicans controlling the \nfinal half.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it has been 3 years--3 years--since my \ncolleague from Kentucky who just spoke announced to America that his \nhighest priority as a Senate leader was to make sure Barack Obama was a \none-term President. That was his highest priority. And since that time, \nwe have seen a record number of Republican filibusters on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n\n[[Page S4795]]\n\nThey have broken all records in terms of efforts to stop even to allow \na vote on the priorities of the Obama administration. For the \nRepublican leader to then come to the floor and bemoan the fact that \nthe President has not done more suggests he believes we are victims of \npolitical amnesia. And we are not.\n  We know the President came with a stimulus bill when we were losing \n800,000 jobs a month. That is what we were losing the month the \nPresident was sworn in. He came with a stimulus bill to turn the \neconomy around and to give tax breaks to businesses and individuals. \nAnd we ended up getting three Republicans who joined us over the \nobjection of their leadership. We needed those three to break the \nRepublican filibuster on the President's effort to get the economy \nmoving forward again.\n  When it came time for health care reform, Senator Baucus, chairman of \nthe Senate Finance Committee, invited the Republicans to sit down and \nconstruct a bipartisan bill with us, and they walked away--they walked \naway and then started a Republican filibuster against any change in \nhealth care reform. Does anyone remember the Republican alternative for \nhealth care reform? Of course not because there wasn't any. They didn't \nhave a bill. They didn't even have a good idea. They were just here to \nsay no and to use their filibuster to achieve it, and that story has \nrepeated itself over and over again.\n  In trying to rein in Wall Street greed so we didn't go through \nanother recession like the one we are living through now, not enough \nRepublicans would step up and support that. We faced a Republican \nfilibuster again.\n  So for the Republican leader to come to the floor and bemoan the fact \nthat certain things have not occurred here is to ignore the reality \nthat he said his highest priority was to make Barack Obama a one-term \nPresident, and he has demonstrated that with an endless stream of \nRepublican filibusters.\n\n\n                                Tax Cuts\n\n  Now, let's get down to tax cuts. What President Obama said yesterday \nwas this: To every single American, your first $250,000 of income--your \nfirst $250,000--will continue to receive a good tax break. There will \nbe no increase in taxes on the first $250,000 of income. For 98 percent \nof Americans, that is great because they make less than $250,000, so \nthey are not going to see any tax increase by the President's proposal. \nBut for the 2 percent who make more than $250,000, the President's \nsuggestion was to go back to the tax rates, for that money earned over \n$250,000, go back to the tax rates of the Clinton years, which was a \ntime of dramatic economic expansion and the last time we in Washington \nbalanced a budget. Now, that is not a radical idea, it is a sensible \nidea.\n  You can't come to the floor of the Senate day after day, week after \nweek posing for holy pictures about dealing with the deficit--my \ngoodness, the deficit--and then when we suggest raising taxes on only 2 \npercent of the American people, say: Oh, that is unacceptable. The only \nway to reach fiscal stability and deal with the deficit and debt is to \nput it all on the table, to make sure spending and revenue are on the \ntable. And if we can't touch income over $250,000 for the top 2 percent \nof Americans, we will never honestly deal with the deficit crisis.\n  The Republican leader came to the floor and said: Well, last week's \nemployment numbers were not that encouraging. And I would join him in \nsaying I wish they were better too. I am not going to say this is where \nI want to be, but I will say this: For 28 straight months--28 straight \nmonths--under President Obama, we have seen increases in private sector \nemployment. Jobs are being lost in the public sector. We know that. \nThey are being lost back home as State and local governments and others \nare reducing their payrolls. That is part of it. It is one of the \nreasons we haven't seen a more fulsome growth in employment. That is a \nreality. But private sector job growth has continued for 28 straight \nmonths.\n\n  So for the Republican leader to suggest that the President took this \nnews and then went out on the campaign trail, he forgot something. Last \nFriday President Barack Obama signed the bipartisan Transportation \nbill--a bill that will create and keep more than 2 million Americans \nworking in this country building the infrastructure we need. This is a \nbill we have been waiting on for 3 years, and the President signed it, \nand I am glad he did. It helps Illinois, and it helps the Nation.\n\n\n                 Small Business Jobs and Tax Relief Act\n\n  Let me also say that we can do more things to help get this economy \nmoving forward. The first thing I would like to see is for the \nRepublicans to end their filibuster against the small business bill we \nwill have before us today. What does this bill do? This bill says to \nsmall businesses across America: We will give you a tax credit if you \nwill create jobs or if you will expand your payroll--a tax credit--and \nwe will give you a quicker depreciation on those items of equipment--\ntechnology and capital--that you purchase now.\n  This would be a shot in the arm. It is a recipe every Republican has \nsworn to Grover Norquist they are going to stand by come hell or high \nwater--to cut taxes, cut taxes on small businesses so they will create \njobs, give them a break to buy equipment so they can depreciate it more \nquickly and create more jobs with those who are supplying them. What is \nwrong with this notion? It is supposed to be the Republican credo: cut \ntaxes, and for small business. Can't we agree on that? No. We are \nfacing a Republican filibuster on that too.\n  Well, it is an illustration, in my mind, of an example of a bill that \ncan move us forward with 1 million new jobs. Why won't the Republicans \njoin us? Well, because they have said over and over again that they \nwant this President to be a one-term President. They do not want \nsuccess. They don't want job creation on his watch. They want as \nmiserable a record as they can help produce to take into the November \nelections.\n  In fact, one Republican Senator said 2 weeks ago in the press: I hope \nthe defense contractors start laying people off with the prospect of \nspending cuts in the future, and the sooner the better. Don't wait \nuntil after the elections; do it now.\n  How can he say that when we have to face these workers and their \nfamilies? We don't want anyone laid off; we want people to have an \nopportunity to work good-paying jobs.\n  I think we understand what we face today. We have to come together as \na nation with solutions that aren't part of the Presidential campaign \nrhetoric.\n  I served on the Simpson-Bowles Commission. I think it was a \nresponsible way forward. I didn't agree with all of it, but it was a \nresponsible way to move forward on deficit reduction. But we also put \neverything on the table in terms of deficit reduction. We conceded the \nfact that we can't start the cutting that is needed until we bring \nourselves strongly out of this recession, and we are moving forward on \nthat path. It is time for us to continue that movement forward on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  I am asking for somebody to throw open the windows and bring in some \nfresh air here in the Senate this afternoon. When we vote on the small \nbusiness tax credits to create more jobs across America, I am asking \nthe Republicans to join us. This is not about President Obama, this is \nabout America, its workers, its families, and our economy. If there was \never a time when we should come together on a bipartisan basis, it is \nnow. We need to knock down the Republican filibuster, bring this bill \nto the floor, and do our very best to create new jobs and move this \ncountry forward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                           Energy Tax Credit\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise once again to discuss \nthe production tax credit for wind energy, and I wish to urge all my \ncolleagues to extend it as soon as possible.\n  I have been coming to the Senate floor on an ongoing basis to \nhighlight the tremendous growth of the wind energy industry from \nColorado, to Texas, to Pennsylvania. Today I would like to talk about \nthe future of clean energy jobs in the great State of Rhode Island.\n  If we look around our country, we find success stories everywhere, \nand wind energy is a bright spot for communities across America that \nsupports good manufacturing jobs in places such as the United States \nand Rhode Island, and this is despite the great recession.\n  Rhode Island has dedicated itself to building a clean energy future, \na key\n\n[[Page S4796]]\n\npart of which is offshore wind energy. The entire eastern seaboard has \nmassive offshore wind potential, and Rhode Island is one of the first \nStates to begin construction on a project off of its coast. If we look \nat the chart I have here, we can see the potential for job creation, \nand we also see that Rhode Island is on track to meet 75 percent of its \nenergy needs through offshore wind development.\n  Rhode Island has been the beneficiary of a number of companies \nlocating themselves there, but one in particular I wish to call \nattention to is TPI Composites. It has been manufacturing wind turbine \nblades at its facilities in Warren, RI, for years. The decision to move \nto Warren was a good one for TPI because Rhode Island is known for its \nmanufacturing acumen. And good-paying jobs have been the result of \nTPI's locating itself in Warren, RI.\n  In fact, I might also mention that President Obama just paid a visit \nto a TPI facility in Iowa last month. TPI has also opened a facility \njust across the Rhode Island State line in Fall River, MA. They will \nalso focus on the development and manufacturing of wind blades for \noffshore wind turbines.\n  But I want to return to the reason I am coming to the floor of the \nSenate on a daily basis. With the looming expiration of the production \ntax credit, orders for new wind blades have dropped and TPI has been \nforced to cut its Rhode Island workforce by 15 percent. In fact, its \nnew facility in Fall River sits empty and idle as new wind blade \ndevelopment has been put on hold.\n  This is why I keep coming to the floor--because we need to pass an \nextension of the wind production tax credit. It equals jobs. We need to \npass it as soon as possible. It is a travesty that we have not extended \nthe wind production tax credit, particularly at a time when we still \nneed to create more jobs.\n  I know the two Senators from Rhode Island agree with me. Communities \nsuch as Warren, RI, have benefited from the growth in the wind energy \nindustry, but they are still hurting because of the great recession. \nOur failure to act is making things worse. We face a stark choice: We \ncan let the PTC expire and continue to lose good-paying Rhode Island \njobs or we can invest in America's future and take advantage of a \nmanufacturing sector that is poised to expand.\n  The development of offshore wind is coming to the eastern seaboard, \nand the opportunities for American manufacturers such as TPI to grow \ntheir business and beat our international competitors are right there \nwithin our grasp. There is simply so much more economic growth possible \nif we would just simply extend the PTC.\n  Our inaction is stunting the growth of this important industry today. \nThat is why I urge my colleagues to join us in extending the wind PTC \nas soon as possible.\n  I am pleased my colleagues from Rhode Island--who of course know \ntheir home State better than I could ever hope to--have joined me, \nSenator Reed and Senator Whitehouse. They know the difficult economic \nchallenges their State has faced and they know how important the \nproduction tax credit is to jobs in their State. They have spent their \npublic service careers fighting for the middle class, fighting for \npolicies that create good-paying, American-based jobs. I am very much \ninterested in hearing what they have to say on this important subject. \nSo as my colleagues have come to expect, I will be back on the floor \ntomorrow talking about the wind PTC every day, until we pass the \nextension of it.\n  I look forward to hearing from my colleagues from the State of Rhode \nIsland.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Colorado, Senator \nUdall, for his leadership on this very important issue. I also want to \ncommend my colleague Senator Whitehouse, who has been extraordinarily \neffective as a national leader on energy policy and ocean policy.\n  As Senator Udall pointed out, we are at a very critical moment. \nNationally, with the support of the wind production tax credit, or the \nPTC, nearly 500 facilities across 44 States manufacture components for \nthe wind energy industry. These products are critical to our future. \nThe U.S. content of wind turbines installed in the United States has \ngrown from 25 percent prior to 2005 to 60 percent today, according to \nthe American Wind Energy Association. So we are actually seeing a \nsituation in which American components are displacing foreign \ncomponents in wind turbine installations that are being deployed here \nin the United States. That is an encouraging sign, because it means \nmore jobs in manufacturing and it means more American content in \nproducts that would be purchased by Americans. This is fundamentally \npremised on the availability of the wind PTC, and so we have to \nmaintain it. If we do not, then we are again at the mercy of world \nmarkets in which we suspect that there are countries that are \nsupporting, directly and indirectly, their wind energy sectors very \naggressively.\n  We need comprehensive reform of our Tax Code. That will be discussed, \nI am sure, in the months ahead. But we can't forget that this \nproduction tax credit for wind and credits for other clean energy \nresources support manufacturing jobs across this country, saves money \nfor middle-class families, and increases our global competitiveness. As \nwe think about tax reform, we also have to think about those programs \nthat produce jobs, and this program is one of those job-producing tax \nprovisions.\n  We in Rhode Island have taken steps, as Senator Udall has alluded to, \nto try to position ourselves to be at the forefront of clean energy \ndevelopment and wind production, particularly offshore wind production. \nDue in part to strong State policy--and I will commend my colleagues in \nthe State government--we ranked fifth in the country according to the \nAmerican Council for an Energy Efficient Economy's annual energy \nefficiency scorecard. Our main utility, National Grid, and our State \nleaders are taking very aggressive steps to lower the amount of energy \nwe use, which helps us in terms of our competitiveness across the globe \nand with other States in the country.\n  We have also tried to be a leader in offshore wind, for obvious \nreasons. We are the Ocean State. We are linked to the ocean, \ninextricably and historically. Offshore wind is something that could be \na huge benefit not only for ourselves but for our region.\n  Quonset Point is a former naval base which was closed in the 1970s. \nFortunately, through the work of our predecessors, it became the site \nof submarine construction. Now it can also be the site of the assembly \nof turbines because of our access to the coast, because of the \ninvestments we made in terms of cranes, because of the investments we \nhave made in shoring up the docks and the bulkheads. We are positioned \nto be a leader in the assembly of offshore wind turbines.\n  Part of this is not just the assembly expertise, but part of it is \nalso the fact that we have done the fundamental environmental work \nnecessary to make sure this economic development is environmentally \nsound as well as economically sound. Our local leaders have created the \nOcean Special Area Management Plan, or Ocean SAMP, which essentially \nhelps guide the locations for proper placement of wind turbines in the \nocean. Among other considerations, it takes into consideration the \ngeology, the tide, the fishing patterns, and the recreational use of \nthe waters. They have come up with a very sophisticated plan, so we are \nwell positioned to start creating this offshore wind production \nfacility with the jobs onshore.\n  Also, as my colleague, the Senator from Colorado, pointed out, we \nhave companies in the State that are leaders in the onshore wind \nindustry. TPI Composites is one of them. It started as a boat builder. \nIt used fiberglass to fabricate hulls for boats. It was sophisticated, \nit was state of the art. But then they shifted several years ago, \nbecause they saw the direction of this wind power development \nworldwide, and they started producing fiberglass blades for wind power. \nThey have a wonderful facility in Warren, RI, and they were on the \nverge of expanding.\n  But again, as the Senator from Colorado pointed out, because of the \nuncertainty of extending the wind production tax credit and because of \nmany other factors, unfortunately they have had to reduce some of their \nworkforce. We want to see them start growing\n\n[[Page S4797]]\n\nagain. We want TPI to be, as it is, a world leader in the production of \nthis type of technology. It is sophisticated. These are good jobs. They \nare manufacturing jobs. They are American jobs. They are the kind of \nwork we want to be doing worldwide, so that when you go anyplace in the \nworld and you look up, you will see a blade whose tooling, engineering, \nand manufacturing processes were made in Warren, RI, not in China or \nelsewhere.\n  We have a challenge in Rhode Island with 11 percent unemployment. So \nthese are the kinds of jobs we not only want for the moment, but we \nwant for the future, because they are valuable. They are not just a \ncontribution in the short run for putting people to work, they are a \ncontribution in the long run, to our economy, to better use of energy, \nto better environmental quality, to a host of values that will turn out \nto have huge benefits for the people of Rhode Island and the people of \nthis Nation.\n  I commend the Senator from Colorado for his consistent and persistent \nefforts to ensure we do not forget the wind production tax credit, and \nthat we are still working hard to ensure we are able to support \nAmerican manufacturing.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am delighted to join my senior \ncolleague from Rhode Island, Senator Jack Reed, on the Mark Udall \nnational economic tour of the renewable energy production tax credit, \nand I am delighted that daily tour has touched on Rhode Island today.\n  This renewable energy production tax credit is a vital part of our \nenergy security strategy. It is pretty simple. It provides a per-\nkilowatt hour corporate tax credit for energy that is produced by \nvarious clean energy systems, such as wind, biomass, hydro, or \ngeothermal. It makes a lot of sense. We need to do it. The problem is \nthat it expires at the end of this year. And given the way that wind, \nbiomass, solar, and other such projects have to be financed in advance \nand built over time, the market effect of the expiration of this \nproduction tax credit at the end of this year is already being felt in \nprojects that are not going forward now or are under a cloud right now \nbecause of the uncertainty we are creating.\n  We know what happens when we allow the production tax credit to fail: \nThe installations of this kind of equipment drop dramatically. The \nDepartment of Energy estimates that new wind installations will be \nvirtually nonexistent next year if the production tax credit is allowed \nto expire. I don't know if there is a State in the Union in which \npeople are not seeking to build wind energy to capture this free and \nabundant resource. All those projects will become nonexistent if this \ndoes not continue. It doesn't make any sense at all.\n  In Rhode Island, it is particularly important not only because we \ndon't have a lot of domestic energy sources--so this is a good one for \nus as a domestic energy source--but also because of the jobs these \nprojects support. We are not supporting international shipping tycoons \nwho bring the oil over here, we are not supporting Saudi princes who \npump the stuff or other folks from OPEC or around the world. We are \nsupporting engineers in America, manufacturers in America, assemblers \nin America, factory workers in America, when we go this route.\n  My home State is still at 11 percent unemployment, so we have no \ntolerance for knocking down these jobs. This is not an acceptable \nenergy strategy, it is not an acceptable jobs strategy. It is self-\ndefeating for America's interests.\n  Senator Reed mentioned TPI Composites. It is a great company. It is \nin Warren, RI. In the Warren and Bristol area, there is a real \nconstellation of incredibly talented folks and small companies that are \naffiliated with the boat building industry. TPI and others do composite \nwork--hulls, spars, masts, products that are light, strong, fast, and \nthat help Rhode Island build the fastest and the best boats in the \nworld. This technology has been transitioned from plain boat building \nand hull building to building the giant wind vanes that turn on these \ngiant wind turbines.\n  This is an important industry for us and it is a valuable American \nindustry. The idea that we would burn foreign oil rather than building \ncomposite wind vanes in Warren, RI, makes no sense at all. We are in \nthe final stages of getting the Department of Interior's approval to \nbuild offshore wind turbines in Rhode Island. Senator Reed and I have \nworked very hard to get TIGER grant funding to Quonset Point, where \nthey have hardened up the pier so that a crane can operate on it. You \ndon't see much on the pier now. It is flat, but it was dug out, steel \nwas put in, and concrete was put down. Had we driven the crane out on \nthe old pier, it would have crumbled down into the water and taken the \ncrane with it. So we had to harden up the pier to put this crane out \nthere, and the crane is now in a position to take these big wind \nturbines, which are too big to put on a truck and too big to put on a \ntrain. You have to build and assemble them shoreside and then barge \nthem out to a location. We can do that now at Quonset Point. The \nproject is expected to create 600 to 800 new jobs, and it could expand \nbeyond that and position this Rhode Island facility as a hub for \nregional wind energy manufacturing.\n  This is important to us. We need this production tax credit. It goes \nalong with a long history of government support for emerging \nindustries. When the commercial airline industry was beginning to open, \nit had immense government support from subsidized airmail, from \nmilitary contracts, from aeronautics R The reason we took it from \nthe Wright Brothers at Kitty Hawk to massive Boeing factories--which is \nstill one of the world leaders in aircraft production--is because along \nthe way the government supported American industry because they knew--\nwe knew--this was an industry that had to compete with overseas \nmanufacturers and needed our support.\n  In the same way, the clean energy industry is in an arena of \ninternational competition in which our country and our companies are \ncompeting with foreign interests. We are competing with foreign \ncompanies and we are competing with the foreign governments that back \nthem. Unfortunately, many in this building don't see that. All they see \nis the old, dirty, polluting fossil fuel industry and competition for \nthe fossil fuel industry from clean energy. So they want to knock it \ndown. Never mind that the well-established fossil fuel industries get \nfar more in terms of government support than emerging clean energy \ntechnologies. The Environmental Law Institute points out that the \nUnited States has invested nearly six times more in subsidies for \nfossil fuel from 2002 to 2008 than we did in renewable energy. So it is \nnot that their hands are clean of government support; they are here \nsucking up all the government subsidies they can, and they don't want \nclean energy to compete with them. They want to knock it down. That is \na terrible mistake. We cannot allow the heavy hand of the fossil fuel \nindustry lobbyists to stamp out competition in clean energy. It may be \ngood for big oil, but it is not good for America, because we are in \ninternational competition to lead the world and be the manufacturers of \nwind, solar, geothermal, and other technologies. We are going to end up \nbuying it. We want to also have built it. And, if we can, we want to be \nexporting it as well. We need to support these industries as they \ncontinue to develop and continue to grow so we can once again lead the \nworld as we have in the past.\n  I thank Senator Udall of Colorado for his leadership. He persistently \nand patiently comes every day to help make this point, and I am \ndelighted he happened to choose Rhode Island as his point of focus \ntoday because Rhode Island truly does wrap it up. It is energy \nsecurity, energy independence, local jobs and getting ahead and winning \nthe game of international competition for this new technology.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I didn't come to the floor to speak \nabout the wind energy tax credit, but I wish to say to my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle that I agree with them, and they probably \nknow I agree with them because I am the author of the wind energy tax \ncredit of 1992. I often tell people that when we worked so hard on \nthat, I did not have the slightest idea it would turn out to be such a\n\n[[Page S4798]]\n\nbig thing; that Iowa would be second in wind energy production in the \nNation. I think Texas is No. 1. For sure, I did not know we would have \nmanufacturing in our State as a result of it. We have had companies \ncome from Spain, from Germany and then we have had from Colorado and \nArizona component manufacturers that have come to Iowa. There are about \n4,000 people, maybe 5,000 people, employed in my State in that, so I \nhope we can get it reauthorized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. If the Senator will yield for a question.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I not only salute what the Senator from Iowa has done \non the production tax credit, but I also recognize that one of our \ngreat Rhode Island companies that is developing bioprocessed algal \nfuels has opened its major facility in the Senator's State, and there \nis a very good Iowa-Rhode Island connection on the development of algal \nfuels. I appreciate the fact our two States are able to work together \nso this Rhode Island company can have such a significant facility in \nIowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. For the Senator from Rhode Island, I believe that Rhode \nIsland facility went to an existing ethanol plant in Shenandoah, IA--\nsouthwest Iowa.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. It did.\n\n\n                                 Taxes\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to speak about \nthe issue of taxes--that is now a big issue--not about the issue the \nmajority will set before the Senate to talk about today and tomorrow \nand however long it takes but the issue we heard about from President \nObama yesterday, the talk about the need to raise taxes on those \nearning more than $250,000. We heard this from him again just \nyesterday, as we did last year quite a bit and the year before quite a \nbit, when he spoke in support of increasing taxes on the so-called \nwealthy.\n  In his speech yesterday, he made the following points: that those \nmaking under $250,000 deserve certainty and they deserve it now; \nanother point is that it is OK to increase taxes on small business \nowners making more than $250,000 because those tax increases would \naffect less than 3 percent of the small business owners; another point, \nthat those making more than $250,000 are not paying their fair share; \nand another point, that we cannot afford to extend the 2001 and 2003 \nbipartisan tax relief to these households because of the impact on the \ndeficit; and last, that if Congress sent him a bill to extend the 2001 \nbipartisan tax relief just for those making under $250,000, he would \nsign the bill into law right away.\n  I come to the floor to highlight what the President is not telling \nthe taxpayers. First, on the issue of certainty, the President fails to \nmention what his plans are for the dozens of tax provisions that \nexpired at the end of last year and the dozens more that are expiring \nat the end of this year. These provisions affect everyone from teachers \nwho dip into their own pockets to purchase school supplies to families \nand students struggling to pay for higher tuition. They also include \nkey incentives for businesses to invest in new equipment and engage in \nresearch needed to produce the products of tomorrow.\n  The President also failed to mention what he would do about the \nalternative minimum tax that threatens an ever-increasing number of \nmiddle-class Americans each year, the same middle class that the \nPresident is telling the world he wants to protect--and nothing wrong \nwith protecting the middle class. Over the past several years, \nlegislation was enacted in regard to the alternative minimum tax to \navoid and avert this crisis happening to the middle class, and we did \nit through a series of patches to increase the exemption amount so \nthese 30 million middle-class taxpayers are not hurt with the \nalternative minimum tax.\n  The President also fails to mention whether he continues to support \nthe middle-class tax increases he included in his budget proposal. This \nis how the President proposes to tax the middle class. Would he \nreinstate the personal exemption phaseout and the Pease limitation on \nitemized deductions? Additionally, would he impose a new 28-percent \nlimitation on itemized deductions? Each of these provisions comes with \nits own income thresholds and phaseout rules that increase complexity \nand increase taxpayer burden.\n  Finally, the President fails to mention the tax increases he \nsupported to pay for the health care reform legislation. These \nprovisions include a bigger haircut on the deductions for medical \nexpenses, lower contribution amounts for flexible savings accounts, and \ntaxes on artificial knees and hips that medical device manufacturers \nhave to pass on to the patients.\n  Given all the looming tax increases the President failed to mention \nin his speech yesterday, it is difficult to see how extending just the \n2001 and 2003 bipartisan tax relief provides certainty to taxpayers, \nincluding small business. The President agrees they are job creators \nand engines of our economy, so the President recognizes a fact of life \nthat middle-class small businesspeople are job creators. Unfortunately, \nhe defends his tax increase this way on small businesses, by claiming \nthe impact will be minimal because only 2 to 3 percent of the small \nbusinesses would be subject to this tax increase. What the President \nfails to mention is that this 2 or 3 percent account for a large amount \nof economic activity and a large amount of the jobs created. We often \ntalk--people on both sides of the aisle--about small business providing \n70 percent of the new jobs being created in America.\n  I wish to see how the Joint Committee on Taxation, which is a \nnonpartisan congressional organization--and I wish to emphasize the \nnonpartisan aspect of this because we often refer to them as \nauthorities in this area. According to this joint committee, 53 percent \nof the flowthrough business income would be subject to the President's \nproposed tax increases--so as I said, 70 percent of the new jobs \ncreated here--but this 2 or 3 percent also accounts for about 25 \npercent of all employment in America.\n  The President claims he wants to give the 97 percent of small \nbusinesses a sense of permanence. Yet the tax relief for those in this \ngroup is only for another year. How do we get permanence if we only \nwant to provide tax policy for 1 year? It does not add up.\n  The President continues to claim we cannot afford to extend tax \nrelief for those earning above $250,000 because of our current deficit \nsituation, but he fails to mention any ideas for reducing the deficit \nby controlling spending or by enacting tax reform, which is the only \nreal way to provide a sense of permanence and eliminate the uncertainty \nwe all agree keeps small and even larger corporations from hiring.\n  At the start of his administration, the President established the \nSimpson-Bowles Commission to come up with a framework to address our \ncurrent out-of-control spending as well as to reform the Tax Code. The \nCommission issued a report over 1 year ago that included substantive \nproposals on how to reform the Tax Code. There are some proposals in \nthe Simpson-Bowles plan I like and some proposals I do not like. I like \nthat it would streamline the Tax Code, reduce tax rates across the \nboard, broaden the tax base, enhance economic opportunity in the \nprocess. At the same time, it violates one of my core tenets of tax \nreform: that it not increase taxes overall. But the Simpson-Bowles plan \nis at least a serious proposal. I think most everybody recognizes that.\n  However, the President failed to embrace the Simpson-Bowles plan and \noffered a token framework for corporate tax reform. While the President \nagrees our current corporate tax rate is too high, his framework is \noverly vague and provides little in the way of simplification. Instead, \nas one commentator put it, his proposal on corporate tax reform simply \n``rearranges the deck chairs on the Titanic.''\n  That being said, at least the President took a position on lowering \nthe corporate tax rate to 28 percent. This is in stark contrast to his \nideas on individual tax reform he put on the table yesterday. Even \nthinner on details, his overarching principle for individual tax reform \nseems to be the wealthy should pay their fair share. Yet after years of \ntalking about the wealthy paying their fair share, he never defines \nwhat rate or amount of tax constitutes fair share for individual \ntaxpayers. Adopting this rhetoric seems to indicate support for using \nthe Tax Code to reduce income disparity between the highest and lowest \ntaxpayers. However, data from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice--again I emphasize nonpartisan--\n\n[[Page S4799]]\n\nshows the so-called wealthy already pay the bulk of the taxes and that \nour Tax Code is highly progressive.\n  I put a chart up. This chart will show that if all Federal taxes are \nconsidered, the top 5 percent of households pay an average effective \nrate of about 28 percent and account for nearly 45 percent of all \nFederal receipts. In contrast, the bottom 20 percent, as we can see, \npay average effective tax rate of about 4 percent and account for less \nthan 1 percent of all Federal receipts. All Federal taxes include \nindividual income taxes, corporate tax, excise, and payroll tax.\n  The disparity is even greater when we only consider individual income \ntaxes. This is actually a better measure, since the President proposes \nto increase just income taxes on the so-called wealthy.\n  If we look at the chart that is before us, we will see that the \nbottom 40 percent of households have an average effective tax rate \nbelow zero. In contrast, the top 5 percent have an average effective \ntax rate of nearly 18 percent and account for 61 percent of income tax \nreceipts.\n  I have highlighted the top 5 percent in these charts because these \nare the households generally earning more than $250,000--in other \nwords, these are the wealthy households, according to the President.\n  When we look at these numbers, it is fair to ask the President, once \nagain, to define what he means by ``fair share.'' How high is the \nPresident willing to raise taxes to meet this objective? In other \nwords, if this 5 percent is paying 61 percent of all the income tax \nreceipts, how much more do they have to pay to satisfy the President in \norder to pay their fair share? In other words, define ``fair share.''\n  I have always stated that taxpayers should pay what they owe, not one \npenny more and not one penny less. Anyone who looks at my record will \nsee I have fought long and hard to shut down loopholes and to ensure \ntaxpayers of all income levels pay what they legally owe. However, I \nhold a fundamentally different view from the President on how the \neconomy works and what the government's role should be and the rate of \ntaxation in contributing to the government's role in enhancing the \neconomy.\n  I believe the money one earns is that individual's money, not a \npittance that a taxpayer can keep based upon the good graces of the \ngovernment. I generally believe individuals have the right to enjoy the \nfruit of their success. I believe the best way to increase the wealth \nand livelihood of all Americans is through progrowth policies that \nincrease the size of the economic pie, not by redistributing the pie \nbased upon some unspecified definition of fairness.\n  I believe 18 percent of the gross domestic product of this country is \ngood enough for the government to collect and spend, and for the most \npart it has been that way over a 50-year average of taxes. That \nbenchmark of 18 percent is what the government has collected \nconsistently regardless of the statutory tax rates. Whether tax rates \nhave been high or low, they generally bring in about the same amount of \nmoney. In other words, just because they raise tax rates on the so-\ncalled wealthy people does not necessarily mean that we get the influx \nof revenue that some believe we will get. This is obviously something \nthe President has not considered.\n  As I have done so often in recent years, I have come to the Senate \nfloor to say we still end up with the same amount of money regardless \nof what the effective tax rate is because higher income individuals \nhave the ability to choose the form of income they will receive. They \nalso have a greater ability to decide when they will recognize this \nincome, such as through the sale of stock, as a way to limit their \ntaxable income in a given year. They also have accountants and \nattorneys to help them legally shield income from the view of the IRS. \nAs taxes go up, so does the incentive to reduce one's income through \nlegal and nonlegal means.\n  I have a chart that shows annual revenues as a percentage of gross \nnational product in relationship to top marginal tax rates. This is in \na period of time since World War II. So getting back to what I \npreviously said, over a long period of time the revenue coming into the \nFederal Treasury tends to be about the same amount. I think this \naverages out to about 18.2 percent of GDP.\n  We can see during the Eisenhower years the marginal tax rate was 90 \npercent. Starting with Kennedy, it became 70 percent. Starting with \nReagan, it became 50 percent. Once again, starting with Reagan, it came \ndown to 30 percent. When Bush, the father, didn't keep his promise of, \n``Read my lips; no new taxes,'' he gave in on that, it went back to 40 \npercent. Now under the 2001-2003 tax bills, it is at 35 percent. The \nPresident says we need to raise the tax rate back to this level.\n  As this chart shows, we can have high marginal tax rates or low \nmarginal tax rates, but the people of this country have decided they \nare going to send just so much money to us bums in Congress to spend. \nSo they decide how much we are going to get, and we can raise marginal \ntax rates, we can do what the first President Bush did, but we are \nstill going to get about the same amount of revenue. So I hope the \nPresident takes that into consideration and also considers the negative \naspect when marginal tax rates are reduced.\n  This means we are not going to be able to tax our way to surpluses. \nWe are going to have to make substantial adjustments on the spending \nside to bring it in line with revenues. In other words, the bottom line \nof what I would like to tell the President is that the American people \nof this country have not come to the conclusion that they are \nundertaxed. They have come to the conclusion that Congress spends too \nmuch, and the problem isn't on the tax side; the problem is on the \nexpenditure side.\n  History also shows that tax increases just lead to spending \nincreases. Often on the floor of the Senate I quote Professor Vedder of \nOhio State University who has studied tax increases and spending for \nmore than two decades. Some of his research goes back to World War II. \nHis most recent work on this subject was with Steven Moore and \npublished in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       Over the entire post World War II era through 2009, each \n     dollar of new tax revenue has been associated with $1.17 in \n     new spending.\n\n  So we raise a dollar here, and we spend $1.17 over there. It is \npretty obvious that bringing in more revenue isn't going to reduce the \ndeficit.\n  Another study by the National Bureau of Economic Research states that \nwhen it comes to fiscal adjustments:\n\n       Those based upon spending cuts and no tax increases are \n     more likely to reduce deficits and debt over Gross Domestic \n     Product ratios than those based upon tax increases. In \n     addition, adjustments on the spending side rather than on the \n     tax side are less likely to create recessions.\n\n  So we know increasing taxes, including on targeted groups, is not \ngoing to reduce the deficit. American workers and businesses deserve \ntax reform and tax certainty. There is bipartisan agreement that we \nneed comprehensive tax reform. What we need to get that done is real \nleadership, to be sure.\n  Lack of leadership is not because of lack of interest. The Senate \nFinance Committee, on which I serve, has held more than a dozen tax \nreform hearings during this Congress. The Senate Budget Committee has \nalso held tax reform hearings. What has been lacking is what is so \nimportant in this town, Presidential leadership.\n  The President's speech yesterday was just that, a speech. As I \noutlined, he spoke only about extending certain tax relief measures for \nthose earning under $250,000. However, he failed to address other \nlooming tax increases and failed to discuss how his other tax increase \nproposals provide the certainty that he claims he wants to provide.\n  It is easy for the President to engage in election year antics and \ngoad Congress to send him a bill. Unfortunately, that is not \nleadership, and such speeches do nothing to help individuals and small \nbusinesses.\n  If the President really was concerned about preventing tax increases \non the middle class and small businesses, he would at least be working \nwith leaders in his own party to make sure they all agreed on who the \nwealthy in this country really are and who ought to have their taxes \nincreased.\n  Democratic leaders in the House and Senate have signaled that they \nsupport extension of lower income tax rates for those making up to $1 \nmillion. In fact, a year ago this week, we in the Senate were debating \nthe majority party's ``millionaire tax resolution.''\n\n[[Page S4800]]\n\n  So if the President really wanted Congress to send him a bill that \nprovided certainty to the taxpayers, he would make it a priority to get \nit done. Unfortunately, he is busy traipsing around the country raising \nmoney for his reelection. That is not leadership, and it is certainly \nnot going to provide timely tax relief to the millions of taxpayers who \nneed it.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of John Thomas \nFowlkes, Jr., of Tennessee, to be United States District Judge for the \nWestern District of Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 30 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see the distinguished senior Senator from \nTennessee on the floor, and I will make sure he has plenty of time to \nspeak. If not, I will ask unanimous consent for extra time for him.\n  Today we will vote on only 1 of the 16 judicial nominations reported \nfavorably by the Judiciary Committee that have been stalled for no \nreason from receiving a Senate vote. Regrettably, Senate Republicans \nare following through on their partisan opposition to the President by \nseeking to slam the door on qualified, consensus judicial nominees who \nhave bipartisan support. In doing so, they seek to take advantage of \nthe delaying tactics that they have been employing for the last 3\\1/2\\ \nyears. This is all to the detriment of the American people.\n  I am disappointed that Senate Republicans are choosing politics over \nthe needs of the American people and seek to justify their actions with \na warped sense of payback. This is not the time for settling imaginary \nscores. Their self-interested approach is what contributes to the low \nopinion the American people have of Congress. What the American people \nand the overburdened Federal courts need are qualified judges to \nadminister justice. They are not helped by these partisan games. \nFollowing the most extended period of historically high vacancy rates \nin the history of our district courts, nearly 1 in every 11 Federal \njudgeships remains vacant. This is more than twice the vacancy rate by \nthis date during the first term of President Bush.\n  This chart, available at http://www.leahy.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/\nBushObama%20-%20Judicial%20-%207-10-12%20-%20Area%20-%201st%20term\n.pdf, should help people understand how far behind we remain in filling \nthe judicial vacancies to provide the Federal judges that the American \npeople need to get justice in our Federal courts. This compares \njudicial vacancies during the first terms of President Bush and \nPresident Obama. It shows the stark contrast to the way in which we \nmoved to reduce judicial vacancies during the last Republican \nPresidency.\n  This chart shows that the Senate can do better because it has done \nbetter. During President Bush's first term we reduced the number of \njudicial vacancies by almost 75 percent. When I became chairman in the \nsummer of 2001, there were 110 vacancies. As chairman, I worked with \nthe administration and Senators from both sides of the aisle to confirm \n100 judicial nominees of a conservative Republican President in 17 \nmonths.\n  We continued when in the minority to work with Senate Republicans and \nconfirm President Bush's consensus judicial nominations well into 2004, \na Presidential election year. At the end of that Presidential term, the \nSenate had acted to confirm 205 circuit and district court nominees. By \nJuly 2004 we had reduced judicial vacancies to 29.\n  By comparison, vacancies have long remained near or above 80, while \nlittle comparative progress has been made during the 4 years of \nPresident Obama's first term. There are still 77 vacancies as of July \n2012--that is more than 2\\1/2\\ times the number of vacancies at this \npoint in President Bush's first term.\n  Each day that Senate Republicans refuse because of their political \nagenda to confirm these qualified judicial nominees who have been \nreviewed and voted on by the Judiciary Committee is another day that a \njudge could have been working to administer justice. Every week lost is \nanother in which injured plaintiffs are having to wait to recover the \ncosts of medical expenses, lost wages, or other damages from \nwrongdoing. Every month is another drag on the economy as small \nbusiness owners have to wait to have their contract disputes resolved. \nHard-working and hard-pressed Americans should not have to wait years \nto have their cases decided. Just as it is with the economy and with \njobs, the American people do not want to hear excuses about why \nRepublicans in Congress will not help them. More importantly, they do \nnot want to hear that the supposed justification is partisan. This is \nprecisely the reason why Congress's approval rating among the American \npeople is so low.\n  The nonpartisan American Bar Association has been sounding the alarm \nfor some time that we need to do better with respect to the judicial \nvacancy crisis. The president of the ABA wrote the Senate leaders again \non June 20 urging them to work together to schedule votes for three \nconsensus, qualified circuit court nominees awaiting Senate \nconfirmation so that they may serve the American people. The response \nwas more excuses from the Republican leadership rather than any \npositive action. In the past, the Senate has worked together to confirm \nconsensus circuit court nominees, especially during times of high \nvacancies. For example, Senate Democrats confirmed 11 circuit court \nnominees of President George H.W. Bush in 1992. The only exception to \nthe practice of confirming consensus circuit court nominees in \nPresidential elections years with high vacancies was when Senate \nRepublicans shut down the process of a Democratic President in 1996. \nThe Republican leadership is apparently planning to stick with its \nshutdown of confirmations just as it did in 1996 when they prevented \nthe confirmation of circuit court nominees for an entire year-long \nsession of the Senate. It was wrong then and it is wrong now.\n  Since May 31, Senate Republicans have consented to consideration of \nonly five judicial nominees. That is a far cry from the 30 confirmed in \nthe last months of 2004 at the end of President Bush's first term that \nbrought his total of circuit and district court confirmations to 205. \nIt is also a far cry from the 22 confirmed in the last months of 2008 \nat the end of President Bush's second term. They are continuing the \nobstruction that has unnecessarily delayed confirmation of consensus \ncircuit and district court nominees for months and resulted in our \nbeing more than 40 confirmations behind the pace we set in President \nBush's first term.\n  Like so many matters on which they have flip-flopped since the \nAmerican people elected President Obama--everything from the individual \nmandate for private health insurance that they originated and used to \nfavor to the deficit reduction commission--they now contend that they \nare invoking the Thurmond rule even though they denied its existence \nwhen President Bush was in office. Just 4 years ago the current \nRepublican leader said that ``there is no Thurmond rule'' and the \ncurrent ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee called it ``plain \nbunk.'' The Senate Republican caucus held a forum to demonstrate that \nno such practice or rule existed and that judicial confirmations should \ncontinue in the last several months of a Presidential term. With \nPresident Obama, they have chosen to flip-flop and use the so-called\n\n[[Page S4801]]\n\nThurmond rule as an excuse for shutting down Senate confirmations. \nElection year politics should not trump the needs of Americans seeking \nto obtain justice in our Federal courts. Senate Republicans' newly \nstated reliance on the Thurmond rule is really just another excuse for \nmore of the stalling tactics that we have been seeing since President \nObama was elected.\n  Nor is this the first time that they have been urged to work with us \nto confirm consensus judicial nominees to address the vacancy crisis. \nIn his 2010 year-end report on the federal judiciary, Chief Justice \nRoberts called attention to the problem of overburdened courts across-\nthe-country and the need to fill judicial vacancies. That followed in \nthe tradition of Chief Justice Rehnquist who called out the obstruction \nof President Clinton's judicial nominees. These are not Democratic \npartisans. Each served in Republican administrations and was appointed \nby a Republican President because of their conservative credentials and \neach has been a deeply conservative Supreme Court Justice.\n  What Senate Republican leaders now contend has been ``exceptionally \nfair treatment'' of President Obama's judicial nominees has, in fact, \namounted to months of unnecessary delays and their having expanded \ncontentiousness to include judicial nominees who should be \nnoncontentious. Their practice has been a virtual across-the-board \nstalling of judicial nominees. That is what has led to the backlog in \nconfirmations and the months of delays in the consideration of \nconsensus nominees, which has been demonstrated over and over again.\n  Let us take a look at how they have been stalling circuit court \nnominees. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service in its recent \nreport confirms what I have been saying. I also have prepared this \nchart, which is taken from the CRS report, and is available at http://\nwww.leahy.senate\n.gov/imo/media/doc/CRS%20chart%20-%20my%20version.pdf.\n  They report that the median time circuit court nominees have had to \nwait before a Senate vote has skyrocketed from 18 days for President \nBush's circuit court nominees to 132 days for President Obama's circuit \ncourt nominees. Any objective observer would concede that President \nObama has made a significant effort to work with home State Senators \nfrom both parties and that his nominees have been less ideological and \nshould be less controversial than his predecessor's. Yet the result of \nRepublican foot dragging and obstruction is that they are nonetheless \ndelayed and stalled. They have filibustered nominations that they then \nturn around and support like that of Judge Barbara Keenan of Virginia \nto the Fourth Circuit who was ultimately confirmed 99 to 0 and Judge \nDenny Chin of New York to the Second Circuit, who was filibustered for \n4 months before he was confirmed 98 to 0.\n  Those interested in the Tennessee nominee today will remember how \nhard we had to work for almost 10 months, despite the support of \nSenator Alexander and Senator Corker, to get Senate Republicans to \nallow consideration of the nomination of Judge Jane Stranch to the \nSixth Circuit. Despite being approved by a bipartisan majority of the \nJudiciary Committee, Judge Stranch's nomination nevertheless languished \non the floor for nearly 10 months because of Republican obstruction. I \npersonally had to come before the Senate to take the extraordinary step \nof propounding a unanimous consent request to consider her nomination, \nwith the support of the senior Senator from Tennessee. So it is hard to \nsee any difference between this supposed application of the Thurmond \nrule and how Senate Republicans have treated nearly all of President \nObama's circuit court nominees since the President took office--\nincluding those with support of Republican home State senators.\n  Among the circuit court nominees they are blockading now are two from \nStates with Republican home State Senators' support: William Kayatta \nfrom Maine and Judge Robert Bacharach from Oklahoma, as well as a \nnominee to the Federal Circuit who had the support of virtually all the \nRepublican Senators on the Judiciary Committee.\n  While Senate Democrats have been willing to work with Republican \nPresidents to confirm circuit court nominees with bipartisan support, \nSenate Republicans have repeatedly obstructed the nominees of \nDemocratic Presidents including those with the support of Republican \nhome State Senators. During the last 20 years, only 4 circuit nominees \nreported with bipartisan support have been denied an up-or-down vote \nduring a Presidential election year by the Senate. All four were \nnominated by President Clinton and blocked by Senate Republicans. \nSenate Republicans are threatening to add the current circuit nominees \npending before the Senate to that list. In the previous 5 Presidential \nelection years, a total of 13 circuit court nominees has been confirmed \nafter May 31. It is notable that 12 of the 13 were nominees of \nRepublican Presidents.\n  When Republican Senators try to take credit for the Senate having \nreached what they regard as their ``quota'' for circuit confirmations \nthis year, they should remember that the Senate would not even have had \nan up-or-down vote on three of the five of them without the majority \nleader first having to file for cloture to overcome Republican \nobstruction--Adalberto Jordan of Florida to the Eleventh Circuit, Paul \nWatford of California to the Ninth Circuit and Andrew Hurwitz of \nArizona to the Ninth Circuit. And the other two, Stephanie Dawn Thacker \nof West Virginia to the Fourth Circuit and Jacqueline Nguyen of \nCalifornia to the Ninth Circuit, were unnecessarily stalled since last \nyear until the leader forced the issue by filing for cloture on 17 \njudicial nominees, ultimately reaching a deal with the Republican \nleader to vote on only some of the many long-stalled nominees. That is \nnot cooperation. That is stalling, and it is why the Senate has yet to \nvote on a single circuit court nominee nominated by President Obama \nthis year.\n  Adalberto Jordan, Stephanie Thacker and Jacqueline Nguyen had all \nbeen reported with bipartisan support from the Judiciary Committee last \nyear but their confirmations were stalled by Republicans into this \nyear. In my view, they could and should have been confirmed last year. \nSenate Republicans broke from the longstanding tradition of confirming \nconsensus judicial nominees at the end of last year. Indeed, Senate \nRepublicans broke from this tradition the last 2 years. When it comes \nto confirming consensus judges for the benefit of the American people, \nthey choose to ignore tradition.\n  The two other circuit nominees who were confirmed this year--Paul \nWatford and Andrew Hurwitz of the Ninth Circuit had their hearings and \ncommittee votes delayed at the request of Senate Republicans. If not \nfor this stalling by Senate Republicans, these circuit nominees could \nalso could have been confirmed last year.\n  Since 1980, the only Presidential election year in which no circuit \nnominee who was nominated that year and confirmed that year was in \n1996, when Senate Republicans shut down the process against President \nClinton's circuit nominees. So when the American people hear Senate \nRepublicans crowing about how they have cooperated to confirm five \ncircuit court nominees this year, they should know the truth.\n  The fact that Republican stalling tactics have meant that circuit \ncourt nominees that should have been confirmed in the spring are still \nawaiting a vote after July 4 is no excuse for not moving forward this \nmonth to confirm the circuit nominees who were voted out of the \nJudiciary Committee with bipartisan support. That was the point of the \nletter to Senate leaders from the ABA last month when the Republicans' \npartisan plan to stall out the rest of the year was first publicly \nacknowledged.\n  We remain far behind in filling judicial vacancies to provide the \nFederal judges that American people need to get justice in our Federal \ncourts, as the previous chart demonstrates. Comparisons of judicial \nvacancies during the first terms of President Bush and President Obama \nshow just how far behind we really are.\n  Judicial vacancies during President Obama's first term long remained \nnear or above 80, while little comparative progress was made for years. \nThere are still 77 vacancies as of July 2012. By this time during \nPresident Bush's first term we had reduced 110 vacancies down to 29. By \nthis time during President Bush's first term the Senate had\n\n[[Page S4802]]\n\nconfirmed 44 more circuit and district court nominees than the Senate \nhas during this Presidential term.\n  Despite these facts, certain Senate Republicans contend that their \nresistance should be excused because two Supreme Court justices, who \nmost of them opposed, were confirmed in President Obama's first term. \nThis is another hollow excuse and is no justification for not moving \nahead with the confirmations of William Kayatta, Judge Bacharach, Judge \nShwartz, and Richard Taranto to circuit vacancies or with the nearly \ntwo dozen judicial nominees that we could easily consider and confirm \nthis year. The American people who are waiting for justice do not care \nabout excuses. They do not care about some false sense of settling \npolitical scores. They want justice. Just as they want action on \nmeasures the President has suggested to help the economy and create \njobs rather than political calculations about what will help Republican \ncandidates in the elections in November.\n  Indeed, despite confirming two Supreme Court justices in President \nClinton's first term, the Senate was able to confirm 200 circuit and \ndistrict court judges by the end of 1996. And in 1992, at the end of \nPresident George H.W. Bush's term, the Senate was able to confirm 192 \ncircuit and district court judges despite confirming two Supreme Court \nJustices. At this point, Republicans have allowed the Senate to confirm \nonly 153 of President Obama's circuit and district court nominees. That \nis a far cry from what we have been able to achieve in addition to our \nconsideration of Supreme Court nominations when the Senate was being \nallowed to proceed to consider judicial nominees reported with \nbipartisan support. This artificial ceiling on confirmations is \nRepublicans imposing a new standard for partisan purposes.\n  Likewise, Republicans' newfound affection for the Thurmond rule \nignores the facts. In the Presidential election year of 1992, for \nexample, with a Republican President, the Democratic majority in the \nSenate proceeded to confirm 66 new judges including 11 circuit judges. \nRepublicans have no good justification for not proceeding to confirm \nthe judicial nominees reported with bipartisan support by the Judiciary \nCommittee this year. We can and we should be doing more to help the \nAmerican people.\n  The American people do not want to hear excuses from Senate \nRepublicans about why the Senate cannot proceed to confirm judges who \nare well-qualified and have received significant bipartisan support. \nThere is no good reason that the Senate should not vote on the circuit \ncourt nominees thoroughly vetted, considered and voted on by the \nJudiciary Committee. There is no reason the Senate cannot vote on the \nnomination of William Kayatta of Maine to the First Circuit, a nominee \nstrongly supported by both of Maine's Republican Senators and reported \nnearly unanimously by the committee 2 months ago. There is no reason \nthe Senate cannot vote on the nomination of Judge Robert Bacharach of \nOklahoma to the Tenth Circuit, who was supported by Senator Coburn \nduring committee consideration, and also by the State's other \nRepublican Senator, Senator Inhofe.\n  There is also no reason the Senate cannot vote on Richard Taranto's \nnomination to the Federal Circuit. He was reported almost unanimously \nby voice vote nearly 3 months ago, and is supported by conservatives \nsuch as Robert Bork and Paul Clement. He is also nominated to the \nFederal Circuit, which has never before been a controversial court.\n  The one circuit court nominee who was reported out of committee with \na split rollcall vote--Judge Patty Shwartz of New Jersey--should not \nhave been controversial. She has been a Federal magistrate judge for \nthe last 8 years and was a Federal prosecutor for 14 years, where she \nrose to become chief of the Criminal Division. She also has the \nbipartisan support of New Jersey's Republican Governor, Chris Christie.\n  Each of these circuit court nominees has been rated unanimously well \nqualified by the nonpartisan ABA Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary, the highest possible rating. These are not controversial \nnominees. Senate Republicans are blocking consent to vote on superbly \nqualified circuit court nominees with strong bipartisan support.\n  Today, the Senate will vote on the nomination of John Fowlkes to fill \na judicial vacancy in the U.S. District Court for the Western District \nof Tennessee. Judge Fowlkes has the support of his home State \nRepublican Senators, Senator Lamar Alexander and Senator Bob Corker. \nHis nomination was reported with near unanimous voice vote by the \nJudiciary Committee nearly 3 months ago, with the only objection coming \nfrom Senator Lee's customary protest vote. Judge Fowlkes was rated \nunanimously well-qualified by the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary, the highest possible rating.\n  Judge Fowlkes currently serves as a criminal court judge in the 30th \nJudicial District at Memphis, Tennessee, where he has been a judge for \napproximately 5 years. He previously held several positions in public \nservice, including as a Federal prosecutor for 13 years and as an \nassistant district attorney general in Shelby County for 10 years. \nJudge Fowlkes also served briefly as an assistant public defender at \nthe Shelby County Public Defender's Office. His diverse range of \nexperience makes him particularly well qualified to serve on the \nFederal bench.\n  Once we confirm Judge Fowlkes, I hope that Senate Republicans will \nreconsider their ill-conceived partisan strategy and work with us to \nmeet the needs of the American people. There is no reason the Senate \ncannot vote to confirm the other 15 well-qualified judicial nominees \nreported by the Committee. There is no good reason we cannot work \ntogether to help solve the problem of high judicial vacancies and \nbetter serve the American people.\n  I see the two distinguished Senators from Tennessee on the floor.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester.) The senior Senator from \nTennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee for his courtesy in allowing Senator Corker and \nme a chance to speak about Judge Fowlkes from Tennessee. I do not \nintend to get into a lengthy dispute with the Senator from Vermont \nabout the relative merits of the two political parties approving \njudges. But I do have to admire his persistence and creativity in \nalways coming up with a way in how Democrats approve more Republican \njudges than Republicans approved Democratic judges.\n  I notice that our ranking member, Senator Grassley, will put a \nstatement in the Record today making a clear statement about what the \nrecord is. But if I may borrow from that: Today's vote will be the \n152nd nominee of President Obama confirmed to district and circuit \njudges. We have also confirmed two Supreme Court nominees during \nPresident Obama's term. The last time the Senate confirmed two Supreme \nCourt nominees was during President Bush's second term. During \nPresident Bush's entire second term, the Senate confirmed a total of \nonly 119 district and circuit court nominees. With Judge Fowlkes' \nconfirmation today, we will have confirmed 33 more district and circuit \nnominees for President Obama than we did for President Bush in similar \ncircumstances.\n  That is according to Senator Grassley's comments, which will be \nprinted in the Record. I would have to say to my friend from Vermont, \nmy memory is good enough that about this time 4 years ago, when we had \na Republican President, I think I remember the majority leader of the \nSenate, Senator Reid, and Senator Leahy both suggesting it was time \nthat we slowed things down and not confirm any more circuit judges \nuntil we saw how the election came out in November. So we are \nbasically, in our opinion, applying, in the fairest possible way in the \nSenate, the Thurmond-Leahy rule that has been developed over time.\n  If there are excellent nominees by the President to the circuit \ncourts, well, the election is only 4 months away. If he is reelected, \nthey can be confirmed in November and December. If he is not, then his \nsuccessor will have a chance to make those nominations.\n  Let me speak today about a matter that I believe we have great \nagreement on in the Senate, with the President,\n\n[[Page S4803]]\n\nand that is the nomination of the President of Judge John Fowlkes to \nfill a vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of \nTennessee.\n  As the Governor of Tennessee, I had the responsibility of appointing \nabout 50 judges over 8 years. I looked for good intelligence, good \ntemperament, good understanding of the law, and respect for those who \ncame before the court. I did not feel it was my responsibility ever to \ninquire how a judge might decide on a particular case before he took \nthe position.\n  So I took some time to look into Judge Fowlkes' background when \nPresident Obama nominated him. I was delighted with what I found. I am \npleased to recommend him to our colleagues. His performance has been \npraised throughout his career in the community of Memphis and Shelby \nCounty where he is best known. His leadership, his citizenship, his \nhigh professionalism, his courtesy to others are the words I often \nhear. I have letters from bar association members who say he has a \ncreative and independent mind; from others in Memphis who say he is \npassionate about the community in which he lives, appearing at civic \nevents repeatedly, committing over 50 hours of service annually to the \nMemphis Area Legal Services, and actively supporting the Boy Scouts.\n  So it is with great pleasure that I recommend to our colleagues today \nPresident Obama's nominee, Judge John Fowlkes, to fill a vacancy on the \nU.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I rise to second what the great Senator \nfrom Tennessee Lamar Alexander said. I want to speak for a moment about \nthe same nomination, with the same amount of energy, and the fact that \nI am very excited about this person being nominated.\n  When the White House began looking for someone to fill this position, \nI talked to numbers of people down in Shelby County about Judge \nFowlkes, and people whom I respected, people who have been involved in \nthe community for years. I can tell you, from every single person I \ntalked to, they talked not only about his record but also the kind of \nperson he was. He has served in many positions.\n  He has been a public defender, a district attorney, a U.S. Attorney, \nhe was the chief administrative officer for the largest and most \npopulous county in the State of Tennessee. Now he serves as a criminal \ncourt judge. At every stop, he has excelled and earned a reputation for \nprofessionalism and integrity. I think his experience certainly makes \nhim very well-prepared for this position and the responsibilities he \nwill carry out.\n  I am glad to join with Senator Alexander, Senator Leahy, and others. \nI hope we have an overwhelming vote today for this nominee, who I \nbelieve will be an outstanding Federal judge. I ask all of my \ncolleagues to join us in supporting this person, who, again, I think \nwill be exemplary on the bench, as he has been throughout his entire \nlife.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I support the nomination of John Thomas \nFowlkes, to be U.S. district judge for the Western District of \nTennessee.\n  Although it is the practice and tradition of the Senate to not \nconfirm circuit nominees in the closing months of a Presidential \nelection year, we continue to confirm consensus district judge \nnominees. Today's vote will be the 152nd nominee of this President \nconfirmed to the district and circuit courts. We also have confirmed \ntwo Supreme Court nominees during President Obama's term.\n  I continue to hear some Members repeatedly ask the question, ``What \nis different about this President that he has to be treated differently \nthan all these other Presidents?'' I won't speculate as to any \ninference that might be intended by that question, but I can tell you \nthat this President is not being treated differently than previous \nPresidents. By any objective measure, this President has been treated \nfairly and consistent with past Senate practices.\n  For example, with regard to the number of confirmations, let me put \nthat in perspective for my colleagues with an apples-to-apples \ncomparison. The last time the Senate confirmed two Supreme Court \nnominees was during President Bush's second term. And during President \nBush's entire second term the Senate confirmed a total of only 119 \ndistrict and circuit court nominees. With Judge Fowlkes' confirmation \ntoday, we will have confirmed 33 more district and circuit nominees for \nPresident Obama than we did for President Bush, in similar \ncircumstances.\n  During the last Presidential election year, 2008, the Senate \nconfirmed a total of 28 judges--24 district and 4 circuit. Today, we \nwill exceed the number of district court judges confirmed. We have \nalready confirmed 5 circuit nominees, and this will be the 25th \ndistrict judge confirmed this year. Those who say that this President \nis being treated differently either fail to recognize history or want \nto ignore the facts.\n  Judge Fowlkes received his B.A. from Valparaiso University in 1975 \nand his J.D. from University of Denver School of Law in 1977. From 1978 \nto 1979 he worked as an assistant public defender at the Shelby County \nPublic Defender's Office, where he represented indigent defendants. In \n1979, he joined the Shelby County District Attorney General's Office \nand served as an assistant district attorney for the next 10 years. \nThere he tried nearly 150 jury trials, handling homicide, assault, sex \noffense, robbery, and burglary cases. In 1989, he became an assistant \nU.S. attorney, trying criminal cases until 2002. As an AUSA, he tried \nover 100 jury trials and handled all appellate level work. During his \ntime at the attorney's office, Judge Fowlkes was a first assistant for \nseveral years, directing day-to-day operations of the office. From 2002 \nto 2007, Judge Fowlkes was the chief administrative officer for Shelby \nCounty. He was not engaged in the practice of law during this period.\n  In 2007, then-Governor Phil Bredesen appointed Judge Fowlkes to be a \ncriminal court judge for Division VI of the 30th Judicial District at \nMemphis. In November 2008, he was elected to a full, 8-year term. In \n2011, he was elected by judges of the 30th Judicial District to serve \nas presiding judge.\n  The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated \nJudge Fowlkes as ``well qualified.''\n  I support the nomination and congratulate Judge Fowlkes on his \nconfirmation today.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof John Thomas Fowlkes, Jr., of Tennessee, to be United States District \nJudge for the Western District of Tennessee.\n  On this question, the yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

On this vote, the yeas are 80, the nays are \n14. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today we begin debate on a bill called the \nSmall Business Jobs and Tax Relief Act. There are some positive \nelements to this legislation, but I remain amazed that the Democratic \nmajority has decided to pursue this bill to support small businesses \nwhen looming tax increases threaten to crush these very same small \nbusinesses.\n  Rather than address the expiration of the 2001 and 2003 tax relief, \nwhich is denying certainty to small businesses and holding back hiring \nand economic development, we are discussing this legislation. The \nPresident and his allies who are pursuing this legislation are patting \nthemselves on the back for supporting small businesses, but puffing \ntheir chest as the saviors of America's job creators while doing \nnothing to address the coming fiscal cliff is like a person asking for \nthe keys to the city after throwing a water balloon at a house fire.\n  Our small businesses and our economy face an existential threat with \nthe coming tax hikes. Not only have Senate Democrats done nothing to \nbring some certainty to this situation, but President Obama actively \nundermined these businesses with his White House campaign event \nyesterday, during which he expressed his commitment to raising taxes on \nthese small businesses.\n  So as we debate this bill, we need to keep that backdrop in mind. As \nthe President proposes with this bill to give with one hand to small \nbusinesses, with the other hand he is prepared to sock those same \npeople in the jaw. Small businesses are just one facet of our economy \nthat will be hit with the largest tax increase in history if Congress \nand the President fail to act before January 1, 2013. But given that \nsmall businesses are the engine of job creation in our economy, the \nimpact of these tax increases will reach far and wide, undermining \neconomic growth and hampering innovation and job creation. Taxpayers \nare on the edge of a fiscal cliff. Yet instead of leading them to \nsafety, the President's campaign is telling us to march forward.\n  The consequences will crush American taxpayers. In February, the \nWashington Post referred to this $4.5 trillion tax hike as \n``taxmageddon.'' Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke described it as \na ``massive fiscal cliff'' when testifying before Congress. If\n\n[[Page S4805]]\n\nthese tax hikes are allowed to occur, it will raise taxes on virtually \nall flowthrough business income in the United States come January 1, \n2013.\n  This is especially harmful to small businesses because the vast \nmajority of small businesses are organized as flowthrough business \nentities such as partnerships, S corporations, limited liability \ncompanies, and sole proprietorships.\n  So unless the Congress acts to prevent these massive tax increases, \nthe vast majority of small businesses in the United States will be hit \nwith a massive tax increase next year. It is hard to conceive of a \ngreater impediment to job creation. All of these tax increases and the \neconomic uncertainty they cause are going into the investment and \nhiring decisions of business men and women today.\n  Even President Obama agrees that two-thirds of the new jobs in our \neconomy are created by small businesses. I do not know anybody who \ndisagrees with that. With unemployment stuck at an unacceptably high \nlevel of 8.2 percent, we must not allow this tax increase to happen. \nAmerica is slowly recovering from one of the greatest recessions in \nmodern history. The Vice President rightly said that for millions of \nAmericans it feels as if they are living through a depression. Paul \nKrugman recently stated we are in a depression.\n  I just finished reading Robert Caro's recent book on Lyndon Johnson. \nHe discusses in that book the tax cuts of President Kennedy and how \nimportant they were and how Lyndon Johnson handled it after the \nhorrific death of our President.\n  (Mr. FRANKEN assumed the chair.)\n  Those tax cuts solved a lot of problems. One of the things, if I \nrecall it correctly, President Johnson said was that without them we \nwould not have been able to pull out of the difficulties we were in.\n  Yet with a fragile recovery and a weak jobs market, President Obama \nseems content to sit idly by and allow this scheduled $4.5 trillion tax \nhike to occur.\n  I believe Congress needs to act now in order to prevent this tax hike \non America's families and job creators.\n  As we can see on this chart, we have the tax legislation to-do list. \nIt is critically important for our economy and the American people that \nwe act now to extend the tax relief signed into law by President Bush \nand extended by President Obama.\n  Notice we did have hearings on tax extenders and we did have hearings \non the fourth item on the chart to prevent the 2013 tax hikes, but we \nhave had neither a markup or a floor presentation on any of those \nfour--tax extenders, the AMT patch, death tax reform, and preventing \nthe 2013 tax hikes.\n  The 2013 tax hikes is the most crucial piece of legislation Congress \nmust address this year, if not during the entire 112th Congress. If we \nallow this tax relief to expire as scheduled at the end of the year, \nalmost every Federal income taxpayer in America will see an increase in \ntheir rates. Some will see a rate increase of 9 percent, while others \nwill see a rate increase of 87 percent.\n  Because the vast majority of small businesses are flowthrough \nbusiness entities, such as partnerships, the income from these \nbusinesses flows through the business directly onto the small business \nowners' individual tax returns. Therefore, any increase in individuals' \ntax rates means those small businesses get hit with a tax increase. \nThis tax increase lands on these small business owners, even if they do \nnot take one penny out of their business. Thus, even if a small \nbusiness reinvests all its income from the business to hire more \nworkers, pay the workers they already have or purchase equipment, they \nwould still get hit with this looming tax hike.\n  Our economy simply cannot afford to take on such a fiscal shock. \nPresident Obama promised that if we would just pass his $800 billion \nstimulus bill, unemployment would not go above 8 percent. It has now \nbeen 40 months in a row since the stimulus passed that unemployment has \nbeen above 8 percent.\n  Looking at this problem more broadly, economists estimate that if \nthese current tax policies are allowed to expire, the economy could \ncontract by approximately 3 percentage points. That would be a large \nhit to an economy that is still weak and recovering from the fiscal \ncrisis of 2008. Adding another fiscal crisis by neglecting to extend \nthese tax policies may cause even further damage. For those on the \nother side of the aisle, including the President, who argue we should \nraise the top two tax rates because it is the fiscally responsible \nthing to do, I will point out a few things.\n  First, according to the Congressional Budget Office, 80 percent of \nthe revenue lost from extending the 2001 and 2003 tax relief provisions \nis found among those making less than $200,000 per year if single and \n$250,000 if married.\n  Second, the nonpartisan official scorekeeper for Congress on tax \nissues, the Joint Committee on Taxation, tells us that 53 percent of \nall flowthrough business income would be subject to the President's \nproposed tax hikes. Because the vast majority of small businesses are \norganized as flowthrough business entities, as I mentioned above, this \nis especially harmful to small businesses. Given the agreed-upon \nimportance of small businesses to our economic recovery, it is a \nmystery to me why the President and his Democratic allies would pursue \ntax increases on these very job creators. We simply cannot afford to \nraise taxes on over half this business income.\n  This would take the marginal tax rate on small businesses from 33 \npercent and 35 percent to 39.6 percent and 41 percent, respectively.\n  Look at this particular chart and the increase in small business top \nmarginal rates. Here, the blue line starts to go up in 2012. As we can \nsee, the marginal rates will go to 40 percent and up to 41 percent.\n  It seems clear what the agenda of the Senate should be. We should be \nfocused like hawks on moving us back from the fiscal cliff and \npreventing ``taxmageddon.'' Yet at a time when we should be working to \nprevent a massive tax increase, President Obama and his Democratic \nallies are spinning their wheels trying to raise taxes on politically \nunpopular groups.\n  These tax hikes are already scheduled to go into effect. Congress \ndoesn't have to do anything, and everyone will pay more in taxes come \n2013. That is not a good sign, given that some people have called this \na do-nothing Senate.\n  Let me refer to the Senate Democratic leadership's tax legislation \nto-do list.\n  I am sure some people are tired of the mantra among conservatives \nthat Democrats want to raise taxes and Republicans don't, but we say it \nbecause it is true. At liberal think tanks, their employees go to work \nevery morning and think about how they can raise taxes.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle, knowing their constituents \nalready feel overtaxed, spend countless hours devising ways to raise \ntaxes in a way that only hits politically unpopular groups or, in the \ncase of ObamaCare, they worked tirelessly to hide the nature of the \nindividual mandate tax and the true impact of the law's over $500 \nbillion in taxes.\n  The President is now devoting his entire reelection campaign toward \ntax hiking in the name of fairness. In the Senate, we have already \nvoted twice on the proposal of my colleague from New Jersey, Senator \nMenendez, to raise taxes on oil and gas companies. We voted twice on \nit.\n  First, we had hearings in the Senate Finance Committee last year. As \nI said then, that was nothing more than a dog and pony show. Everybody \nknew it. Then the leadership brought the bill directly to the floor, \nskipping the process of a markup.\n  A few months ago, we voted on the silly Buffet tax--the Buffet rule \ntax hike bill--without hearings and without a markup. This is not \nserious tax policy. The Buffet tax is a statutory talking point and not \na very good one at that.\n  First, the President said it was about deficit reduction. We pointed \nout to him it raised only $47 billion in revenue over 10 years, a drop \nin the bucket given the President's trillions in deficit spending. We \npointed out that implementing the Buffet tax the way President Obama \nsuggested in his most recent budget would lose nearly $1 trillion over \nthe first 10 years alone. Specifically, President Obama proposed \nreplacing the AMT with the Buffet tax.\n\n  So the White House shifted gears. Now the Buffet tax was about \nfairness. But when we pointed out that his\n\n[[Page S4806]]\n\nredistributionist scheme, if redirected to a lower tax bracket, would \nonly yield an $11-per-family tax rebate, he criticized Republicans for \ndemonizing him as a class warrior.\n  The President needs to come clean about what the Buffet tax is. It is \nnothing less than a second and even more damaging alternative minimum \ntax, one that would force many small business owners and job creators \nto pay a minimum of 30 percent of their income in tax.\n  As the Wall Street Journal said on April 10:\n\n       The U.S. already has a Buffett rule. The Alternative \n     Minimum Tax that first became law in 1969 . . . . The surest \n     prediction in politics is that any tax that starts by hitting \n     the rich ends up hitting the middle class because that is \n     where the real money is.\n\n  What is rich about the Buffett rule is that Mr. Buffet would be able \nto avoid his own Buffett tax. What is the President doing? Why, with \n``taxmageddon'' around the corner, are President Obama and his liberal \nallies dithering with these harmful tax increases?\n  The answer is pure and simple: politics.\n  Let's not forget that every minute Democrats spend playing politics \nis a minute we don't spend preventing the largest tax increase in \nAmerican history.\n  It is time for the Senate Democratic leadership to get serious and to \nfocus on preventing this massive tax hike.\n  Instead of focusing on preventing this massive tax hike on small \nbusiness, however, the President and the congressional Democratic \nleadership have doubled down on their small business tax hike strategy. \nThe President's speech yesterday was simply a rehash of the same old \nineffective arguments about why we should raise taxes on small \nbusinesses. His claims that it is necessary to rein in the debt and \ndeficit are not credible at all, considering he has added trillions of \ndollars to the debt since he has been in office. The Senate Democratic \nleadership will not even present a budget proposal of their own for the \nSenate to vote on.\n  ``Taxmageddon'' is coming. The only good news is that Congress can \nprevent this historic tax increase. I have an amendment to this bill \nthat will prevent this historic tax increase and will pave the way for \nsignificant tax reform in 2013.\n  That is where my focus will be until this tax hike is prevented, and \nI hope my colleagues will join me in preventing this looming tax \nincrease on the American people.\n  Forty of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle voted to \ntemporarily extend this tax relief in 2010. They should do so again.\n  President Obama once said it would be foolish to raise taxes during \nan economic downturn, and he acted accordingly. I compliment him for \ndoing so.\n  Our economy remains weak today. The only thing that appears to have \nchanged is that President Obama has apparently determined that his path \nis class warfare.\n  My hope is my colleagues who have supported this tax relief in the \npast will put the President's shortsighted and self-interested \npartisanship aside and vote on behalf of their constituents to extend \ntax relief to America's families and small businesses.\n  I finished reading this book about Lyndon Johnson and about his \nascension to the Presidency of United States of America. For most of \nthe time before President Kennedy's unfortunate death, Lyndon Johnson \nwas kind of a fish out of water. He didn't know what to do. He wasn't \nutilized very well. He was totally loyal to the President. But once the \nmurder of our President occurred, he was very sensitive to the feelings \nof the Kennedy family, the Kennedy widow and the Kennedy children. He \nwas sensitive to the President's brothers. He didn't move into the \nWhite House until after everything was taken care of. But he decided he \nwas going to make sure the President's tax cuts went through. \nNaturally, there was serious involvement with the civil rights bill at \nthat time, something many of our southern Senators--most all \nDemocrats--did not want to pass. He knew if they brought that up first, \nthe tax bill would never pass. It is an extremely interesting book by \nRobert Caro as to how the President was able to get the tax cuts \nthrough ahead of bringing up the civil rights bill and then bringing up \nthe civil rights bill and putting pressure on Republicans and Democrats \nto do what should have been done many years before.\n  I pay tribute to President Johnson, who, of course, in the eyes of \nmany Democrats and Republicans, had a mixed record, but he was a master \nin helping President Kennedy's tax bill go through. And because of \nthat, we had a period of decent expansion.\n\n  I don't think I will ever fully understand why my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle don't seem to understand the importance of \ncutting taxes during a time when we are in real difficulty. They still \nwant to spend more by increasing taxes, which they never seem to use to \npay down any deficits. We use them to spend more than ever before. They \ncould take a page out of Lyndon Johnson's book and really out of the \nbook of President John F. Kennedy, who was smart enough to know, \nintelligent enough to know, and caring enough to know that during times \nof great difficulty tax rate reductions are very important.\n  Mr. President, I wish we could work together a little bit better. I \nwish both Democrats and Republicans would get off their high horses and \nstart to band together and work on what is wrong with our country \ninstead of what is wanted as far as political advantage goes. Taxing \n940,000 small businesses--which is what our bipartisan leaders in the \nSenate have said--is like asking to go into a deeper depression. It is \nlike saying we don't care.\n  What is really interesting is that a lot of these taxes are going to \nbe socked onto the people who earn less than $120,000 a year through \nthe health care bill. And further, with regard to the health care bill, \nwhich is now considered a tax, the bottom 10 percent of all wage \nearners or of all people in our society are going to pay a pretty \nwhopping percentage of the taxes that are going to be assessed. They \nare the ones who are going to get hit harder than anybody else.\n  I think our colleagues on the other side ought to really study this \nand figure it out. And the points I am making are from many bodies who \nare supposed to be nonpartisan. We simply cannot allow tax Armageddon \nto occur. And by using this ploy, the President is just playing \npolitics instead of doing what really ought to be done. I think more of \nhim than that, and I hope that I am right and that he will get off his \nhigh horse, quit playing the class warfare game, and start doing what \nis right for America. He would be better off if he did, I guarantee \nthat.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I come today to share with the Senate a \nletter which I have written to Ambassador Susan Rice, the United States \nPermanent Representative to the United Nations. It is a letter I have \nwritten over a grave concern I have over actions that have taken place \nrecently in the United Nations but also reflects back on some things \nthat have happened in the last year or so that are very troubling to me \nand, quite frankly, very troubling to my constituents.\n  As I know the Presiding Officer is aware and as all the Senate is \naware, the U.N. convened this month in New York a conventional arms \ntrade treaty, where they are looking at an international treaty on \nlimitations and governance over small arms shipment and trade between \ncountries.\n  I have expressed my concern about the threat to the United States \nsecond amendment, our constitutional right to bear arms, and my concern \nover the U.N. subordinating U.S. law to itself. But I have never ever \nbeen as concerned as I am today to find out that Iran has been named, \nwithout objection, as a member of the conference that will lead this \ndebate.\n  I want to talk about it for a few minutes, because a lot of U.N. \npolitics and\n\n[[Page S4807]]\n\nU.N. governance and U.N. practices are not understood by the American \npeople. But when the U.N. has one of these conferences working toward a \ntreaty, they will appoint a general conference or a general bureau or a \nboard which is made up of members of the U.N. who will work out the \ndetails on the conference and then submit the entire convention to the \nUnited Nations.\n  There is a process in the United Nations where anyone can object to \nthe appointment or to any other motion that may be made on the floor, \nbecause the U.N. operates under what is known as consensus, which is \nthe absence of an objection. If there is an objection to a motion that \nis made, then a vote takes place.\n  Iran has been seeking a position on this U.N. conference on small \narms and arms trade treaty agreement for some time. That has been \nknown.\n  This is the same Iran the U.N. has sanctioned four times in the last \n3 years for its progress on its nuclear arms program and the enrichment \nof nuclear material. It is the same Iran that as recently as last week \nthe U.N. sent its former chief head president to try to negotiate a \nsettlement on the horrible things that happened in Syria. This is the \nsame Iran that is accused of shipping arms to Syria and to the Asad \nregime, which has resulted in the killing of over 17,000 Syrians in the \nlast year.\n  How in anybody's right mind could they allow a country that is in the \nprocess of doing that and that has been sanctioned four times by the \nU.N. to ascend to a position to negotiate a conference on a treaty on \nsmall arms on behalf of the U.N?\n  I have written this letter to Secretary Rice because I have great \nrespect for Ambassador Rice, and I know she is doing a great job. But I \ncannot understand for the life of me why the United States would not \nuse its right to object to the appointment of a country such as Iran on \nany treaty, much less one on arms and the Arms Trade Treaty. It reminds \nme of what happened a year ago when North Korea went on the disarmament \ncommittee in the United Nations. Today, Syria is seeking a position on \nthe Human Rights Commission. These types of appointments to people who \nare often serial violators of the governance of the committee they are \ntrying to seek is laughable and puts the United Nations and the United \nStates in an embarrassing position.\n  I have written Secretary Rice to find out the answer to this \nquestion: Did we have the opportunity to object to Iran being named to \nthe conference? If we did, why didn't we object to that? How in the \nworld can we be expected to have any confidence in what comes out of \nthe conference if, in fact, one of the worst perpetrators in the world \nis being appointed to the conference? I hope the Secretary will inform \nme so that I can inform my constituents because, frankly, I cannot \nexplain it.\n  I have great concern that any U.N. treaty on small arms would, \nintentionally or unintentionally, affect the second amendment rights of \nthe American people. I am a great supporter of the second amendment, \nand I have had a concern all along. I signed a letter with Senator \nMoran from Kansas last week to the Secretary registering my objections \nand concerns about the threat of that treaty itself, but to find out \nnow that one of the 15 members writing the treaty and negotiating it \nthis month in New York City is the nation of Iran concerns me greater.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record my letter to \nthe Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Susan E. Rice, of \nthe United States and New York.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 10, 2012.\n     Hon. Susan E. Rice,\n     United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations, \n         United States Mission to the United Nations, United \n         Nations Plaza, New York, NY.\n       Dear Ambassador Rice: I write today concerning the United \n     Nations (U.N.) Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty being held \n     this month in New York City. I have already expressed my \n     concerns and objections over the danger that the U.N. Arms \n     Trade Treaty poses to our sovereignty and to our Second \n     Amendment rights. I now write to voice my strong concern over \n     the recent inclusion of Iran as a member of the Conference's \n     Bureau/General Committee, and the failure of the United \n     States to exercise its right to block this action.\n       On July 3, 2012, the members of the Conference unanimously \n     supported Iran's bid for membership on the Conference's \n     Bureau/General Committee. The Conference supported Iran's \n     inclusion in the Bureau/General Committee despite both Iran's \n     continued pursuit of a nuclear weapons program in defiance of \n     numerous U.N. Security Council Resolutions and a recent U.N. \n     report detailing Iran's central role in enabling the \n     continuing massacre of Syrian civilians by Bashar al-Assad's \n     regime.\n       Situations such as these are not without precedent. Just \n     last year, North Korea ascended to the presidency of the \n     U.N.-backed Conference on Disarmament, and recent reports \n     have indicated that Syria is actively pursuing membership on \n     the U.N. Human Rights Council. Given this recent history, the \n     possibility of Syria joining such a body at a time when it is \n     slaughtering thousands of its own citizens does not appear as \n     implausible as it should.\n       It is my understanding that the United States had the \n     opportunity to oppose Iran's membership. If this is true, it \n     is particularly troubling that Iran faced no opposition. As \n     Iran becomes increasingly isolated on the international stage \n     a unanimous vote in favor of its membership on an \n     international panel legitimizes the regime. The United States \n     must vocally lead the opposition to any attempt by Iran to \n     use an international body to further its aims. I am \n     requesting a full explanation as to why the United States did \n     not oppose Iran's membership on the Bureau/General Committee \n     of the U.N. Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty, and a \n     commitment that the United States will do all that it can to \n     oppose Syria's membership on the U.N. Human Rights Council.\n       My constituents regularly voice their concerns that their \n     tax dollars go toward supporting the United Nations, an \n     organization that many of them see as operating in direct \n     opposition to U.S. interests. As a member of the United \n     Nations and as a permanent member of the Security Council, \n     our resolve must be the catalyst for the United Nations to \n     assert itself as a positive force in unifying the world \n     community against tyranny, terrorism and totalitarianism. I \n     look forward to your response and look forward to sharing it \n     with my constituents.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Johnny Isakson,\n                                                      U.S. Senate.\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a letter from the Members of the House of \nRepresentatives--over 100 of them--to the President and Secretary of \nState Clinton regarding the U.N. arms agreement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 29, 2012.\n     President Barack Obama,\n     Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC.\n     Secretary of State Hillary Clinton,\n     C St., NW, Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Obama and Secretary Clinton: We write to \n     express our concerns regarding the negotiation of the United \n     Nations Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), the text of which is \n     expected to be finalized at a conference to be held in New \n     York during the month of July. Your administration has voted \n     in the U.N. General Assembly to participate in the \n     negotiation of this treaty. Yet the U.N.'s actions to date \n     indicate that the ATT is likely to pose significant threats \n     to our national security, foreign policy, and economic \n     interests as well as our constitutional rights. The U.S. must \n     establish firm red lines for the ATT and state unequivocally \n     that it will oppose the ATT if it infringes on our rights or \n     threatens our ability to defend our interests.\n       The U.S. must not accept an ATT that infringes on our \n     constitutional rights, particularly the fundamental, \n     individual right to keep and to bear arms that is protected \n     by the Second Amendment, as well as the right of personal \n     self-defense on which the Second Amendment is based. \n     Accordingly, the ATT should not cover small arms, light \n     weapons, or related material, such as firearms ammunition. \n     Further, the ATT should expressly recognize the individual \n     right of personal self-defense, as well as the legitimacy of \n     hunting, sports shooting, and other lawful activities \n     pertaining to the private ownership of firearms and related \n     materials.\n       The U.S. must also not accept an ATT that would interfere \n     with our nation's national security and foreign policy \n     interests. The ATT must not accept that free democracies and \n     totalitarian regimes have the same right to conduct arms \n     transfers: this is a dangerous piece of moral equivalence. \n     Moreover, the ATT must not impose criteria for determining \n     the permissibility of arms transfers that are vague, easily \n     politicized, and readily manipulated. Specifically, the ATT \n     must not hinder the U.S. from fulfilling strategic, legal, \n     and moral commitments to provide arms to allies such as the \n     Republic of China (Taiwan) and the State of Israel. Indeed, \n     the State Department acknowledged in June 2010 that the ATT \n     negotiations are expected to introduce such regional, \n     country-specific challenges. Finally, the ATT should not \n     contain any language that legitimizes the arming of \n     terrorists--for example, by recognizing\n\n[[Page S4808]]\n\n     any right of resistance to ``foreign occupation''--or implies \n     that signatories must recognize the jurisdiction of the \n     International Criminal Court.\n       Furthermore, the U.S. must not agree to an ATT that would \n     damage U.S. economic interests. The ATT must not create \n     costly regulatory burdens on law-abiding American businesses, \n     for example, by creating new onerous reporting requirements \n     that could damage the domestic defense manufacturing base and \n     related firms. Furthermore, the ATT must not pressure the \n     U.S. to alter either the criteria or the decision-making \n     system of its current arms export control system, which \n     Secretary Clinton has called the ``gold standard'' of export \n     controls. The ATT should not in any way skew domestic debate \n     on export control reforms, as the U.S. continues to modernize \n     export controls to increase U.S. global competitiveness, \n     create jobs for American workers, and strengthen our allies.\n       Lastly, regardless of negotiated text, the Administration \n     must make clear in its reservations, understandings, and \n     declarations that the ATT places no new requirements for \n     action on the U.S., because U.S. law is already compliant \n     with the treaty regime or that the treaty cannot change the \n     Bill of Rights or the constitutional allocation of power \n     between the federal and state governments. Moreover, the U.S. \n     must not accept the creation of any international agency to \n     administer, interpret, or add to the ATT regime because it \n     might represent the delegation of federal legal authority to \n     a bureaucracy that is not accountable to the American people.\n       We urge this Administration to uphold the principles \n     outlined above in the ATT negotiations at the July conference \n     and any future venues for discussion. Should the final ATT \n     text run counter to these principles or otherwise undermine \n     our rights and our interests, we urge this Administration to \n     break consensus and reject the treaty in New York. Further, \n     the Constitution gives the power to regulate international \n     commerce to Congress alone, and the ATT will be considered \n     non-self-executing until Congress enacts any legislation to \n     implement the agreement. As members of the House of \n     Representatives, we reserve and will maintain the power to \n     oppose the appropriation or authorization of any taxpayer \n     funds to implement a flawed ATT, or to conduct activities \n     relevant to any ATT that has been signed by the President but \n     has not received the advice and consent of the Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Members of Congress.\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n\n                          Affordable Care Act\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, 2 weeks ago the Supreme Court did the \nright thing and settled once and for all the question of whether the \nAffordable Care Act is constitutional. As I said on the floor 2 weeks \nago, the fight is over; the law is constitutional, and it will stand. \nSome have been saying this is a great win for the President or for \nDemocrats. I don't see it that way. I believe this is a great victory \nfor the American people, for small businesses, and for our economy.\n  Now is the time to move past the political distractions and focus on \nthe task before us: implementing the law to bring quality, affordable \nhealth coverage to every American.\n  Unfortunately, tomorrow the House of Representatives will take a step \nin exactly the opposite direction. They have cracked open their old, \ntired playbook and will vote once again to repeal the Affordable Care \nAct. This is the second time the House has taken this vote to repeal \nthe entire Affordable Care Act, and they have failed every time to pass \nit in the Senate. The House has voted 30 times to repeal all or part of \nthe Affordable Care Act. Again, they have not been successful on any \none of those in the Senate, in this Chamber. If you say there hasn't \nbeen a vote--yes, in this Chamber, the Senate, last year every Member \nof the Republican caucus voted to repeal health reform. That failed as \nwell. This is just cynical politics.\n  My Republican friends don't expect their bill to repeal the \nAffordable Care Act to actually become law; they just want to put on \ngrand political theater. Their strategy, dreamed up by the same old \ncast of characters, such as Karl Rove, is to gin up the rumor mill, \nscare people with lies and distortions while offering no ideas of their \nown. They don't offer any new ideas because they don't have any.\n  Neither the House nor Senate Republicans agree on any plan that \ncontrols costs, brings down premiums, or covers as many people as the \nAffordable Care Act. In fact, a Republican Senator was recently asked \nto describe his plan for the health care system if the Affordable Care \nAct were repealed. Here is his answer: ``What we need to do is have a \nlot of hearings.'' That is their plan? I don't think that qualifies as \na plan. That won't help the millions of people who would lose access to \naffordable health insurance coverage.\n  Republicans in Congress are pandering to the extreme rightwing--those \nwho want to tear down everything this President has accomplished, \nregardless of the cost. Their strategy only makes sense if you are \nabsolutely obsessed with two things: tearing down health reform and \ntearing down this President.\n  What would repeal mean for average Americans? Well, I have looked at \nthis a different way. People used to think of the Republicans as being \nagainst the Affordable Care Act, but I want to delineate what the \nRepublicans would be for if they were to succeed in repealing the \nAffordable Care Act. If you vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, \nhere is what you are for:\n  You are for putting dollar limits on insurance coverage of more than \n100 million Americans, which would allow insurance companies to stop \npaying benefits right when you get really sick. They will stop paying \nbenefits. That is what you are for if you are for repealing the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  If you are for repealing the Affordable Care Act, you are for kicking \nmore than 3 million young people off of their parents' insurance policy \nright now.\n  If you vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, you are for allowing \ninsurance companies to cancel people's coverage when they are sickest--\njust cancel the policy.\n  You would be for allowing insurance companies to spend Americans' \npremium dollars on CEO buildings, marketing, or fancy buildings rather \nthan health care. In the Affordable Care Act, we have a medical loss \nratio requirement, and because of that, policyholders nationwide, this \nyear, by August 1, will receive more than $1 billion in rebates from \ninsurers. What that means in the future is that insurers will have to \nspend 80 to 85 percent of the premiums they get on health care--not \nadvertising, corporate jets, or big CEO salaries--on health care. If \nyou vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, you will vote to just let \nthem go back to their old ways, and they can spend 50 cents of every \npremium dollar on health care, and the rest they can spend on high \nsalaries and fancy buildings and conventions in the Cayman Islands and \nplaces like that.\n  If you vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, you are for allowing \ninsurance companies to deny people coverage or to increase their \npremiums if they have a preexisting condition. Nearly half of all \nAmericans have some form of a preexisting condition. So I guess that is \nwhat you would be for if you vote to repeal the health care bill.\n  If you want to repeal the bill, you are for taking affordable \ncoverage away from more than 30 million people, and you are for making \ninsured Americans pay for tens of billions of dollars of uncompensated \ncare when uninsured people show up in the emergency room. This has been \nestimated to cost American families an average of $1,100 in extra \npremiums annually.\n  If you vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, you are for charging \nas much as $300 in copays for lifesaving, preventive services that \nAmericans now get for free, services such as mammograms, colonoscopies, \nand other cancer screenings. More than 85 million people have already \nused these free services so they can stay healthy, get in charge of \ntheir illnesses, or catch something early on when it costs less.\n  If you are for repealing the Affordable Care Act, you are for \nincreasing prescription drug costs on seniors by an average of $600 a \nyear. That is because in the Affordable Care Act we close this doughnut \nhole. More than 5.2 million seniors and people with disabilities, I \nmight add, have saved a total of $3 billion already on prescription \ndrug spending in the doughnut hole since we enacted the law. If you are \nfor repealing this law, you are for making seniors pay more money for \nprescription drugs, pure and simple.\n  If you vote to repeal this law, you are voting to deprive States and \nlocalities of vital funding to combat chronic diseases, such as cancer, \ndiabetes, and heart disease, and to ensure that our kids have access to \nlifesaving vaccines. Why do I say that? Because in the\n\n[[Page S4809]]\n\nhealth reform bill, there is a prevention and public health fund that \nis already saving lives, getting money out to communities for these \nvery services, and cutting health care costs. So if you vote to repeal \nthe Affordable Care Act, you are saying that we are not going to combat \nchronic diseases such as cancer and diabetes and heart disease.\n  All of these protections I have enumerated have been enjoyed by a \ncertain select group of Americans for decades. What select group of \nAmericans do you suppose I am talking about who have had these \nprotections for decades? I suggest that every Member of Congress, the \nSenate and House, look in the mirror. We have enjoyed these for a long \ntime. How many times have we heard in the past when we were debating \nand having hearings on the Affordable Care Act before we voted on it--\nhow many times have we heard from our constituents that ``we need the \nsame kind of health care coverage you guys have in Congress.'' That is \nwhat we did. We didn't have higher premiums because of preexisting \nconditions; there is no exclusion because of that. We have had no \nlifetime or annual limit on benefits, no cancellation of coverage when \nwe got sick, and no copays for preventive services. In health reform, \nwe basically gave the American people the same services we in Congress \nhave enjoyed for a long time.\n\n  When a Member of Congress votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act, he \nor she is saying that these consumer protections are great for us--we \nwill keep them--but they are too good for you, the rest of the American \npeople. That is the kind of cynicism that takes your breath away.\n  Finally, let me point this out on the mandate that has gotten so much \npublicity lately. Quite frankly, the issue of this mandate--or, as I \ncall it, a free rider penalty--has a long, bipartisan history. Seven \ncurrent Republican Senators have previously endorsed a mandate. Many \nmore Republican Senators had endorsed it, and they are no longer here \nbecause they either retired or were defeated. Former Massachusetts \nGovernor Mitt Romney included a similar free rider penalty as the \ncenterpiece of RomneyCare in Massachusetts. In fact, he said this: \n``No, no, I like mandates. Mandates work.''\n  So we ought to stop these silly political games. The Republicans' \nobsession with repealing health reform is based strictly on ideology. \nThey oppose the law's crackdown on abuses by health insurance companies \nand any serious effort by the Federal Government to secure health \ninsurance coverage for tens of millions of Americans who currently have \nno coverage. It is really about giving control back to their good \nfriends--the wealthy, powerful insurance companies--so they can raise \nyour rates and hold on to your money by denying you benefits and making \negregious profits.\n  We all remember William Buckley's famous admonition to conservatives. \nHe said that the role of conservatives is ``to stand athwart history, \nyelling stop.''\n  William F. Buckley. Again, he said: The role of conservatives is to \nstand athwart history, yelling stop.\n  Well, in 1935, President Roosevelt and the Congress passed Social \nSecurity, providing basic retirement security for every American. \nRepublicans yelled stop. They fought it bitterly. Seventy-five years \nlater they are still trying to undo Social Security.\n  In 1965 President Johnson and the Congress passed Medicare, ensuring \nseniors had access to decent health care coverage. Republicans yelled \nstop. They fought it bitterly. Forty-five years later, they are still \ntrying to undo Medicare.\n  Well, here they go again. Here they go again, trying to undo the \nAffordable Care Act. As I have said before, they are on the wrong side \nof history.\n  I think we should listen to the American people and leave our \nideological obsessions behind and work together to make the law even \nbetter. The choice is to go forward or to be dragged backward. It is \ntime to come together as a united American people to create a reformed \nhealth care system that works not just for the healthy and the wealthy \nbut for all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I think it is important also to put a human face on \nthis matter. Let's just put a human face on what this bill does. I have \nshown some of these people before. Let's talk about Emily Schlichting.\n  She testified before our committee. She suffers from a rare \nautoimmune disorder that would have made her uninsurable in the old \ndays. But thanks to the Affordable Care Act, as a student, she is able \nto stay on her parents' policy until she is 26. Here is what she said \nat our hearing last year. She said:\n\n       Young people are the future of this country and we are the \n     most affected by reform--we're the generation that is most \n     uninsured. We need the Affordable Care Act because it is \n     literally an investment in the future of this country.\n       --Emily Schlichting, a student in Omaha.\n\n  Then there is Sarah Posekany of Cedar Falls, IA. She was diagnosed \nwith Crohn's disease when she was 15. During her first year in college \nshe ran into complications from Crohn's disease and was forced to drop \nher classes in order to heal after multiple surgeries. Because she was \nno longer a full-time student, her parents' private health insurance \ncompany terminated her coverage. They stopped it. Four years later, \nafter many health care interventions, she found herself $180,000 in \ndebt and forced to file for bankruptcy. She was able to complete one \nsemester at Hawkeye Community College but could not afford to continue. \nBecause of her earlier bankruptcy--because of her earlier bankruptcy \ndue to her health--every bank she applied to for student loans turned \nher down. But now, thanks to the new law, people like Sarah will be \nable to stay on their parents' health insurance plan until they are age \n26.\n  Again, are we just going to say to people like Sarah and Emily: \nTough. You got a bad break. Tough luck. Are we going to say that just \nto make some political point because of some ideological obsession?\n  The Affordable Care Act protects children with preexisting conditions \nnow. That protection will be expanded to all adults in 2014--in just a \ncouple of years. Well, actually, now that I think about it, in about a \nyear and a half, every adult American will have that coverage and be \nable to get affordable coverage even though they have a preexisting \ncondition.\n  That could mean a lot to Eleanor Pierce. She is from Cedar Falls, IA. \nHere is Eleanor Pierce. When her job with a local company was \neliminated, she lost her health insurance. She could purchase the COBRA \ninsurance, but it was completely unaffordable to her. So she searched \nfor coverage on the private individual market but was denied access \nbecause of her preexisting condition of high blood pressure. The only \nplans that would cover her came with premiums she could never hope to \nafford without any income.\n  So here is Eleanor, age 62, suffering from high blood pressure, and \nshe had no choice but to go without insurance and hope for the best. \nBut, Mr. President, hoping for the best is not a substitute for regular \nmedical care. One year later, Eleanor Pierce suffered a massive heart \nattack. When all was said and done, she had racked up $60,000 in \nmedical debt.\n  So, again, are we going to leave people like Eleanor without \ncoverage, with mounting debt and declining health just to make some \npolitical point? These are real people the Affordable Care Act is now \nhelping.\n  Well, as I have said before, the Affordable Care Act is for every \nAmerican. But many of the benefits that are in place now, Republicans \nwould take away by voting to repeal it. Many like Eleanor, who will be \nhelped when it is fully implemented in 2014, will be denied the \nability, the wherewithal to have affordable health care coverage so \nthey can have good preventive health care measures, so they can get in \nto see a doctor and get medical care before they have to go to the \nemergency room.\n  I am told that tomorrow the House of Representatives will once again \nvote to repeal the Affordable Care Act. But once again they are on the \nwrong side of history. It is time to come together. Let's work together \nnow to implement the law. It is constitutional, it is the law, let's \nget it implemented, and let's make sure we don't go down the road of \npolitical theater--political theater--due to ideological obsessions.\n  I know it is a campaign year. I have been in a lot of campaigns \nmyself. They are tough, I know that. But there comes a point when we \nhave to put politics aside for what is good for the\n\n[[Page S4810]]\n\nAmerican people. Now is the time to put aside the politics on the \nAffordable Care Act. Let's get to the business of implementing it.\n  As I said, Governor Romney is the nominee of the Republican Party for \nPresident. I am sure they will do everything they can to elect him. I \nunderstand that, and that is fine. That is the American way. I wouldn't \nhave it any other way. But just keep in mind, when he was Governor, he \nput in a health care system in Massachusetts that is very much like the \nAffordable Care Act, which included a mandate. Governor Romney himself \nsaid: No, no, I like mandates. Mandates work.\n  Well, it is time to move ahead. Let's implement the bill, and let's \nget over this political theater the House is going to embark on \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Restoring the Gulf of Mexico\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, last week, we passed some \nsignificant legislation, and it was one little glimpse of a bright \nshining moment of bipartisanship. The overall Transportation bill \npassed overwhelmingly. The magnificent leadership of the chairman of \nthe committee, Senator Boxer, and the ranking member, Senator Inhofe, \nwas a good example of how government, in general, and this institution, \nthe Senate, should operate to get things done. We went through the \namendatory process, and I noticed the two leaders of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee fought off all the amendments that would \nhave been killer amendments. They accepted some they believed \nstrengthened the bill, and then we passed the bill seventy-four to \nnineteen. So it was overwhelming and it was bipartisan.\n  As a part of the process of that bill, several months ago, when the \nTransportation bill was on the Senate floor, I had the privilege of \noffering an amendment--again, bipartisan--to restore the Gulf of Mexico \nafter the effects of the BP oilspill. That emanated from the fact that \nwe have a fine that will be levied by a Federal judge in New Orleans. \nThe law allows for the judge to assess a fine per barrel of oil spilled \nin the Gulf of Mexico.\n  In this case, we are talking about some real money. We are talking \nabout almost 5 million barrels spilled in the Gulf of Mexico. The fine \ncould be anywhere from a $5 billion fine all the way up to a $20 \nbillion fine. So the question became: Once the fine is determined and \napproved by the court, where is that money going to go? The Gulf State \nSenators argued we should be able to have this come back to help the \npeople and the environment of the gulf who were harmed.\n  There are so many effects, and we do not know what is going to be the \nultimate result of all of this, particularly on the health of the gulf.\n  Five million barrels in the gulf is a lot of oil. The question is, \nthe natural processes of the bacteria in the water that consume oil \nthat naturally leak through the ocean floor--is the gulf so overwhelmed \nwith all that oil that the bacteria are not able to consume it? Since \nthis came from a ruptured well 5,000 feet below the surface of the \nwater, how much oil is still down there, where it is hard to get any \nkind of research done because of the depth and the pressure.\n  That is what we need to know. We need to know for the future and we \nneed to know for all the people who have their livelihood by the gulf, \nbe it the seafood industry--but that not only affects the gulf. The \ngulf provides seafood for the entire country.\n  I am coming here to say we have an incredible success in a bipartisan \nway. I remind the Presiding Officer that we passed that amendment on to \nthe Transportation bill, the RESTORE the Gulf of Mexico Act, in this \nChamber 76 to 22. It was a huge bipartisan vote. Last week was a time \nto celebrate, and it was a time to celebrate for our whole country for \na lot of reasons.\n  Yesterday, I went back to the shores of the gulf to share with the \npeople what the specifics are of the legislation we passed and, once \nthe court decides what the fine is, how that money is going to flow and \nwhat it is going to do for our people to improve their economies and \nthe environment and for the long-term outlook of the health of the \ngulf. I wish to bring this to the attention of the Senate because the \ngulf doesn't just belong to the gulf coast counties of five Gulf \nStates; it belongs to all Americans, and the President signed it into \nlaw last Friday.\n  I wish to thank those people in the Senate, in the House, and the \nPresident for signing it, a wide array of staff and stakeholders, the \ncities and the counties whose tireless efforts led to the enactment of \nthe RESTORE Act. It aims to make sure the gulf does recover.\n  The chorus of support behind the success of this bill is enormous, \nand it would take me until the next Congress to thank everyone. But in \naddition to Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe, I wish to mention the \nspark plug behind this whole effort was Senator Mary Landrieu of \nLouisiana, whose State has suffered mightily. Senator Shelby and \nSenator Baucus, the chairman of the Finance Committee, who helped us \ncome up with sources of revenue that we had to have to satisfy the \nGeneral Accounting Office, Senator Whitehouse, all these Senators were \ninvolved. Indeed, when we filed the bill 1 year ago, we had Senators \nfrom all 5 Gulf States as cosponsors, another display of bipartisan \ncooperation.\n  Think back to 2 years ago when this disaster began. It was about 10 \nat night on April 20, 2010, 52 miles off the coast of Louisiana. The \nMacondo 252 oil well suddenly kicked, leading to an explosive blowout \nthat claimed the lives of 11 Americans. For the next 87 days, almost 5 \nmillion barrels of crude oil gushed into the gulf.\n  Fishermen pulled the gear off their boats and replaced it with booms \nand skimmers, tourists canceled their vacations, waiters came to work \nto find that there were no customers, and the oil continued to coat the \nmarshes that are the nursery habitat for juvenile shrimp and so many of \nthe other critters that spawn in and around the marshes. Some of the \nbeaches that draw tourists every summer were coated. Even for those \nbeaches that did not have oil, the perception was that there was oil on \nour beaches and the tourists did not come and it killed an entire \ntourist season.\n  That is why, in addition to Louisiana being affected with their \nenvironment and their shrimping industry and their fishing industry, \nthe economy of Florida, where oil got onto the westernmost beaches--as \na matter of fact, there was that famous photograph of Pensacola Beach \nwith the white sugary sand beaches, and it looked like the entire beach \nwas covered. That shot around the world and people started canceling \nvacations.\n  Only a few tar balls got as far east as Panama City Beach, and the \nrest of the gulf coast beaches all the way down to the southern tip of \nFlorida, no oil, but the tourists stopped coming. When the tourists \nstop coming, there is nobody in the hotels and the hotel workers can't \nwork, there is nobody in the restaurants and all those workers aren't \nworking and all the ancillary businesses that depend on that major \ncomponent of the economy. Then, of course, the seafood industry--the \nsource of one-third of our domestic seafood in this country, the Gulf \nof Mexico. Of course, the fishing industry was devastated, even those \nwho could fish outside the danger zone of where the oil was lurking. \nPeople stopped buying gulf seafood because they were afraid it was \ntainted. Even when the oil was finally shut off after 3 months, the \ngulf was left with this public perception that the gulf was tainted.\n  If we remember back, the President asked the Secretary of the Navy, \nRay Mabus, to recommend a strategy to restore the gulf. Why Ray Mabus? \nBecause he had been a Gulf State Governor, Governor of Mississippi. \nAfter he did his first tour, Secretary Mabus labeled the gulf a \nnational treasure, and he recommended that a significant portion of the \nClean Water Act fines to be levied against BP be sent back to the \nregion for environmental and economic recovery. Over the last couple \nweeks, the President, the Congress, stakeholder groups from across the \ncountry and across the political spectrum have made this commitment to \nrestore this\n\n[[Page S4811]]\n\nnational treasure, and the result is that we passed the RESTORE Act.\n\n  Over the next 6 months, the Department of Treasury is going to \ndevelop procedures in which to implement the RESTORE Act. The Ecosystem \nRestoration Council, established by the act, will build on the \nrecommendations of Secretary Mabus, the task force, and others to \ndevelop a draft comprehensive plan to address the environmental needs \nof the gulf. It is a Federal-State council. Once we know the outcome of \nthe Justice Department's lawsuit against BP--and there are rumors that \nthere is a settlement in the works. If that settlement were to be true \nand the judge approves it, the money will be ready to flow under the \nprocedures being set up under this Federal-State council as initially \ndetermined by the Department of the Treasury.\n  The reason I wish to speak is not only to thank the many people who \nhelped us accomplish this major milestone, but I also want to put into \nthe Congressional Record why certain provisions in the RESTORE Act are \nthere.\n  As the sponsor of the amendment, I want this legislative intent to be \nunderstood as the law is implemented. Certainly, I want understood from \nmy perspective, as one of Florida's two Senators, what we have done. \nBut it is important to flesh it out, if it hasn't been said already in \ntestimony in committee as well as testimony as given in the speeches on \nthe floor.\n  The RESTORE Act sends 80 percent of all the Clean Water Act fines \nback to the gulf through four mechanisms. The first is to direct equal \nallocation among the five Gulf States.\n  In the spring of 2011, in our State, the Florida legislature passed \nand the Governor signed legislation to ensure that the most affected \ncounties receive the bulk of any oil spill funding that comes to the \nState. This is different in the allocation of this first pot of money \nin the State of Florida from what was indicated in the other four Gulf \nStates. In the case of Florida, it is memorialized in law that 75 \npercent of the funds for Florida in this first pot of money would be \nspent in the eight disproportionately affected counties in the Florida \nPanhandle--so from the west, Escambia County all the way to the east to \nWakulla County--while the remaining 25 percent would be spent in other \ncounties. That allocation of funding is mirrored in the RESTORE Act and \nit is now law. This is important. Because while there are places across \nthe State that suffered from the misperception of oil, the panhandle \ncounties were some of the hardest hit. So when it comes to the first \nallocation, the intent was to have those eight counties receive 75 \npercent of the funds in that first pot and for the other counties along \nthe gulf coast of Florida to receive the remaining 25 percent.\n  If that State law is changed in the future, I want it clearly known \nthat the legislative intent of the sponsor of this bill was what was \njust said: the 75-25 allocation--not to be squirreled off into some \nother purposes in the State government but to go to the counties that \nwere affected by the spill.\n  The Senate-passed version of the RESTORE Act included impact \nallocation formulas for disproportionately affected counties and for \nother gulf coast counties that took into account things such as \npopulation and proximity to the oil spill. These impact allocations \nwere meant to provide a reasonable and transparent method for \naccounting for impacts between gulf coast counties in Florida. The \nFlorida Association of Counties convened working groups of the \ndisproportionately affected counties to determine such a method.\n  When we got into the conference committee with the House, the House \ndidn't go along with that particular internal approach so that language \nwas not included in the final public law. But I want the record stated \nthat was the intent of the Senate-passed bill, and as I have just come \nfrom the gulf coast yesterday, I understand from the county commissions \nall up and down the gulf that they intend to work with the cities and \nthe other affected parties to try to follow that method they had \nrecommended to us that we put into the Senate-passed bill.\n\n  The eight panhandle counties worked hard to reach a consensus, and it \nis my expectation they are going to continue to honor those collective \ndecisions to come up with a fair and reasonable method of allocating \nthe money. Throughout the spill and for the recovery efforts that are \nmoving forward, the gulf region worked as one gulf, with Louisiana \nshrimpers standing shoulder to shoulder with Florida county commissions \nbecause, together, the gulf would be stronger and better. I urge all \nthe stakeholders to continue this unified, consensus-driven process. \nAny one city, any one county or State restoration effort will only help \nthe region if you look at it as a whole.\n  I said there were four pots and each of the pots has a specified \namount, a percentage of the total fine money. Each of them has certain \ncriteria. The first pot I described will be divvied up among the five \nGulf States, equal parts to each State, and distributed according to \nthe formulas I mentioned.\n  The second pot is an amount of money specified to be directed under a \nFederal-State council. It will be for the purposes of restoration of \nthe environment of the gulf.\n  A third pot will be according to State plans, operating under the \ncriteria put together by all of the stakeholders, including a \nrepresentative from all the gulf coast counties in Florida, and \nultimately approved by the State-Federal council.\n  The last pot, the final 5 percent of the allocation of the moneys, is \nto be an investment in the long-term science and monitoring of the gulf \necosystem. When the oil began to spill we immediately realized how \nlittle we knew about the gulf. Many commercially and recreationally \nimportant fish stocks in the gulf have never had a stock assessment. We \ndid not know what the fisheries were. We knew organizations were \nclosing down certain fish stocks to protect the species, but it was \nnever done with up-to-date data. To know how to restore a whole \necosystem we have to know what has been harmed and how we go about \nstraightening it out. So half of the science funding is going toward a \ngrant program to collect data, observe and monitor the fish, the \nwildlife, and the ecosystem of the gulf in the long term.\n  From the beginning this program has been a priority of mine because \nour fishing industry is so important--commercial fishing, recreational \nfishing, and charter fishing.\n  By the way, the protection of these fisheries is not just for the \nfish in the gulf because so many of these critters that are spawned in \nthe marshes and bayous of the gulf, in the near-shore habitats of the \ngulf, are species that migrate to all the oceans of the world. I want \nto reiterate that this program is intended to provide a long-term \ninvestment in gulf science.\n  Years ago, in Alaska, after the Exxon-Valdez spill, it took 5 years \nfor the herring population to collapse and it has not recovered in the \n19 years since. We do not want this to happen in the Gulf of Mexico \nfisheries. If this gulf science program looks only at the short term we \nmay not be able to adequately assess the real impacts.\n  This funding is also meant to supplement existing efforts and not to \nsupplant them. I want that clear in the legislative intent. The health \nof the gulf, the fishing industry, and the tourism industry all rely on \naccurate, up-to-date science--which is lacking, by the way, not just in \nthe gulf but in all our fisheries.\n  There is a strict cap on the administrative expenses of 3 percent so \nthat the RESTORE funds produce on-the-ground results rather than \nplugging budgetary shortfalls.\n  The science pot, the fourth pot, is divided in two. I have described \nthe long-term science looking at the fisheries. The remaining half of \nthe science pot will go to centers of excellence to be established in \neach of the five Gulf States. University and research institutions in \nFlorida have been a vital part of the response to the Deepwater Horizon \nincident. Since the 1960s, Florida research institutions have worked \ntogether to benefit oceanographic science in the State. This \ncoordinated effort is called the Florida Institute of Oceanography. \nThis institute is essentially Florida's marine science brain trust and \nits members have done excellent science work, particularly since the \noil spill.\n  This model has produced excellent results that avoid the duplication \nand make the most effective use of the resources in the State. That is \nwhy the RESTORE Act includes language that\n\n[[Page S4812]]\n\nspecifies that in our State of Florida, a consortium of public and \nprivate research institutions in the State--a total of 20 with 7 \nassociate additional members, including the two State resource \nagencies--is going to be the ones named to carry out the center of \nexcellence in our State. This language is intended to provide for the \nFlorida Institute of Oceanography to carry out this program as the \ncentralized voice of the ocean science in Florida.\n  I want that clearly understood for any who read about this \nlegislation in the future. That was the legislative intent with regard \nto the center of excellence in the State of Florida. Each of the other \nStates has their own procedures.\n  This past week I have been on the gulf coast quite a bit to tell \nfolks about what I am sharing here today. This new law is going to \nprovide some of the necessary resources and a framework to restore the \ngulf coast and the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Just like plugging the \nMacondo well was a step in the right direction, this is another \nmonumental step. But obviously our work is not done here.\n  The Department of Justice is still negotiating with BP to ensure that \nthey are held responsible for the damage done, and it is time to \nimplement RESTORE, because we want to eat gulf seafood forever at \nFourth of July barbecues. Parents want to see their children playing on \nthe white sand beaches of the gulf. They want them to visit the Gulf \nIslands National Seashore and all up and down, from the Perdido River \nin the west all the way to the tip of the Florida Keys at Key West.\n  I am going to continue to work with our colleagues to move this \nprocess forward in a way that adequately restores this national \ntreasure of the Gulf of Mexico for many future generations.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to share this and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Burr pertaining to the introduction of S. 3367 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BURR. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The assistant majority leader.\n\n\n                             Child Marriage\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a disturbing \narticle which most of us saw on the front page of the Washington Post. \nIt is entitled ``In Niger, hunger crisis raises fears of more child \nmarriages.'' It was written by Sudarsan Raghavan. The article \nhighlights child marriages around the world. It is a human rights \natrocity that steals the future, the health, and the lives of little \ngirls and even boys in many developing countries.\n  In many of these countries girls are treated like chattel or \ncommodities, sold into marriages with older men to settle debts or for \ndowries to help families survive. In Niger--the focus of the Post \narticle--a famine is raising fears that more families will turn to that \npractice and marry off their little girls to gain economic security and \neven survival.\n  Niger happens to have the highest prevalence of child marriage with \none out of two girls marrying before the age of 15, and some are as \nyoung as 7.\n  Can you imagine? Women, look around you. If you see another woman, \nknow that in Niger one of you would have been married before you were \n15 years old. That is exactly what happened to Balki Souley.\n  Balki Souley was married at 12 years of age. Let me show this poster \nof her. She is now 14. She recently lost her first child during \nchildbirth at age 14. She almost died herself. Her small body was just \ntoo frail to handle the difficulty of facing labor. While Niger has the \nworld's highest rate of child marriage, it is not the only place this \nscourge occurs. It can be found all over the world and is most \nprevalent in Africa and southern Asia.\n  Recently the Senate acted to ensure that the U.S. government is \nadequately addressing this global human rights tragedy by passing the \nInternational Protecting Girls by Preventing Child Marriage Act. \nSenator Olympia Snowe and I were joined by a bipartisan group of 34 \nSenators in introducing this legislation. We have now passed this \nlegislation in the Senate not once but twice.\n  Unfortunately, despite the bipartisan support for this bill in the \nSenate, the Republican leadership in the House refuses to act on this \nlegislation. With every day that failure in the House continues, more \nand more little girls around the world, such as Balki are forced into \nearly marriage.\n  This means more girls in developing countries will lose their \nfreedom, have their childhood innocence stolen, and may, in fact, lose \ntheir lives. It means more young girls will be forced into sexual \nrelationships with men two or three times their age, and it means more \ngirls will suffer the devastating and often deadly health consequences \nthat accompany forced child marriage such as sexually transmitted \ndiseases and birth complications for the child and mother.\n  That is not what America stands for. I am calling on Speaker Boehner, \nMajority Leader Cantor, and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman \nIleana Ros-Lehtinen to bring this bill to a vote in the House \nimmediately.\n  Read the article, consider the photographs in the Post and other \nplaces. The lives of these girls in developing countries across the \nworld are literally in your hands.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, Mother Teresa once said, ``Be faithful in \nsmall things because it is in them that your strength lies.''\n  Small businesses matter; they are the store fronts in our main \nstreets; they are the idea creators in our technology sector; and they \nare the employers of our people.\n  In Montana small businesses matter even more, since small firms make \nup 97.6 percent of our employers and create almost 70 percent of the \nprivate-sector jobs.\n  We know small businesses are hurting because we see the job numbers. \nTrue, unemployment rates are holding steady, but we need to do better.\n  Monthly job growth hit its highest point in 20 months in January, \ncreating 275,000 new jobs. But job growth slowed substantially to \n77,000 in April and 69,000 in May--its lowest point since May of last \nyear--and 80,000 in June.\n  Similarly, U.S. GDP grew by 3.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011 \nbut has slowed to 2.2 percent for the first quarter of 2012.\n  We need to give businesses the boost they need to take the risk in \nhiring that additional employee or investing in that additional piece \nof equipment. The Small Business Jobs and Tax Relief Act introduced by \nSenator Reid does just that. It gives businesses a 10-percent tax \ncredit for increased payroll, allows businesses to write-off 100 \npercent of their business purchases made this year, and expands the \nability of businesses to claim an AMT credit in lieu of bonus \ndepreciation.\n  The hiring credit makes it cheaper for small businesses to employ \nworkers or raise wages. The extension of bonus depreciation would help \nsmall businesses that purchase equipment to write off those purchases \nmore quickly. The proposal would also help the businesses that sell the \nequipment. Bonus depreciation sparks investment, increases cash flows, \nand creates jobs.\n  These measures work because they provide incentives. They require \ncompanies to do something beneficial in order to obtain the \ncorresponding tax benefit--either to hire American workers or invest in \ncapital in the United States.\n  The Reid bill is in stark contrast to that offered by Representative \nCantor. His small business jobs bill is a mere giveaway. It gives \nbusinesses a 20 percent deduction for simply earning income. The Cantor \nbill allows businesses to avoid paying taxes on one-fifth of their \nprofits as long as they employ fewer than 500 people and pay twice the \namount of the deduction in wages. But rather than creating jobs or \ninvesting in business, the Cantor bill incentivizes the opposite. \nBecause it provides a temporary reduced rate, the Cantor bill\n\n[[Page S4813]]\n\nincentivizes businesses to defer making investments, hiring new \nemployees or increasing wages in 2012 in order to increase profits. \nThat is because, the larger the profits, the larger the tax deduction \nunder the Cantor bill.\n  That does not make sense for what we need as a Nation. Those \nbusinesses that need the boost are those that may be struggling to make \na profit right now. Indeed, this could be a risk-taking retailer or \ntechnology start-up that may not have any income at all this year. \nThose businesses would not be helped by Representative Cantor's \nproposal. Nor does it make sense to spend $46 billion for only 1 year \nof the provision as proposed by Representative Cantor.\n  We should be working to create certainty for our small businesses--\nreducing tax rates for all businesses without magnifying budget \ndeficits or exacerbating our long-term fiscal challenges.\n  We should oppose the Cantor bill and support the Reid bill.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, so ordered.\n  The assistant majority leader.\n\n\n                             The DREAM Act\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Eleven years ago, I introduced the DREAM Act. It was \nlegislation to allow a select group of young immigrant students with \ngreat potential to be a bigger part of America. The DREAM Act gave the \nstudents a chance to earn their way into legal status. It wasn't \nautomatic. They had to come to the United States as children, be long-\nterm residents, have good moral character, graduate from high school, \nand complete at least 2 years of college or military service.\n  It has had a strong history of bipartisan support over 11 years. I \nfirst introduced it with my Republican lead sponsor, Senator Orrin \nHatch of Utah, when it was first introduced. When the Republicans last \ncontrolled the Congress, the DREAM Act passed the Senate in a 62-to-36 \nvote with 23 Republicans voting yes. It was part of comprehensive \nimmigration reform. Unfortunately, that bill didn't pass.\n  The Republican support for the DREAM Act diminished for political \nreasons. The vast majority of Democrats, despite our support, can't \nstop a Republican filibuster when the bill has been called for \nconsideration. I am still committed to the DREAM Act. I am committed to \nwork with any Republican or any Democrat who wants to help me pass this \nimportant legislation.\n  Even though we have to wait on Congress to act, these young people \nwho would benefit from the DREAM Act can't wait any longer. \nUnfortunately, many are now being deported or at least they were. They \ndon't remember the places they are being deported to, and certainly in \nmany instances they don't speak the language. Those still here are at \nrisk of deportation themselves. They can't get a job and find it \ndifficult to go to school. They have no support from the government in \nterms of their education.\n  That is why President Obama and Homeland Security Secretary Janet \nNapolitano decided the Obama administration would no longer deport \nyoung people who are eligible for the DREAM Act. Instead, the \nadministration said they would permit these students to apply for a \nform of relief known as ``deferred action'' which puts on hold \ndeportations and allows them--on a temporary, renewable basis--to live \nand work in America. I strongly support this decision. I think it will \ngo down in history as one of the more significant civil rights \ndecisions of our era, and I salute President Obama for his courage in \nreaching this conclusion.\n  Remember that the students we are talking about didn't come to this \ncountry because of a family decision. They were brought here as babies \nand as children. As Secretary Napolitano said, immigrants who are \nbrought here illegally as children ``lack the intent to violate the \nlaw.'' It is not the American way to punish kids for their parents' \nwrongdoing.\n  The Obama administration's new policy will make America a stronger \ncountry by giving these talented immigrants a chance to contribute more \nfully to the economy. Studies have found that DREAM Act students can \ncontribute literally trillions of dollars to the U.S. economy during \ntheir working lives. They will be our future doctors and engineers and \nsoldiers and teachers. They will make us a stronger Nation.\n  Let me be very clear: The Obama administration's new policy is \nclearly lawful and appropriate. Throughout our history, the government \nhas decided who they will prosecute and who they will not based on law \nenforcement priorities and available resources. Previous \nadministrations in both political parties have made those decisions on \ndeportations, and the Supreme Court recognizes the right of a President \nto decide what agency will make a decision to prosecute or not \nprosecute. Listen to what the Supreme Court said in a recent opinion on \nArizona's immigration law:\n\n       A principal feature of the removal system is the broad \n     discretion exercised by immigration officials . . . \n     Discretion in the enforcement of immigration law embraces \n     immediate human concerns.\n\n  The administration's policy isn't just legal; it is smart and \nrealistic. There are millions of undocumented immigrants in the \ncountry. It would take literally billions of dollars to deport all of \nthem. It will never happen. So the Department of Homeland Security has \nto set priorities. The Obama administration has established a \ndeportation policy that makes it a high priority to deport those who \nhave committed serious crimes or who may be a threat to public safety. \nThe administration said it is not a high priority to deport DREAM Act \nstudents. I think the administration has its priorities right.\n  This isn't amnesty. It is simply a decision to focus limited \ngovernment resources on those who have committed serious crimes and to \nbasically say to DREAM Act students: You have an opportunity to remain \nhere in a legally recognized, temporary, and renewable status.\n  That policy has strong support in Congress. It was Richard Lugar, a \nRepublican from Indiana, who joined me 2 years ago in writing to \nPresident Obama to ask him to do this. Last year Senator Lugar and I \nwere joined by 20 other Senators who stood together with us, including \nmajority leader Harry Reid, Judiciary Committee chairman Patrick Leahy, \nand Senator Bob Menendez.\n  According to recent polls, the American people think the President \nmade the right decision. For example, a Bloomberg poll found that 64 \npercent of likely voters, including 66 percent of Independents, support \nthe President's policy on DREAM Act students compared to 30 percent--\nless than half--who oppose it.\n  Some Republicans outside Congress have also expressed support. For \nexample, Mark Shurtleff, the attorney general of Utah, said:\n\n       This is clearly within the president's power. I was pleased \n     when the president announced it . . . until Congress acts, \n     we'll be left with too many people to deport. The \n     administration is saying, Here's is a group we can be \n     spending our resources going after, but why? They're \n     Americans, they see themselves as Americans, they love this \n     country!\n\n  Mark Shurtleff, Attorney General of Utah.\n  It is easy to criticize the President's policy on the DREAM Act in \nthe abstract. What I have tried to do on a regular basis is to \nintroduce those who follow the Senate proceedings to the actual \nstudents who are affected by this.\n  One of them is Kelsey Burke. Kelsey was brought to the United States \nfrom Honduras at the age of 10. Her family settled in Lake Worth, FL, \nwhere she started school in the sixth grade. By the time she was in \neighth grade, she was taking advanced placement classes. She was \naccepted into the Criminal Justice Magnet Program at Lake Worth High \nSchool. She developed a passion for the law and started to dream about \nbecoming an attorney. She continued to take honors classes and then \nenrolled in college at Palm Beach State College. She graduated from \nhigh school with a 3.4 GPA, a criminal justice certificate, and already \n15 college credits.\n  In 2008, Kelsey was granted temporary protected status which allows \nimmigrants to remain in the United\n\n[[Page S4814]]\n\nStates temporarily because it is unsafe for them to return to their \nhome country. With temporary protected status, Kelsey is able to work \nlegally, although she is still not eligible to stay here permanently or \nto become a citizen. After she began working, Kelsey was able to afford \ncollege. Keep in mind Kelsey and other DREAM Act students are not \neligible for Federal student loans or any other Federal financial aid. \nGoing to college for them is harder than it is for most kids.\n  While working full-time, Kelsey went to Florida Atlantic University, \ngraduating with a major in public communications and a minor in \nsociology. She was indeed the first member of her family to graduate \nfrom high school and college. She now works as a paralegal at a law \nfirm in Palm Beach County. She is very active in her community. She \nserves on the board of the Hispanic Bar Association, volunteers at the \nneighborhood community center, and coaches youth soccer. Her dream is \nto become a U.S. citizen, and she wants to be an attorney. Of course, \nnot being a citizen is an obstacle to her ever becoming a member of the \nlegal profession in this country. Here is what she said when she wrote \nto me:\n\n       I desire to help others pursue their passion, to fight for \n     their dreams, and to make a positive difference . . . Others \n     forgot where they came from and how their ancestors got here; \n     and what coming to America represents. I have been blessed \n     and want to use my knowledge and experience to help other \n     immigrant families.\n\n  I am a child of one of those immigrants. My mother was an immigrant \nto this country. I now have been honored to serve in the U.S. Senate, a \nfirst-generation American. I am proud of my mother's immigrant heritage \nand my heritage as well. In my office behind my desk is my mother's \nnaturalization certificate. At about age 23 she became a citizen. I \nkeep that certificate there as a reminder of my family roots and a \nreminder of this great country. It is the immigrant contribution to \nAmerica that adds to our diversity, gives us strength, and I think \nbrings a lot of special people to our shores who are willing to make \ngreat sacrifices to be part of this great Nation.\n  These young people affected by the DREAM Act were too young to make \nthat conscious decision, but the parents who brought them here weren't, \nand they were making that decision for them. Now we want these young \npeople to have a chance for their generation to make this a stronger \nNation. I ask my colleagues: Would we be better off if Kelsey were \nasked to leave? I don't think so. I think her having grown up in this \ncountry and overcome so many obstacles is an indication of what a \nstrong-willed and talented young woman she is. We need so many more \njust like her.\n  The President has given Kelsey and others some breathing space here \nwith his decision on the DREAM Act. Now it is time for us to accept the \nresponsibility not only to deal with the DREAM Act but also to deal \nwith the immigration question. We cannot run away from the fact that it \nis unresolved and has been for years. We need to work together on a \nbipartisan basis to make certain we have an immigration system that is \nfair, reasonable, and will continue to build this great Nation of \nimmigrants, bringing to the shores of this country those who have made \nsuch a difference in the past and will in the future.\n  I thank all of my colleagues, including the Presiding Officer, for \nhis strong support of the DREAM Act. The President's decision has given \nus a new opportunity to introduce these young people to America in a \nlegal, protected status on a renewable basis.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor for my colleague from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                           Ohio Manufacturing\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I so appreciate the leadership of \nSenator Durbin on the DREAM Act. Nobody has kept the DREAM Act alive \nmore than he, and nobody has spoken more passionately or cares more \nabout young people. The point of so much of what he is talking about is \ngiving people an opportunity. If they work hard and play by the rules, \nthey can get ahead in this country. While I do not come to the floor \ntoday to talk about immigration and the DREAM Act, I support what \nSenator Durbin is doing.\n  I come to speak about something else that is related to allowing \npeople to have the opportunity to get ahead, and that is Ohio \nmanufacturing and why it is so important to our country.\n  The best ticket to the middle class in the last 100 years in the \nState of Ohio and all over the country has been people making things. \nThe way to create wealth is to either mine it or grow it or make it. \nThe Presiding Officer in his State of Colorado understands all three of \nthose. In Colorado they mine ore, they grow crops, they make products, \nas they do in Ohio. Ohio is increasingly becoming an energy State in \nmany ways and a leading farm State. Our biggest industry in a sense in \nOhio is agriculture. We are also the No. 3 manufacturing State in the \nUnited States of America. Only Texas and Colorado produce more than \nOhio does. They are States two and three times our size in population \nand, in area, more than that.\n  We know that from 2000 to 2010, we lost one-third of the \nmanufacturing jobs in this country. We lost more than 5 million \nmanufacturing jobs, which disappeared, suffered tens of thousands of \nplant closings, thousands of communities abandoned or crippled, \nteachers laid off, librarians laid off, police and firemen laid off, \nfamilies broken because of these manufacturing job losses. More than \n15,000 manufacturing jobs were lost between 2000 and 2010. Since early \n2010, we now have 500,000 more jobs than we had in the early 2000s. In \nother words, for the first time in a decade, we are actually seeing \nmanufacturing job gains. A big part of that is what has happened to the \nauto industry.\n  I spent much of last week all over my State but especially visiting \nplaces in northern Ohio where manufacturing and especially auto \nmanufacturing is so important. I talked to business owners who are \ngrateful and enthusiastic about what happened with the auto rescue. The \nauto industry was literally dying in Ohio and across the country. At \nthis point 4 years ago, in late 2008 and early 2009, if the U.S. \nCongress, the President--the House and Senate--hadn't stepped in, my \nState would be in a depression. Since then, we are seeing major \ninvestments--in many cases hundreds of millions of dollars of \ninvestment--tens of millions spent on major investments in Toledo, OH, \nby Chrysler; major investments in Ohio by GM, major investments in Ohio \nby Ford, and major investments in Ohio by Honda. We all understand the \nauto industry is alive and well and coming back.\n  But many of these auto suppliers--companies that make brackets or \nbolts or wheel covers or glass or a number of other products that all \ngo into auto assembly--many of these manufacturers, including component \nmanufacturers of parts for the auto industry, talk about competing \nagainst China. For too long, they tell me--and I recognize--China has \nbeen manipulating its currency to give Chinese exports an unfair \nadvantage. The Chinese Government also gives illegal subsidies to their \ndomestic industries for the purpose of exporting and dumping products \nin the American market. The term ``dumping'' simply means they \nsubsidize it so the product itself is priced under the cost of \nproducing it. It is called dumping it in our market.\n  If that weren't enough, China skirted trade volume even further with \nillegal duties that affected more than 80 percent of U.S. auto exports \nto China, including Ohio-made vehicles such as Jeep, assembled in \nToledo, and Acura, assembled in Marysville. We can't afford to let \nChina take the wind out of our sails.\n  Last week, the day after Independence Day, the administration \nannounced it would stand with American workers and fight back against \nChina's discriminatory tariffs on American automobiles. When they use \nillegal international trade law--when they put illegal tariffs on \nAmerican products--it means the Chinese keep prices so high for \nAmerican-made autos--artificially high--the Chinese simply won't buy \nthem. Chinese motorists won't buy them. So they, in effect, by using \nthese tariffs, have kept American products made by American workers in \nthe United States of America, out of China. We buy so much from China. \nWe can buy products in almost any store in America that were made in \nChina. We buy so many of their products, but\n\n[[Page S4815]]\n\nthey do all they can--illegally in many cases--to keep our products \nout.\n  Now is the time to stand for American workers, to stand for suppliers \nin Dayton who provide aluminum and zinc for casting, workers in \nDefiance, OH, who specialize in heavy-gauge steel for our domestic \nautomobile industry. That is why the President's decision, the United \nStates Trade Representative's decision, aimed at defending American \njobs was so important. We know what rescuing the auto industry meant \nfor us. It was not only about preventing crises, but it could have been \nan economic depression, especially in the industrial Midwest. Hundreds \nof thousands of Ohioans depend on the auto industry: workers, \nsuppliers, manufacturers, drivers, truckers, sales representatives, \ndealerships.\n  For those of us in Congress who supported rescuing the auto industry, \ndoing so meant standing for the hundreds of thousands of Ohioans and \nhundreds and hundreds of thousands of Americans, as much as it was \nabout supporting the Big Three.\n  Today the domestic auto industry is back on course. GM is the leading \ncar company in the world. It is earning significant profits. As I said, \nplants in Toledo and Lordstown and Defiance are hiring workers. Honda, \nChrysler, Ford, GM, have all announced those various multimillion \ndollar investments in Ohio alone, not to mention many other States I \nnamed earlier.\n  We have to continue making the investments in manufacturing that \nmatter for our recovery and our economic competitiveness. I was just on \na conference call with rural housing advocates in Ohio. We know \nhistorically in this country what leads us out of depression: \nmanufacturing and housing. We are doing significantly better in \nmanufacturing. Remember earlier in my short little talk, that we lost 5 \nmillion manufacturing jobs from 2000 to 2010. We have gained 500,000 \nsince then, including in Ohio almost every single month over the last \n30 months or so. Manufacturing is doing its part to pull us out of this \nrecession. We have got to do better in housing. That is a subject for \nanother discussion. But the manufacturing part is so important.\n  One place we must remain vigilant is the enforcement of trade laws. \nThat is what the President is doing. We know that enforcing trade law \nis not just right for manufacturing, it is right for job creation. The \nInternational Trade Commission's ruling in December 2009 led to a \nbroader measure on imports to support domestic producers of steel pipe, \nsuch as V Star Steel in Youngstown. By addressing illegal Chinese \ntrade practices, this decision helped increase demand for domestic \nproduction. It played a significant role in V Star's decision to do \nsomething that people did not expect would happen anytime soon. V \nStar Steel made a decision to build a new $650 million seamless pipe \nmill in Youngstown, OH, bringing, I believe, about 1,000 building \ntrades jobs, building the structure of the plant, and now several \nhundred jobs as they begin production--a new steel plant in Youngstown, \nOH, one of the major steel-producing centers in the country that had \ncome on hard times, particularly in steel; a new steel mile in \nYoungstown, OH, because the President of the United States, because the \nInternational Trade Commission, because the Department of Commerce, \nbecause Congress pushed for it, actually enforced trade rules, and look \nwhat happened. So trade enforcement matters.\n  We also need to be vigilant in currency manipulation. Our trade \ndeficit in auto parts with China grew from about $1 billion 10 years \nago to almost $10 billion today. These massive illegal subsidies the \nChinese are engaging in are worsened by indirect predatory subsidies \nsuch as currency manipulation. That is why my legislation, the Currency \nExchange and Oversight Reform Act, the largest bipartisan jobs bill \nthat has passed the Senate in the last 2 years, is so important. It got \nmore than 70 votes in the Senate. Both parties supported it. The House \nof Representatives had passed a similar measure one other time. Now we \nare simply asking Speaker Boehner to schedule this bill for a vote. If \nit is scheduled for a vote, if the House votes on it, they will pass \nit, I would predict, with at least 300 votes, because large numbers of \nMembers of both parties want to see the House of Representatives move. \nThey voted for it before. We need Speaker Boehner to actually bring it \nto a vote.\n  It means standing for American jobs when China cheats. Without \naggressive enforcement of trade laws, this unlevel playing field will \ncost hundreds of thousands of American jobs. It is born from the \nrealization that stakes are too high for our workers, our \nmanufacturers, our economy if we do not fight back. We need an all-\nhands-on-deck approach, at the U.S. Trade Rep, at the Department of \nState, at the Department of Commerce, to be involved and more \naggressive, especially by initiating more trade actions.\n  We know our trade actions stabilized the auto industry. We know \nenforcement of trade law translates into steel jobs and paper jobs and \ntire jobs and other jobs. We know it is time to continue fighting for \nand investing in American manufacturing.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to SGT James \nSkalberg, Jr., who made the ultimate sacrifice on June 27, in Wardak \nProvince, Afghanistan. James was driving his vehicle when an improvised \nexplosive device detonated, injuring him fatally. My thoughts and \nprayers go out to his wife, Jessica, his son, Carter, his parents, \nJames and Kelli, and all his other family and friends who are grieving \nhis loss.\n  Sergeant Skalberg grew up an athlete. He graduated from Nishna Valley \nHigh School in Hastings, IA in 2005, and enlisted in the Army in 2007. \nJames deployed to Iraq with his unit in 2008 through 2009 and deployed \nagain to Afghanistan in 2011. His awards and decorations include the \nBronze Star Medal, Purple Heart, Army Commendation Medal, Army \nAchievement Medal, Army Service Ribbon, Overseas Service Ribbon, \nDriver's Badge, Air Assault Badge, and Combat Action Badge.\n  James is remembered by his family as having been loved by everyone \nfor being a gentleman in every respect. He was remembered by teachers \nand coaches as a star player and caring student. He was carefree, easy \ngoing, reliable, levelheaded, and loving. He was a family man who loved \nhis wife since they met as teenagers in high school, and his son, \nCarter, whom he hoped to one day teach to play basketball.\n  James was the kind of man we can be proud to call a native son of \nIowa. He stood as an example to others in his actions and his \ncharacter. We owe SGT James Skalberg, and others like him, our most \nsincere gratitude and appreciation for their willingness to make the \nultimate sacrifice for our great country. I call on my colleagues in \nthe Senate and every American to pay tribute to this brave American.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/10/senate-section/article/S4815-3", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4815-S4816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO NORTH CAROLINA AIR NATIONAL GUARD\n\n  Mr. THUNE.

Paul Mikeal, Maj. Joseph McCormick, Maj. Ryan David, and \nSenior Master Sgt. Robert Cannon were killed July 1 when their C-130 \nfirefighting plane crashed near Edgemont, SD, as they battled a large \nforest fire in the Black Hills.

CARL GANTER AND CIRCLE OF BLUE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I extend a hearty congratulations to J. \nCarl Ganter, director and founder of Circle of Blue in Traverse City, \nMI, on receiving the 2012 Rockefeller Foundation Innovation Award. \nInnovation and collaboration are two components critical to solving the \nchallenges we face as a State and as a nation. Organizations like \nCircle of Blue are leading the charge, helping to inform our \ndiscussions and to guide us on a path toward lasting, comprehensive \nsolutions.\n  Circle of Blue has focused its efforts on the global freshwater \ncrisis for more than a decade and has successfully united an \ninternational network of leading journalists, scientists, and data \nexperts to shed light on this issue and to illuminate a better path \nforward. This work has spurred meaningful, dynamic, and workable \nprocesses and information that are helping to solve real and pressing \nproblems for communities in need.\n  Through this effort, Circle of Blue has put forth enlightening \nreports on the nexus between water, food, and energy. Conducted both in \nChina and the United States, this integrated, cross-cutting work \ndemonstrates that current practices are not only environmentally \nunsustainable, but can be economically disruptive. In both instances, \nCircle of Blue has utilized this innovative approach to build broad \ncollaborations and solutions-focused processes that are charting a \ncourse toward a brighter future.\n  There is little doubt we live in a deeply interconnected world, and \nthe fundamental economic, social, and environmental challenges we face \nare linked. Under Ganter's able leadership, Circle of Blue has built a \nbreakthrough model of data collection, design, reporting, and convening \nthat places an emphasis on these linkages holistically. By facilitating \ncollaboration between policymakers, scientists, academics, businesses, \nand the general public, this organization is on the cutting edge of \ndeveloping processes to creatively implement these solutions. As Mr. \nGanter recently stated, ``We are listening better. We are becoming more \nnimble in how we work and collaborate. We are empowering people at all \nlevels with better information to make better decisions.''\n  By discerning emerging trends, highlighting solutions, and \nfacilitating meaningful collaboration, Circle Of Blue is a powerful \npartner in a number of areas. The Rockefeller Foundation Innovation \nAward is a tremendous honor, one this organization richly deserves. \nWhat is most clear to me is that the best has yet to come, and I look \nforward to the fruits their work will surely bear in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/10/senate-section/article/S4816-2", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4816-S4817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO TOM MAHR\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a truly \nexceptional member of my staff who recently departed after 22 years of \nservice in the Senate. Tom Mahr is one of the longest-serving members \nof my staff, and he has made invaluable contributions to important \ndebates and the drafting of key pieces of legislation in the Senate \nover the past 2 decades. He will be missed.\n  Like many staff members, Tom began his career on Capitol Hill as an \nintern. I tapped him to join my staff in January 1988 as a legislative \ncorrespondent. Tom excelled from the start, and it was not long after \nthat he began a steady path to increasing levels of responsibility. His \nfirst major effort as a banking legislative assistant was during the \nSavings and Loan bailout. He provided me with sound advice, and I was \none of only 8 Senators to vote against the bailout.\n  Tom left briefly to complete graduate school at Princeton; he \nrejoined my staff in 1991, working on a number of important issues, \nincluding what to do to help the economy. When I joined the Finance \nCommittee in 1993, Tom was assigned to work on trade issues. For North \nDakota, with its significant agricultural interests, ensuring fair \ntrade agreements and opening new markets for our products was vital. In \nthose days, the rapid rise in imports of wheat and barley from Canada \nwas negatively affecting farmers in North Dakota. Addressing this was a \ntop priority for me, and Tom was a key part of the effort. With his \nguidance and strategic advice, I was successful in getting the U.S. \nTrade Representative to negotiate an agreement under which the \nCanadians agreed not to flood our markets.\n  In the mid-1990s, Tom took over the health care portfolio in my \noffice. Health care was an integral part of the major budget battles \nthat took place then, when the Speaker of the House was proposing to \nslash Medicare spending to pay for tax cuts. Tom was deeply involved \nand assisted in staffing me on the Chafee-Breaux bipartisan group, \nwhich ultimately produced a bipartisan budget proposal in 1996 that \ngarnered 46 votes over the opposition of both leaders. Tom spearheaded \nMedicare and Medicaid changes, including improvements to rural Medicare \nprograms and securing reimbursement for telehealth services, that \nbecame part of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act. During that time I worked \nwith others to prevent budget legislation from block-granting nutrition \nprograms. Winning that amendment during consideration of the 1996 \nwelfare reform bill was an incredibly important legislative \naccomplishment, in terms of helping to protect the most vulnerable in \nour society, a priority that Tom has always had with his work on health \nand other issues.\n  In the summer of 1997, I was tasked by Leader Daschle to lead a \nDemocratic Senate task force to develop legislation to implement the \nproposed tobacco settlement between the State attorneys general and a \nnumber of private tobacco plaintiffs. Tom played an integral role in \ndeveloping that bill and negotiating improvements as it moved through \nthe Senate. That bill was seen as the gold standard for public health \nand it won key support from the White House.\n  In 1998, Tom became my legislative director, a position he held until \nJuly 6, 2012. I have relied on Tom's advice, counsel, and strategic \nthinking on so many key initiatives that I have advanced for both North \nDakota and the country. You name it, Tom was a part of it. He has been \na trusted advisor during key debates from the resolution authorizing \nthe war in Iraq that I voted against to budget and tax issues to \nMedicare prescription drugs and health reform. And he has led \nnegotiations on many critical bills that I have introduced or played a \nrole in developing.\n  Tom has proven himself as a strategic thinker when it comes to \nputting together the farm bill compromises necessary to achieve \nlegislative success in the Senate. He has worked tirelessly with other \nSenate offices during the critical stages of the last three farm bills \nto ensure the best possible outcomes for North Dakota, while also \naddressing the needs and concerns of other States.\n  On energy, Tom has a deep understanding of the challenges and \nopportunities our Nation faces. He was instrumental in my efforts with \nthe bipartisan energy group, the Gang of 10. It grew to 20, 10 \nDemocrats and 10 Republicans. Through our efforts, we were able to come \ntogether on a bipartisan, comprehensive energy package to reduce fuel \nprices, lessen our dependence on foreign energy, and strengthen our \neconomy. The New Energy Reform Act\n\n[[Page S4817]]\n\nlegislation produced by the group represented a true compromise, \nincorporating commonsense ideas, and it was fully offset. Tom could \nalways be counted on to think ahead, anticipate obstacles, and develop \nsolutions that were critical to reaching an agreement.\n  Tom is one of the smartest people I have ever had working for me, and \nhe has brought that knowledge and his sound judgment to so many \nsuccessful efforts. He is enormously talented, hard-working, dedicated, \nand incredibly loyal. And he has earned the greatest respect of other \nSenators, staff, and many constituents he has worked with through the \nyears.\n  Tom will be leaving my office to serve as policy director for \nMinority Whip Steny Hoyer in the U.S. House of Representatives. We are \nfortunate that he will continue using his incredible talent to serve \nthe public good. While I will miss him terribly, I am so pleased that \nhe has chosen to continue in service to Congress and our great Nation.\n  I am so grateful for the leadership Tom has provided in my office \nthese past 22 years. The country is very fortunate to have someone of \nhis caliber in public service. It is with deepest gratitude for his \nyears of service to me, the State of North Dakota, the Senate, and the \nNation that I wish him all the best in the next stage of his career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/10/senate-section/article/S4817-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL FREDERICK HODGES\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

His candor and ready accessibility to \nCongress ensured comprehensive support for the Army. Major General \nHodges handled some of the most complex and sensitive issues faced by \nthe Army in the last decade.\n  Throughout his career, Major General Hodges has been the consummate \nsoldier's soldier and is known for having an open mind and candor while \naddressing the issues affecting the Army today. He is a tremendous \nadvocate for soldiers both within the Pentagon and here on Capitol \nHill. His advice, counsel, and friendship have been very valuable to us \nin the Senate, and he will be sorely missed.\n  A native of Quincy, FL, Major General Hodges graduated from the U.S. \nMilitary Academy in May 1980 and was commissioned as a second \nlieutenant in the infantry. Following successful completion of the \nbasic course and Ranger School, he was assigned as a platoon leader and \ncompany executive officer in Germany. Upon return to the United States, \nMajor General Hodges commanded infantry units at the company, \nbattalion, and brigade levels in the 101st Airborne Division, AASLT. \nDuring his command of the ``Bastogne'' Brigade, Major General Hodges' \nleadership was instrumental in the successful invasion of Iraq during \nthe early stages of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Major General Hodges has also served in a variety of Army staff \npositions throughout his distinguished career. Ranging from tactics \ninstructor at the Infantry School to senior battalion observer/\ncontroller at the Joint Readiness Training Center, he has ensured that \nour soldiers are properly trained in their war-fighting functions. As a \nstaff officer, Major General Hodges has served as the aide-de-camp to \nthe Supreme Allied Commander Europe, chief of staff for the XVIIIth \nAirborne Corps, and director of the Pakistan/Afghanistan Coordination \nCell. Major General Hodges' operational assignments include deployments \nto both Iraq and Afghanistan as the assistant chief of staff, CJ3, \nMulti National Corps-Iraq and as the deputy commander for Stability, \nRegional Command South, International Security and Assistance Force, \nKandahar, Afghanistan. Throughout the various assignments and \ndeployments, Major General Hodges always accomplished his mission and \ncared for his soldiers, and took great care of the Army families under \nhis command.\n  We extend our heartfelt thanks to MG Ben Hodges, to his wife Holly, \nand to his children Ben and Madeline, for their dedication and service \nto the Nation. Words cannot characterize properly the extraordinary \ncharacter of Major General Hodges's accomplishments.\n  The Nation thanks him and wishes him success and happiness in his \nnext assignment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/10/senate-section/article/S4817-2", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO MR.

Through its outstanding\n\n[[Page S4818]]\n\nclinical care, research and education, CCHMC serves children and \nfamilies in the greater Cincinnati community and has improved child \nhealth around the Nation and throughout the world.\n  Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center has grown significantly \nover the past 127 years, becoming one of the five largest employers in \nthe region. Not only does the hospital provide outstanding patient \ncare, but it is also responsible for many medical and research \nbreakthroughs that have changed medicine forever.

Mr. President, the Height of Land in Maine's \nRangeley Lakes Region is a crown jewel among my State's abundant \nnatural treasures. The panorama of lakes and mountains, streams and \nvalleys, offered by this lofty perch in the Western Mountains, is among \nthe most spectacular sights in New England.\n  I rise today to congratulate a remarkable group of local citizens, \nthe Rangeley Lakes Heritage Trust, for their hard work and commitment \nover more than 2 decades to protect and preserve this extraordinary \nplace and to make it accessible to all. The Height of Land Overlook on \nthe Rangeley Lakes National Scenic Byway, officially dedicated on July \n15, 2012, demonstrates the great partnership they have formed with \nState and Federal Government, conservation organizations, businesses, \nand neighbors to achieve lasting accomplishments.\n  Since the Rangeley Lakes Heritage Trust was formed in 1991, it has \nconserved more than 12,800 acres of land, including 45 miles of lake \nand river frontage, 15 islands, and the commanding 2,443-foot Bald \nMountain, so that these features might be accessed and enjoyed by \nresidents and visitors forever. The Height of Land Overlook has \nconverted a narrow and dangerous corridor into a spacious, safe, and \nwelcoming place for inspiration and reflection.\n  To complete this outstanding project, the Rangeley Lakes Heritage \nTrust brought together a wide range of people and organizations into a \ncommon cause. It overcame the boundaries between towns, bridged the \ndivide between government agencies, and worked collaboratively with the \nprivate sector. The commitment by the Maine Department of \nTransportation is especially commendable.\n  In 2009, I was pleased to help secure $2.9 million in U.S. Department \nof Transportation funding for this important project. It is essential \nthat the Federal Government be a strong member of partnerships to \npreserve our natural treasures, enhance recreation, promote economic \ngrowth, and help protect the environment. The Height of Land Overlook \nand the conservation walk that will be completed next spring will help \nmake this area a national destination.\n  Sir Edmund Hillary said that, ``People do not decide to become \nextraordinary. They decide to accomplish extraordinary things.'' Like \nthat famous mountaineer, the citizens who came together to establish \nthe Rangeley Lakes Heritage Trust had a lofty goal. They not only \nreached the summit, they went far beyond. Their amazing success speaks \nvolumes about the commitment that the people of Maine have to preserve \nour special places and to share them with all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/10/senate-section/article/S4818-2", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4818-S4819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MICHAEL N. CASTLE TRAIL\n\n Mr. COONS. Mr. President, yesterday we recognized the vision \nand tireless efforts of former Congressman Mike Castle of Delaware to \ndevelop a recreational trail along the Chesapeake and Delaware--or \nC and broke ground for its construction.\n  The C Canal, managed by the Philadelphia District of the Army Corps \nof Engineers, has been in operation since 1829. Today it is one of the \nbusiest working waterways in the world, with over 25,000 vessels \npassing through it each year. The canal is a critical commercial \nwaterway serving the ports of Wilmington, Baltimore, and Philadelphia. \nThe C Canal is bordered by a 16-mile stretch of flat, uninterrupted \nland, perfect for a trail, and surrounded by more than 7,500 acres of \npublic land, creating a unique and safe environment for recreationists. \nIn 2004 Congressman Castle saw these assets as an ideal opportunity to \nenhance the canal's existing resources by adding a recreational trail.\n  Under Congressman Castle's leadership, a working group was formed in \n2004 with representatives from the State of Delaware, New Castle \nCounty, the Army Corps, Delaware City, Chesapeake City, the State of \nMaryland, and recreation groups. In 2005 and 2006 public workshops were \nheld to solicit ideas and comments from local residents regarding \npotential recreational uses along the C Canal. In March 2006 a \nconcept plan was completed by the working group, recommending the \ncreation of a recreational trail along the canal to be used by walkers, \njoggers, cyclists, and equestrians. In 2007 design work for the trail \nbegan and environmental assessments were completed, and in 2009 trail \ndesign was completed.\n  Congressman Castle was instrumental in obtaining resources for the \ntrail. In addition to supporting efforts to acquire state and local \nfunding, he also secured a total of $2.2 million in public lands \nhighways discretionary awards in fiscal years 2008, 2009, and 2010 from \nthe Federal Highway Administration to go toward planning and \nconstruction of the trail.\n  Congressman Castle's vision and years of work to build a trail along \nthe C Canal were not forgotten when he left office. Recognizing the \ntremendous benefits that could be realized by the trail, the delegation \npicked up the project where Castle left off. Since then, the delegation \nhas worked with the Federal Highway Administration, the State of \nDelaware, New Castle County, the recreation community, and others to \nreinvigorate the working group and secure additional funding to build \nthe first phase of the recreational trail along the banks of the \nChesapeake and Delaware Canal.\n  The recreational trail along the C Canal will provide a common link \nto communities across the States of Delaware and Maryland from \nChesapeake City to Delaware City. It will create a safe and inviting \nrecreational opportunity along the canal and will bring families and \nother groups to hike, bicycle, jog, skate, or ride horseback along the \ntrail. Local business, including restaurants and shops, will reap the \nbenefits of this increased tourism to the area. The C Canal trail \nwill also support healthy lifestyles through outdoor recreation. The \ntrail will improve safety along the canal and increase the appeal and \nland value of residential developments in the area. The C Canal \nrecreation trail will be an attractive asset for the Middletown, \nOdessa, and Townsend region that will draw new residents to the area.\n  Congressman Castle long ago embraced the notion that the C Canal is \nlike an emerald necklace draped across the northern portion of our \nbeautiful State, and we are so very pleased that this jewel will be \nnamed after our dear friend.\n  Yesterday, the Delaware Department of Transportation broke ground on \nphase I of the recreational trail. This first phase will complete \napproximately 9 miles of the trail from Delaware City to just beyond \nSummit Marina in Delaware, including the construction of two trail \nheads, parking areas, and comfort stations.\n  Honoring Congressman Mike Castle's longtime support of recreational \nand commuter-oriented greenways and trails in Delaware and across the \nNation, as well as his vision, leadership,\n\n[[Page S4819]]\n\nand steadfast support of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal trail, the \nDelaware delegation hereby dedicates the trail to him and officially \nrecognizes the name as the ``Michael N. Castle Trail at the C \nCanal.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/10/senate-section/article/S4819-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING RICHARD BAUER\n\n Mr. CRAPO.

Dick owned the business for 22 years and was recognized as \na dedicated member of the community. Prior to moving to American Falls \nin 1963, Dick Bauer studied economics at Westminster College in Salt \nLake City, Utah, served in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in Germany \nin 1954-1956 and married his wife of 55 years, Lois Saathoff.\n  Throughout his life, he devoted considerable time to community \nservice and served in leadership roles on numerous boards, commissions \nand organizations. This includes his service on the Power County \nAirport Board, the Idaho Board of Aeronautics and the Board of \nDirectors of the Idaho Housing and Finance Association. He was also a \ncommitted Lutheran, who was actively involved in Lutheran churches in \nhis communities, and he was a member of the Board of Regents of Pacific \nLutheran University in Tacoma, Washington.\n  His efforts in the Republican Party included his service as national \ncommitteeman; State party chair, secretary and treasurer; county, \nregional and district chairman; mentor to political candidates; and \nmember of the Ada County Lincoln Day Association. He also served as an \nelector for President Reagan and Vice-President Bush. President George \nH.W. Bush appointed Dick to serve as Regional Administrator for Region \nX of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n  Dick Bauer leaves behind a legacy of devoted service. He was a person \nthat people turned to for assistance and leadership, and he touched the \nlives of many people. I extend my deep condolences to his wife, Lois, \nand their family.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 150th \nanniversary of the Richland County Fair. I am proud to honor this \ncelebration and all that this event has contributed to the State of \nWisconsin.\n  The Richland County Agricultural Society was founded in 1857 with the \nmission to improve ``the character and operation of the agricultural, \nmechanical, and household arts.'' In order to achieve its mission, \nlater that year it sponsored a cattle show and fair. The success of \nthat first cattle show led the organization to purchase the fairground, \nwhich has allowed them to evolve and continue to sponsor this popular \nfair for the next 100 years. Since the original fair in 1857, year in \nand year out, organizers have proudly showcased the beauty, simplicity, \nand fortitude of rural Wisconsin life; the only years the fairs were \nnot held were during the four summers of our Nation's Civil War. After \nturning over the fairground and buildings to Richland County in 1957, \nthis landmark celebration became officially known as the Richland \nCounty Fair. For 150 years, the Richland County Fair has built upon the \nfoundation of recognition of the agricultural, mechanical, and \nhousehold arts that truly represent the beauty of Wisconsin.\n  While Wisconsin's agriculture has changed since the mid-19th century, \nthe fun of the fair traditions has not. It is through events like these \nthat our communities come together to celebrate Wisconsin's unique \nofferings, culture, and traditions. It has stood the test of good and \nbad economies and serves as a reminder of our dairy and farming \nheritage. In recent years, the fair has provided entertainment to the \ncitizens of Richland County and visitors by holding tractor pulls, \nmagic shows, music concerts, games, and rides. With a rich, illustrious \nhistory, the Richland County Fair rings in its sesquicentennial \nanniversary and will no doubt head into many future fairs that build \nupon a wonderful community legacy. I am proud to have the opportunity \nto honor this event and honor the spirit of celebration that the \nRichland County Fair brings to the great State of Wisconsin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/10/senate-section/article/S4819-3", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4819-S4820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF \n                                UTAH 4-H\n\n Mr. LEE. Mr. President, Thomas Jefferson once wrote in a \nletter to George Washington: ``Agriculture is our wisest pursuit, \nbecause it will in the end contribute most to real wealth, good morals, \nand happiness.'' Before their faces were chiseled into monuments and \nprinted on dollar bills, many of the patriots who founded our Nation \nand who fought and died for the freedoms we cherish were simple \nfarmers. Washington, Jefferson, and others like them were doing much \nmore than just growing food to live off of; they were laying the \ngroundwork for a culture of self-reliance that played a role in \nAmerica's fight for independence and its sustained growth over the past \n200 years. While technology has changed the focus of our economy from \nagriculture to a variety of other sectors, it is crucial that we \nremember the principles set forth by our Founders. For the past 100 \nyears, the 4-H Club of Utah has provided youth with the opportunity to \ncultivate and continue our Nation's rich agricultural heritage while \nsimultaneously training them in the technologies and advancements of \nthe future. Thus, Utah 4-H's centennial theme--``Celebrating the Past, \nCreating the Future''--is particularly pertinent. I find it appropriate \nto commemorate Utah 4-H at its centennial in the halls and records of \nCongress.\n  The four H's stand for Head, Heart, Hands and Health. The head \nrepresents the quest for knowledge, the heart symbolizes love and \nservice to others, hands signify hard work and the development of \ndiligence, and health emphasizes the importance of healthy habits and a \nhealthy lifestyle. While the educational arm of the program was \noriginally centered in farm communities, the program has extended far \nbeyond that with over a third of its members living in metropolitan and \nsuburban areas. Roughly the same percent of members represent minority \npopulations.\n  The express mission of 4-H is to ``engage youth to reach their \nfullest potential while advancing the field of youth development,'' and \nas its motto states, ``to make the best better.'' The 4-H of Utah \nstrives to broaden horizons and connect participating youth with \ngreater opportunities than would otherwise be available to them. \nScholarships are offered to high school seniors and college students in \nneed to allow them to take their 4-H education and skills to college \nand beyond.\n  The 4-H Club was established in Utah in 1912 but its roots run much \ndeeper--back to the 1888 founding of the ``Agricultural College of \nUtah,'' which is now known as Utah State University. The purpose of the \n4-H Club was to educate youth about new agricultural technology so that \nthey might pass them to their own farm communities and improve the \nState's agricultural industry. By 1931, Utah's 4-H Club was declared to \nbe the fastest growing in the Nation, and now in 2012, it serves over \n75,000 youth. From holding a strict focus on agriculture, cooking, and \nhome economics, 4-H has grown and now offers over a thousand programs \nranging from robotics to skateboarding. The program has succeeded in \nlarge part due to the dedication of a group of volunteers who are \npassionate about the work of 4-H. I commend and express gratitude to \nthe 9,500 current 4-H volunteers, and the tens of thousands that came \nbefore them. I owe Utah 4-H a personal debt of gratitude, as my own \nchief of staff, Spencer Stokes, is a program alumnus who has brought \nskills and principles he learned in 4-H to his leadership role in my \noffice.\n  The world is no longer a simple place for the youth of our Nation. \nThey face a cloudy economic horizon with an excess of workers competing \nfor a dearth of jobs. 4-H gives participating youth a tremendous \nadvantage and competitive edge from a young age--helping them build \nhealthy relationships, cultivate fruitful habits and hobbies, and learn \nskills to take into their communities and industries. 4-H has played a \ntremendous role in making Utah a better\n\n[[Page S4820]]\n\nplace for our youth and making our youth better contributors to our \ncommunities around the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/10/senate-section/article/S4820-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JIM SUTTON\n\n Mr. LEE. Mr. President, the United States Air Force has always \nbeen on the cutting edge of technology, ensuring the safety of \nAmericans from a wide variety of threats. The advancement and \nsustainment of this technology has come as a result of the hard work of \nvisionary leaders in research and intelligence sectors of the United \nStates Armed Services. One of these visionary leaders is Jim Sutton, \nthe Director of Plans and Programs for the Ogden Air Logistics Center \nat Hill Air Force Base. After an honorable and decorated career, Jim is \nretiring from public service. I wish to honor him today.\n  The Ogden Air Logistics Center is one of the United States foremost \nwarfighter sustainment organizations, with management and maintenance \nresponsibilities for some of the world's most advanced weapons systems. \nTheir motto is ``Innovative leaders for the defense technologies of the \nfuture; combining action and quality to ensure the systems you depend \non are done right!'' Jim Sutton has served as the director of Plans and \nPrograms at the Ogden Air Logistics Center. During his tenure, he has \nturned the center into a model of fiscal responsibility and efficiency. \nJim also oversaw the Enhanced Use Lease Program Management Office, \nwhich manages real estate transactions authorized by the Department of \nDefense Leasing Authority. I should note that Hill's Enhanced Use Lease \nProgram Management office is the largest in the country. During his \ntenure as director he simultaneously served as a crucial advisor to the \nUtah Defense Alliance, where his colleagues note his instrumental \nleadership role during the Base Realignment and Closure act of 2005. \nOne of Jim's crowning achievements at Hill is Falcon Hill, a state of \nthe art National Aerospace Research Park located within the base \nitself.\n  Jim's career began long before he joined the directorate at the Ogden \nAir Logistics Center. His active duty began over 30 years ago in 1980. \nDuring that time he served in important judicial advocacy positions at \nthe Los Angeles Air Force Base, the United States Air Forces European \nHeadquarters in Germany, the Pentagon, San Antonio Contracting Center, \nPeterson Air Force Base in Colorado, Andrews Air Force Base in \nMaryland, Air Force Materiel Command at Wright Patterson Air Force Base \nand Scott Air Force base in Illinois. He has received several awards \nand commendations, including the Air Force Commendation Medal in 1983, \nfive Meritorious Service Medals, the Albert M. Kuhlfeld Award for \nOutstanding Young Judge Advocate in both 1986 and 1990, the Outstanding \nCareer Judge Advocate in 1996, the Stuart Reichart Award for \nOutstanding Senior Attorney in 1999, and the Outstanding Achievement \nAward for work from 2001-2003.\n  On a more personal level, coworkers describe Jim as a man of \nintegrity, who fought for causes important to Utah and to the \nadvancement and sustainment of Air Force technology. He has been a \ntremendous ally between the armed services and the state of Utah, \nworking closely with Utah's congressional delegation in the advancement \nand progress of Hill Air Force Base. He has made it his personal \nmission to both sustain the viability of Hill Air Force Base and fight \nfor its continued advancement. The base is now one of the top employers \nin Utah, providing jobs for over 23,000 Utahns. He has brought \ntremendous military credibility and knowledge to the state of Utah and \nwill remain a respected and beloved authority to Utah's armed services \ncommunity.

Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity \nto celebrate 125 Years of United Way, the world's largest privately \nsupported non-profit with 1,800 communities based throughout 41 \ncountries and territories.\n  In 1887, a group of Denver community leaders recognized the need for \ncooperative action to address their city's problems. They created an \norganization to collect funds for local charities, and to coordinate \nrelief services, counsel, and make emergency assistance grants. This \ncommunity establishment sparked a national movement that ultimately \nbecame the world's leading community impact organizations.\n  Over the last 125 years, United Way has worked collaboratively with \ncommunities in the U.S. and around the globe, enabling individuals to \nachieve their maximum human potential through education and financial \nstability.\n  In my home State, the United Way of Central Maryland has had a \nsignificant impact on the lives of my constituents. Each year, over \n33,000 Marylanders receive nutritious meals, and 7,000 are provided \nwith housing. Nearly 200 Maryland youths received scholarships this \nyear, and 600 were provided with school readiness services. The \nresources provided by United Way of Central Maryland have assisted each \nand every kind of problem my constituents face--from helping a single \nfather of two children get employment, to providing the necessary \ntreatment and funding for a local woman with advanced heart disease.\n  United Way is known for its successful partnerships. One example \nincludes the collaboration between United Way and the Alliance of \nInformation and Referral Systems resulted in the successful petitioning \nof the Federal Communications Commission to designate the telephone \nnumber ``211'' for health and human services information and referral. \nPartnerships with corporations such as MTV and CNN, along with 120 \nUnited Ways Global Corporate Leadership Companies, and the \nestablishment of the United Way Financial Stability Partnership, have \nallowed United Way to be an extraordinary contributor to thousands of \ncommunities in this country and abroad.\n  Since its inception, United Way has led disaster response in crises \naround the globe. In response to the terrorist attacks of 9/11, the \nUnited Way of New York City and the New York Community Trust \nestablished the September 11th Fund to mobilize financial resources for \nthe needs of the individuals impacted by the tragedies. It raised an \nastounding $425 million. Three years later, in response to the tsunami \nthat stuck Southeast Asia, The United Way Coordinated Crisis Response \nTeam worked with United Way communities around the world to respond to \nthe nations impacted by the disaster.\n  The invaluable impact of the United Way and its associates is without \nquestion. On behalf of myself, and speaking for the countless \nindividuals and communities that have regained their strengths and \nlived better lives due to this organization, I would like to \ncongratulate United Way on 125 years of extraordinary global \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/10/senate-section/article/S4820-3", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4820-S4821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NORTHWEST KIDNEY CENTERS\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Northwest \nKidney Centers on its 50th anniversary and to commemorate the \norganization's service and dedication to kidney patients in my home \nState of Washington.\n  In 1960, Dr. Belding Scribner, a University of Washington researcher, \ncreated the Teflon shunt, a medical device that allowed patients \nsuffering from kidney disease access to ongoing dialysis treatments. \nThis invention paved the way for the creation of the Northwest Kidney \nCenters, the first out-of-hospital dialysis organization in the world.\n  Since opening its doors on January 8, 1962, the Northwest Kidney \nCenters has grown into a national leader in the field of patient care, \neducation, research, and prevention. It is now the largest community-\nbased, nonprofit dialysis provider in the country--providing \napproximately 25 percent of Washington State's dialysis patients in 14 \ncenters and 12 local hospitals in King and Clallam Counties. Last year \nNorthwest Kidney Centers served nearly 1,500 patients and trained and \nsupervised 200 patients in self-treatment at\n\n[[Page S4821]]\n\nhome. All together, the organization provided 226,000 dialysis \ntreatments in our home State.\n  The organization regularly outperforms the Nation in clinical \nquality, with higher survival rates, more kidney transplants, and lower \nhospitalization rates. Moreover, Northwest Kidney Centers founded and \nstill operates the Nation's first nonhospital retail pharmacy \nspecializing in medications for kidney patients. The organization also \nmanages unique special care units for very frail patients, thus \navoiding hospitalizations and reducing costs.\n  Northwest Kidney Centers is a shining example of what it means to be \na community-based organization. Each year Northwest Kidney Centers \ninvests millions of dollars in the community with a variety of \nprograms: charity care and uncompensated dialysis; training of kidney \nphysicians; and services for predialysis patients and transplant \nrecipients.\n  Finally, as we celebrate this historic 50-year milestone, I would \nlike to recognize the entire Northwest Kidney Centers community--\npatients, staff, donors, supporters, and volunteers--for their \ndedication and commitment to improving the lives of kidney patients in \nour State. I salute them for their remarkable achievements and \nsuccesses and look forward to the next 50 years of outstanding service \nand patient care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/10/senate-section/article/S4821-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  FLANDREAU SANTEE SIOUX TRIBE POW WOW\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 50th \nAnniversary of the Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe Pow wow in Flandreau, \nSD.\n  The Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe is located in Moody County and \ngained full recognition in 1934. Beginning in 1962, the Pow wow became \nan annual, cultural event. Originally, pow wows were a time for \nreligious ceremonies and the celebration of life. Held in the spring, \nit was a time for the community to come together to meet up with old \nfriends and make new ones. The Pow wow is still a community event used \nto strengthen and preserve the Native American culture for generations \nto come.\n  The rich culture of tradition is shown in the dancing, the clothing, \nthe food and the community that comes together every year for this \nunique and extraordinary event.\n  I wish to offer my congratulations to the members of the Flandreau \nSantee Sioux Tribe on this milestone anniversary and wish them \ncontinued prosperity in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/10/senate-section/article/S4821-2", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:44 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 2061.

A bill to authorize the Attorney General to award grants to \nState courts to develop and implement State court interpreter programs; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I introduce the State Court \nInterpreter Grant Program Act of 2012. This legislation would create a \nmodest grant program to provide much needed financial assistance to \nStates for developing and implementing effective State court \ninterpreter programs. This would help to ensure fair trials for \nindividuals with limited English proficiency.\n  States are already legally required, under Title VI of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964, to take reasonable steps to provide meaningful \naccess to court proceedings for individuals with limited English \nproficiency. Unfortunately, however, court interpreting services vary \ngreatly by State. Some States have highly developed programs. Others \nare trying to get programs up and running, but lack adequate funds. \nStill others have no interpreter certification program at all. It is \ncritical that we protect the constitutional right to a fair trial by \nadequately funding State court interpreter programs.\n  Our States are finding themselves in an impossible position. \nQualified interpreters are in short supply because it is difficult to \nfind individuals who are both bilingual and well-versed in legal \nterminology. The skills required of a court interpreter differ \nsignificantly from those required of other interpreters or translators. \nLegal English is a highly particularized area of the language and \nrequires special training. Although anyone with fluency in a foreign \nlanguage could attempt to translate a court proceeding, the best \ninterpreters are those that have been tested and certified as official \ncourt interpreters.\n  Making the problem worse, States continue to fall further behind as \nthe number of Americans with limited English proficiency and therefore \nthe demand for court interpreter services continues to grow. According \nto the most recent Census data, 21 percent of the population over age \nfive speaks a language other than English at home. In 2010, the number \nof people in this country who spoke English less than ``very well'' was \nmore than 25 million, compared to 23 million in 2005. In 2010, New York \nhad almost 2.5 million. Texas had nearly 3.4 million. California had \nalmost 6.9 million.\n  The shortage of qualified interpreters has become a national problem, \nand it has serious consequences. In Pennsylvania, a committee \nestablished by the state Supreme Court called the State's interpreter \nprogram ``backward,'' and said that the lack of qualified interpreters \n``undermines the ability of the . . . court system to determine facts \naccurately and to dispense justice fairly.'' When interpreters are \nunqualified, or untrained, mistakes are made. The result is that the \nfundamental right to due process is too often lost in translation, and \nbecause the lawyers and judges are not interpreters, these mistakes \noften go unnoticed.\n  Some of the stories associated with this problem are simply \nunbelievable. In Pennsylvania, for instance, a husband accused of \nabusing his wife was asked to translate as his wife testified in court. \nIn Ohio, a woman was wrongly placed on suicide watch after an \nunqualified interpreter mistranslated her words. In testimony before \nthe Judiciary Committee, Justice Kennedy described a particularly \nalarming situation where bilingual jurors can understand what the \nwitness is saying and then interrupt the proceeding when an interpreter \nhas not accurately represented the witness' testimony. Justice Kennedy \nagreed that the lack of qualified court interpreters poses a \nsignificant threat to our judicial system,\n\n[[Page S4824]]\n\nand emphasized the importance of addressing the issue.\n  This legislation does just that by authorizing $10 million per year, \nover 5 years, for a State Court Interpreter Grant Program. The bill \ndoes not merely send Federal dollars to States to pay for court \ninterpreters. It will provide much needed ``seed money'' for States to \nstart or bolster their court interpreter programs to recruit, train, \ntest, and certify court interpreters. Those States that apply would be \neligible for a $100,000 base grant allotment. In addition, $5 million \nwould be set aside for States that demonstrate extraordinary need, \ndetermined by the percentage of persons in that State over the age of 5 \nwho speak a language other than English at home and who identify as \nspeaking English less than very well. This legislation also directs the \nDepartment of Justice to prioritize funding for any State that does not \nhave and has not begun to develop a qualified court interpreter \nprogram. In this way, the States most in need will benefit from the \ngrant program.\n  Some will undoubtedly question whether this modest amount can make a \ndifference. It can, and my home State of Wisconsin is a perfect example \nof that. When Wisconsin's court interpreter program got off the ground \nin 2004, using State money and a $250,000 Federal grant, certified \ninterpreters were scarce. Now, 8 years later, the court's public \nregistry of interpreters lists 114 certified interpreters. Most of \nthese are certified in Spanish, where the greatest need exists. \nHowever, the State also has interpreters certified in sign language, \nFrench and German. The list of qualified interpreters who have received \ntraining and attained requisite scores on an oral assessment includes \n56 individuals who speak Russian, Hmong, Korean, Bulgarian, Polish and \nmany other languages. All of this progress in only 8 years, and with \nonly $250,000 of Federal assistance.\n  This bill includes cost saving measures to ensure funding is spent \nwisely. For example, it provides for remote interpretation services to \nfacilitate certified court interpretations when costs prohibit in-\nperson interpretations. These services help cover the cost of \ninterpreter transportation fees. Additionally, the bill encourages \nStates to share successful cost saving programs with other States and \ndefines an effective court interpreter program as one that \n``efficiently uses funding to create substantial cost savings.'' To \nmake certain grants are being used in the most resourceful manner, the \nDepartment of Justice is required to submit an annual report to \nCongress detailing where and how the funding was spent.\n  This legislation has the strong support of State court administrators \nand state Supreme Court justices around the country. Our States are \nfacing this difficult challenge, and Federal law requires them to meet \nit. Despite their noble efforts, many of them have been unable to keep \nup with the demand. It is time we lend them a helping hand. This is an \naccess issue, and no one should be denied justice or access to our \ncourts merely because of a language barrier. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to support this critical legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3365\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to deter the disclosure to the public of evidence or \ninformation on United States covert actions by prohibiting security \nclearances to individuals who make such disclosures; to the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today for a \nreason I never dreamed would be needed. Recently there has been a \nseries of articles published in the media that have described and in \nsome cases provided extensive details about highly classified \nunilateral and joint intelligence operations, including covert actions. \nTo describe these leaks as troubling and frustrating is by all \nstandards an understatement. They are simply inexcusable criminal acts \nthat must stop and must stop now. Our intelligence professionals, our \nallies and, most important, the American people deserve better than \nthis.\n  I understand there are ongoing efforts in the House and Senate of \nwhich I am a part to address these leaks through legislation and that \nthe Director of National Intelligence has implemented some \nadministrative steps to investigate these leaks. I support those \nefforts. But I also believe special attention needs to be drawn to \nunauthorized disclosures relating to covert actions, so today I have \nintroduced the Deterring Public Disclosure of Covert Action Act of \n2012.\n  This act will ensure that those who disclose or talk about covert \nactions by the United States will no longer be eligible for Federal \nGovernment security clearance. It is novel. It is very simple. If you \ntalk about covert actions you will have your clearance revoked and you \nwill never get another one.\n  This is not a bill that any Member should ever have to introduce. \nCovert actions are by their very definition supposed to be kept quiet. \nThose who engage in them, those who support them, and those who work to \nget them authorized all know that. Yet those rules, those very laws \nthat are supposed to protect classified information, are being \ndisregarded with few repercussions, even though each one of those leaks \nundermines the hard work of our intelligence officers, puts lives at \nrisk, and jeopardizes our relationship with overseas partners.\n  As I said in this Chamber last month, I strongly believe those \nleakers are violating the trust of the American people. Those who are \ngiven access to classified information, especially covert actions, are \ngiven the same responsibility we as Members have. As long as something \nis classified, you do not talk about it.\n  In other words, keep your mouth shut. Yet month after month, we see \narticles about covert actions that quote a wide range of U.S. \nofficials, mostly anonymously, and often senior administration \nofficials. While this act focuses on covert action, it in no way \nminimizes the importance of maintaining the secrecy of other types of \nclassified information. Those who leak any classified information \nshould no longer be trusted with our Nation's secrets. But I believe \nthe damage that is being done to our covert action programs by these \nleaks deserves special attention today.\n  The act also ensures that any determination that an individual has \nleaked information about a covert action will be made only in \naccordance with the applicable law or regulation. In short, no one will \nlose his clearance without appropriate due process. I believe that is \nan important requirement, as losing clearance often means losing your \nlivelihood.\n  Today I am taking one step to silence those who may have done \nirreparable harm by putting their own personal agendas above their \ncolleagues and, most importantly, their country. We cannot afford to \nwait for more leaks or more compromised covert actions.\n  The bill I have introduced today may target only one part of the \nproblem, but I believe it is an essential part of a solution. I urge my \ncolleagues in the days and weeks to come to be supportive of this piece \nof legislation. I think it is a small thing to ask of those who are \nentrusted with our Nation's most important secrets, that they actually \nkeep them secret or we take that ability away to be entrusted with that \ninformation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/10/senate-section/article/S4825-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2490.

Such authority shall commence beginning no \n     earlier than the first day of the calendar quarter that is at \n     least 6 months after the date that the State enacts \n     legislation to exercise the authority granted by this title \n     and to implement each of the following minimum simplification \n     requirements:\n       (A) Provide--\n       (i) a single entity within the State responsible for all \n     State and local sales and use tax administration, including \n     return processing and audits for remote sales sourced to the \n     State,\n       (ii) a single audit of remote sellers for all State and \n     local taxing jurisdictions within that State, and\n       (iii) a single sales and use tax return to be used by \n     remote sellers and single and consolidated providers and to \n     be filed with the single entity within the State.\n       (B) Provide a uniform sales and use tax base among the \n     State and the local taxing jurisdictions within the State.\n       (C) Source all interstate sales in compliance with the \n     sourcing regime set forth in section __6(8).\n       (D) Provide--\n       (i) adequate software and services to remote sellers and \n     single and consolidated providers that identifies the \n     applicable destination rate, including the State and local \n     sales tax rate (if any), to be applied on sales sourced to \n     the State, and\n       (ii) certification procedures for both single providers and \n     consolidated providers to make software and services \n     available to remote sellers, and hold such providers harmless \n     for any errors or omissions as a result of relying on \n     information provided by the State.\n       (E) Relieve remote sellers from liability to the State or \n     locality for the incorrect collection or remittance of sales \n     or use tax, including any penalties or interest, if the \n     liability is the result of an error or omission made by a \n     single or consolidated provider.\n       (F) Relieve single and consolidated providers from \n     liability to the State or locality for the incorrect \n     collection or remittance of sales or use tax, including any \n     penalties or interest, if the liability is the result of \n     misleading or inaccurate information provided by a seller.\n       (G) Relieve remote sellers and single and consolidated \n     providers from liability to the State or locality for the \n     incorrect collection or remittance of sales or use tax, \n     including any penalties or interest, if the liability is the \n     result of information provided by the State or locality.\n       (H) Provide remote sellers and single and consolidated \n     providers with 30 days notice of a rate change by the State \n     or any locality in the State.\n       (2) Treatment of local rate changes.--For purposes of this \n     subsection, local rate changes may only be effective on the \n     first day of a calendar quarter.

Mr. McCONNELL submitted an amendment intended to be proposed \nby him to the bill S. 2237, to provide a temporary income tax credit \nfor increased payroll and extend bonus depreciation for an additional \nyear, and for other purposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. REPEAL OF OBAMACARE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following with respect to \n     the impact of Public Law 111-148 and related provisions of \n     Public Law 111-152 (collectively referred to in this section \n     as ``the law''):\n       (1) President Obama promised the American people that if \n     they liked their current health coverage, they could keep it. \n     But even the Obama Administration admits that tens of \n     millions of Americans are at risk of losing their health care \n     coverage, including as many as 8 in 10 plans offered by small \n     businesses.\n       (2) Despite projected spending of more than two trillion \n     dollars over the next 10 years, cutting Medicare by more than \n     one-half trillion dollars over that period, and increasing \n     taxes by over $800 billion dollars over that period, the law \n     does not lower health care costs. In fact, the law actually \n     makes coverage more expensive for millions of Americans. The \n     average American family already paid a premium increase of \n     approximately $1,200 in the year following passage of the \n     law. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) predicts that \n     health insurance premiums for individuals buying private \n     health coverage on their own will increase by $2,100 in 2016 \n     compared to what the premiums would have been in 2016 if the \n     law had not passed.\n       (3) The law cuts more than one-half trillion dollars in \n     Medicare and uses the funds to create a new entitlement \n     program rather than to protect and strengthen the Medicare \n     program. Actuaries at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \n     Services (CMS) warn that the Medicare cuts contained in the \n     law are so drastic that ``providers might end their \n     participation in the program (possibly jeopardizing access to \n     care for beneficiaries)''. CBO cautioned that the Medicare \n     cuts ``might be difficult to sustain over a long period of \n     time''. According to the CMS actuaries, 7.4 million Medicare \n     beneficiaries who would have been enrolled in a Medicare \n     Advantage plan in 2017 will lose access to their plan because \n     the law cuts $206 billion in payments to Medicare Advantage \n     plans. The Trustees of the Medicare Trust Funds predict that \n     the law will result in a substantial decline in employer-\n     sponsored retiree drug coverage, and 90 percent of seniors \n     will no longer have access to retiree drug coverage by 2016 \n     as a result of the law.\n       (4) The law creates a 15-member, unelected Independent \n     Payment Advisory Board that is empowered to make binding \n     decisions regarding what treatments Medicare will cover and \n     how much Medicare will pay for treatments solely to cut \n     spending, restricting access to health care for seniors.\n       (5) The law and the more than 13,000 pages of related \n     regulations issued before July 11, 2012, are causing great \n     uncertainty, slowing economic growth, and limiting hiring \n     opportunities for the approximately 13 million Americans \n     searching for work. Imposing higher costs on businesses will \n     lead to lower wages, fewer workers, or both.\n       (6) The law imposes 21 new or higher taxes on American \n     families and businesses, including 12 taxes on families \n     making less than $250,000 a year.\n       (7) While President Obama promised that nothing in the law \n     would fund elective abortion, the law expands the role of the \n     Federal Government in funding and facilitating abortion and \n     plans that cover abortion. The law appropriates billions of \n     dollars in new funding without explicitly prohibiting the use \n     of these funds for abortion, and it provides Federal \n     subsidies for health plans covering elective abortions. \n     Moreover, the law effectively forces millions of individuals \n     to personally pay a separate abortion premium in violation of \n     their sincerely held religious, ethical, or moral beliefs.\n\n[[Page S4831]]\n\n       (8) Until enactment of the law, the Federal Government has \n     not sought to impose specific coverage or care requirements \n     that infringe on the rights of conscience of insurers, \n     purchasers of insurance, plan sponsors, beneficiaries, and \n     other stakeholders, such as individual or institutional \n     health care providers. The law creates a new nationwide \n     requirement for health plans to cover ``essential health \n     benefits'' and ``preventive services'', but does not allow \n     stakeholders to opt out of covering items or services to \n     which they have a religious or moral objection, in violation \n     of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (Public Law 103-\n     141). By creating new barriers to health insurance and \n     causing the loss of existing insurance arrangements, these \n     inflexible mandates jeopardize the ability of institutions \n     and individuals to exercise their rights of conscience and \n     their ability to freely participate in the health insurance \n     and health care marketplace.\n       (9) The law expands government control over health care, \n     adds trillions of dollars to existing liabilities, drives \n     costs up even further, and too often put Federal bureaucrats, \n     instead of doctors and patients, in charge of health care \n     decisionmaking.\n       (10) The path to patient-centered care and lower costs for \n     all Americans must begin with a full repeal of the law.\n       (b) Repeal.--\n       (1) PPACA.--Effective as of the enactment of Public Law \n     111-148, such Act (other than subsection (d) of section 1899A \n     of the Social Security Act, as added and amended by sections \n     3403 and 10320 of such Public Law) is repealed, and the \n     provisions of law amended or repealed by such Act (other than \n     such subsection (d)) are restored or revived as if such Act \n     had not been enacted.\n       (2) Health care-related provisions in the health care and \n     education reconciliation act of 2010.--Effective as of the \n     enactment of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act \n     of 2010 (Public Law 111-152), title I and subtitle B of title \n     II of such Act are repealed, and the provisions of law \n     amended or repealed by such title or subtitle, respectively, \n     are restored or revived as if such title and subtitle had not \n     been enacted.\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, I know of no further debate. I urge \npassage of the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the resolution.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 429), as amended, was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 429\n\n       Whereas April 25th of each year is recognized \n     internationally as World Malaria Day;\n       Whereas malaria is a leading cause of death and disease in \n     many developing countries, despite being completely \n     preventable and treatable;\n       Whereas fighting malaria is in the national security \n     interest of the United States Government, as reducing the \n     risk of malaria protects members of the Armed Forces of the \n     United States serving overseas in malaria endemic regions, \n     and reducing malaria deaths helps to promote stability in \n     less developed countries;\n       Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, 35 countries, the majority of which are in sub-\n     Saharan Africa, account for 98 percent of global malaria \n     deaths;\n       Whereas young children and pregnant women are particularly \n     vulnerable to and disproportionately affected by malaria;\n       Whereas malaria greatly affects child health, as children \n     under the age of 5 account for an estimated 85 percent of \n     malaria deaths each year;\n       Whereas malaria poses great risks to maternal health, \n     causing complications during delivery, anemia, and low birth \n     weights, with estimates that malaria infection causes 400,000 \n     cases of severe maternal anemia and between 75,000 and \n     200,000 infant deaths annually in sub-Saharan Africa;\n       Whereas heightened national, regional, and international \n     efforts to prevent and treat malaria over recent years have \n     made measurable progress and helped save hundreds of \n     thousands of lives;\n       Whereas the World Malaria Report 2011 by the World Health \n     Organization states that in 2011, approximately 50 percent of \n     households in sub-Saharan Africa owned at least 1 \n     insecticide-treated mosquito net (referred to in this \n     preamble as an ``ITN''), and household surveys indicated that \n     96 percent of people with access to an ITN within a household \n     actually used the ITN;\n       Whereas, in 2010, a total of 185,000,000 people were \n     protected by indoor residual spraying (referred to in this \n     preamble as ``IRS'');\n       Whereas the World Malaria Report 2011 further states that \n     malaria mortality rates have fallen by more than 25 percent \n     globally, and 33 percent in Africa alone, since 2000;\n       Whereas the World Malaria Report 2011 further states that \n     out of 99 countries with ongoing malaria transmissions, 43 \n     countries recorded decreases of more than 50 percent in the \n     number of malaria cases between 2000 and 2010, and 8 other \n     countries recorded decreases of more than 25 percent;\n       Whereas continued national, regional, and international \n     investment in efforts to eliminate malaria, including \n     prevention and treatment efforts and the development of a \n     vaccine to immunize children from the malaria parasite, is \n     critical in order to continue to reduce malaria deaths, \n     prevent backsliding in areas where progress has been made, \n     and equip the United States and the global community with the \n     tools necessary to fight malaria and other global health \n     threats;\n       Whereas the United States Government has played a leading \n     role in the recent progress made toward reducing the global \n     burden of malaria, particularly through the President's \n     Malaria Initiative (referred to in this preamble as ``PMI'') \n     and the contribution of the United States to the Global Fund \n     to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria;\n       Whereas the United States Government is pursuing a \n     comprehensive approach to ending malaria deaths through PMI, \n     the United States Agency for International Development, the \n     National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention, the Department of Defense, and the \n     private sector focused on helping partner countries to \n     achieve major improvements in overall health outcomes through \n     advances in access to, and the quality of, healthcare \n     services in resource-poor settings;and\n       Whereas PMI, recognizing the burden of malaria on many \n     partner countries, has set a target of reducing the burden of \n     malaria by 50 percent for 450,000,000 people, representing 70 \n     percent of the at-risk population in Africa, by 2015: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of World Malaria Day, \n     including the target of ending malaria deaths by 2015;\n       (2) recognizes the importance of reducing malaria \n     prevalence and deaths to improve overall child and maternal \n     health, especially in sub-Saharan Africa;\n       (3) commends the recent progress made toward reducing \n     global malaria deaths and prevalence, particularly through \n     the efforts of the President's Malaria Initiative and the \n     Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria;\n       (4) welcomes ongoing public-private partnerships to \n     research and develop more effective and affordable tools for \n     malaria diagnosis, treatment, and vaccination;\n       (5) recognizes the goals to combat malaria in the Tom \n     Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership \n     Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization \n     Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-293;122 Stat. 2918);\n       (6) supports continued leadership by the United States in \n     bilateral, multilateral, and private sector efforts to combat \n     malaria as a critical part of the President's Global Health \n     Initiative;and\n       (7) encourages other members of the international community \n     to sustain and scale up their support for and financial \n     contributions to efforts worldwide to combat malaria.\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nmotion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, and \nthat any statements relating to the resolution be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
