Mr. President, today the Supreme Court correctly struck \ndown the vast majority of the mean-spirited Arizona law; that is, of \ncourse, the immigration law. While I agree with the Court's decision to \ninvalidate three troubling provisions of Arizona's flawed law, there \nare actually four provisions. Three were declared unconstitutional, one \nwas upheld.\n  I am concerned about the section they upheld. I am surprised they \ndid, but they did. The Justices upheld a measure that allows police to \nconduct immigration checks on anyone they suspect of being in the \ncountry illegally, even if their only evidence is an accent or maybe \nthe color of their skin.\n  Allowing Arizona to keep its ``papers please'' system of immigration \nchecks invites racial profiling. It gives Arizona officials free rein \nto detain anyone they suspect of being in Arizona without \ndocumentation.\n  As long as this provision remains, innocent American citizens are in \ndanger of being detained by police unless they carry immigration papers \nwith them at all times. However, it is reassuring that the Court left \nthe door open to further court challenges of this unsound provision. I \nsay to the Presiding Officer and to anyone within the sound of my \nvoice, someone with my skin color or yours, I do not think we are going \nto be carrying our immigration papers with us everyplace we go.\n  But if someone is in Arizona and speaks with a little bit of an \naccent or their skin color is brown, they better have their papers with \nthem. That is unfortunate. It is reassuring that the Court, though, \nleft the door open to further court challenges of this very unsound \nprovision. I am optimistic that once that portion of the law is \nimplemented, it will be discarded.\n  Laws that legalize discrimination are not compatible with laws and \ntraditions of equal rights. So it is disturbing that Mitt Romney has \ncalled the unconstitutional Arizona law a model for immigration reform. \nAnyone who thinks such an unconstitutional law should serve as a model \nfor national reform is clearly outside the mainstream.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court agreed with that today. Today's partial \nvictory affirms the Obama administration was right to challenge this \nawful law, and it is a reminder that the ultimate responsibility for \nfixing our Nation's broken immigration system rests with Congress.\n  Instead of allowing 50 States to have 50 different enforcement \nmechanisms,\n\n[[Page S4434]]\n\nwe need a national solution that continues to secure the border, \npunishes unscrupulous employers that exploit immigrants and undercut \nAmerican wages, improves our dysfunctional legal immigration system, \nand requires the 11 million people who are undocumented to register \nwith the government, pay fines and taxes, learn English, work, stay out \nof trouble, and go to the end of the line to legalize their status.\n\n  Democrats are ready for this challenge. We have been willing to craft \na commonsense legal solution for a long time, one that is fair, tough, \nand practical. As I have indicated, we have been ready to do this for \nyears. We have tried on a few occasions. The problem now and has been, \nRepublicans will not vote for immigration reform--simple as that. We \nhave tried.\n  The first step would be to pass the DREAM Act, which would create a \npathway to citizenship for children brought to the country through no \nfault of their own. If upstanding young people stay out of trouble, \nwork hard in high school, they should have a chance to serve their \ncountry in the military, go to college, and work toward citizenship.\n  Unfortunately, Mitt Romney said he would veto that, the DREAM Act. \nPresident Obama, on the other hand, took decisive action in halting \ndeportation of the DREAMers. His directive will protect 800,000 young \npeople and focus law enforcement resources where they belong, on \ndeporting criminals.\n  As we all know, though, this is not a permanent solution. But \nPresident Obama's decision to defer these deportations was necessary \nprecisely because Republicans have so far refused to work with \nDemocrats on a solution. Congress must consider a long-term resolution \nto protect the DREAMers and tackle comprehensive immigration reform \nthat addresses all 11 million undocumented people living in this \ncountry.\n  But that will take cooperation from my Republican colleagues. That \nhas not been forthcoming. This week, we have a lot to accomplish, and \ngetting it all done before the July 4 holiday will also take \ncooperation. By Friday, the Senate must pass flood insurance that will \nallow millions of Americans to close on new homes or new properties. We \nmust send to the President a bill to ease drug shortages. That is the \nFDA bill. We need to protect 3 millions jobs with an agreement on \ntransportation legislation, and the deadline to stop student loan rates \nfrom doubling for 7 million students looms at the end of this week as \nwell.\n  I am putting my colleagues on notice that the Senate will stay as \nlong as we have to, into the weekend if necessary, to complete this \nsubstantial workload. We hope there will be cooperation not only in \nthis body but also in the House of Representatives. I alert everyone, \nwe have a lot to do--extremely important pieces of legislation. We have \nto complete them before we leave this week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/25/senate-section/article/S4434-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, since the victory of the Socialist \ncandidate for the President of France, opponents of fiscal \nresponsibility have found renewed vigor for their pro-spending \nideology--more stimulus, as we might call it here in this country. \nThere is interest in this country also in more fiscal stimulus.\n  The new French President talked about choosing growth over austerity. \nMany liberal pundits and politicians on this side of the Atlantic have \nnow begun to echo this call. When you put it that way, it barely sounds \nlike a choice at all. The term ``austerity'' sounds so severe, but \nalmost everybody agrees that economic growth is good.\n  Just what is this austerity all about? In Europe, ``austerity'' is \noften used to describe an attempt to reduce budget deficits by reining \nin unsustainable spending. In this country, we more often talk about \nfiscal responsibility. For Europeans who have grown accustomed to \ngenerous social benefits, even modest reforms to government programs \nare apparently cause to take to the streets and demonstrate. But for \nthe millions of Americans who still believe in limited government and \nwho do not feel entitled to programs or benefits paid for by the \nearnings of others, there is nothing austere about government spending \nwithin its means.\n  So then what about the other aspect of it--growth? The implication of \nthe supposed choice between growth and austerity is that we must accept \nirresponsible levels of spending in order to have that economic growth. \nObviously this is absurd. The politically convenient economic theory \nwas summed up by Margaret Thatcher as, ``The more you spend, the richer \nyou get.'' That doesn't meet the commonsense test in the Midwest of \nAmerica. It was the rationale behind President Obama's massive $800 \nbillion stimulus bill. The bill looked suspiciously like a grab bag of \npent-up Democratic spending priorities, but we were told that all of \nthis spending was necessary to keep unemployment below 8 percent. Of \ncourse, as we all know, unemployment soon soared well above 8 percent \nand has never dipped below 8 percent now more than 3 years later.\n  I would say to all of those across the Atlantic in Europe calling for \nnew stimulus spending: We tried it, and it didn't work. Not only didn't \nit work but it made things worse. All of that government spending \ncrowded out private sector activity that would have helped the recovery \nand saddled our economy and our children with even more debt. \nConversely, reining in government spending will unleash the power of \nfree enterprise to create wealth and grow our economy in ways no \ngovernment central planner can ever accomplish.\n  Despite the clear results of the most recent American experience with \nstimulus spending, liberal pundits are now blaming Europe's current \neconomic troubles on efforts to reduce government spending. They say \nthat savage cuts by pro-austerity governments in countries such as \nBritain, France, and Spain have actually damaged their economies. So \njust how deep did these countries of Europe actually cut? Spain \nincreased spending after the recession started, then implemented some \nmodest cuts but is still spending more than it did before the \nrecession. Britain and France have continued to increase spending. So \nmuch for savage spending cuts. It defies common sense, but, as you \nknow, in this town smaller increases in spending than previously \nplanned can qualify somehow as a cut in spending. However, to most \nAmericans, cutting spending actually means spending less than you were \nthe year before. The fact that there have been no serious spending cuts \nin these supposedly pro-austerity countries is enough to dismiss the \naccusations that spending cuts are the cause of Europe's current \ntroubles.\n  But there is another part of the story that is too often ignored: \nGovernments that talk about the need to reduce deficits but are too \ntimid to enact necessary spending cuts invariably turn to tax \nincreases. For instance, since the recession started, Britain has \nraised the top marginal income tax rate as well as increased the \ncapital gains tax, the national insurance tax, and the value-added tax. \nSpain has enacted hikes in personal income tax and property taxes and \nseems to be planning even more taxes.\n  This year the Spanish Government is looking to address its deficit \nwith a $19.2 billion package of spending reductions paired with another \n$16 billion worth of tax increases. Of course, to us\n\n[[Page S4435]]\n\nhere in the United States, that sounds a lot like what Democrats have \nbeen calling a balanced approach. And so it is--just like giving a \npatient an equal dose of medicine and poison would be a balanced \napproach. However, across Europe there has been a lot more emphasis on \nthe poison of tax increases than on the medicine of spending cuts. In \nfact, while government spending across the entire European Union fell \nby just 2.6 billion euros between 2010 and 2011, taxes rose by a \nstaggering 235 billion euros.\n  So while critics of austerity are flatout wrong to blame the largely \nmythical spending cuts for Europe's economic troubles, they may have \nstumbled onto something. To the extent that austerity really means big \ntax increases rather than serious spending cuts, I think it identifies \na big part of Europe's fiscal and economic problems.\n  These facts notwithstanding, if I couldn't point to an example where \neconomic growth resulted from spending restraint, my arguments would \nring hollow. I would sound like those radical intellectuals who still \nrefuse to accept that Marxism has been totally discredited both morally \nand economically by claiming that it has never truly been tried. \nHowever, what I am talking about has been tried. There are plenty of \nexamples of where bold leadership to dramatically rein in government \nspending has resulted in economic growth. There is actually a prime \nexample right in Europe and in the euro area--Estonia.\n  In response to the 2008 economic crisis, Estonia's free enterprise-\noriented government focused on real spending cuts, including major \nstructural reforms. Estonia cut private sector wages, raised the \npension age, and reformed health benefits. When it comes to taxes, \nEstonia already had a low flat tax and didn't raise rates. While there \nwas an increase in the value-added tax, the overwhelming emphasis was \non spending cuts. As a result, the Estonian economy grew at 7.6 percent \nlast year. And it happens that Estonia is the only country in the \neurozone with an actual budget surplus, and the country has a national \ndebt that is only 6 percent of GDP. Can you imagine that, a debt of \nonly 6 percent of GDP?\n  Moreover, Estonia had an especially deep hole to climb out of. The \nEstonian economy was devastated by the global financial crisis. It \ncontracted by 18 percent, which is more than Greece. Nevertheless, \nEstonia's economy is well on its way back to prerecession levels.\n\n  I should add that in response to the spending cuts, Estonians didn't \nriot in the streets. Instead, they reelected their government.\n  Also, while Estonia is the most impressive example, a similar story \nalso holds true for the other Baltic countries of Latvia and Lithuania. \nPerhaps their unhappy experience of Soviet domination has made them \nextra skeptical of big government solutions to problems. It is possible \nthat the unique history of the Baltic countries makes it easier for \nthem to break the spending addiction, but that doesn't mean it can't be \ndone here. In fact, I will give you an example that is much closer to \nhome--Canada.\n  In the 1990s Canada was facing the same problem the United States is \nnow. It suffered a recession and had a looming debt crisis. The \nCanadian Government's response was to dramatically cut spending. Again, \nI am not talking about slowing the rate of growth but actual spending \ncuts. In just 2 years, starting in 1995, total noninterest spending \nfell 10 percent. Canadian federal spending as a share of GDP dropped \nfrom 22 percent in 1995 to 15 percent 11 years later. Canada's federal \ndebt was at 68 percent of GDP in 1995 and is down to just 34 percent \ntoday. Now a lesson for America: Compare that to our national debt, \nwhich is more than 70 percent of GDP. Like Estonia, the overwhelming \nemphasis in Canada was on spending cuts rather than tax increases.\n  Moreover, these cuts included structural reforms. Canada's Government \nfixed its version of Social Security, which is the third rail of \nAmerican politics, as we say here. Unlike Social Security, the Canadian \npension plan is solvent for the foreseeable future. What is really \ninteresting is that these reforms were not implemented by some \nrightwing ideologues; these reforms were all implemented by the \nCanadian Liberal Party, which is a center-left party like America's \nDemocrats.\n  However, when President Bush suggested fixing Social Security upon \nhis reelection, the issue was relentlessly demagogued by Democrats in \nCongress. More recently, when Paul Ryan unveiled a plan to save \nMedicare, rather than present alternative ideas, liberal groups \ndepicted him in political advertisements pushing grandmother off a \ncliff.\n  If our Democrats had shown the same leadership the Canadian Liberals \ndid, we would be in a lot better economic shape right now. Instead, \nwhat we get from the other side of the aisle are demands for more \nstimulus spending and head-in-the-sand denial about the impending \nbankruptcy of Medicare and Social Security.\n  There are a lot of other examples where low taxes and spending \nrestraint have led an economic recovery after a downturn. In fact, a \n2009 paper by two Harvard economists, Alberto Alesina and Silvia \nArdagna, reviewed 107 examples of fiscal adjustments in industrialized \ncountries between 1970 and the year 2007. They found that, \nstatistically, tax cuts are more likely to increase growth than \nspending. They also found that spending cuts without tax increases are \nmore likely to reduce deficits and debt than increased taxes. The \nhistorical record is clear. We know what path leads to economic growth \nand prosperity. However, that is not an easy path to follow.\n  Unlike the ``have your cake and eat it too'' philosophy that says \nmore government spending will somehow make us all richer, the real road \nto recovery requires real leadership and less spending.\n  Earlier in my comments I mentioned a statement by Margaret Thatcher's \ncontempt for stimulus ideology. When she took office, Britain was in \ndeep debt and known as ``the sick man of Europe.'' In fact, Britain had \nbeen forced to go to the IMF for a bailout and was regularly rocked by \nmassive strikes. In many ways it was the Greece of the 1970s. When \nThatcher began making the difficult decisions necessary to rescue the \nBritish economy, many people, including some of her own party, pleaded \nfor her to return to the big spending policies of previous British \nGovernments. Her response is applicable to our country today as it was \nto Britain back then. I wish to quote Margaret Thatcher:\n\n       If spending money like water was the answer to our \n     country's problems, we would have no problems now. If ever a \n     nation has spent, spent, spent and spent again, ours has. \n     Today that dream is over. All of that money has got us \n     nowhere but it still has to come from somewhere. Those who \n     urge us to relax the squeeze, to spend yet more money \n     indiscriminately in the belief that it will help the \n     unemployed and the small businessman, are not being kind or \n     compassionate or caring. They are not the friends of the \n     unemployed or the small business. They are asking us to do \n     again the very thing that caused the problem in the first \n     place.\n\n  I leave with this proposition. Can Congress learn from the \nexperiences of Estonia, Canada, and Britain's Thatcher? If we can, we \ncan turn this U.S. economy around--and the economy and jobs are the \nissue of this Presidential campaign season.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. What is the pending business?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The motion to proceed to S. 1940.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of voting for cloture \non the bill and wish to speak for as much time as I may consume.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n         Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we have just exchanged some \nparliamentary lingo to essentially say we are going to vote shortly to \nsee if we can pass the Food and Drug Administration Safety and \nInnovation Act, and do it without a filibuster. I hope we can vote for \ncloture--not to muzzle, not to have a gag rule, but so we can move \nexpeditiously on this bill.\n\n[[Page S4436]]\n\n  Every single Member here should be proud of what we have accomplished \nin this FDA Safety and Innovation Act. We have accomplished three major \nobjectives: No. 1, if the legislation is passed--and it is a conference \nagreement between the House and the Senate--we will be able to move \npharmaceuticals, biotech products, and medical devices into clinical \npractice faster while maintaining our ethical standards around public \nsafety.\n  No. 2, we can demonstrate we can work together and we can govern. \nThis is the result of the Senate working on both sides of the aisle. \nNow, with the House, through the conference report, we show we can work \nbetween the Senate and the House.\n  In this time of prickly politics and political posturing when more \ngets said than done, we can show we cannot only pass legislation but \nlegislation that makes a difference in people's lives. We will also \nshow we can do it in a way that we will not only have a regulatory \nframework but something in which the businesses cooperated so we will \nhave regulation without strangulation. We will have regulation that \nacts in the interest of public safety but does not stifle, shackle, or \nimpede good business practices. Wow. Isn't this what we have been \ntalking about?\n  I am very proud of having been a member of the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee that worked on this bill. I am also very \nproud of the fact that FDA is in my State. In a nutshell, we are \npassing something called PDUFA and other UFAs. PDUFA stands for the \nPrescription Drug User Fee Act. There will be others that we will talk \nabout which relate to bio user fees and medical device user fees and \ngenerics.\n\n  This bill was originally enacted in 1992, and the reason for that was \nat that time there was an unduly long wait for patients to have access \nto new medicines and new medical devices. It often took close to 3 \nyears to even review a drug application. So Congress went to work with \nthen-President Bill Clinton to say where the pharmacy could agree that, \nfirst of all, they would pay user fees to support FDA's drug review \nprogram. It is a true public-private partnership. When we look at the \nfunding for FDA, the people who make pharmaceuticals, biotech, and \nmedical devices pay 60 percent of the FDA budget. That is $712 million. \nThe remainder comes from Federal appropriations--40 percent, which is \n$473 million. So there is a partnership between those businesses that \nprofit--and we want them to do so, without profiteering--and, at the \nsame time, government pays its share.\n  Since 1992, this legislation has been an enormous success. More than \n1,500 new medicines have been approved, including treatments for \ncancer, infectious disease, and cardiovascular disease. It has \ndecreased review times from more than 3 years to 1 year and a few \nmonths now.\n  In order to make sure we had the right perspective, we not only held \nexcellent hearings in the Senate, but I went out around my own State. I \nam so proud of my State. We are the home of life sciences. We have NIH \nthere, which does incredible basic research. We actually have FDA, \nwhich reviews food safety and drug safety. At the same time, we are the \nhome to a robust group of biotech companies. I wanted to listen to \nthose biotech companies. When I went out, I said to them: Tell me how \nyour government is helping you and tell me how your government is \nimpeding you. Tell me where you want your government to get out of the \nway and where do you need a more muscular government. Well, we heard \nquite a bit from them. The first thing they told me is they need a Food \nand Drug Administration because when they are approved for public \nsafety and efficacy in the United States of America, they can sell \ntheir products anywhere in the world. It often means countries--small \ncountries, countries of modest means with limited GDP that could never \nafford an FDA--know that if the United States of America says it is OK \nfor their citizens, any other country in the world knows it is OK for \ntheirs. So it is very good to be able to export these products with \nconfidence and reliability. This is fantastic, in their minds.\n  Second, they said they needed more help from FDA not only to expedite \nbut they wanted better communication.\n  They also needed to be able to incentivize development for those rare \ndiseases we often hear about, where there are small markets but big \ninvestments to achieve in it. They outlined the fact that they needed \nto be viewed not in an adversarial way but a collaborative way. Well, \nthanks to business sitting down with FDA, and business sitting down \nwith Members of Congress, we have been able to do exactly that. We have \nimproved efficiency, predictability, the regulatory environment, and, \nat the same time, insisting on safety and efficacy.\n  This is going to be great for patients. Millions of Americans rely on \ndrugs and biologics and on medical devices. If we are going to improve \nhealth care and rein in the cost of health care, we have to use drugs, \nbiotech products, and medical devices that improve lives and extend \nlives.\n  If we fail to authorize this legislation, we are going to be in big \ntrouble. How are we going to be in big trouble? Well, first of all, we \nwill have to give notice to FDA that there are going to be layoffs. \nThat means we would have to send out notices in July telling 4,000 \npeople: Look, we know you are the best and the brightest and we want \nyou to have integrity as well as regulatory sensibility and a great \ndeal of scientific competence, but we couldn't get our act together so \nyou are going to be laid off.\n  Hello. We want these people out there, helping America be able to \nprovide health care in a way that is safe and efficacious.\n  Again, as I said, if we don't act, thousands of FDA people will be \nlaid off. It is not about government. If those people are laid off, it \nmeans the review process for every single drug that is now in the \npipeline will come to a halt. So we are hurting patients, thousands of \npeople who need new drugs; new ways of helping them, whether it is for \nthat dread C word--cancer--or diabetes, which takes so much of our \nnational budget to manage chronic illness.\n  What about the breakthroughs on this epidemic of Alzheimer's we have \nor autism? We need all the help we can develop. If America is going to \ncontinue to be America the exceptional, we have to do an exceptionally \ngood job of making sure we produce some of the newest and most reliable \ndrugs, biotech, and medical devices.\n  This is why I think we have good legislation. Is it perfect? No. But \nis it pretty close to it for what business and government and \nproviders--the doctors themselves--say we need? Absolutely.\n  I urge my colleagues today, when we vote on this motion to proceed on \ncloture to have in mind--whether a colleague is a Democrat or a \nRepublican--that we don't make the perfect the enemy of the good; \nrather, we think of all those people to whom we talk every day. We talk \nto them at townhall meetings and out there with diners, and they say: \nYou know, my little boy has leukemia; my mother has breast cancer; my \ndear father who stood up for me is facing the ravages of Alzheimer's. \nWe need breakthroughs. We need help, then, for our private sector, so \nit can go global and create jobs in this country and well-being in \nother countries around the world. We have to be able to do it.\n  I am also pleased this bill combats drug shortages, improves the \nsafety of the drug supply chain, and makes permanent those special \nconsiderations that require that children's needs are being met with \nboth medical devices and prescriptions, either in terms of dosage or \nthat a device actually fits them.\n  I wanted to come to the floor to lay this out. I am very proud of \nFDA, and I am very proud of the Congress, including Senator Harkin and \nSenator Enzi, who pulled us together. We have the right legislative \nframework. Now let's act and do it in a way we can all be proud of.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S4437]]\n\n         Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, after many months of bipartisan \nnegotiation, I have high hopes that the Senate will vote very shortly \nto invoke cloture on the House message to accompany the Food and Drug \nAdministration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012.\n  I am pleased to report it is the product of excellent bipartisan \ncollaboration on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, \nwhich I chair, and productive conversations with our colleagues in the \nHouse. The House passed the FDA Safety and Innovation Act unanimously \nlast week. Now it is our turn to do our part. The backbone of this \nlegislation is the user fee agreement that FDA has negotiated with \nindustry.\n  I might just add this bill passed this Chamber about 3 weeks ago on a \nvote of 96 to 1. So it has strong bipartisan support. A sizeable part \nof FDA's budget comes from user fees that industry agrees to pay to \nallow FDA to more quickly weekly review product applications. We need \nto authorize FDA to implement those agreements if we want to keep FDA \nrunning at full steam, which is critical to preserving jobs at both the \nagency and in the industry and to ensuring that FDA has the resources \nto get safe medical products to patients quickly.\n  I want to be clear. These agreements affect all of us by helping to \nmaintain and create jobs in our home States. For example, in my State \nof Iowa, these agreements will support our burgeoning bioscience sector \nwhich saw employment grow by 4.5 percent between 2007 and 2008. The \nimplementation of these agreements will continue to foster biomedical \ninnovation and job growth in all of our States.\n  The bill before us reauthorizes the prescription drug user fee \nagreement and the medical device user fee agreement, both commonly \nknown as PDUFA and MDUFA, which will continue and improve the agency's \nability to speed market access to prescription drugs and medical \ndevices while ensuring patient safety.\n  I just might add that, again, uppermost, foremost, first is patient \nsafety. That does not mean we cannot do things in a better manner, get \nproducts more readily available, speed up the process if we have the \npersonnel and the equipment to do so. That is why this bill is so \nimportant. It provides that type of support so we can hire more people \nto make sure we get these products to patients quickly, but to make \nsure they are safe.\n  The bill also authorizes a new generic drug user fee agreement which \nis expected to slash review time to one-third of current levels, from \n30 months to 10 months, drastically improving the speed with which \ngeneric products are made available to patients. The new generic user \nfee agreement will generate significant savings for patients and our \nhealth care system. In the last decade alone, from 2001 to 2010, the \nuse of generic drugs saved the U.S. health care system more than $931 \nbillion. This agreement will ensure that we continue to see those \nsavings and that patients have access to cheaper drugs when they need \nthem.\n  This bill also authorizes a new biosimilars user fee agreement which \nwill further spur innovation by the generic biologic industry. This \nchart shows again some of the savings we will get. The use of generic \ndrugs has saved over $931 billion over the last decade, $158 billion \njust in 2010 alone. So we can see the better we are able to get generic \ndrugs approved and in the pipeline--again, safely--the better off we \nare all going to be and more money that not only will we save as \nindividuals but our entire health care system will save. That is almost \n$1 trillion over the last 10 years.\n  These agreements again, as I said, are vital to FDA's ability to do \nits job, vital to the stability of the medical products industry, and \nmost importantly to the patients who are the primary beneficiaries of \nthis longstanding and valuable collaboration between FDA and the \nindustry.\n  After months of negotiation, FDA and the industry have crafted win-\nwin agreements they stand behind. They are doing their job. Now it is \ntime for us to do ours.\n  It is absolutely imperative that we authorize these user fee \nagreements before they expire. If we do not, FDA will lose 60 percent \nof its drug center budget and 20 percent of its device center budget. \nThey will have to lay off nearly 2,000 employees. That is why it is so \ncritical for us to do this at this time.\n  To be sure, the expiration does not happen until late this summer. \nBut the FDA has told us if they do not get this reauthorization done, \nthey will have to start sending out pink slips at the beginning of \nJuly. That is why it is so imperative for us to pass this legislation \nthis week and send it to the President for his signature, so they will \nnot have to go through that process of sending out pink slips.\n  But we can see how important this is. If this were to happen, it \nwould have devastating consequences for patients whose health and lives \ndepend on new medical treatments. We cannot let that happen. That is \nwhy for more than a year I worked closely with my colleague, the \nranking member of the HELP Committee, Senator Enzi, and other members \nof the HELP Committee. Our aim has been to ensure that in addition to \nthe user fee agreements, the other provisions in this legislation are \nalso the product of consensus bipartisan policymaking.\n  We have used bipartisan working groups and an open, transparent \nprocess to ensure that we had input from our members and the \nstakeholder community at large throughout negotiations on the other \ntitles of this bill. This is quite remarkable. We do not see much of it \nin this Congress these days. But we have had great cooperation from all \nmembers of our committee on both sides of the aisle.\n  This legislation has benefited greatly from all of the diverse input: \nfrom Senators, as I said, on both sides of the aisle, industry \nstakeholders, consumer groups, patient groups, and more recently from \nour colleagues in the House. The FDA Safety and Innovation Act is the \nresult of concerted efforts to define our common interests, and these \ninterests will directly benefit patients and the U.S. biomedical \nindustry.\n  As you can see from this chart, the bill modernizes FDA's authority \nin several critical ways: It authorizes key user fee agreements to \nensure timely approval of medical products. It streamlines the device \napproval process. It modernizes FDA's global drug supply chain \nauthority, which is so important. It spurs innovation and incentivizes \ndrug development for life-threatening conditions. It reauthorizes and \nimproves incentives for pediatric trials. It helps prevent and mitigate \ndrug shortages, and it increases FDA's accountability and transparency. \nSo it addresses the broad array of critical issues that we face in \ntoday's global economy.\n  It is imperative that our regulatory system keep pace with and adapt \nto technological and scientific advances and that patient protection \nremains strong in this era of dynamic change. Keeping pace with the \never-changing biomedical landscape is precisely the aim of the FDA \nSafety and Innovation Act. This bill injects greater transparency into \nthe device approval process. It bolsters FDA's ability to help U.S. \nmanufacturers create innovative and safe devices, while also enhancing \nFDA's ability to determine how the devices perform in the real world \nand takes appropriate measures to protect patients.\n  The bill also reauthorizes and improves incentives for pediatric \ntrials. It creates incentives for the development of new antibiotics \nand authorizes new drug and device provisions to help expedite the \napproval of important lifesaving drugs and devices without sacrificing \nsafety.\n  In addition, the bill also helps address the national crisis \nprescription drug shortages. For the past several years, hospitals \nacross the country and in my State of Iowa have experienced an \nincreasing number of shortages of life-sustaining prescription drugs. \nThese shortages directly threaten the public health by denying patients \naccess to medications that are indispensable to their care. This bill \nrequires all manufacturers of certain drugs to notify FDA if they \nexpect a manufacturing disruption that could lead to a shortage because \nif FDA is aware of a potential shortage early, then the agency can work \nwith manufacturers and providers to find other ways to get patients the \ndrugs they need. This bill also addresses drug shortages by explicitly \nallowing FDA to expedite drug\n\n[[Page S4438]]\n\nestablishment inspections and application reviews when needed to help \nprevent or mitigate a shortage. It establishes an FDA drug shortage \ntask force to develop a strategic plan to address drug shortages and to \nimprove communication and outreach to stakeholders preparing for drug \nshortages.\n  Another significant advance in the bill is the much needed \nmodernization of the FDA's authority to ensure the safety of drug \nproducts coming into the United States from abroad. This bill, No. 1, \nallows FDA to prioritize inspections of both domestic and foreign firms \nbased on the risk they present to patient safety. It requires importers \nto demonstrate that certain high-risk drugs are safe and compliant \nbefore they can be imported into the United States. It requires \nmanufacturer accountability and oversight of the quality and compliance \nof their drug producers and suppliers. It enhances penalties for \nadulterating and counterfeiting drugs. It allows FDA to detain \nnoncompliant drugs in U.S. commerce to prevent them from reaching \npatients. It permits FDA to destroy certain illegal drugs at the border \ninstead of releasing them back into commerce. It clarifies FDA's \nauthority to address criminal conduct that occurs abroad and threatens \nthe safety of U.S. consumers.\n  An important point to remember about the importance of these safety \nprovisions is that weaknesses in our pharmaceutical supply chain not \nonly affect the health of American patients, they also affect the \nhealth of American businesses. U.S. companies that source and \nmanufacture drugs in this country should not be placed at a competitive \ndisadvantage by foreign firms that operate with less oversight and sell \nsubstandard ingredients into this country at reduced prices. This bill \nwill help ensure that businesses operate on a level playing field by \nholding foreign actors to the same high standards as those in the \nUnited States.\n  The last policy provision I will highlight is a mix of device and \ndrug authorities that together can fairly be described as the most \nsignificant advance for patients of orphan and rare diseases since the \nOrphan Drug Act was passed nearly 30 years ago.\n  In addition to the significant resources that will be devoted to rare \ndiseases under the prescription drug user fee agreement itself, this \nbill, No. 1, expands the accelerated approval pathway to therapies for \nrare and very rare diseases, and it instructs FDA to weigh the rarity \nof a disease as a factor in its approval process.\n  Next, it directs resources to promising therapies for unmet medical \nneeds, which will receive the new ``breakthrough'' designation.\n  Next, it requires FDA to consult with outside experts on rare \ndiseases.\n  Next, it focuses on pediatric rare diseases by requiring a strategic \nplan regarding pediatric rare diseases and creating a pilot program to \nincentivize new therapies for pediatric rare diseases.\n  Next, it helps make devices for rare diseases more available by \nmodernizing provisions relating to custom devices and making it easier \nfor companies to make profits on devices for rare disease.\n  Lastly, it reforms the conflict of interest rules for advisory \ncommittees to make it easier for the FDA to fill panels, which will \nhave particular impact regarding rare diseases because those panels are \nsometimes very hard to fill.\n  I am very proud of the advances this legislation represents for \npatients with orphan and rare diseases.\n  Not only does the bill support the biomedical industry and help \npatients get the medical products they need, it also reduces the \ndeficit. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, this \nlegislation will reduce the budget deficit by more than $311 million in \nthe next decade. So what we have is not only good policy, but it is \nfiscally responsible by contributing to deficit reduction.\n  As I have said, well over a year of diligent, bipartisan work has \ngone into the legislation before us today. Neither Democrats nor \nRepublicans got everything they wanted in this bill. We sought out \nconsensus measures. Where we could not achieve consensus, we did not \nallow our differences to distract us from the critically important goal \nof producing a bill everyone could support. As a result, this is a true \nbipartisan bill, and it is broadly supported by the patient groups and \nindustry. In fact, it has wide support from medical associations and \nalso from consumer groups and manufacturers throughout the entire \ncountry--a broad base of support. In fact, it is unique because it has \nthe full support of manufacturers, the pharmaceutical industry, the \ndevice manufacturers, the FDA itself, and patients groups--people \nconcerned about patient safety, cost, and availability of drugs and \ndevices. So it has a broad base of support.\n\n  The FDA Safety and Innovation Act before us, which we will be voting \non in a little while, authorizes the important FDA user fee agreements, \nand it modernizes our regulatory system to ensure safety and to foster \ninnovation in the medical product industry. Our bipartisan work has \nproduced an excellent bill. We cannot allow unrelated partisan \ndisagreements or Presidential-election-year politics to interfere or \nkeep us from completing our job.\n  I will say it again. We must pass this vital legislation now. It is \ncritically important to the agency, to the industry and, most \nimportantly, to patients that we get this done. Let's come together, \nDemocrats and Republicans, to pass this legislation. Let's have a \nresounding vote on cloture. Hopefully we won't have to use the 30 hours \nand we can get to passage of the bill very rapidly so that we can get \nit down to the President for his signature.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                    Invoking the Leahy-Thurmond Rule\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nminority leader's decision to invoke the longstanding Senate tradition, \nknown as the Leahy-Thurmond rule. Pursuant to this tradition and \nprecedent, the Senate will cease confirming nominees to the Federal \ncourts of appeals until after the Presidential election in November. \nMany of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle have previously \naffirmed the propriety of this rule and enforced its standard. For \nexample, in the last year of the Bush administration, the majority \nleader noted that ``in a Presidential election year, it is always very \ntough for judges. That is the way it has been for a long time, and that \nis why we have the Thurmond rule.''\n  The chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who has cited the Thurmond \nrule more frequently than any other Senator, has likewise stated that \n``in a Presidential election year, after Spring, no judges go through \nexcept by the consent of the Republican and Democratic leaders.''\n  Statements from several of my Democratic colleagues likewise confirm \nthat it is proper to invoke the Leahy-Thurmond rule at this point in a \nPresidential election year. In 2008, for example, one of my colleagues \non the Judiciary Committee argued that for Federal appeals court \nnominees, once ``it comes to June . . . generally everything stops in \nan election year.'' Indeed, on June 12 of that same year, another \nJudiciary Committee colleague stated that the Senate was already ``way \npast the time of the Thurmond rule.''\n  History further confirms the propriety of invoking the Leahy-Thurmond \nrule at this time. It is extremely rare for the Senate to confirm an \nappeals court nominee after June of a Presidential election year. In \nfact, it has happened only once in almost two decades, when in 2000 the \nRepublican-controlled Senate confirmed one of President Clinton's \nnominees. It is simply not true, as comments from some of my colleagues \nhave implied, that in recent Presidential election years we have \nconfirmed appellate court nominees in July, August, or September.\n  Moreover, this year we have already confirmed five of President \nObama's Federal appeals court nominees. This, incidentally, is the same \nnumber of appeals court nominees the Senate confirmed in 2008, the most \nrecent Presidential election year on record. In 2004 the Senate \nconfirmed only four such nominees. Indeed, dating back over 100 years, \nfrom President William Howard Taft to President Obama, the Senate has \nconfirmed an average of just four appeals court nominees during \nPresidential election years. This year we have already exceeded the \nhistorical average and confirmed five of President Obama's appeals \ncourt nominees.\n\n[[Page S4439]]\n\nThere is no reason to depart further from the historical norm and \nconfirm additional nominees.\n  The suggestion by some that application of the Leahy-Thurmond rule \nsomehow affects court vacancies deemed ``judicial emergencies'' is \nfalse, and recklessly so. Of the four judicial emergencies on the \nFederal court of appeals, President Obama has nominated only one \nindividual, and because that nomination was so recent, even absent the \nLeahy-Thurmond rule, that nominee would not be scheduled for a vote \nanytime soon.\n  I also remind my colleagues that Democrats enforced the Leahy-\nThurmond rule in June 2008, during a time when there were twice as many \njudicial emergencies in the circuit courts as there are right now. \nLikewise, the overall vacancy rate on our circuit courts was much \nhigher in June 2004 when President Bush was in the final year of his \nterm. Yet Democrats did not hesitate to block several qualified \nappellate court nominees in the months leading up to the 2004 \nPresidential election.\n  Enforcement of the Leahy-Thurmond rule does not currently apply to \ndistrict court nominees. This year the Senate has already confirmed 23 \nof President Obama's district court nominees--many more than were \nconfirmed during comparable years during the President Bush and Clinton \nPresidencies. And we will continue to confirm more qualified nominees. \nApplication of the Leahy-Thurmond rule, beginning now, will thus not \nimplicate any district court judicial emergencies.\n  The urgency for such vacancies lies not in the Senate, which to this \nday has acted responsibly on nominees, but with President Obama, who to \nthis day has failed to nominate individuals for many of these seats.\n  There are, I add, other good reasons in addition to tradition and \nhistorical precedent to enforce the Leahy-Thurmond rule now rather than \nwaiting longer to do so. Doing so now prevents a particular President \nfrom packing the courts at the end of his term by appointing \ninfluential, life-tenured appellate court judges whose service will \nspan numerous other Presidential administrations.\n  The Leahy-Thurmond rule also ensures that Presidential politics \nduring an election season will not overshadow or interfere with the \nSenate's advice and consent role on such judicial nominees.\n  The last point bears special emphasis. The Constitution assigns to \nthe Senate the right and the duty to advise and consent to the \nPresident's judicial and executive branch nominees. It is essential for \nthe Constitution's separation of powers that the Senate protect its \nnecessary and legitimate role in the nominations process against \nencroachment by the executive branch of government.\n\n  Earlier this year, we witnessed a troubling demonstration of what can \nhappen when the President violates the Constitution's separation of \npowers and tramples on the Senate's rightful prerogatives in the advise \nand consent process. On January 4, 2012, at a time when the Senate was \nconducting brief sessions approximately every 72 hours, President Obama \nnonetheless bypassed the Senate and unilaterally appointed four \nsignificant executive branch nominees. By asserting the power to make \nrecess appointments, even when the Senate--according to its own rules--\nwas not in recess, the President simply ignored the Senate's legitimate \nconstitutional right to advise and consent to nominees made by the \nPresident.\n  President Obama's unconstitutional appointments cut to the very heart \nof our Constitution's separation of powers and the institutional \nprerogatives that rightfully belong right here, in this body. \nAccordingly, since the time of those appointments, I have sought to \nprotect the Senate's interests by opposing President Obama's judicial \nnominees. I have made clear I would do the same were a Republican \nPresident to make similarly unconstitutional appointments under the \nrecess appointments clause.\n  As the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee noted at a recent \nJudiciary Committee hearing, I have stated my concern with President \nObama's unconstitutional recess appointments very clearly, but I have \nalso been, in his words, extremely responsible in my opposition and \nhave not hindered the work of the Senate. In light of President Obama's \nunconstitutional appointments, it is all the more proper we invoke the \nLeahy-Thurmond rule now.\n  I agree with the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee \nthat we should have invoked that rule back in January, at the time of \nthe unconstitutional appointments. By enforcing the Leahy-Thurmond rule \nnow, we will demonstrate for the historical record the Senate did not \nacquiesce in President Obama's unconstitutional recess appointments \nand, instead, took action to protect the Senate's institutional \nprerogatives. When we have done so, I will again be in a position to \nvote in favor of qualified consensus District Court nominees.\n  But I will always remain vigilant in seeking to protect the Senate \nagainst unconstitutional encroachment by the executive branch. As \nMembers of this body, we have an institutional responsibility to \nsafeguard the Senate's essential advise and consent role and to confirm \nonly those nominees who are properly qualified to serve in the \npositions for which they have been rightfully nominated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                      Arizona Immigration Decision\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today, the U.S. Supreme Court announced \nits decision on S.B. 1070--the controversial Arizona immigration law. \nThe Court--including conservative Justices Anthony Kennedy and John \nRoberts--agreed with the Obama administration that a State cannot set \nup its own immigration enforcement system.\n  As a result, the Supreme Court struck down several parts of the \nArizona law, including the provision that would have made it a crime in \nArizona to be an undocumented immigrant and the provision that would \nhave required legal immigrants to carry documents proving their legal \nstatus at all times.\n  The Supreme Court is right. States do not have the right, under the \nConstitution, to enact immigration laws that contradict Federal law. \nMany of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle strongly \ncriticized the Obama administration for even challenging the Arizona \nimmigration law. There was even an amendment offered to try to block \nthe Justice Department from pursuing the litigation brought to the \nSupreme Court. Fortunately, the vast majority of Democrats, joined by \ntwo Republicans--Senators Johanns and Voinovich--blocked that \namendment.\n  Now the Supreme Court--including Chief Justice Roberts and Justice \nKennedy--has sided with the Obama administration in holding the vast \nmajority of the Arizona law unconstitutional.\n  I am troubled the Supreme Court upheld one of the provisions in that \nlaw in Arizona--section 2(B)--which requires Arizona police officers to \ncheck the immigration status of suspected undocumented immigrants. But \nit is important to understand the Court's decision on that section is a \nnarrow one. The only question for the Court was whether that section--\n2(B)--was preempted by Federal immigration law. The Court said it is \nopen to future challenges once the law goes into effect, and this \nprovision may still be held unconstitutional, as the other provisions \nin the Arizona law.\n  According to law enforcement experts, section 2(B) is likely to \nencourage profiling, which would violate the Equal Protection Clause of \nthe 14th amendment to the Constitution. Specifically, section 2(B) \nrequires police officers to check the immigration status of any \nindividual with whom they have lawful contact if they have ``reasonable \nsuspicion'' the person is an undocumented immigrant.\n  What is the basis for a reasonable suspicion the person they pull \nover is, in fact, an undocumented immigrant? The guidance on the law \nissued in the State of Arizona says police officers should consider \nthings such as how a person is dressed or their ability to communicate \nin English.\n  Earlier this year, I held a hearing on racial profiling in the \nJudiciary's Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Human \nRights. It was the first hearing on racial profiling since before 9/11. \nOne of the witnesses at my hearing was Ron Davis. He is the chief of \npolice in East Palo Alto, CA, and\n\n[[Page S4440]]\n\nChief Davis, along with 16 other law enforcement officials and the \nMajor Cities Chiefs of Police Association, filed a brief in the Arizona \ncase. In their brief, the police chiefs say:\n\n       The statutory standard of ``reasonable suspicion'' of \n     unlawful presence in the United States will as a practical \n     matter produce a focus on minorities, and specifically \n     Latinos.\n\n  Two former Arizona attorneys general, joined by 42 other former State \nattorneys general, filed an amicus brief in the Arizona case, and they \nsaid ``application of the law requires racial profiling.'' I agree with \nthese law enforcement experts. I am confident section 2(B) will \neventually be struck down as the other provisions of the Arizona law \nwere.\n  The Arizona law is the wrong approach for America. It is amazing to \nme how this Nation of immigrants, in which we are all part of the \nfamily, has struggled for so long to deal with the whole issue of \nimmigration. I think it is wrong to treat people as criminals simply \nbecause of their immigration status, and it is not right to make \ncriminals of people who literally go to work every day, cooking our \nfood, cleaning our rooms, and caring for our children in day care \ncenters or caring for our parents and grandparents in nursing homes.\n  Here is the reality: Treating immigrants as criminals will not help \ncombat illegal immigration. Law enforcement doesn't have the time or \nthe resources to prosecute and incarcerate every undocumented immigrant \namong the 10 million or 11 million in this country. Making undocumented \nimmigrants into criminals simply drives them into the shadows. That is \nwhy the Arizona Association of Chiefs of Police opposes the Arizona law \nconsidered by the Court today. They say it will make it more difficult \nfor them to make Arizona a safe place. Immigrants are less likely to \ncooperate with the police if they fear they are going to get arrested \nfor even trying to help.\n  Instead of measures that harm law enforcement and promote racial \nprofiling, such as the Arizona immigration law, we need practical \nsolutions to fix a broken immigration system. That case was before the \nSupreme Court. The Court made its decision today because this body--the \nSenate and the House--have failed to accept their responsibility. We \nhave a responsibility, if, in fact, immigration is a Federal issue, for \na Federal response, and we failed.\n  The first step we should take in passing comprehensive immigration \nreform is to pass the DREAM Act--legislation that would allow a select \ngroup of immigrant students who grew up in this country to earn \ncitizenship either by attending college or serving in the military.\n  Russell Pearce is the author of the Arizona immigration law. He had \nthis to say about the DREAM Act:\n\n       The DREAM Act is one of the greatest legislative threats to \n     America's sovereignty, national security and economic future.\n\n  I see it differently and so do many others, including GEN Colin \nPowell and former Defense Secretary Robert Gates. They support the \nDREAM Act because it would make America a stronger country by giving \nthese talented immigrants the chance to serve in the military and \ncontribute to the future of America.\n  The best way to understand the problems with the Arizona immigration \nlaw and the need for the DREAM Act and comprehensive immigration law is \nto hear the stories of some of the immigrant students who would be \neligible for the DREAM Act. They call themselves DREAMers. Almost every \nweek in the session I come to the floor of the Senate to tell the story \nof one of these young people. Over the years I have told stories of \nseveral DREAMers from the State of Arizona. Under the Arizona law, \nthese young people would be targets for prosecution and incarceration. \nUnder the DREAM Act, they would be future citizens who could make \nAmerica and Arizona stronger.\n  Today, I wish to introduce one of them from Arizona. Her name is \nAngelica Hernandez. She was brought to Phoenix, AZ, when she was 9 \nyears old. She started school in the fourth grade, and by the time she \nreached the sixth grade, Angelica no longer took English as a second \nlanguage. She was proficient in the language of English.\n  At Carl Hayden High School in Phoenix, AZ, Angelica served in Junior \nROTC and was president of the National Honor Society. She became a \ndedicated member of the school's robotics club, where she found her \ntrue love, engineering.\n  Angelica graduated from high school with a 4.5 GPA and in 2007 was \nnamed Outstanding Young Woman of the Year for district 7 in Phoenix. \nLast year, Angelica Hernandez graduated from Arizona State University--\nwe can see her holding her graduation certificate--as the outstanding \nsenior in the Mechanical Engineering Department, with a 4.1 GPA.\n  Under the Arizona immigration law, Angelica Hernandez would be a \ntarget for prosecution and incarceration. Under the DREAM Act, she \nwould be a future citizen and engineer who could contribute her talents \nto making this a better country. What a choice: to take this woman, who \nhas spent virtually her entire life, as she remembers it, in America, \nattending our schools, excelling in those schools, being acknowledged \nas one of the better students so her ambition takes her to a great \nuniversity, Arizona State University, where she graduated at the top of \nher class in mechanical engineering and, some would say, tell her now \nshe must leave America, I think is wrong. Angelica Hernandez, and \npeople like her, will make this a better country. Unlike the Arizona \nimmigration law, the DREAM Act is a practical solution to a broken \nimmigration system. The Arizona law would harm law enforcement and \nencourage profiling. The DREAM Act would make America stronger.\n  President Obama understands this. That is why he challenged the \nArizona law, taking the case to the Supreme Court. That is why earlier \nthis month I saluted the President for announcing his administration \nwill no longer deport people, such as Angelica Hernandez, who would be \neligible for the DREAM Act. I strongly support President Obama's \ncourage and his decision. It is one of the most historic, humanitarian \nmoments of our time. His decision will give these young immigrants the \nchance to finally come out of the shadows and be part of the only \ncountry they have ever called home. It was the right thing to do.\n  These students didn't make the decision to come to this country. \nAngelica was brought here at the age of 9, and it is not the American \nway to punish children for the wrongdoing of their parents. President \nObama's new deportation policy will make America better by giving these \ntalented immigrants the chance to contribute.\n  Studies have found DREAM Act students will literally boost the \nAmerican economy during their working lives. This policy is also \nclearly legal. Throughout our history, the government has decided who \nto prosecute and who not to prosecute based on law enforcement \npriorities and availability resources. Past administrations of both \npolitical parties have used their authority to stop deportation of low-\npriority cases. The courts have recognized that.\n  Listen to what the Supreme Court said today in the Arizona \nimmigration law case:\n\n       A principal feature of the removal system is the broad \n     discretion exercised by immigration officials. . . . \n     Discretion in the enforcement of immigration law embraces \n     immediate human concerns.\n  The President's plan is smart and realistic. The Department of \nHomeland Security has to set priorities. It is not amnesty; it is \nsimply a decision to focus limited government resources on those who \nhave committed serious crimes and are a threat to public safety, not \nthe DREAM Act students.\n  Compare President Obama's approach with the Presidential candidate \nfrom another party who said the Arizona law was a ``model'' for the \nrest of America. That other Presidential party candidate has promised \nthat if he is elected President he will veto the DREAM Act. He has \nrefused to say whether he would even maintain or rescind President \nObama's order banning the deportation of DREAM Act students. That is \nthe wrong approach for America.\n  The administration's new policy on the DREAM Act is only temporary. I \nunderstand that. The burden is still on us in the Senate and the House \nto do something about the many thousands of students across America, \njust like this dynamic young lady in Arizona,\n\n[[Page S4441]]\n\nwho simply want a chance to be a part of America and its future. Our \nfirst step: Pass the DREAM Act. Do it and do it now.\n  Justice Kennedy wrote in his opinion today:\n\n       The history of the United States is in part made of the \n     stories, talents, and lasting contributions of those who \n     crossed oceans and deserts to come here.\n\n  Justice Kennedy is right. Congress should reform our immigration laws \nso we can once again welcome those who cross oceans and deserts to \nrevitalize and strengthen this Nation of immigrants.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I came to the floor to discuss another \nissue. But since my friend from Illinois, with whom I share many of his \ncomments, I have to comment. The fact is that the irony of the Supreme \nCourt decision today said it is a Federal responsibility to ensure our \nborders and not the States' responsibility. The State of Arizona acted \nbecause the Federal Government wouldn't act, because our borders were \nbroken, because the people in the southern part of our State were \nliving in fear, because a rancher was killed by someone who had crossed \nour border illegally, because people are on mountaintops today guiding \ndrug runners across our border into Arizona with drugs ending up in \nPhoenix, AZ, and distributed all over this Nation, $887 million wasted \non a contract for a virtual fence.\n  Coyotes bring these people across and then treat them in the most \nabominable fashion, where they are put into drop houses and kept in the \nworst kinds of conditions and held for ransom.\n  Because the Federal Government would not secure our borders, the \nState of Arizona believed they had to act because people in the \nsouthern part of our State and even other parts of our State were \nliving in fear. They are living in fear because of the drug dealers who \nare coming across, because of the coyotes who are mistreating the \npeople they were bringing.\n  Of course we want to address the issue of children who weren't born \nhere. But we also have an obligation to have our borders secured. I \nrepeat--today, I say to my friend from Illinois--there are people \nsitting on mountaintops hired by the drug cartels who are guiding the \ndrug runners across our borders and up to Phoenix. You can ask the DEA. \nThese drugs are then distributed throughout the country from Phoenix, \nAZ. People are murdered, and the violence on the other side of the \nborder threatens every day to spill over to our side of the border. So \nI hope, as a result of this decision, the administration will get \nserious about actually securing our border. Every expert agrees that \nbecause of the work that has been done in California and Texas it has \nfunneled through the State of Arizona.\n  Have there been improvements? Of course there have been improvements. \nIs it still going on? As long as we have guides sitting on mountaintops \nguiding drug dealers, we haven't got a secure border. That is what the \npeople of Arizona not only want but they also deserve.\n  By the way, Mitt Romney agrees that we have to address this issue in \na comprehensive fashion as well as concern about the plight of the \nchildren who are brought here illegally. But I would also point out to \nmy friend that part of the DREAM Act, as proposed by the Senator from \nIllinois, is 2 years' service in the military. We don't sign people up \nfor 2 years. Average citizens, in order to get on a path to a green \ncard and citizenship, sign up for 4 years. That is just one of the \nareas that need to be worked out.\n  So there will be a lot of conversation about this. But I believe \npeople who live inside of our country--no matter whether it is in \nArizona or Illinois--deserve the right to live in a safe environment. \nThe people who live in the southern part of our State do not have that.\n  So I hope we can get our borders secure and we can move forward with \ncomprehensive immigration.\n  By the way, then-Senator Obama was one of the key reasons it failed \nbecause he wanted to sunset the guest worker program. That is a fact, \nand you can look it up, I say to my friend from Illinois. Although it \nwas killed by people on this side, it was also a broken promise on the \npart of then-Senator Obama who assured Senator Kennedy and me that he \nwouldn't vote for an amendment that would impair the progress of \ncomprehensive reform at that time.\n  I look forward to having further discussions with the Senator from \nIllinois as we move forward--sooner or later--with comprehensive \nimmigration reform, which is absolutely needed. But we also have to \nensure the security of all of our citizens and stop the flow of drugs \nacross our southern border, which is killing our young Americans.\n  By the way, I would say to the Senator from Illinois, the price of an \nounce of cocaine on the streets of Chicago today is not one less penny \nhigher than it was 10 years ago, which means we are not restricting the \nflow of drugs coming into our country. As we all know, the majority of \nit comes across from our southern border.\n  Finally, I would remind my friend from Illinois that then-Senator \nObama promised in the campaign of 2008 that immigration reform would be \nhis first priority. The Senator had 60 votes over here and an \noverwhelming majority in the House of Representatives in the first 2 \nyears of the Obama administration. I never saw a proposal come to the \nSenate for comprehensive immigration reform. Now, the DREAM Act did. \nComprehensive immigration reform? No. That is what then-Senator Obama \npromised.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for a colloquy between myself \nand the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me say, the Senator from Arizona is my friend, and \nthere are many things we have worked on together, and I respect him \nvery much. He knows, as I do, when the DREAM Act was called, we thought \nthe introductory may be the easiest part of immigration reform. It was \nstopped by a Republican filibuster.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I don't dispute that point, I say to my friend from \nIllinois. There was no comprehensive immigration reform proposal that \ncame over from the White House or from the Democrats, as was promised \nby then-Senator Obama when running for the Presidency. That is a fact.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to the Senator from Arizona, as part of this \ncolloquy, we thought that would be the first step. We couldn't get past \nthe first step because of the Republican filibuster.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I wish that when then-Senator Obama was running for \nPresident he would have said: But first I am coming over with the DREAM \nAct. He didn't. He said: My first act will be comprehensive immigration \nreform.\n  I was invited over to the White House in 2009. We talked about \ncomprehensive immigration reform and I said: I will await a proposal \nfrom the administration on comprehensive immigration reform. My phone \nnever rang.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Arizona, perhaps the day will \ncome in our lifetime when we can see that, and you and I can work on it \ntogether again as we once did before. I would look forward to that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I look forward to it, and I want to say there has been no \nmore passionate advocate in the Senate than the Senator from Illinois. \nI respect him and admire him for his compassion and his concern about \nyoung people whose lives, as he very well described, need to have some \nkind of assurance for their future since it is clearly a compelling \nhumanitarian situation. I thank my friend from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Health Care Ruling\n\n  Mr. President, later this week the Supreme Court will issue its \nruling on the health care bill, designed and negotiated by the White \nHouse and rammed through Congress during President Obama's first year \nin office when the economy was near its weakest.\n  Instead of focusing on recovery and persistent unemployment, the \nPresident and the Democratic majorities controlling Congress squandered \nthe opportunity and forced the unpopular and potentially \nunconstitutional legislation on the American people.\n  Today we are voting on final passage on the reconciled FDA user fee \nbill. During Senate consideration of this bill I offered an amendment \nto allow safe drug importation from legitimate\n\n[[Page S4442]]\n\nCanadian pharmacies. But the pharmaceutical industry spread misleading \nand inaccurate information about the amendment, as they have done time \nand a time again. As I said then, there is no greater example of the \ninfluence of special interests on this body than the failure to enact \nan amendment that would have allowed drugs from legitimate Canadian \npharmacies so people could purchase their much needed medication at \nsometimes half the cost of what it is in the United States of America. \nI am embarrassed to this day that nine of my Republican colleagues also \nvoted against it.\n  I don't know if there was a sweetheart deal to protect PhRMA at the \nexpense of American patients from the vote on my amendment. But we do \nknow that PhRMA was protected by the White House and Senate Democrats \nfrom provisions they didn't like in ObamaCare only after they offered \nup advertising in exchange for more accommodating policies.\n  From a recent House Energy and Commerce Committee investigation, it \nis now confirmed that PhRMA orchestrated a grand deal with the White \nHouse and Senate Democrats to oppose importation and other policies. I \nmight point out then-Senator Obama supported drug importation.\n  This is how the New York Times described the deal that was done in \nexchange for reportedly $150 million in advertising to support \nObamaCare, June 8, 2012:\n\n       After weeks of quiet talks, drug industry lobbyists were \n     growing nervous. If they were to cut a deal with the White \n     House on overhauling health care, they needed to be sure \n     President Obama would stop a proposal by his liberal allies \n     intended to bring down medicine prices.\n       On June 3, 2009, one of the lobbyists e-mailed Nancy-Ann \n     DeParle, the president's top health care adviser. Ms. DeParle \n     sent a message back reassuring the lobbyists. Although Mr. \n     Obama was overseas, she wrote, she and other top officials \n     had ``made a decision, based on how constructive you guys \n     have been, to oppose importation on the bill.'' Just like \n     that, Mr. Obama's staff abandoned his support for the \n     reimportation of prescription medicines at lower prices and \n     with it solidified a growing compact with an industry he had \n     vilified on the campaign trail the year before.\n       A president who had promised to air negotiations on C-SPAN \n     cut a closed-door deal with the powerful pharmaceutical \n     lobby, signifying to some disillusioned liberal supporters a \n     loss of innocence, or perhaps even the triumph of cynicism.\n       Still, what distinguishes the Obama-industry deal is that \n     he had so strongly rejected that very sort of business as \n     usual.\n\n  Ironically, candidate Obama sang a very different tune on the \ncampaign trail in 2008:\n\n       You know, I don't want to learn how to play the game \n     better. I want to put an end to the game playing.\n\n  Now, PhRMA is the lobbying group for the pharmaceutical industry. The \nNew York Times article continued:\n\n       The e-mails, which the House committee obtained from PhRMA \n     and other groups, document a tumultuous negotiation, at times \n     transactional. . . .\n       In the end, the White House got the support it needed to \n     pass its broader priority, but industry emerged satisfied as \n     well. ``We got a deal,'' wrote Bryant Hall, then senior vice \n     president of the pharmaceutical group.\n       In July, the White House made clear that it wanted \n     supportive ads using the same characters the industry used to \n     defeat Mr. Clinton's proposal 15 years earlier. ``Rahm asked \n     for Harry and Louise ads thru third party,'' Mr. Hall \n     wrote.''\n       Talks came close to breaking down several times. In May, \n     the White House was upset that the industry had not signed \n     onto a joint statement. One industry official wrote that they \n     should sign: ``Rahm is already furious. The ire will be \n     turned on us.''\n\n  The e-mails also detail extensive and direct negotiations with PhRMA, \nits drug company members, the American Medical Association, AARP, the \nAmerican Hospital Association, unions, and many more. Members of the \nalliance all participated because they thought they were getting \nsomething more valuable--revenue to their organization or membership \nbecause the Federal Government was going to force everyone into some \nform of government-designed health insurance coverage--than what they \nwere going to have to spend on advertising to support the legislation. \nSome reports have the PhRMA advertising commitment as high as $150 \nmillion, spread out through direct advertising in certain important \nStates and among groups created to sound like they were looking out for \npatients or to tout the economic benefits of ObamaCare.\n  On June 11, 2012, the Wall Street Journal described the e-mails about \nthe 2009 negotiations:\n\n       The joint venture was forged in secret in spring of 2009 \n     amid an uneasy mix of menace and opportunism. The drug makers \n     worried that health-care reform would revert to the liberal \n     default of price controls and drug re-importation that Mr. \n     Obama campaigned on, but they also understood that a new \n     entitlement could be a windfall as taxpayers bought more of \n     their products. . . .\n       Initially, the Obamateers and Senate Finance Chairman Max \n     Baucus asked for $100 billion, 90% of it from mandatory \n     ``rebates'' through the Medicare prescription drug benefit \n     like those that are imposed in Medicaid. The drug makers \n     wheedled them down to $80 billion by offsetting cost-sharing \n     for seniors on Medicare, in an explicit quid pro quo for \n     protection against such rebates and re-importation.\n       ``Terms were reached in June. . .lead PhRMA negotiator \n     Bryant Hall wrote on June 12 that Mr. Obama ``knows \n     personally about our deal and is pushing no agenda.''\n       But Energy and Commerce Chairman Henry Waxman then \n     announced that he was pocketing PhRMA's concessions and \n     demanding more, including re-importation. We wrote about the \n     double-cross in a July 16, 2009 editorial called ``Big Pharma \n     Gets Played,'' noting that Mr. Tauzin's ``corporate clients \n     and their shareholders may soon pay for his attempt to get \n     cozy with ObamaCare.''\n       Mr. Hall forwarded the piece to Ms. DeParle with the \n     subject line, ``This sucks.'' The White House rode to the \n     rescue. In September Mr. Hall informed Mr. Kindler that \n     deputy White House chief of staff Jim Messina ``is working on \n     some very explicit language on importation to kill it in \n     health care reform. This has to stay quiet.''\n       ``PhRMA more than repaid the favor, with a $150 million \n     advertising campaign coordinated with the White House \n     political shop. As one of Mr. Hall's deputies put it earlier \n     in the minutes of a meeting when the deal was being \n     negotiated, ``The WHdesignated folks . . . would like us to \n     start to define what 'consensus health care reform' means, \n     and what it might include. . . . They definitely want us in \n     the game and on the same side.''\n\n  More on the ``WH-designated folks . . .'' in a moment. The June 11 \nWSJ editorial continued:\n\n       In particular, the drug lobby would spend $70 million on \n     two 501(c)(4) front groups called Healthy Economy Now and \n     Americans for Stable Quality Care. In July, Mr. Hall wrote \n     that ``Rahm asked for Harry and Louise ads thru third party. \n     We've already contacted the agent.\n\n  Other groups like the AMA were also willing to commit their \nmembership dollars to advertising in support of the legislation in \nexchange for their policy priorities. According to the Wall Street \nJournal:\n\n       ``At least PhRM/I deserves backhanded credit for the \n     competence of its political operatives--unlike, say, the \n     American Medical Association. A thread running through the \n     emails is a hapless AMA lobbyist importuning Ms. DeParle and \n     Mr. Messina for face-to-face meetings to discuss reforming \n     the Medicare physician payment formula. The AMA supported \n     ObamaCare in return for this ``doc fix,'' which it never got.\n       ``We are running out of time,'' this lobbyist, Richard \n     Deem, writes in October 2009. How can he ``tell my colleagues \n     at AMA headquarters to proceed with $2m TV buy'' without a \n     permanent fix? The question answers itself: It was only $2 \n     million.''\n\n  The emails uncovered by the House committee also describe potentially \nserious conflicts of interest for senior White House staff, their \nformer businesses, who was really writing the legislation--the White \nHouse, Congress or affected industries--and questions about the \nappearance of the White House staff orchestrating the outside \nadvertising campaign. On June 21, 2012 the Wall Street Journal further \nreported on the 2009 secret deals:\n\n                 Strassel: Axelrod's ObamaCare Dollars\n\n                       (By Kimberly A. Strassel)\n\n       Rewind to 2009. The fight over ObamaCare is raging, and a \n     few news outlets report that something looks ethically rotten \n     in the White House. An outside group funded by industry is \n     paying the former firm of senior presidential adviser David \n     Axelrod to run ads in favor of the bill. That firm, AKPD \n     Message and Media, still owes Mr. Axelrod money and employs \n     his son.\n       The story quickly died, but emails recently released by the \n     House Energy and Commerce Committee ought to resurrect it. \n     The emails suggest the White House was intimately involved \n     both in creating this lobby and hiring Mr. Axelrod's firm--\n     which is as big an ethical no-no as it gets.\n       Mr. Axelrod--who left the White House last year--started \n     AKPD in 1985. Mr. Axelrod moved to the White House in 2009 \n     and agreed to have AKPD buy him out for $2 million. But AKPD \n     chose to pay Mr. Axelrod in annual installments--even as he \n     worked in the West Wing.\n       The White House and industry were working hand-in-glove to \n     pass ObamaCare in 2009, and among the vehicles supplying ad \n     support was an outfit named Healthy Economy Now (HEN).\n       House emails show HEN was in fact born at an April 15, 2009 \n     meeting arranged by then-White House aide Jim Messina and a \n     chief of staff for Democratic Sen. Max Baucus. The\n\n[[Page S4443]]\n\n     two politicos met at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign \n     Committee (DSCC) and invited representatives of business and \n     labor.\n       The call was from Nick Baldick, a Democratic consultant who \n     had worked on the Obama campaign and for the DSCC. Mr. \n     Baldick started HEN. The only job of PhRMA and others was to \n     fund it.\n       Meanwhile, Mr. Axelrod's old firm was hired to run the ads \n     promoting ObamaCare. At the time, a HEN spokesman said HEN \n     had done the hiring. But the emails suggest otherwise. In \n     email after email, the contributors to HEN refer to four men \n     as the ``White House'' team running health care.\n       In one email, PhRMA consultant Steve McMahon calls these \n     four the ``WH-designated folks.'' He explains to colleagues \n     that Messrs. Grossman, Grisolano and Del Cecato ``are very \n     close to Axelrod,'' and that ``they have been put in charge \n     of the campaign to pass health reform.''\n       A 2009 PhRMA memo also makes clear that AKPD had been \n     chosen before PhRMA joined HEN. It's also clear that some \n     contributors didn't like the conflict of interest. When, in \n     July 2009, a media outlet prepared to report AKPD's hiring, a \n     PhRMA participant said: ``This is a big problem.'' Mr. \n     Baldick advises: ``just say, AKPD is not working for PhRMA.'' \n     AKPD and another firm, GMMB, would handle $12 million in ad \n     business from HEN and work for a successor 501(c)4.\n       A basic rule of White House ethics is to avoid even the \n     appearance of self-dealing or nepotism. Could you imagine the \n     press frenzy if Karl Rove had done the same after he joined \n     the White House?\n       Until the White House explains all this, voters can fairly \n     conclude that the President's political team took their \n     Chicago brand of ethics into the White House.''\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na New York Times article, June 8, 2012; a Wall Street Journal article, \nJune 11, 2012; and June 21 Wall Street Journal editorial, and the memos \nabout the e-mails associated with this report.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     May 16, 2012.\n     To: Energy and Commerce Committee Republican Members\n     From: Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations Majority \n         Staff\n     Re Investigation Update: Closed-Door Obamacare Negotiations\n       From: Messina, Jim\n       Sent: Friday, January 15, 2010 6:04 PM\n       To: Bryant Hall\n       Subject: FW: TAUZIN EMAIL\n       What the hell? This wasn't part of our deal.\n\n\n                                Overview\n\n       The purpose of this memorandum is to update Republican \n     Members on the Energy and Commerce Committee on the \n     Committee's ongoing investigation into the potential \n     agreements made by the White House and health care industry \n     stakeholders prior to passage of the Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act (PPACA). As reported on April 17, 2012, \n     the Committee's investigation is attempting to answer the \n     following questions:\n       Were ``deals'' made between the Administration and outside \n     stakeholders that exchanged specific policy outcomes for \n     public support of the law?\n       Who made these deals, and to what extent was Congress \n     excluded?\n       What specifically was negotiated by the White House and \n     these outside interests? What policies are now law as a \n     result of these negotiations, and what did the White House \n     obtain in exchange?\n       This investigation has produced further information \n     regarding the substance of the ``deal'' between the White \n     House and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of America \n     (PhRMA), the details of which have never been fully disclosed \n     to the public. Further, based on email exchanges and other \n     primary source material, it appears that deal was reached not \n     solely between PhRMA and the United States Senate Finance \n     Committee, but that top personnel in the White House were \n     involved in negotiating and approving this deal. The \n     following update is based on internal records obtained from \n     outside stakeholders who engaged in negotiations outside the \n     public's view during the development and passage of PPACA.\n\n\n                          I. Was there a deal?\n\n       The existence of an agreement or series of agreements \n     between powerful health care industry stakeholders and the \n     authors of PPACA is a widely known--albeit poorly \n     understood--aspect of the health care law. Media accounts \n     dating back to 2009 speculated on the existence and details \n     of such deals leading up to the law's enactment. However, \n     those accounts have lacked concrete evidence of exactly what \n     policies the White House accepted or rejected as part of \n     these agreements, and what the interest groups delivered in \n     return. Moreover, media accounts and public statements from \n     policymakers at the time were often conflicting or \n     incomplete, failing to provide a clear picture to the \n     American people about how this law was being written, and by \n     whom.\n       For example, while President Obama referred to the \n     agreement in June 2009, reports at the time also indicated \n     that ``many details of the . . . deal remained unclear.'' A \n     month later, The Wall Street Journal reported that House \n     Democrats had been told that the Administration ``doesn't \n     feel bound'' by the agreement. Because of increased pressure \n     from the Hill to scuttle the agreement, eventually the White \n     House attempted to publicly support the deal in early August \n     when The New York Times reported that the drug industry ``. . \n     . successfully demanded that the White House explicitly \n     acknowledge for the first time it had committed to protect \n     drug makers. . . .'' Yet, a week later reports still \n     indicated that ``[s]ince mid-July, the White House and the \n     drug industry's lobby, PhRMA, have denied any specific \n     agreement. . . .''\n       This investigation has confirmed the existence of a deal \n     between the White House and PhRMA that explicitly bound both \n     parties to certain commitments. As the email exchange at the \n     top of this memorandum demonstrates, the deal was so clearly \n     understood to be binding that White House Deputy Chief of \n     Staff Jim Messina made direct contact with PhRMA's chief \n     lobbyist for the negotiations regarding the deal to express \n     his displeasure with an apparent violation of the agreement \n     more than two months before the legislation was given final \n     approval by Congress.\n\n\n           II. Why did the White House hide its involvement?\n\n       On June 20, 2009, the White House issued a 296-word \n     statement from President Obama announcing an agreement \n     between the nation's pharmaceutical companies and the Senate. \n     The statement makes no mention of White House involvement.\n       The investigation has determined that the White House, \n     primarily through the Office of Health Reform Director Nancy \n     Ann DeParle and Messina, with involvement from Chief of Staff \n     Rahm Emmanuel, was actively engaged in these negotiations \n     while the role of Congress was limited. For example, three \n     days before the June 20 statement, the head of PhRMA promised \n     Messina, ``we will deliver a final yes to you by morning.'' \n     Meanwhile, Ms. DeParle all but confirmed that half of the \n     Legislative Branch was shut out in an email to a PhRMA \n     representative: ``I think we should have included the House \n     in the discussions, but maybe we never would have gotten \n     anywhere if we had.''\n       Given these facts, it is unclear why the White House did \n     not fully disclose its involvement with outside stakeholders \n     in the development of the legislation. Their efforts are \n     particularly surprising given the President's repeated \n     promises of transparency.\n       After this Committee initiated its investigation into the \n     potential promises or agreements made between PhRMA, labor \n     unions, insurers, medical associations, and other trade and \n     advocacy organizations, the White House derided the \n     Committee's request for basic information about its \n     legislative efforts as ``vast and expensive.'' The White \n     House refused to produce any of the requested documents and \n     only produced to the Committee a list of meetings based on \n     ``calendar entries and other readily available information.'' \n     These calendar entries do not provide information on the \n     attendees or details of discussion. For example, the calendar \n     provided by the White House identifies a July 7, 2009, event \n     as follows: ``Meeting with PhRMA representatives.'' No \n     further information is provided. This investigation, however, \n     has revealed that this was not only a meeting between \n     representatives of PhRMA and top White House aides; it was \n     the critical meeting to solidify the deal. As a PhRMA \n     representative said at the time: ``It's just to go over the \n     principal elements of the deal w[ith] Rahm, Messina and \n     DeParle. ''\n\n\n              III. What did the White House promise to do?\n\n       Even news stories that indicated that there was a potential \n     agreement with the pharmaceutical industry could not report \n     the entirety of the agreement. The August New York Times \n     story that reported White House acknowledgment of the deal \n     ``for the first time'' could not report any specifics \n     ``beyond an agreed-upon $80 billion'' in cost savings. This \n     investigation will show that the agreement between the White \n     House and the pharmaceutical industry was much more explicit. \n     In the coming weeks the Committee intends to show what the \n     White House agreed to do as part of its deal with the \n     pharmaceutical industry and how the full details of this \n     agreement were kept from both the public and the House of \n     Representatives.\n       After two years, the health care law has failed to lower \n     costs while only increasing its unpopularity with the public. \n     According to a PhRMA official: ``[W]e got a good deal.''\n       The important question to answer is what did the White \n     House get in return.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     May 31, 2012.\n     To: Energy and Commerce Committee Republican Members\n     From: Majority Staff\n     Re Investigation Update: Closed-Door Obamacare Negotiations\n\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       The White House negotiated a deal with the Pharmaceutical \n     Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) in mid-June \n     2009. After attempting to secure a commitment from the \n     industry for $100 billion in payment cuts, eventually the \n     White House settled for approximately $80 billion in payment \n     reductions through expanded and increased Medicaid rebates \n     and a new health reform fee. PhRMA also had direct input into \n     the actual legislative policies that produced the $80 \n     billion, including the proposal for closing the Part D \n     doughnut hole.\n       Under the deal, ``the White House and Senator Baucus \n     agreed'' that neither price controls nor a government-run \n     Medicare Part D\n\n[[Page S4444]]\n\n     plan would become law, the White House would oppose price \n     controls on dual eligible beneficiaries, and that savings \n     from a follow-on biologics proposal would be applied to the \n     total $80 billion commitment.\n       White House Office of Health Reform Director Nancy-Ann \n     DeParle told PhRMA's chief lobbyist for negotiating the deal \n     that the White House would oppose new drug importation \n     policies because of ``how constructive'' PhRMA had been. \n     According to PhRMA's lobbyist, White House Deputy Chief of \n     Staff Jim Messina told him that the ``WH is working on some \n     very explicit language on importation to kill it in health \n     reform.''\n       According to internal e-mails, PhRMA's chief lobbyist \n     believed the White House eventually cut a deal with the \n     pharmaceutical industry during the week of June 20, 2009, \n     because the White House had suffered a bad week politically.\n       Despite countless promises of televised negotiations and \n     transparent government, the White House met in private with \n     PhRMA representatives and drug company CEOs in July 2009, \n     ``to look the other side in the eye and shake their hand on \n     whatever deal we work out.''\n       The White House was not above threatening PhRMA to get its \n     way. According to PhRMA's chief lobbyist, the White House was \n     going to have President Obama call for rebating all of \n     Medicare Part D, a policy PhRMA staunchly opposed, in his \n     Weekly Radio Address unless PhRMA cut a deal with the White \n     House to support health reform.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     June 8, 2012.\n     To: Energy and Commerce Committee Republican Members\n     From: Majority Staff\n     Re: Investigation Update: Closed-Door Obamacare Negotiations\n\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       As part of its agreement with the White House, the \n     Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) \n     needed to undertake a ``significant public campaign.'' PhRMA \n     was willing to spend as much as $150 million on advertising, \n     with nearly $70 million spent on two 501(c)(4) groups that \n     could spend unlimited corporate money with little public \n     disclosure: Healthy Economy Now and Americans for Stable \n     Quality Care.\n       Healthy Economy Now was created after a meeting at the \n     Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) organized in \n     part by White House Deputy Chief of Staff Jim Messina. \n     Participants were told that the White House wanted to see ads \n     linking the poor economy to the need for health care \n     legislation, with one attendee remarking that ``given who is \n     behind this ask'' their group should support the effort.\n       In early June 2009, PhRMA representatives met with ``the \n     team that is working with the White House on health care \n     reform'' to learn about White House messaging and ``how our \n     effort can be consistent with that.'' The team was a who's \n     who of Democratic strategists that included a previous head \n     of the DSCC; the producer of the 2008 Democratic National \n     Convention; and two partners at AKPD Message and Media, the \n     advertising firm founded by then Senior Advisor to the \n     President David Axelrod.\n       When PhRMA's representative indicated that PhRMA was not \n     prepared to run advertisements before seeing how the health \n     care legislation developed, the White House team specifically \n     referred to a meeting the PhRMA CEOs had with Jim Messina the \n     day before and to White House efforts on drug importation \n     policy which had been communicated to PhRMA's chief lobbyist \n     that day.\n       PhRMA's chief lobbyist reported that White House Chief of \n     Staff Rahm Emanuel asked for ``Harry and Louise ads thru \n     third party'' on July 7, 2009, the same day White House \n     officials met with PhRMA CEOs. PhRMA aired the ad a week \n     later.\n       Public revelations about the hiring of political firms \n     close to the White House were perceived to be a ``big \n     problem.'' Presumably, because the firms producing and \n     placing some of PhRMA's advertising, including the \n     advertising through both Healthy Economy Now and Americans \n     for Stable Quality Care, had also received over $340 million \n     to handle advertising for President Obama's 2008 election \n     campaign.\n       The White House attempted to steer the advertising and \n     advocacy tactics of a number of organizations, including the \n     AFL-CIO and AARP.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 11, 2012]\n\n ObamaCare's Secret History--How a Pfizer CEO and Big Pharma Colluded \n             With the White House at the Public's Expense.\n\n       On Friday House Republicans released more documents that \n     expose the collusion between the health-care industry and the \n     White House that produced ObamaCare, and what a story of \n     crony capitalism it is. If the trove of emails proves \n     anything, it's that the Tea Party isn't angry enough.\n       Over the last year, the Energy and Commerce Committee has \n     taken Nancy Pelosi's advice to see what's in the Affordable \n     Care Act and how it passed. The White House refused to \n     cooperate beyond printing out old press releases, but a dozen \n     trade groups turned over thousands of emails and other files. \n     A particular focus is the drug lobby, President Obama's most \n     loyal corporate ally in 2009 and 2010.\n       The business refrain in those days was that if you're not \n     at the table, you're on the menu. But it turns out Big Pharma \n     was also serving as head chef, matre d'hotel and dishwasher. \n     Though some parts of the story have been reported before, the \n     emails make clear that ObamaCare might never have passed \n     without the drug companies. Thank you, Pfizer.\n       The joint venture was forged in secret in spring 2009 amid \n     an uneasy mix of menace and opportunism. The drug makers \n     worried that health-care reform would revert to the liberal \n     default of price controls and drug re-importation that Mr. \n     Obama campaigned on, but they also understood that a new \n     entitlement could be a windfall as taxpayers bought more of \n     their products. The White House wanted industry financial \n     help and knew that determined business opposition could tank \n     the bill.\n       Initially, the Obamateers and Senate Finance Chairman Max \n     Baucus asked for $100 billion, 90% of it from mandatory \n     ``rebates'' through the Medicare prescription drug benefit \n     like those that are imposed in Medicaid. The drug makers \n     wheedled them down to $80 billion by offsetting cost-sharing \n     for seniors on Medicare, in an explicit quid pro quo for \n     protection against such rebates and re-importation. As \n     Pfizer's then-CEO Jeff Kindler put it, ``our key deal points \n     . . . are, to some extent, as important as the total \n     dollars.'' Mr. Kindler played a more influential role than we \n     understood before, as the emails show.\n       Thus began a close if sometimes dysfunctional relationship \n     with the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of \n     America, or PhRMA, as led by Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana \n     Democrat turned Republican turned lobbyist. As a White House \n     staffer put it in May 2009, ``Rahm's calling Nancy-Ann and \n     knows Billy is going to talk to Nancy-Ann tonight. Rahm will \n     make it clear that PhRMA needs a direct line of \n     communication, separate and apart from any coalition.'' \n     Nancy-Ann is Nancy-Ann DeParle, the White House health reform \n     director, and Rahm is, of course, Rahm.\n       Terms were reached in June. Mr. Kindler's chief of staff \n     wrote a memo to her industry colleagues explaining that \n     ``Jeff would object to me telling you that his communication \n     skills and breadth of knowledge on the issues was very \n     helpful in keeping the meeting productive.'' Soon the White \n     House leaked the details to show that reform was making \n     health-care progress, and lead PhRMA negotiator Bryant Hall \n     wrote on June 12 that Mr. Obama ``knows personally about our \n     deal and is pushing no agenda.''\n       But Energy and Commerce Chairman Henry Waxman then \n     announced that he was pocketing PhRMA's concessions and \n     demanding more, including re-importation. We wrote about the \n     double-cross in a July 16, 2009 editorial called ``Big Pharma \n     Gets Played,'' noting that Mr. Tauzin's ``corporate clients \n     and their shareholders may soon pay for his attempt to get \n     cozy with ObamaCare.''\n       Mr. Hall forwarded the piece to Ms. DeParle with the \n     subject line, ``This sucks.'' The duo commiserated about how \n     unreasonable House Democrats are, unlike Mr. Baucus and the \n     Senators. The full exchange is among the excerpts from the \n     emails printed nearby.\n       Then New York Times reporter Duff Wilson wrote to a PhRMA \n     spokesman, ``Tony, you see the WSJ editorial, `Big Pharma \n     Gets Played' ''? I'm doing a story along that line for \n     Monday.'' The drug dealers had a problem.\n       The White House rode to the rescue. In September Mr. Hall \n     informed Mr. Kindler that deputy White House chief of staff \n     Jim Messina ``is working on some very explicit language on \n     importation to kill it in health care reform. This has to \n     stay quiet.''\n       PhRMA more than repaid the favor, with a $150 million \n     advertising campaign coordinated with the White House \n     political shop. As one of Mr. Hall's deputies put it earlier \n     in the minutes of a meeting when the deal was being \n     negotiated, ``The WH-designated folks . . . would like us to \n     start to define what `consensus health care reform' means, \n     and what it might include. . . . They definitely want us in \n     the game and on the same side.''\n       In particular, the drug lobby would spend $70 million on \n     two 501(c)(4) front groups called Healthy Economy Now and \n     Americans for Stable Quality Care. In July, Mr. Hall wrote \n     that ``Rahm asked for Harry and Louise ads thru third party. \n     We've already contacted the agent.''\n       Mr. Messina--known as ``the fixer'' in the West Wing--asked \n     on December 15, 2009, ``Can we get immediate robo calls in \n     Nebraska urging nelson to vote for cloture?'' Ben Nelson was \n     the last Democratic holdout toward the Senate's 60-vote \n     threshold, and, as Mr. Messina wrote, ``We are at 59, we have \n     to have him.'' They got him.\n       At least PhRMA deserves backhanded credit for the \n     competence of its political operatives--unlike, say, the \n     American Medical Association. A thread running through the \n     emails is a hapless AMA lobbyist importuning Ms. DeParle and \n     Mr. Messina for face-to-face meetings to discuss reforming \n     the Medicare physician payment formula. The AMA supported \n     ObamaCare in return for this ``doc fix,'' which it never got.\n       ``We are running out of time,'' this lobbyist, Richard \n     Deem, writes in October 2009. How can he ``tell my colleagues \n     at AMA headquarters to proceed with $2m TV buy'' without a \n     permanent fix? The question answers itself: It was only $2 \n     million.\n\n[[Page S4445]]\n\n       Mr. Waxman recently put out a rebuttal memo dismissing \n     these email revelations as routine, ``exactly what Presidents \n     have always done to enact major legislation.'' Which is \n     precisely the point--the normality is the scandal. In 2003 \n     PhRMA took a similar road trip with the Bush Republicans to \n     create the Medicare drug benefit. That effort included \n     building public support by heavily funding a shell outfit \n     called Citizens for a Better Medicare.\n       Of course Democrats claim to be above this kind of merger \n     of private profits and political power, as Mr. Obama did as a \n     candidate. ``The pharmaceutical industry wrote into the \n     prescription drug plan that Medicare could not negotiate with \n     drug companies,'' he said in 2008. ``And you know what? The \n     chairman of the committee who pushed the law through''--that \n     would be Mr. Tauzin--``went to work for the pharmaceutical \n     industry making $2 million a year.''\n       Outrage over this kind of cronyism is what animates the Tea \n     Party and Occupy Wall Street, whose members aren't powerful \n     enough to get special dispensations from the government--or \n     even a fair hearing from their putative representatives.\n       In one email, an AARP lobbyist writes the White House to \n     say ``We really need to talk,'' noting that calls from \n     seniors are running 14 to one against ObamaCare. But she \n     isn't calling to say that AARP is withdrawing support--only \n     that the White House needs to adjust its messaging. This is \n     how a bill passes over the objections of most Americans.\n       The lesson for Republicans if they do end up running the \n     country next year is that their job is to restore the free \n     and fair market that creates broad-based economic growth. The \n     temptation will be to return for the sake of power to the \n     methods of Tom DeLay and Jack Abramoff. If they do, voters \n     will return the GOP to private life as surely as they did the \n     Democrats in 2010.\n       The warning to business is also fundamental. Crony \n     capitalism undermines public trust in capitalism itself and \n     risks blowback that erodes the free market that private \n     companies need to prosper and that underlies the productivity \n     and competitiveness of the U.S. economy. The political \n     benefits of cronyism are inherently temporary, but the damage \n     it does is far more lasting.\n       As for Big Pharma, the lobby ultimately staved off Mr. \n     Waxman's revolt and avoided some truly harmful drug \n     policies--for now. But over the long term their products are \n     far more vulnerable to the command-and-control central \n     planning that will erode medical innovation, and their $80 \n     billion fillip is merely the teaser rate.\n       Mr. Kindler resigned from Pfizer in December 2010 under \n     pressure from directors, its stock having lost 35% of its \n     value since he became CEO. Mr. Tauzin left PhRMA in February \n     2010, with the Affordable Care Act a month from passage.\n       The truth is that this destructive legislation wasn't \n     inevitable and far better reforms were possible. They still \n     are, though they might have gained more traction in 2009 and \n     2010 with the right support. The miracle is that, despite \n     this collusion of big government and big business, ObamaCare \n     has received the public scorn that it deserves.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 8, 2012]\n\n        Lobby E-Mails Show Depth of Obama Ties to Drug Industry\n\n                            (By Peter Baker)\n\n       Washington.--After weeks of quiet talks, drug industry \n     lobbyists were growing nervous. If they were to cut a deal \n     with the White House on overhauling health care, they needed \n     to be sure President Obama would stop a proposal by his \n     liberal allies intended to bring down medicine prices.\n       On June 3, 2009, one of the lobbyists e-mailed Nancy-Ann \n     DeParle, the president's top health care adviser. Ms. DeParle \n     sent a message back reassuring the lobbyist. Although Mr. \n     Obama was overseas, she wrote, she and other top officials \n     had ``made decision, based on how constructive you guys have \n     been, to oppose importation on the bill.''\n       Just like that, Mr. Obama's staff abandoned his support for \n     the reimportation of prescription medicines at lower prices \n     and with it solidified a growing compact with an industry he \n     had vilified on the campaign trail the year before. Central \n     to Mr. Obama's drive to overhaul the nation's health care \n     system was an unlikely collaboration with the pharmaceutical \n     industry that forced unappealing trade-offs.\n       The e-mail exchange that day three years ago was among a \n     cache of messages obtained from the industry and released in \n     recent weeks by House Republicans--including a new batch put \n     out on Friday morning detailing the industry's advertising \n     campaign in favor of Mr. Obama's proposal. The broad contours \n     of the president's dealings with the drug industry were known \n     in 2009 but the newly public e-mails open a window into the \n     compromises underlying a health care overhaul now awaiting \n     the judgment of the Supreme Court.\n       Mr. Obama's deal-making in 2009 represented a pivotal \n     moment in his young presidency, a juncture where the heady \n     idealism of the campaign trail collided with the messy \n     reality of Washington policymaking. A president who had \n     promised to air negotiations on C-Span cut a closed-door deal \n     with the powerful pharmaceutical lobby, signifying to some \n     disillusioned liberal supporters a loss of innocence, or \n     perhaps even the triumph of cynicism.\n       But if it was a Faustian bargain for the president, it was \n     one he deemed necessary to forestall industry opposition that \n     had thwarted efforts to cover the uninsured for generations. \n     Without the deal, in which the industry agreed to provide $80 \n     billion for health reform in exchange for protection from \n     policies that would cost more, Mr. Obama and Democratic \n     allies calculated he might get nowhere.\n       ``There was no way we had the votes in either the House or \n     the Senate if PhRMA was opposed--period,'' said a senior \n     Democratic official involved in the talks, referring to the \n     Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the \n     drug industry trade group.\n       Republicans see the deal as hypocritical. ``He said it was \n     going to be the most open and honest and transparent \n     administration ever and lobbyists won't be drafting the \n     bills,'' said Representative Michael C. Burgess of Texas, one \n     of the Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce \n     subcommittee that is examining the deal. ``Then when it came \n     time, the door closed, the lobbyists came in and the bills \n     were written.''\n       Some of the liberals bothered by the deal-making in 2009 \n     now find the Republican criticism hard to take given the \n     party's long-standing ties to the pharmaceutical industry.\n       ``Republicans trumpeting these e-mails is like a fox \n     complaining someone else raided the chicken coop,'' said \n     Robert Reich, the former labor secretary under President Bill \n     Clinton. ``Sad to say, it's called politics in an era when \n     big corporations have an effective veto over major \n     legislation affecting them and when the G.O.P. is usually the \n     beneficiary. In this instance, the G.O.P. was outfoxed. Who \n     are they to complain?''\n       Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director, said \n     the collaboration with industry was in keeping with the \n     president's promise to build consensus.\n       ``Throughout his campaign, President Obama was clear that \n     he would bring every stakeholder to the table in order to \n     pass health reform, even longtime opponents like the \n     pharmaceutical industry,'' Mr. Pfeiffer said. ``He understood \n     correctly that the unwillingness to work with people on both \n     sides of the issue was one of the reasons why it took a \n     century to pass health reform.''\n       In a statement, PhRMA said that its interactions with Mr. \n     Obama's White House were part of its mission to ``ensure \n     patient access'' to quality medicine and to advance medical \n     progress.\n       ``Before, during and since the health care debate, PhRMA \n     engaged with Congress and the administration to advance these \n     priorities,'' said Matthew Bennett, the group's senior vice \n     president.\n       Representative Henry Waxman of California, the top Democrat \n     on the House committee and one of those who balked at Mr. \n     Obama's deal in 2009, now defends it as traditional \n     Washington lawmaking.\n       ``Presidents have routinely sought the support and lobbying \n     clout of private industry in passing major legislation,'' Mr. \n     Waxman's committee staff said in a memo released in response \n     to the e-mails. ``President Obama's actions, for example, are \n     no different than those of President Lyndon B. Johnson in \n     enacting Medicare in 1965 or President George W. Bush in \n     expanding Medicare to add a prescription drug benefit in \n     2003.''\n       Still, what distinguishes the Obama-industry deal is that \n     he had so strongly rejected that very sort of business as \n     usual. During his campaign for president, he specifically \n     singled out the power of the pharmaceutical industry and its \n     chief lobbyist, former Representative Billy Tauzin, a \n     Democrat-turned-Republican from Louisiana, as examples of \n     what he wanted to change.\n       ``The pharmaceutical industry wrote into the prescription \n     drug plan that Medicare could not negotiate with drug \n     companies,'' Mr. Obama said in a campaign advertisement, \n     referring to Mr. Bush's 2003 legislation. ``And you know \n     what? The chairman of the committee who pushed the law \n     through went to work for the pharmaceutical industry making \n     $2 million a year.\n       ``Imagine that,'' Mr. Obama continued. ``That's an example \n     of the same old game playing in Washington. You know, I don't \n     want to learn how to play the game better. I want to put an \n     end to the game playing.''\n       After arriving at the White House, though, he and his \n     advisers soon determined that one reason Mr. Clinton had \n     failed to pass health care reform was the resilient \n     opposition of industry. Led by Rahm Emanuel, his chief of \n     staff and a former House leader, and Jim Messina, his deputy, \n     White House officials set out to change that dynamic.\n       The e-mails, which the House committee obtained from PhRMA \n     and other groups after the White House declined to provide \n     correspondence, document a tumultuous negotiation, at times \n     transactional, at others prickly. Each side suspected the \n     other of betraying trust and operating in bad faith.\n       The White House depicted in the message traffic comes \n     across as deeply involved in the give-and-take, and not \n     averse to pressure tactics, including having Mr. Obama \n     publicly assail the industry unless it gave in on key points. \n     In the end, the White House got the support it needed to pass \n     its broader priority, but industry emerged satisfied as well. \n     ``We got a good deal,'' wrote Bryant Hall, then senior vice \n     president of the pharmaceutical group.\n       Mr. Bryant, now head of his own firm, declined to comment. \n     So did Mr. Emanuel, now mayor of Chicago; Mr. Messina, now \n     the president's campaign manager; and Ms. DeParle, now a \n     White House deputy chief of\n\n[[Page S4446]]\n\n     staff. Mr. Tauzin, who has left his post as the industry's \n     lobbyist, did not respond to messages.\n       The latest e-mails released on Friday underscore the \n     detailed discussions the two sides had about an advertising \n     campaign supporting Mr. Obama's health overhaul.``They plan \n     to hit up the `bad guys' for most of the $,'' a union \n     official wrote after an April meeting with Mr. Messina and \n     Senate Democratic aides. ``They want us to just put in enough \n     to be able to put our names in it--he is thinking @100K.''\n       In July, the White House made clear that it wanted \n     supportive ads using the same characters the industry used to \n     defeat Mr. Clinton's proposal 15 years earlier. ``Rahm asked \n     for Harry and Louise ads thru third party,'' Mr. Hall wrote.\n       Industry and Democratic officials said privately that the \n     advertising campaign was an outgrowth of the fundamental \n     deal, not the goal of it. The industry traditionally \n     advertises in favor of legislation it supports.\n       Either way, talks came close to breaking down several \n     times. In May, the White House was upset that the industry \n     had not signed onto a joint statement. One industry official \n     wrote that they should sign: ``Rahm is already furious. The \n     ire will be turned on us.''\n       By June, it came to a head again. ``Barack Obama is going \n     to announce in his Saturday radio address support for \n     rebating all of D unless we come to a deal,'' Mr. Hall wrote, \n     referring to a change in Medicare Part D that would cost the \n     industry.\n       In the end, the two sides averted the public confrontation \n     and negotiated down to $80 billion from $100 billion. But the \n     industry believed the White House was rushing an announcement \n     to deflect political criticism.\n       ``It's pretty clear that the administration has had a \n     horrible week on health care reform, and we are now getting \n     jammed to make this announcement so the story takes a \n     positive turn before the Sunday talk shows beat up on \n     Congress and the White House,'' wrote Ken Johnson, a senior \n     vice president of the pharmaceutical organization.\n       In the end, House Democrats imposed some additional costs \n     on the industry that by one estimate pushed the cost above \n     $100 billion, but the more sweeping policies the firms wanted \n     to avoid remained out of the legislation. Mr. Obama signed \n     the bill in March. He had the victory he wanted.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 22, 2012]\n\n                 Strassel: Axelrod's ObamaCare Dollars\n\n                       (By Kimberley A. Strassel)\n\n       Emails suggest the White House pushed business to the \n     presidential adviser's former firm to sell the health-care \n     law.\n       Rewind to 2009. The fight over ObamaCare is raging, and a \n     few news outlets report that something looks ethically rotten \n     in the White House. An outside group funded by industry is \n     paying the former firm of senior presidential adviser David \n     Axelrod to run ads in favor of the bill. That firm, AKPD \n     Message and Media, still owes Mr. Axelrod money and employs \n     his son.\n       The story quickly died, but emails recently released by the \n     House Energy and Commerce Committee ought to resurrect it. \n     The emails suggest the White House was intimately involved \n     both in creating this lobby and hiring Mr. Axelrod's firm--\n     which is as big an ethical no-no as it gets.\n       Mr. Axelrod--who left the White House last year--started \n     AKPD in 1985. The firm earned millions helping run Barack \n     Obama's 2008 campaign. Mr. Axelrod moved to the White House \n     in 2009 and agreed to have AKPD buy him out for $2 million. \n     But AKPD chose to pay Mr. Axelrod in annual installments--\n     even as he worked in the West Wing. This agreement somehow \n     passed muster with the Office of Government Ethics, though \n     the situation at the very least should have walled off AKPD \n     from working on White-House priorities.\n       It didn't. The White House and industry were working hand-\n     in-glove to pass ObamaCare in 2009, and among the vehicles \n     supplying ad support was an outfit named Healthy Economy Now \n     (HEN). News stories at the time described this as a \n     ``coalition'' that included the Pharmaceutical Research and \n     Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the American Medical \n     Association, and labor groups--suggesting these entities had \n     started and controlled it.\n       House emails show HEN was in fact born at an April 15, 2009 \n     meeting arranged by then-White House aide Jim Messina and a \n     chief of staff for Democratic Sen. Max Baucus. The two \n     politicos met at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee \n     (DSCC) and invited representatives of business and labor.\n       A Service Employees International Union attendee sent an \n     email to colleagues noting she'd been invited by the Baucus \n     staffer, explaining: ``Also present was Jim Messina. . . . \n     They basically want to see adds linking HC reform to the \n     economy . . . there were not a lot of details, but we were \n     told that we would be getting a phone call. Well that call \n     came today.''\n       The call was from Nick Baldick, a Democratic consultant who \n     had worked on the Obama campaign and for the DSCC. Mr. \n     Baldick started HEN. The only job of PhRMA and others was to \n     fund it.\n       Meanwhile, Mr. Axelrod's old firm was hired to run the ads \n     promoting ObamaCare. At the time, a HEN spokesman said HEN \n     had done the hiring. But the emails suggest otherwise. In \n     email after email, the contributors to HEN refer to four men \n     as the ``White House'' team running health care. They \n     included John Del Cecato and Larry Grisolano (partners at \n     AKPD), as well as Andy Grossman (who once ran the DSCC) and \n     Erik Smith, who had been a paid adviser to the Obama \n     presidential campaign.\n       In one email, PhRMA consultant Steve McMahon calls these \n     four the ``WH-designated folks.'' He explains to colleagues \n     that Messrs. Grossman, Grisolano and Del Cecato ``are very \n     close to Axelrod,'' and that ``they have been put in charge \n     of the campaign to pass health reform.'' Ron Pollack, whose \n     Families USA was part of the HEN coalition, explained to \n     colleagues that ``the team that is working with the White \n     House on health-care reform. . . . [Grossman, Smith, Del \n     Cecato, Grisolano] . . . would like to get together with \n     us.'' This would provide ``guidance from the White House \n     about their messaging.''\n       According to White House visitor logs, Mr. Smith had 28 \n     appointments scheduled between May and August--17 made \n     through Mr. Messina or his assistant. Mr. Grossman appears in \n     the logs at least 19 times. Messrs. Del Cecato and Grisolano \n     of AKPD also visited in the spring and summer, at least twice \n     with Mr. Axelrod, who was deep in the health-care fight.\n       A 2009 PhRMA memo also makes clear that AKPD had been \n     chosen before PhRMA joined HEN. It's also clear that some \n     contributors didn't like the conflict of interest. When, in \n     July 2009, a media outlet prepared to report AKPD's hiring, a \n     PhRMA participant said: ``This is a big problem.'' Mr. \n     Baldick advises: ``just say, AKPD is not working for PhRMA.'' \n     AKPD and another firm, GMMB, would handle $12 million in ad \n     business from HEN and work for a successor 501(c)4.\n       A basic rule of White House ethics is to avoid even the \n     appearance of self-dealing or nepotism. If Mr. Axelrod or his \n     West Wing chums pushed political business toward Mr. \n     Axelrod's former firm, they contributed to his son's salary \n     as well as to the ability of the firm to pay Mr. Axelrod what \n     it still owed him. Could you imagine the press frenzy if Karl \n     Rove had done the same after he joined the White House?\n       Messrs. Axelrod and Messina are now in Chicago running Mr. \n     Obama's campaign. Mr. Axelrod, the White House and a partner \n     for AKPD didn't respond to requests for comment on their role \n     in HEN, the tapping of Mr. Baldick, and the redolent hiring \n     of AKPD. Until the White House explains all this, voters can \n     fairly conclude that the President's political team took \n     their Chicago brand of ethics into the White House.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I know my other colleagues are waiting to \nspeak, but last month when we voted down this amendment to allow drug \nreimportation from pharmacies that are accredited by both the Canadian \nand American Governments, my statement was, and I will repeat it:\n\n       In a normal world, this would probably require a voice \n     vote. But what we are about to see is the incredible \n     influence of the special interests, particularly PhRMA, here \n     in Washington.\n       What you are about to see [as I predicted just before the \n     vote] is the reason for the cynicism the American people have \n     about the way we do business in Washington. PhRMA--one of the \n     most powerful lobbies in Washington--will exert its influence \n     again at the expense of average low-income Americans who \n     will, again, have to choose between medication and eating.\n\n  In response the Senator from New Jersey said, in opposition to my \namendment:\n\n       It is not the special interests that have caused the Senate \n     countless times to reject this policy. . . . .\n       This is about the health and security of the American \n     people. That is why time after time the Senate has rejected \n     it. It is why it should be rejected once again.\n\n  He was correct. It was rejected. The American people were rejected in \nfavor of one of the most powerful special interest lobbies in \nWashington and it is a shame.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin).

Mr. President, I now move to proceed to Calendar No. 341, \nS. 2237.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 341, S. 2237, a bill to \n     provide a temporary income tax credit for increased payroll \n     and extend bonus depreciation for an additional year, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                            Flood Insurance\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise in support of a bill we will take \nup soon to reauthorize the Flood Insurance Program. Nine months ago the \nSenate Banking Committee passed long-term flood insurance \nreauthorization with overwhelming bipartisan support. Five months ago \nSenator Vitter and I, along with 39 Members of this body, wrote our \nleadership urging that the bill be brought to the floor, but today, \nthis week, we will finally consider this much needed piece of \nlegislation, and I thank Senator Reid for his willingness to bring it \nto the Senate floor.\n  I want to first and foremost thank Chairman Johnson and Ranking \nMember Shelby for their excellent work in drafting this bill. I commend \nthem for their efforts to build consensus on this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  I thank my colleague Senator Vitter for his leadership and \npartnership in working with me to help influence this bill in a way \nthat reflects broad bipartisan support. Together we added a number of \nprovisions to improve the initial draft. These provisions include one \nthat addresses a critical issue in my State.\n  When this bill is passed, the Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA will \nfinally have to work together to develop common standards that will \nallow existing Corps levee inspections to meet FEMA certification \ncriteria.\n  We also lengthened the phase-in period for homeowners who must \npurchase flood insurance for the first time as a result of being mapped \ninto a floodplain, so that as changes to the maps occur, folks are not \nforced immediately into high-priced premiums.\n  This bill takes important steps to more closely align risks with \npremiums. It makes changes to protect taxpayers, and it puts the \nprogram on a more solid financial ground.\n  The House and Senate have never produced two flood insurance bills as \nclosely aligned as the bills we have before us, and I am not sure we \nhave ever had the same strong broad support we have now from \nhomeowners, realtors, insurers, state insurance regulators, and \nenvironmental groups. That is a real testament to my colleagues on the \nBanking Committee, and I look forward to finally sending a long-term \nreauthorization and reform bill to the President's desk for his \nsignature.\n  Unfortunately, we have seen the consequences of reauthorizing this \nprogram on a short-term basis, and we have seen the consequences of \nletting this program lapse. We have been down that road before and have \nseen how unproductive and destructive lapses can be. Past lapses in the \nprogram created uncertainty for homeowners and created significant \nburdens for those participating in the Flood Insurance Program. When \nthe program lapsed in 2010, about 1,400 home sales were canceled each \nday during those 53 days the program lapsed. At a time when the housing \nmarket is still fragile, this is something we cannot afford.\n  For me this is an issue that hits home. The unprecedented flooding in \nthe Missouri River basin last year, which affected folks throughout \ncentral and eastern Montana, particularly in Musselshell and Carbon \nCounties, clearly demonstrates the need for reauthorization and for \nreforms to ensure that levees are certified properly and efficiently.\n  I also care deeply about this program because in addition to \nprotecting Montana homeowners, there are jobs tied directly to the \nFlood Insurance Program. In Kalispell, MT, two of the national \nservicing organizations employ over 500 people--jobs that could be put \nin jeopardy without a long-term agreement.\n  We must offer Americans certainty in the face of risk. Now, at long \nlast, comprehensive, bipartisan, long-term reauthorization of the \nNational Flood Insurance Program is within reach. Let's quickly act to \nprovide security and piece of mind to the 6 million Americans who rely \non the National Flood Insurance Program.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S4449]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 2 years ago a constituent of mine named \nDavid Rozga committed suicide shortly after smoking a product called \nK2--a synthetic form of marijuana.\n  A week before he passed away David had graduated from Indianola High \nSchool.\n  He was looking forward to attending my alma mater, the University of \nNorthern Iowa, that fall.\n  David and his friends spent the week after graduation going to \nparties and celebrating their achievements.\n  Some of David's friends heard about K2 from some other friends who \nwere home from college.\n  They were told that if you smoked this product like marijuana you \ncould get a high.\n  David and his friends were about to go to a concert and thought \nsmoking K2 before would be nothing but harmless fun.\n  However, shortly after smoking K2, David became highly agitated and \nterrified.\n  His friends tried to calm him down and once he appeared calmer he \ndecided to go home instead of going out with them.\n  Tragically, David took his own life shortly after returning home--\nonly about 90 minutes after smoking K2 for the first time.\n  The only chemicals in his system at the time of his death were those \nthat comprised K2.\n  David's tragic death is one of the first in what has been a rapidly \ngrowing drug abuse trend.\n  In the past 2 years, the availability and popularity of synthetic \ndrugs like K2, Spice, Bath Salts, and 2C-E has exploded.\n  These drugs are labeled and disguised as legitimate products to \ncircumvent the law.\n  They are easily purchased online, at gas stations, in shopping malls \nand in other novelty stores.\n  Poison control centers and emergency rooms around the country are \nreporting skyrocketing cases of calls and visits resulting from \nsynthetic drug use.\n  The physical effects associated with this use include increased \nagitation, elevated heart rate and blood pressure, hallucinations, and \nseizures.\n  A number of people across the country have acted violently while \nunder the influence of the drug, dying or injuring themselves and \nothers.\n  Just a few weeks ago a man in Miami, Florida attacked a homeless man \nand ate nearly half his face before police had to shoot him to stop \nhim.\n  Two weeks ago, police in upstate New York tazered a woman who was \nchoking her 3-year-old son after smoking bath salts.\n  These ongoing and mounting tragedies underscore the fact that \nCongress must take action to stop these drugs from causing further \ndamage to our society.\n  I introduced the David Mitchell Rozga Act a year ago last March to \nban the drugs that comprised K2.\n  My colleagues Senators Schumer, Klobuchar, and Portman have also \njoined me to ban synthetic drugs including bath salts and 2-CE \ncompounds.\n  Today our separate bills are included as part of the House and Senate \nagreement on the FDA User Fee bill we will be voting on shortly.\n  I thank all who have worked very hard to get my bill, as well as the \nother bills banning synthetic drugs, through Congress.\n  I especially want to thank Mike and Jan Rozga and their family for \ntheir tireless efforts to prevent more tragedy from befalling other \nfamilies.\n  This legislation will drastically help to remove these poisons from \nthe store shelves and protect our children from becoming more victims. \nI urge my colleagues to support cloture on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                       Nomination of Donna Murphy\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nWashington, Senator Murray, for yielding to me for a moment to make a \nunanimous consent request regarding the nomination of Donna Murphy of \nthe District of Columbia to be an associate judge on the DC Superior \nCourt.\n  This nomination was favorably reported by the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee on June 29, 2011. That is almost 1 year \nago. For that year, this nomination has been stopped from a vote. I \ncome to the\n\n[[Page S4450]]\n\nfloor today to say it is time for this to stop.\n  In fairness to this able nominee, she deserves an up-or-down vote. \nShe would bring a wealth of talent and experience to the job.\n  Donna Murphy has been a career attorney in the Department of Justice \nfor four administrations--two Democratic and two Republican--and has \nreceived strong support from senior officials for whom she worked in \neach one of those administrations.\n  John Dunne, the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights under \nPresident George H.W. Bush praised Ms. Murphy as ``extremely smart, \nhard-working, and fair-minded.''\n  Bill Lee, the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights under \nPresident Clinton recalls Ms. Murphy as ``one of the best lawyers in \nthe Division who was known for her fairness, integrity, smarts, legal \nskills, dedication and exceedingly hard work.''\n  Wan J. Kim, the Deputy Assistant Attorney General and Assistant \nAttorney General for Civil Rights under President George W. Bush \nrecommended Ms. Murphy for the D.C. Superior Court believing that she \npossessed the qualities he has seen in exemplary jurists. Under Mr. \nKim, Donna Murphy received the division's highest award in 2007, the \nJohn Doar Award for Excellence and Dedication, an award that was \nestablished under the first Bush administration.\n  So there is no rational reason at all to continue to deny this \nnominee an up or down vote.\n  A native of Norristown, PA, Ms. Murphy fell in love with Washington, \nDC during a visit when she was just 12 years old. She moved here to \nattend college at American University, where she received her Bachelor \nof Science in Political Science in 1986.\n  From American University, she went to Yale Law School--a decision I \nnaturally admire--and received her law degree in 1989.\n  Since October 1990, she has worked for the Justice Department's Civil \nRights Division on a variety of cases, including voting rights, \ndiscrimination in credit, housing and public accommodations, and \nallegations of police misconduct.\n  It is her work on these police cases that has brought about some \ncriticism, but not much.\n  Both prior to the Committee's approval of Ms. Murphy's nomination and \nafterwards, Committee staff investigated the criticism and found no \nevidence to support the charge that she would be negative to police.\n  In fact, we have received letters of support for Ms. Murphy from \nleading police officials, including one group in Los Angeles, CA, for \nher work in negotiating and implementing consent decrees regarding \nallegations that the Los Angeles Police Department had been \nsystematically violating people's civil rights.\n  The Committee received a letter from Gerald Chaleff, the Special \nAssistant for Constitutional Policing for the LAPD who negotiated the \nconsent decree between the LAPD and Department of Justice. Mr. Chaleff \nwrote that during negotiation and implementation of the consent decree \nMs. Murphy earned the respect and admiration of LAPD personnel with \nwhom she dealt. Mr. Chaleff also notes that contrary to the vague and \nunsubstantiated allegations made against her, Ms. Murphy at all times \nacted honorably, ethically, and intelligently.\n  We have similar letters from law enforcement officials praising her \nwork negotiating similar consent decrees with the Pittsburgh Bureau of \nPolice, the city of Steubenville, OH, and the New Jersey State Police.\n  It is past time the Senate approve this nomination and send this \nqualified nominee to the bench and let her serve the city that has been \nher home for more than 20 years.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these letters, as well as \nthe letters from former Justice Department officials that I cited \nearlier, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                        Civil Rights Division,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 24, 2011.\n     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,\n     Chairman, Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \n         Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write this letter to strongly \n     recommend Donna Murphy to the Superior Court of Washington, \n     DC. I started in the Civil Rights Division at the Department \n     of Justice as an Honors Program hire in 1989, where I served \n     as a prosecutor in the Criminal Section. I have also served \n     as Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Division, and I \n     now have the privilege of serving as the Assistant Attorney \n     General. During this extensive experience working in the \n     Division, I have had the pleasure of working with Ms. Murphy, \n     who joined the Division in 1990, shortly after I was hired.\n       Ms. Murphy has also held a variety of positions during her \n     tenure in the Civil Rights Division, including serving as \n     both a trial attorney and also as a manager. Although she \n     began in the Voting Section, she has also served in the \n     Special Litigation Section and the Housing and Civil \n     Enforcement Section. The breadth and depth of her experience \n     in the Division enforcing many of our nation's most cherished \n     civil rights laws is nearly unparalleled. While working with \n     her over the last two decades, I have witnessed her \n     professionalism, intellect, and extraordinary judgment at \n     work. Ms. Murphy treats everyone with respect, and has shown \n     uncommon abilities as a leader. Her tactical and analytical \n     legal skills have allowed her to quickly master new, and \n     complex, areas of the law. The breadth of her experience \n     across three different Sections of the Division illustrates \n     her extraordinary abilities in this regard.\n       Her commitment to the Department of Justice and to the \n     enforcement of our nation's promise of equal opportunity has \n     been apparent to me from the beginning of my experiences \n     working with her, and it has been apparent to the leadership \n     of the Division in both Democratic and Republican \n     administrations. For example, in 2007, she received the \n     Division's John Doar Award, which is the Division's highest \n     overall award. She has also received the Division's highest \n     litigation award, the Walter W. Barnett Award, in 1995. In \n     addition, Ms. Murphy has consistently received performance \n     awards recognizing her outstanding contributions to the \n     Division's work.\n       When I returned to the Civil Rights Division in October \n     2009, I was pleased to find that Ms. Murphy had remained in \n     the Division, as I knew she was someone I could rely upon in \n     helping to ensure full and fair enforcement of civil rights \n     laws. I have the highest regard for her abilities and know \n     her to be a person of great character.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any \n     questions about my experience working with Ms. Murphy.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Thomas E. Perez,\n     Assistant Attorney General.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Los Angeles Police Department,\n\n                           Los Angeles, California, July 14, 2011.\n     Re Donna M. Murphy.\n\n     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman, Chairman,\n     Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins, Ranking Member,\n     Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Lieberman and Collins: I write in strong \n     support of the nomination of Donna M. Murphy to the Superior \n     Court of Washington, D.C. I am a senior police executive in \n     the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). I had a substantial \n     number of dealings with Ms. Murphy in her capacity as Deputy \n     Chief of the Special Litigation Section of the Civil Rights \n     Division of the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) in \n     connection with negotiation and implementation of a Consent \n     Decree with the LAPD and the City of Los Angeles, relating to \n     the conduct and operation of the police department. Ms. \n     Murphy's and the DOJ objective was to improve the LAPD and \n     she at all times acted honorably, ethically, and \n     intelligently. She never exhibited prejudice or bias or \n     rigidity of position. As a lawyer, I can ensure you that Ms. \n     Murphy will have an exemplary judicial temperament, is highly \n     intelligent, and will render equal justice to all, without \n     bias or favor. Her decisions will be firmly based in the law \n     and will be seen by all sides as fair and just.\n       I was President of the Los Angeles Board of Police \n     Commissioners and a member of the team that conducted the \n     negotiations with DOJ. These negotiations took six months \n     during which Ms. Murphy conducted herself with \n     professionalism and in the manner that all attorneys should \n     when in a similar situation. After the negotiations concluded \n     and the decree approved by the court, I returned to private \n     practice. When William Bratton was appointed Chief of the Los \n     Angeles Police Department (Department), he requested that I \n     join the Department and assist in the Department's compliance \n     with the decree. In that capacity I had the opportunity to \n     observe the conduct of Ms. Murphy and again found her to be \n     professional, intelligent and fair. It has been suggested \n     that because Ms. Murphy worked in the Special Litigation \n     Section, she is somehow biased against the police. Throughout \n     the Consent Decree negotiations and implementation, she \n     manifested a clear understanding of the issues facing the \n     LAPD and, where possible, she suggested resolutions that \n     demonstrated her understanding of the job of the police and \n     the pressures facing the officers performing their duties and \n     never exhibited any indication of prejudice against police \n     officers\n\n[[Page S4451]]\n\n     or the Department. She earned the respect and admiration of \n     the LAPD personnel with whom she dealt. As the LAPD's \n     executive in charge of implementation of the Consent Decree, \n     I can assure that as difficult as it was, Ms. Murphy never \n     did anything to cause anyone to feel anyway other than that \n     she was fair and only trying to assist.\n       The Consent Decree was negotiated in perfect good faith by \n     the Special Litigation Section and that the goals and \n     intentions of the Consent Decree were in no way a reflection \n     of anti-police bias. Indeed, the Decree augmented police \n     professionalism, promoted officer safety, helped to restore \n     public trust and confidence, and made the LAPD an even \n     stronger law enforcement agency.\n       Please let me know if you have any questions about the \n     foregoing. I am available at (213) 486-8730.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                     Charlie Beck,\n                                                  Chief of Police.\n                                                Gerald L.

Superior Court.\n\n     Hon. Joseph Lieberman, Chairman,\n     Senate Homeland security and Governmental Affairs Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Susan Collins, Ranking Member,\n     Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Lieberman and Ranking Member Collins: I write \n     in support of the nomination of Ms. Donna Murphy to be a \n     judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. I \n     was Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights from the end \n     of 1997 to the beginning of 2001 where I became familiar with \n     the work of Ms. Murphy who was an attorney in the Voting \n     Rights and the Special Litigation Sections, two Sections that \n     enforce important civil rights protections. After my time, I \n     understand Ms. Murphy worked in the Housing and General \n     Litigation Section, another high profile Section.\n       I recall Ms. Murphy as one of the best lawyers in the \n     Division who was known for her fairness, integrity, smarts, \n     legal skills, dedication, and exceedingly hard work. Ms. \n     Murphy was recognized for her skills and abilities by being \n     assigned some of the most significant and sensitive \n     investigations and cases and for being assigned managerial \n     duties supervising teams of other lawyers. I particularly \n     remember her excellent work in supervising a team of lawyers \n     who prepared and filed a police misconduct case against the \n     Los Angeles Police Department. Back then the LAPD was a \n     police department rife with problems that resulted in harm to \n     minority communities as well as lack of law enforcement for \n     those communities. Today the LAPD is appropriately lauded as \n     a department that deals with minority communities with \n     sensitivity and fairness. Much of the credit for the dramatic \n     difference is attributable to the role played by the Division \n     in the case that Ms. Murphy had so much to do with both in \n     its beginnings, the negotiation of a pioneering consent \n     decree and the implementation of the decree with LAPD \n     leaders.\n       I am happy to join predecessors and successors as former \n     Assistant Attorneys General for Civil Rights from several \n     different Administrations who have joined together to support \n     Ms. Murphy's nomination.\n       If I can be helpful to the Committee, please feel free to \n     call me.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bill Lann Lee.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Whiteman Osterman & Hanna LLP,\n\n                                Albany, New York, October 7, 2011.\n     Re Nomination of Donna Murphy to the Superior Court of the \n         District of Columbia.\n\n     Hon. Joseph Lieberman, Chairman,\n     Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Susan Collins, Ranking Member,\n     Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Lieberman and Senator Collins: I write to \n     support the nomination of Ms. Donna Murphy to be a Judge on \n     the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. From 1990 \n     until 1993 I worked with Ms. Murphy in the Civil Rights \n     Division of the U.S. Department of Justice where I served as \n     Assistant Attorney General of the Division. During that time, \n     Ms. Murphy was an attorney in the Voting Rights Section and I \n     met regularly with her, reviewing a number of her reports and \n     recommendations concerning very complex and sensitive pre-\n     clearance applications pursuant to Section 5 of the Voting \n     Rights Act.\n       From those personal interactions, I became very impressed \n     by her legal intellect and her knowledge and commitment to \n     the Division's mission and work. She is extremely smart, \n     hardworking and fair-minded.\n       In 2007, for her significant contributions to the work of \n     the Division, Ms. Murphy received the Division's highest \n     award--the John Doar Award for Excellence and Dedication. \n     When, as Assistant Attorney General, I initiated that award, \n     I had in mind a recipient with qualities which Ms. Murphy has \n     faithfully demonstrated in the various assignments she has \n     discharged with distinction.\n       I strongly recommend your confirmation of her nomination \n     and, if I can be of any assistance, would welcome your \n     request.\n           Respectfully,\n     John R. Dunne.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  August 21, 2011.\n     Re: Donna M. Murphy.\n\n     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental \n         Affairs Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Homeland Security and \n         Governmental Affairs Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       I am pleased to write this letter in support of the \n     nomination of Donna M. Murphy to the Superior Court of \n     Washington, D.C. I am a retired police chief and a Past \n     President of the International Association of Chiefs of \n     Police. Since 1998 I have been working with the Special \n     Litigation Section of the Civil Rights Division of the United \n     States Department of Justice (DOJ) in a variety of capacities \n     dealing with police practices and reform. It was during one \n     such assignment that I met and worked with Donna Murphy.\n       In 1997, the U.S. DOJ and the City of Steubenville, Ohio \n     entered in to a Consent Decree regarding police practices. I \n     was appointed as an agent of the Federal Court to audit \n     compliance with the Decree. As one can imagine, even though \n     the Decree was negotiated and agreed upon by the parties (the \n     City and DOJ) there was considerable institutional resistance \n     to the changes in police practices outlined in its several \n     requirements. Donna Murphy was the supervisor overseeing line \n     attorneys assigned this matter during the period 2000-03, \n     which was a time when there was heightened resistance to the \n     Decree requirements since the easier tasks had been \n     accomplished and we were moving into an area of serious \n     substantive change.\n       There is little doubt that the persistence and leadership \n     of Donna Murphy; moreover her patience and understanding of \n     the issues and obstacles of concern to the City, and to the \n     members of the Police Department, were the basis for much of \n     the progress made with Decree compliance during her tenure. \n     She consistently sought information to insure she had a clear \n     understanding of the organizational and operational \n     difficulties faced by the police and in my opinion, made \n     decisions that were professional and fair to all concerned. \n     Accordingly, I am pleased to add my support for her \n     appointment to the Superior Court of Washington, D.C.\n       Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this \n     information.\n     Very truly yours,\n                                              Charles D. Reynolds,\n     Police Practices Consultant.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         Blacks in Law Enforcement\n\n\n                                                   of America,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 26, 2011.\n     Re Ms. Donna M. Murphy.\n\n     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental \n         Affairs Committee, Washington, D.C. 20510\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Homeland Security and \n         Governmental Affairs Committee, Washington, DC.\n       I am pleased to offer this letter in support of the \n     nomination of Ms. Donna M. Murphy to the Superior Court of \n     Washington, D.C. I am a retired D.C. Metropolitan Police \n     Officer and retired Executive Director of the National Black \n     Police Association (NBPA). The NBPA is an advocacy \n     organization established to work on behalf of African \n     Americans in Law Enforcement involving the prevention and \n     intervention of police abuse and misconduct as well as other \n     criminal justice policies and practices that have a negative \n     impact on people and communities of color.\n       After the establishment of the Special Litigation Section \n     of the Civil Rights Division, the organization began to work \n     very closely with the section and its staff attorneys. Ms. \n     Murphy was assigned to work with a variety of cases involving \n     the investigation of police practices in cities that the NBPA \n     had brought to the attention of the Department of Justice.\n       Ms. Donna M. Murphy and her staff worked during that time \n     against a great deal of resistance to the necessary changes \n     needed for our nations police departments which most were the \n     results of court ordered consent decree. The National Black \n     Police Association was honored to work with Ms. Murphy and \n     found her very dedicated to the creation of fairness and \n     justice for all involved the consent decree compliance.\n       So, as a result of the positive and productive \n     relationships created during my tenure as Executive Director \n     of the National Black Police Association, I am please to add \n     my support to the nomination of Donna M. Murphy to the \n     Superior Court of Washington, D.C.\n       Please let me know if there any additional questions \n     regarding this correspondence.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Ronald E. Hampton,\n                                                         Director.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at a \ntime to be determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the \nRepublican leader, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider \nthe following nominations: Calendar No. 231; that there be\n\n[[Page S4452]]\n\n2 hours for debate equally divided in the usual form; that upon the use \nor yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to a vote without \nintervening action or debate on Calendar No. 231; that the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, with no \nintervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order, that \nany related statements be printed in the Record, that the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume \nlegislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, Senator DeMint has some concerns \nabout this nomination. Therefore, at his request, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I am going to keep returning to the \nfloor of the Senate in fairness on this nomination. She is such a \ndeserving nominee and at least deserves a vote up or down.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nmy remarks, the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Brown, be recognized, and \nfollowing that, Senator Whitehouse be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Murray pertaining to the introduction of S. 3340 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                            The Highway Bill\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I come to the floor this evening \nto discuss the bipartisan transportation jobs bill that has been \nlingering since March 14. March 14 was pretty early in the construction \nseason. If the House had moved as quickly as they should have, if the \nHouse were not, apparently, held hostage by some tea party members who \nthink transportation should be a State issue and the Federal Government \nshouldn't be involved, there would have been so many more jobs created \nin the Presiding Officer's State of North Carolina and in Ohio and \nelsewhere. Those tea party members should think about President \nEisenhower's legacy when they talk about transportation being a State \nand not a Federal issue.\n  The Senate passed this job-creating economic development bill more \nthan 100 days ago, but this historically bipartisan highway bill \nremains stalled. We know investments in infrastructure mean jobs \ndirectly. We know investments in infrastructure mean economic \ndevelopment in the future. President Eisenhower and Congress \nestablished the Interstate Highway System not too many years after I \nwas born, in the 1950s. A generation of Americans was set to work \ncarving freeways, paving new roads, building bridges and tunnels across \nour great country that allowed people and products to travel across the \n48 States.\n  In the 1950s, the 1960s, the 1970s, and the 1980s, we had an \ninfrastructure which was the envy of the world--an infrastructure the \nlikes of which the world had never seen. Since then, we have not done \nquite so well. Our Nation used our postwar infrastructure boom to \nbecome an economic superpower, similar to how the GI bill helps \nmillions of families who take advantage of it--soldiers, veterans, and \nfamilies--yet at the same time creating prosperity for the whole \ncountry. Infrastructure building helps those men and women who are \nactually doing the construction, doing the work on the highways and \nbridges and water and sewer systems, but it also helps the companies \nand the workers who are manufacturing the steel and the concrete and \nthe glass that goes into infrastructure, and it also helps the \nprosperity of society as a whole.\n  A truck leaving Toledo, OH, could be in Miami, FL, in less than a \nday. A family could drive from one corner of Ohio--from Conneaut, the \ncounty my wife was born in--to North Bend on the other end of the State \nin several hours instead of a whole day.\n  We know infrastructure investments are forward thinking, with payoffs \nthat last for decades, yet also benefit our Nation--our small \nbusinesses, our workers--both today and for generations to come. So it \nis unacceptable that at a time of still too high unemployment--even \nthough the unemployment rate in my State has dropped between 2 and 3 \npercent in the last 3 years, it is still too high--Washington \npoliticians, for whatever reason, continue to block progress on this \nbill.\n  No one in this Congress should be proud of the condition of our roads \nor the safety of our bridges. No one in this Congress should be proud \nof the fact the world's newest airports and most modern train stations \nare not in the United States of America, as they were in the 1950s, \n1960s, the 1970s, and the 1980s. They are being built overseas. No one \nin this Congress should be proud of creating new hurdles to progress, \nof obstruction, when the need is so great for us to create new jobs.\n  Historically, infrastructure has been a bipartisan issue. There is no \nso such thing as a Democratic or Republican bridge. The most recent \nextension is slated to expire Saturday at midnight. We can't afford to \nkeep passing short-term extensions. We need to think about consequences \nfor businesses that plan for the long term. Because Congress keeps \npassing inch-by-inch, month-by-month extensions, businesses can't plan, \nworkers can't plan, State departments of transportation can't plan. It \nhurts the contractor, who is unsure whether she will have the funds to \nbuy a new bulldozer; the crane operator, who is unsure of where his \nnext job will be; and it hurts the small business owner who sells \naggregate to the construction industry. We cannot afford to keep \npassing the buck with these short-term extensions and disrupting the \nability of businesses to plan for the future.\n  This past weekend I visited El Meson Restaurante, a family-owned \nrestaurant located near the I-75 modernization project in West \nCarrollton in Montgomery County, OH, in southwest Ohio, near Dayton. I \nspoke with the owner Bill Castro. I asked him: What happens if the bill \nexpires and this project is delayed? He tells me that construction \nsurrounding the restaurant has already cut into El Meson's profits. I \nhave eaten at that restaurant three or four times. It has always been \ncrowded. The food is good, the hospitality is great, and the owners are \nfriendly and embracing. It is a great place. But because of this \ndelay--which happens from time to time, I understand, and should--he \nhas had to scale back his own salary, rather than lower his workers' \nwages and reduce the staff. He knows this is good for Montgomery \nCounty, for Dayton, and for the Miami Valley, but it is clear if this \nproject gets delayed it will do serious damage to his restaurant and to \nthe other small businesses in the area.\n  It is clear business owners in my State are doing their jobs. It is \ntime the House of Representatives does its job and works with us to \npass this highway bill, then get it back to the Senate and the House so \nwe can vote on it. We know what is at stake: Jobs created by \ninfrastructure investments are almost always good-paying middle-class \njobs. Whether they are the construction jobs or the manufacturing jobs \nproducing the products that go into the construction, these jobs \ntypically provide workers with health care and retirement benefits and \nare the kinds of jobs our neighbors need to create a strong middle \nclass. These jobs enable people to buy a home, to save for their \nchildren's college education, and plan for the future.\n  These investments not only create construction jobs, they improve our \nNation's economic efficiency, obviously creating more prosperity. This \nbill is about rebuilding our infrastructure as much as it is about \nrebuilding our middle class. It is time for Congress to pass the \nhighway bill. There is simply too much at stake not to.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Supreme Court Decisions\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, this is the week for the Supreme \nCourt to release opinions from dozens of cases that it has been \nconsidering over the past term. In most of these\n\n[[Page S4453]]\n\nimportant cases, the Court followed its usual practice of allowing the \nparties to file detailed legal briefs and to present oral arguments to \nmake their side of the case before the Court reached its decision. In \none case, however, it decided an issue vital to the ongoing function of \nour democracy, and it decided that case without even allowing the \nparties the opportunity to write legal briefs on the merits and to \nargue their case before the Court.\n  In the Montana case, American Tradition Partnership v. Bullock, the \nCourt's five-man conservative bloc doubled down on a historic error \nthey made 2 years ago in Citizens United. Citizens United, I am \nconfident, will mark one of the lowest points in the Supreme Court's \nhistory.\n  The case will ultimately stand alongside Lochner v. New York and \nother such decisions in the Supreme Court gallery of horrible \ndecisions.\n  A telltale of these horrible court decisions is that they create \nrights of the powerful against the powerless, turning the very concept \nof ``rights'' inside out. Ordinarily, a right is something that stands \nagainst power. That is why it is carved out as a right; it is because \nit offends against the power structure, and yet we value it and we \ndefend it. And our courts have as their very purpose in our system of \ngovernment the purpose to be the guardians of those rights, the \nguardians of those rights against whatever the structure of power is in \nour society. That is why we give judges long or lifetime tenure. That \nis why conflicts of interest in the judiciary are so particularly \nconcerning. That is why some decisions we take away from officialdom \nentirely and give them to a jury of our peers. That is why it is a \ncrime to tamper with a jury. We do all of those because we want \ncourtrooms insulated from power so that courts can do the essential \nwork of protecting rights against the predations of power.\n  Look at the Lochner decision, for instance, and see how that Court \nturned the whole question of rights inside out. Seeking to defend the \nprevailing economic power structure, the Supreme Court held that bakers \nhad a constitutional right--under a theory of freedom to contract--to \nagree to work whatever hours their employers wanted to make them work, \nwithout overtime, without rest, a right on the part of the bakers to \nenter into a contract where their employers could tell them they could \nmake them work whatever they wanted. Looking back now, that seems \nalmost silly, but if you were a judge affiliated with an economic \nstructure that saw workers as essentially disposable, this question of \nworkers' rights to work reasonable hours seems, well, unreasonable. And \nthe Lochner decision justifiably lies on the junk pile of judicial \nhistory, a broken monument to the prejudice and error of that Court.\n  Citizens United and now the Montana decision join this gallery of \njudicial horribles. Here, the right they turned inside out is the right \nof free speech, and the power structure served is the vast and \nunprecedented corporate power structure that exists today.\n  Under Citizens United, under this inside-out right they have created, \nyou now enjoy the free speech right to hear as much corporate speech as \nthey want to bombard you with. If you are a regular human, you are on \nyour own. If you are a CEO, you can access your corporate treasury to \ndrown out the voices of all of your workers. If you are a massive \nmultinational corporation or if you are a billionaire or a \nmultibillionaire, you now have a right to dominate the paid media \nairwaves, and we have the free speech right to have to listen to all of \nthat.\n  At least if you are a billionaire, you are still a human being. And I \ndon't say this judgmentally; this is a legal fact. If you are a \ncorporation, you have no soul, you have no conscience, you have no \naltruism. You have none of the characteristics that are special to \nhumankind. You are a legal fiction. You are a financial mechanism \ncreated for the massing and the efficient use of capital. In the \neconomic sphere, the value of that corporate structure is immense, \nthere is no doubt about it. It has provided great value to our society. \nBut in the political sphere, it is dangerous. But for these five \nJustices who constantly support corporate interests, to protect the \npower that comes from being able to provide or promise or threaten \nmassive anonymous expenditures on political attack ads, well, that is \njust how you see the world.\n  One day the Citizens United decision will lie next to Lochner on the \njunk pile of judicial error and prejudice. There is too much wrong with \nit for it ultimately to survive. But, sadly, today is not that day, and \nthe five conservative Justices have chosen, instead of correcting their \nerror, to double-down on it.\n  The central and deeply flawed premise of Citizens United was the \nconservative majority's declaration that vast corporate independent \nexpenditures ``do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of \ncorruption.'' They had no record on which to make that decision. None \nhad ever run in an election before. They had no basis for making that \ndecision, but that was the declaration they issued.\n  First, whether independent expenditures by corporations pose dangers \nof corruption or dangers of the appearance of corruption is a factual \nquestion that depends on the actual workings of the electoral system. \nSupreme courts aren't supposed to make findings of fact. So one of the \nfirst errors in the Citizens United decision was that they drove off \nthe road of proper judicial procedure, across the rumble strip, and \nthey started making findings of fact--and they did so in a very \ndangerous way.\n  The peculiar way the conservative Justices brought the Citizens \nUnited question before the Court deprived the Court of any opportunity \nto consider a record. Ordinarily, the Supreme Court has a record that \ncomes up to it from the court decisions below. But, as my colleagues \nmay recall, the parties in Citizens United did not ask the Court to \nconsider the constitutionality of limiting corporate independent \nexpenditures. That was not addressed below. What happened is that the \nconservative Supreme Court Justices took it upon themselves to ask a \nnew question and to answer that question they themselves had asked. In \ndoing it this way, the Justices simply declared, with no factual basis, \nthat massive, independent corporate expenditures posed no risk of \ncorruption to our elections. They were wrong, as is obvious to most \npeople.\n  The case the Court decided today, American Tradition Partnership, \ncreated an opportunity for the Court to have dug itself out from the \ncolossal mistake it made in Citizens United. It is an interesting \nbackground in comparison to Citizens United because the case came out \nof Montana, where there is an extensive record within the State of \nMontana of historical evidence of immense corruption created in that \nState by corporate influence and corporate campaign money dating all \nthe way back to the copper barons who bought and sold Montana State \ngovernment in the bad old days. The Montana court also found \nsubstantial evidence that Montana voters believe that corporate \nelection expenditures lead to corruption and that this belief has \ncontributed in Montana to widespread cynicism and low voter turnout. \nThose were findings of fact based on an actual record, and the Montana \nSupreme Court carefully reviewed those findings of fact. That is what \nit is supposed to do--not make findings of fact but review them. The \nMontana court concluded that the State had a compelling interest \njustifying the law based on the evidence in the record.\n  The corporations then came in and asked the U.S. Supreme Court to \noverrule the Montana Supreme Court's decision, arguing that it was \ninconsistent with Citizens United. At that point, I joined with Senator \nJohn McCain, who has long been a national leader on campaign finance \nissues, in filing a bipartisan amicus brief with the Supreme Court. In \nour brief, Senator McCain and I challenged that central premise in \nCitizens United--that phony premise about the corrupting potential of \noutside political expenditures being nonexistent. The extensive factual \nrecord developed in Montana and the facts that have developed since \nCitizens United on the ground nationally provided the Court with plenty \nof evidence--evidence that it lacked because of the way it had \napproached Citizens United.\n  Our brief showed that Citizens United stood on a pair of false and \nflawed factual assumptions about our elections. First, the Citizens \nUnited decision assumed that outside political expenditures were going \nto be independent,\n\n[[Page S4454]]\n\nthat they were not going to be coordinated with political campaigns. \nSecond, the Citizens United majority assumed that there would be \ndisclosure of what special interests were paying for the ads. Both of \nthese assumptions are demonstrably wrong. The ongoing Presidential and \ncongressional races reveal close coordination between campaigns and \nthese so-called independent expenditures. Wealthy donors, who have \nmaxed out their contributions to the candidate, now can use candidate-\nspecific super PACs as convenient proxies to make the functional \nequivalent of excess campaign contributions. Campaigns and their super \nPACs have closely connected staff, they have shared consultants, they \nopenly coordinate on fundraising, and they work together on \nadvertising, with super PACs acting, actually, as the successful \nsurrogates for the candidates in States where the candidate has made \nfew appearances or spent little money on advertising. Indeed, in the \nRepublican Presidential primary a candidate-specific super PAC for \nSenator Santorum spent millions and won the Minnesota primary for \nSenator Santorum when the candidate himself had no money to spend.\n  These vast expenditures are not just coordinated closely with \ncandidates and campaigns, they are anonymous, with the special \ninterests behind the ads keeping themselves secret from the American \npublic. As everybody in this Chamber and every American who has a \ntelevision set knows, the decision in Citizens United opened the \nfloodgates to unlimited corporate and special interest money pouring \ninto our elections. Using phony shell corporations, 501(c) \norganizations, and super PACs, outside groups can now spend--or, \nimportantly, they can credibly threaten to spend because that can have \na big effect in politics--overwhelming amounts of money in support of \nor against a candidate without any publicly disclosed paper trail.\n  Although the secretive interests behind the anonymous spending may be \nhidden from voters, they may be hidden from regulators, they may be \nhidden from prosecutors, they may be hidden from the media, they will \nnot be hidden from the candidate. They will be well known to the \ncandidate. That alone allows for an undetectable quid pro quo \ncorruption, as the wealthy outside interests can award a candidate with \nmassive, anonymous spending.\n  Worse than that is a type of corruption I touched on a moment ago \nwhen I talked about threats--a corruption made possible by the Citizens \nUnited decision that went completely unconsidered by the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. They never even mentioned it. That is the ability to threaten \nlarge and secret expenditures without actually having to make them. A \ncandidate could be quietly warned that if they don't take the right \nposition on this issue, if they don't vote right when the amendment or \nthe bill comes up, they will be punished with a large expenditure \nagainst them.\n  Now, how is that a threat under Citizens United? Before Citizens \nUnited, if a corporation wanted to threaten a politician, the threat \nwould mean a $5,000 PAC contribution to the politician's opponent. It \nwould mean maybe some fundraising and bundling by the corporate \nexecutives and by the corporate lobbyists. I suppose that is something \na candidate wouldn't necessarily want, but it is not a very big deal. \nIt happens all the time. And I don't think it throws much weight around \nhere.\n  Today, after Citizens United, the threat isn't of $5,000 and a couple \nof fundraisers, the threat is of unlimited, anonymous corporate \nspending against you--enough to defeat or elect a candidate. And if \nthis threat succeeds, the real danger is that there is no record \nwhatsoever of the corrupt deal for regulators, prosecutors, and media \noutlets to track.\n  Sherlock Holmes famously talked in one of his decisions about the dog \nthat didn't bark. In political corruption, we need to be concerned \nabout the ad that didn't run--the ad that didn't run because the \npolitician obediently did what he or she was told.\n  The brief Senator McCain and I authored laid all of this before the \nCourt. We documented the close coordination between campaigns and this \nso-called independent spending. We detailed the tangled web of \ncorporate 501(C) and super PAC relationships that allow wealthy \ninterests, special interests, to hide their spending from the public, \nand we explained the various ways these forms of coordinated identity \nlaundering by special interests create the real threat of quid pro quo \ncorruption. As we said in our brief, ``The campaign finance system \nassumed by Citizens United is no longer a reality, if it ever was.'' \nAnd, frankly, I don't think it ever was.\n  Confronted with the actual facts on the ground in Montana and \nnationally, the Supreme Court's conservatives decided they were going \nto ignore the evidence. There is a blindfold on Lady Justice. But the \nblindfold on Lady Justice as she holds her scales aloft is supposed to \nbe blindness to the parties who are before her. It is supposed to be \nblindness to what the interests are. It is not supposed to be a \nconsidered and deliberate blindness to the evidence and the facts. But \nin this case, that is the blindness the Supreme Court has deliberately \nimposed on itself--or at least the five conservative Justices have.\n  This conservative bloc has decided to perpetuate the error of \nCitizens United without considering the facts. Montana will not have an \nopportunity to file briefs on the merits, explaining the importance of \nits laws to protect against the corruption that is its historic \nexperience. The attorney general of Montana will not have the \nopportunity to stand before the Justices to defend his State's law. \nOnce again, the Court has kept from itself any relevant record that \nmight present uncomfortable facts.\n  In Citizens United, the conservative Justices asked themselves to \ndecide a major constitutional case without any lower court record. And \nnow that they have a fully developed lower court record to proceed on \nthat happens to show how wrong they were, they have no interest in even \nlooking at that record.\n  We need to act now to fix our broken campaign finance system. The \nSupreme Court had the chance to correct its error. These five \nconservative Justices refused to correct their error. They doubled down \non their error. They have ignored the evidence of their error that we \nall see around us, so we cannot wait. We know why they are doing it. We \nknow what is going on. We know it is not going to happen from this \nSupreme Court, not from those five Justices, so we need to fix this on \nour own. Americans of all political stripes, whether you are an \noccupier or tea party, they are disgusted by the influence of unlimited \nand anonymous corporate cash pouring into our elections, and by \ncampaigns that succeed or that fail depending on how many billionaires \nsupport the candidate.\n  More and more, people in my home State of Rhode Island and around the \ncountry believe their government responds only to wealthy special \ninterests. They see jobs disappear and wages stagnate and bailouts and \nspecial deals for the big guys and they lose faith that elected \nofficials here in Washington are listening to them.\n  (Mr. MERKLEY assumed the Chair.)\n  For now we are left with one weapon in the fight against the \noverwhelming tide of secret special interest money, and that one weapon \nis disclosure. Let the sun shine in. At least let the American public \nknow who is behind these massive expenditures.\n  Earlier this year I introduced the DISCLOSE Act of 2012. I had \nimmense help from the Presiding Officer, Senator Merkley, in doing that \nwork. We call it DISCLOSE 2.0. This legislation will shine a bright \nlight on all of this spending by these powerful special interests.\n  With this legislation, which now has 44 Senators cosponsoring it, \nevery citizen will know who is spending these great sums of money to \nget their candidates elected and to influence our elections. Passing \nthis law would begin to remove the dark cloud of unlimited secret money \nthat the Supreme Court has cast over our American elections.\n  The DISCLOSE Act includes a narrow and reasonable set of provisions. \nWe have trimmed it down so that it should have wide support from \nDemocrats and Republicans. A great number of my Republican colleagues \nin this body are on record that disclosure and transparency are \nessential in campaign finance, so we have made every effort to craft an \neffective and a fair proposal while imposing the least possible burden \non the covered organizations.\n\n[[Page S4455]]\n\n  As Trevor Potter, a Republican, former Chairman of the Federal \nElection Commission, said in a statement submitted to the Rules \nCommittee: Disclose 2.0 is ``appropriately targeted, narrowly tailored, \nclearly constitutional and desperately needed.''\n  The same cannot be said for the conservative majority's holding in \nCitizens United, echoed again today in American Tradition Partnership. \nThe conservative Justices' desire to maintain their error and to keep \nthe corporate money flowing represents a sad, sad day in the history of \nthe Court. It will, as I said earlier, one day be corrected. One day, \nCitizens United will lie next to Lochner v. New York and other \ndecisions that have disgraced the Court in the past on the junk heap of \njudicial history. But until that day, it is up to all of us to work \ntogether to restore control of our elections, to restore control of our \ndemocracy, to put it back in the hands of the American people, to \nassure that we continue a government of the people, by the people, and \nfor the people--not a government of the big corporations, by the big \ncorporations, and for the big corporations.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/25/senate-section/article/S4455-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a \ndedicated public servant, a talented administrator, and a tireless \nwarrior for homeland security. Transportation Security Administration \nDeputy Administrator and Chief Operating Officer Gale Rossides is \nretiring at the end of the month, and her departure will be a \nsignificant loss not just for TSA and the Department of Homeland \nSecurity but for the American people, whom she has served so well \nthroughout her 34-year career in the public sector.\n  As Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, I came to understand the central role Ms. Rossides played at \nTSA. In appearances before the Committee, she impressed me as a \nknowledgeable and experienced manager whose dedication to the agency \nhelped TSA stay on track through a difficult and chaotic start up and \ndevelop into a more mature agency as the years progressed.\n  Ms. Rossides' institutional memory, alone, will be irreplaceable. She \nwas one of the original six executives hired to build TSA from the \nground up in 2001, and in his book ``After: How American Confronted the \nSeptember 12 Era,'' Steven Brill wrote that ``no matter what was added \nto her plate, or what she reached out for to put on it herself, she \nseemed to take it in stride.'' Despite the grueling 13-hour days and 6-\nday weeks, Ms. Rossides stayed at TSA for 10 years--with a 1-year \nhiatus as senior advisor to the Under Secretary for Management at DHS. \nI think it is fair to say that today she is one of the department's \nmost respected senior executives.\n  Ms. Rossides brought critical management experience to the nascent \nTSA. In the tense period after September 11, 2001, she led the team of \ngovernment and private sector officials that trained and certified more \nthan 50,000 screeners in less than 6 months--the largest public \nmobilization since World War II. She oversaw the debut of TSA's \nfederalized screening force at Baltimore Washington Airport. And she \nled the effort to develop and implement screener technical training and \ncertification standards.\n  Throughout her TSA tenure, Ms. Rossides has fostered collaborative \npartnerships with stakeholders; pushed for more intelligence sharing; \ncreated leadership development programs; and developed innovative \nworkforce programs to encourage communication and conflict management. \nUnder her watch, TSA reduced its employee injury and attrition rates \nand raised employee morale through innovative solutions like providing \nbenefits to part time personnel.\n  Ms. Rossides moved steadily up the management ladder during her \ntenure at TSA. She has served as the Associate Administrator/Chief \nSupport Systems Officer, been a Senior Advisor to the Deputy Secretary \nand the Under Secretary for Management at DHS, and in 2007 she was \nappointed acting Deputy Administrator, a position that became permanent \nin January 2008. She has held that position longer than any other in \nthe agency's history.\n  From 2009 to January 2010, she served as Acting TSA Administrator. As \nsuch, she oversaw the implementation of Secure Flight and introduced \nother key security programs, including measures implemented to detect \nand deter improved explosives devices that could be concealed on \nterrorists, in the aftermath of the attempted Christmas Day terrorist \nattack.\n  This career arc more than justifies Steven Brill's description of her \nin his book as ``an incurable workaholic'' who would ``run over or \ncleverly sidestep almost any obstacle to get to the goal.'' It is a \ntribute to her character that she remained universally well-liked while \ndoing so.\n  Before she was hand-picked to help launch TSA, Ms. Rossides had \nworked at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, within the \nJustice Department, for 23 years, where she started as an \nadministrative assistant. She was co-chair of a blue ribbon panel to \noverhaul ATF after the 1993 siege of the Branch Davidian ranch in Waco, \nTX. For 8 years, she served as the first assistant director, in charge \nof all law enforcement, investigative, regulatory, and leadership \ntraining at ATF--the first woman to hold such a significant post at the \nbureau. And she was a member of the Board of Directors of the Federal \nLaw Enforcement Training Center for 6 years.\n  The American people have been fortunate that Ms. Rossides has given \nmuch of her life to the Federal Government. We are certainly better off \nbecause of it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/25/senate-section/article/S4455-3", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 AGRICULTURE REFORM, FOOD, AND JOBS ACT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I could not support Senate passage of S. \n3240, the ``2012 Farm Bill.'' CBO estimates the Senate's Farm Bill will \nconsume a colossal amount of taxpayer dollars--at least $966 billion \nover 10 years. While I agree that we need nutrition programs to assist \nlow-income families as well as programs to ensure farmers receive a \nfair return on their labors, the fact remains we are living in an era \nof crushing national debt and runaway government spending. Ultimately, \nthe American people, both farmers and consumers, lose under this bill.\n  Farm Bill programs are ripe for reform. Unfortunately, we rejected \namendments to fix USDA's sugar programs which cost American consumers \n$3 billion annually in artificially high sugar prices. We created \nseveral new so-called ``shallow-loss'' subsidy programs, which could \nballoon to $14 billion each year if crop prices drop from today's \nrecord high levels and return to average prices. We implemented a new \n$3 billion cotton program that may exacerbate our ongoing trade dispute \nat the World Trade Organization. We could have eliminated the outdated \nmohair subsidies, but didn't, and wound up creating several new and \nunnecessary subsidy programs for products like popcorn and maple syrup. \nWe've made some progress on imposing stricter payment limits on \nsubsidies and we eliminated wasteful and duplicative USDA programs like \nthe Catfish Inspection Office. Unfortunately, much more remains to be \nfixed in the Senate's farm bill before I could support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/25/senate-section/article/S4455-4", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4455-S4456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          TRIBUTE TO IKE LIBBY\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Mr. Ike \nLibby, who, with his company Hometown Energy, has worked tirelessly to \nease the burdens of rising home heating costs for the people of my home \nState.\n  Founded in 2004 by Ike Libby and Gene Ellis, who handles the business \naspects of the company and owns a variety store next door, Hometown \nEnergy of Dixfield, ME, supplies heating oil to a region that knows \njust how cold winter can be. With seven employees, Hometown Energy is a \nquintessential local small business. Known for its\n\n[[Page S4456]]\n\nlong, harsh winter season, Maine's heating oil providers not only sell \na product, they serve as barrier between Mainers and the biting cold.\n  Relationships and care are at the heart of the Hometown Energy \nservice structure, where, in true neighborly spirit, it is more crucial \nto ensure that customers are taken care of than to adhere to a \nstringent payment plan. Hometown Energy will often waive service fees \nand structure payments to give as much leeway as possible during the \ncoldest months when resources are at a premium and ability to pay the \nhigh costs of energy may be scarce. It is this devotion to a customer-\nfirst philosophy that embodies the entrepreneurial spirit of Maine \nsmall businesses. The flexibility and understanding exhibited by \nHometown Energy has proven vital to many in these difficult economic \ntimes.\n  Hometown Energy's efforts to assist Mainers was given national \nattention this year when they were featured by the New York Times \narticle ``In Fuel Oil Country, Cold That Cuts To The Heart,'' which \ndetailed the difficulties of home heating during the trying northern \nwinters. Since the article ran, donations have been pouring in to \nHometown Energy to assist in covering the costs of heating oil. More \nthan $250,000 in donations have been sent by contributors from around \nthe world. The kindhearted response and outreach has been so great that \nHometown Energy has developed a Web site specifically dedicated to \nreceiving these contributions.\n  For his immeasurable compassion and commitment to serving the people \nof his community, Mr. Libby has been recently recognized by Dixfield's \nBoard of Selectmen as Dixfield's Distinguished Citizen for 2012. There \ncan be no doubt that this honor is well-deserved by Mr. Libby, who has \ngenerously given his time, energy, and very self. Through his efforts, \nhe has profoundly touched the lives of so many in his community.\n  Congratulations to Ike Libby on being named Dixfield's Distinguished \nCitizen for 2012. Mr. Libby and everyone at Hometown Energy's kindness \nand selfless dedication to assisting the most vulnerable truly warms my \nheart.

Mr. President, today I wish to remember a man who \nhad significant impact on the lives of hundreds, maybe thousands of \nKansans.\n  Kansans very rarely live idle lives. We are an active hard-working \nState, always in motion, quick to rise to a challenge. The bigger the \nobstacle, the faster a Kansan will be there to remove it. Our Founders \nseemed to know that would be the case when they chose for our State \nmotto, ``ad astra ad aspera''--``to the stars through difficulties.'' \nKenneth Orville Dunlap, who grew up and lived in and around Wichita, \nKS, lived up to the motto.\n  A little less than 40 years ago, this Nation made a commitment to \ndisabled children--or ``differently able'' as Ken liked to say--that we \nwere going to provide them the best possible education in the least \nrestrictive environment. Some people saw that commitment as an \nobstacle. Ken saw that commitment as an opportunity to help people live \nfuller lives.\n  Ken had been a teacher and coach in Kansas public schools for a \ncouple of years when he decided to fully commit himself to special \neducation. In the early 1970s, Ken established Wichita Public Schools' \nfirst Adaptive Physical Education curriculum at Levy Special Education \nCenter. He went on to teach special education for 18 years at Wichita \nEast High School, where he developed the first community-based \ninstruction program, assisting special students with job readiness and \nplacement.\n  Some folks might have looked at those accomplishments and called \nthemselves a success. Ken, however, wasn't done yet. He went on to \nserve as a special education coordinator for the Wichita School \nDistrict for 5 years and as principal of three special education \nprograms at Starkey, Ketch, and Heartspring.\n  Still not finished, in 1996, Ken established one of the most \ninnovative special education programs in the country--the Chisholm Life \nSkills Center. Ken had a vision for a school that would serve the \ncommunity of Wichita, and at the same time teach its students the \nskills they would need to live independently. Chisholm students care \nfor the yards of area seniors on their way to full-time paid jobs with \nlandscaping companies. Students cook in the school cafeteria on their \nway to a career in food service. The school itself contracts with local \nbusinesses like Cessna/Textron Aviation, Intrust Bank and the United \nWay and students go on to work at several of those businesses. Chisholm \nis more than just a school; it is a bridge for ``differently able'' \nkids from education to the workforce and community. The staff, faculty \nand parents still strive for every student at Chisholm to be fully \nequipped with the skills needed upon graduation to live the most \nindependent life possible in the local community.\n  In 1999, a Kansas storm put a different obstacle in Ken's way, when a \ndeadly tornado ripped the roof off of Chisholm. Again, Ken saw the \nopportunity, transitioning from his role as educator and administrator \nto foreman. While most educators were enjoying their summer vacation, \nKen was overseeing the cleanup and rebuilding of the school. He rallied \nthe whole community. Teachers, parents and alumni all pitched in, \nclearing debris, cleaning and rebuilding Chisholm. The school today \nstands as a testament to Ken's leadership and the whole community's \npersistence.\n  And, just as Ken's commitment to his school didn't end with the \nschool year, his commitment to special education didn't end in the \nschoolyard. Ken and his wife Jan devoted countless hours to \nvolunteering with the Special Olympics. They took students on annual \ncamping trips and chaperoned the Chisholm Prom each year. They went to \nstudents' weddings and attended their funerals. Even after he retired \nfrom his 37 years in public education, Ken continued to serve on the \nSedgwick County Physical & Developmental Disabilities Advisory Board.\n  For the last year, Ken has battled lung cancer and on Saturday, \nsurrounded by his family, he took his last breath. This remarkable \nman's life was celebrated and remembered this week by family, friends, \ncolleagues and former students. During the visitation on Tuesday at the \nfuneral home, one of the last people to pay their respects to Ken was a \nformer student. This young man shared with Ken's family that he had \ncaused a lot of trouble to Ken when he was a student. Before he left, \nhe walked over to the casket and put his hand on Ken's shoulder. He \nsaid simply, ``Thank you for everything, Mr. Dunlap,'' and turned to \nleave. Then he stopped. He asked Jan if he could leave something \nbehind. Pulling a Special Olympics Medal from his pocket, he laid it on \nKen's chest, thanked him again and left.\n  We will never know how many lives Ken touched nor the full impact he \nmade--but he leaves behind a great legacy and his life stands as an \nexample to us all. His dedication to others is a powerful reminder of \nwhat is most important in life--the people around us. May we learn from \nKen's example and make a lasting difference in the lives of \nothers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/25/senate-section/article/S4456-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4456-S4457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  75TH ANNIVERSARY OF REPTILE GARDENS\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I wish to \nrecognize a very important South Dakota business and visitor attraction \nthat is observing its 75th anniversary this year. Reptile Gardens has \nbeen a main focal point for Black Hills area residents and the touring \ngeneral public since 1937.\n  It all began in 1935 when 19-year-old Earl Brockelsby discovered \npeople's interest in snakes. As a young tour guide at a local Rapid \nCity attraction, this fearless snake enthusiast would often end his \ntours by removing his hat and revealing a live rattlesnake coiled on \ntop of his head.\n  With the help of some friends, Earl built an 18-by-24-foot building \nat the top of a long hill outside of Rapid City and put a handful of \nspecimens on display. Even then, the young entrepreneur knew the vital \nimportance of location, location, location, as back in the 1930s cars \nwould often overheat as they reached the top of a long hill. Earl's \nidea was to have the cars stop in Reptile Gardens' parking lot to cool\n\n[[Page S4457]]\n\ntheir radiators and maybe stay to see the gardens.\n  Admission when the doors opened on June 3, 1937, was 10 cents for \nadults and 5 cents for children. That first day of operation, Black \nHills Reptile Gardens took in $3.85. For the next 2 days, no one \nvisited, and on the following 2 days, the attraction took in only 40 \ncents and 50 cents respectively. Fortunately, business would improve \nquickly, and by 1941 the business had 15 employees and was showing a \nprofit. Today, over a quarter million people visit Reptile Gardens each \nyear.\n  Brockelsby was an acute businessman and one of the true tourism \npioneers of South Dakota. He was also quite the practical joker. One of \nthe many interesting stories prepared by Joe Maierhauser of Reptile \nGardens includes Earl propping open the mouth of a dead alligator with \nthe Sunday newspaper inside and setting it outside a friend's home. \nThat friend happened to be the publisher of the Rapid City Journal.\n  The attraction would go through a move in 1965 with the construction \nof a new highway and a modernization that would give visitors the rare \nopportunity to walk amongst free-roaming reptiles and birds. It was one \nof the first such exhibits in the United States.\n  Over the many decades, Earl would become well known for his many \ntrips to obtain various specimens to showcase at his attraction. From a \none-man show in 1937, Reptile Gardens has expanded into a world-\nrenowned team of animal specialists and conservationists. Their goal is \nto educate the public about important environmental issues and work \nclosely with facilities worldwide on the preservation and care of rare \nspecimens, not to mention educating school-aged children and the \nvisiting public about various species and how they influence our world.\n  From crocodiles and alligators, lizards, snakes and spiders, birds, \nflowers and tortoises, Reptile Gardens offers a truly educational and \nentertaining experience. Decades of visitors can recall the facility's \nmascot Methuselah, a giant Galapagos tortoise that was brought to the \nfacility in 1954 and passed away last summer, as well as Mac the \nScarlet Macaw, who had been at the facility since the mid-1950s and \ncould recite most of the 20-minute snake show word for word.\n  Reptile Gardens has a worldwide reputation amongst visitors as well \nas among animal specialists. In addition to the various shows and \nspecimens on site that entertain, educate, and inform people of all \nages, their workers provide important research and preservation of \nnumerous rare species.\n  Reptile Gardens continues to be operated by the Brockelsby family, \nmaintaining the attraction as one of the must-see sites among the \ntouring public in South Dakota.\n  I congratulate and commend the Brockelsby family for their many years \nof service to the Black Hills and to South Dakota, as well as to the \nmany workers and specialists who have worked there over the past 75 \nyears. Sons John and Jeff Brockelsby and daughters Judee Oldham and \nJanet Jacobs have preserved the legacy of Earl and Maude Brockelsby \nwith eye-popping displays, hands-on exhibits, and shows with a flair \nfor the dramatic, all the while educating visitors on the importance of \npreservation and care of various species. I know Reptile Gardens will \ncontinue to be one of the most popular visitor attractions in South \nDakota for many years to come, and I applaud the Brockelsby family for \ntheir lasting contributions to tourism, education, and species \npreservation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/25/senate-section/article/S4457-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4457-S4458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH MONTH\n\n Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, we recognized May as \nNational Cancer Research Month. This year, more than 1.6 million \nAmericans will receive a cancer diagnosis and more than half a million \nAmericans will lose their battle with cancer. However, due to the \ndiscoveries made by cancer researchers, people are living with cancer \nlonger and, increasingly, are beating it.\n  Cancer researchers--world-class scientists and clinicians--are making \ninvaluable contributions to our health care knowledge. The National \nInstitute of Health, NIH, and the National Cancer Institute, NCI, are \nthe leading funders and conductors of biomedical research in the \nworld--including cancer research. According to Families USA, \napproximately seven jobs are created per research grant and each dollar \nof NIH grant money generates about $2.21 of new business activity.\n  In fiscal year 2011, Ohio scientists and physicians attracted more \nthan $710 million in grant funding, including $104 million dedicated to \ncancer research.\n  Ohio is on the cutting edge of cancer research thanks to world \nrenowned medical institutions, including Ohio's two NCI-designated \ncancer centers: the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, and the Ohio \nState University Comprehensive Cancer Center--the James Cancer Hospital \nand Solove Research Institute.\n  The Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, CCC, brings together the cancer \nresearch efforts at Case Western Reserve University, University \nHospitals Case Medical Center, and the Cleveland Clinic. Through this \ncollaboration, the brightest minds at Case, University Hospital, and \nthe Cleveland Clinic partner on cutting-edge cancer research bringing \ntogether more than 300 scientists and physicians to work on research \nprojects supported by more than $100 million in annual funding.\n  Case CCC also was awarded a Specialized Programs of Research \nExcellence, SPORE, grant--to promote translational cancer research.\n  The Case SPORE grant will allow Case to research gastrointestinal, \nGI, cancers. GI cancers are a leading cause of cancer deaths in men and \nwomen as well as disproportionately affect African Americans. African \nAmericans are more likely to have--and die--from colon cancer. \nAdditionally, the onset of colon cancer occurs at an earlier age for \nAfrican Americans. Of the four projects that would be funded by the \nCase GI SPORE, several include a research emphasis on colon cancer in \nAfrican Americans.\n  Case is also the lead center for the Barrett's Esophagus Research \nNetwork. This multiple center network allows for collaboration to \ndevelop a better understanding of Barrett's esophagus disorder and its \ncorrelation with esophageal cancer.\n  The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, also referred \nto as ``the James,'' was the Midwest's first fully dedicated cancer \nhospital and research institute.\n  The James researchers are drawn from 12 of Ohio State's 18 colleges \nto collaborate and study ways to prevent and treat cancer, including \nthe ways genetics influences cancer development and how targeted \ntherapies based on molecular genetics can promote treatment.\n  Research at the James has expanded our knowledge and understanding of \ncancer treatment. Researchers at the James found that 1 in 35 people \nwith colon cancer carry a genetic disease called Lynch syndrome. Of the \npatients who had this gene mutation, each had on average three family \nmembers with the mutation.\n  Thanks to the outstanding research conducted by the James, the early \ndetection of the mutation means that through regular colonoscopies, \npeople with Lynch syndrome will never develop colon cancer. This is \nremarkable-- through genetic advances, people can beat cancer before it \nstarts.\n  OSU scientists are also developing a medicated patch that releases a \ncancer-preventing drug onto precancerous oral lesions.\n  Other scientists are conducting clinical trials for new drugs to \ntreat patients with advanced or recurring breast, colon, lung, or \nprostate cancer. These drugs may offer new hope to patients who have \nexhausted most--if not all--existing therapeutic options.\n  The James and the Ohio State Wexner Medical Center is expanding its \ncancer research as the result of a $100 million grant made available \nfrom the health care reform legislation.\n  The funding has spurred the largest construction project in \nuniversity history, which will expand the Wexner Medical Center, \nincluding the James Cancer Hospital and Solove Research Institute. \nSlated to be completed by 2014, the expansion includes a new cancer \nhospital, critical care tower, outpatient center, research \nlaboratories, and classrooms--all designed to advance the medical \ncenter's mission to\n\n[[Page S4458]]\n\nimprove people's lives through innovation in patient care, education, \nand research.\n  This project put more than 5,000 Ohioans to work constructing the \nfacility and is expected to create 10,000 full-time jobs by 2014.\n  The University of Cincinnati Cancer Institute is another Ohio \ninstitution making strides in combating cancer.\n  UC's Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology is \npartnering with the Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute at Cincinnati \nChildren's Hospital to explore gene therapy for the treatment of \npediatric cancers and blood disorders.\n  I applaud the groundbreaking work conducted every day in Ohio and \nacross the country to increase prevention, improve treatment, and \nextend life-expectancies--for all constituencies.\n  Even though National Cancer Research Month has come to an end, I urge \nmy Senate colleagues to continue to support cancer research. While \nresearchers have made incredible strides in cancer research, only a \nmere 5 percent of Americans with pancreatic and other cancers have a 5-\nyear survival rate. Now is the time to strengthen the investment in the \nrevolutionary work of cancer researchers across the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/25/senate-section/article/S4458-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO YOUNG COLORADANS\n\n Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, today I wish to honor two young \nheroes from Colorado who received 9-1-1 for Kids' Medal of Honor this \nweek. The medal is bestowed upon young people who distinguish \nthemselves by calling 911 in an emergency and help to save someone's \nlife or report a crime. An award is also presented to the dispatcher \nwho processed the call and provided the appropriate emergency response.\n  Last year, 7-year-old Alisha Fetz and 12-year-old Matthew Diaz, both \nof Thornton, each found themselves in difficult situations in which \nthey needed to protect their family members.\n  Alisha called 911 on June 1, 2011 when her mother was having \ndifficulty breathing. Alisha answered dispatcher Ashley Bettschen's \nquestions clearly and calmly, even providing her mother's cell phone \nnumber and information on her mother's medical condition. Following all \nof dispatcher Bettschen's instructions, Alisha ensured that her mother \nwas treated quickly and efficiently.\n  On August 15, 2011, Matthew called 911 while his house was being \nburglarized. He locked himself and his younger sister in a bathroom and \nmanaged to whisper answers to Dispatcher Rhonda Halsey in a calm and \nclear manner. Because of his great descriptions of both the burglars \nand their vehicle, the suspects were apprehended only minutes later. \nThe burglars were both prior convicted felons, and several other open \ncases were cleared because of Matthew's call.\n  Both of these kids knew exactly what to do. They didn't panic, and \nthey helped ensure the safety of their family members through their \nactions. They and the dispatchers who helped them serve as a great \nexample of how important it is for kids to know what to do when trouble \narises.\n  The organization, 9-1-1 for Kids, is working to ensure that kids of \nall ages understand the importance and proper use of 911. It does so by \nraising awareness through conferences, media outreach, training \nactivities, school events, and by highlighting the stories of kids like \nAlisha and Matthew.\n  I join all Coloradans in offering our gratitude to dispatchers Ashley \nBettschen and Rhonda Halsey for their service to their communities and \ncongratulating Alisha and Matthew for this award as well as their \nbravery and ability to remain calm in the face of an emergency.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/25/senate-section/article/S4458-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4458-S4459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO PAUL L. PARETS\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of Senator \nChris Coons, Congressman John Carney and myself in recognition of Mr. \nPaul L. Parets upon his retirement from 36 years of exemplary service \nat A.I. duPont High School as a nationally-recognized high school band \ndirector and 46 years as a music educator. His enthusiasm and \nleadership over the years has won him the respect of educators, \nmusicians, community leaders, co-workers and students alike, and his \npassion for teaching music has inspired generations of Delawareans.\n  Growing up in Michigan, Paul Parets was not raised in a musical \nfamily. In fact, his parents expected Paul to become a doctor. But Paul \nhad a keen interest in music from an early age, and once he joined the \nband in his grade school, he was hooked. Following his graduation from \nMelvindale High School in Melvindale, MI, Paul received a Bachelor's of \nMusic Education from Central Michigan University and continued his \ngraduate education at the University of Michigan and the University of \nMaryland. For the first 10 years of his career, Paul led the band at \nCroswell-Lexington High School in Michigan. Fortunately for those of us \nin the First State, though, he moved to Delaware in 1976 and became the \nBand Director at A.I. duPont High School in Greenville. There, over the \ncourse of the next 4 decades, Paul developed one of the foremost high \nschool band programs in the country.\n  Under Paul's leadership, band membership rose from 90 students to \nwell over 300, and from one band sprouted five: the Freshman Band, \nSymphonic Band, Jazz Band, the Symphonic Wind Ensemble and The Tiger \nMarching Band.\n  Paul's unique approach to music education has made the A.I. duPont \nband program a standout in Delaware and in America. Through a student-\nelected executive board for the band, students--not teachers--are \nempowered to make major decisions about music and band activities. By \nallowing students to decide the arrangements they would like to \nperform, the drills they want to execute or the trips they want to \ntake, Paul gave his band members an important opportunity to learn how \nto lead, to make decisions and to become better musicians. Paul's \napproach also expanded the prospect of band membership to every \nstudent--from novices to the classically-trained, from football players \nto after-school waiters--giving all Tigers exposure to the power of \nmusic.\n  Paul once said in an interview with School Band & Orchestra Magazine \nthat he has two objectives as a band director. The first is to make \nsure his students play ``some great music by some great composers.'' \nThe second is that the students recognize that ``there is only one \npurpose for music, and that is to thrill people. Nobody listens to \nmusic that doesn't do something to them emotionally.'' And for the past \n36 years, our State--and the world--has been thrilled by Paul Parets \nand his A.I. Tigers.\n  Beyond A.I. duPont and Delaware, the rest of our Nation--and other \ncountries beyond our borders--began taking notice of Paul Parets and \nhis talented musicians at A.I. duPont years ago. Since 1989, his bands \nhave received first place awards in almost every category of every \nfestival competition they have entered. Paul is the only band director, \nand his Tiger Marching Band is the only high school band outside \nCalifornia, ever to be invited to the Pasadena Tournament of Roses \nParade an unprecedented five times: 1990, 1995, 1999, 2004, and 2008. \nThe Tigers have appeared in the Orange Bowl twice, the Macy's \nThanksgiving Day Parade, the Hall of Fame Bowl, the Fiesta Bowl twice, \nthe 6ABC Thanksgiving Day Parade in Philadelphia every year since 1987 \nand the inaugurations of three U.S. Presidents, the most recent being \nBarack Obama.\n  Internationally, Paul's Tigers have represented the First State with \nhonor at the London New Year's Day Parade seven times, the Rome New \nYear's day Parade twice, the St. Patrick's Day Parade in Dublin 4 \ntimes, and played for two of the world's most recognizable figures: \nQueen Elizabeth in London and Pope Benedict in St. Peter's Square. The \ntalents of his bands have filled the music halls and legendary stages \nof the Ireland National Concert Hall and The Royal Albert Hall in \nLondon.\n  Paul was named Delaware Teacher of the Year in 1987 and was a \nrecipient of the Ruth M. Jewell Outstanding Music Educator Award from \nthe Music Educator's National Conference at Indianapolis in 1988. In \n1989, my friend and former colleague, then-Governor Mike Castle, \nconferred on Paul the Order of the First State, as well. While Paul's \naccolades have made him legendary in the sphere of public education, \nhis legacy will undoubtedly remain with the thousands of students--many \nof whom are second generation Tigers--that he has taught in his nearly \n50-year career.\n\n[[Page S4459]]\n\n  It is not hard to see the span of influence Paul has had on his \nstudents, who are now scattered across the globe. He has nearly 2,000 \nFacebook friends, mainly made up of past and current students. A quick \nInternet search of his name will turn up blog post after blog post of \nformer students stating that Paul--or ``Mr. Parets''--``changed my \nlife,'' ``made a difference,'' and that A.I. will ``never be the same'' \nwithout him. I think all of us who have experienced the thrills of any \nof the A.I. duPont bands echo these sentiments. As they say at A.I., \n``You cannot hide that Tiger Pride,'' and I know I share that feeling \nof pride every time I turn on my TV and see the A.I. duPont Tigers \nmarching down the streets of Pasadena, London or New York. Up and down \nDelaware, we certainly can't hide our overwhelming pride for Paul \nParets, nor will we be able to hide our heartbreak when he is not on \nthe director's podium this fall.\n  Upon Paul's retirement, he will leave behind a legacy that is a \ntestament to the importance of music in public education and the pure \njoy--and thrill--of music. His lessons inside and outside of the \nclassroom will remain with his students, our community, and with future \ngenerations of A.I. duPont band members. I thank him for his \ncontribution to music education and for his commitment to public \nservice through years as an elected member to the Delaware City \nCouncil. I also thank him for the pride he has brought to the First \nState and for the generations of musicians he has nurtured--a gift that \nwill give time and time again. I wish him, his children, Tim and \nMeredith, and two grandchildren, Aaron and Abigail, and the rest of his \nfamily only the very best in all that lies ahead for each of them. As \nwe say in the Navy, ``Bravo Zulu!'' to Paul Parets. You are one of a \nkind, and we are blessed to have known you all of these years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/25/senate-section/article/S4459-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO SCOTT BLANCHARD\n\n Mr. THUNE.

She said the husband \nshe had been married to for nearly two decades--although he was sitting \ndirectly next to her--was still not back from the war.\n  Do you know what. Despite the fact that we often refer to these \nwounds as invisible, you could see it. When it came time for Stephen to \ndescribe to me his experiences, he shook as he explained how difficult \nthe transition\n\n[[Page S4462]]\n\nhome has been for him, his wife, and for their family.\n  The Davis family's story is no different than what thousands of other \nfamilies have faced. But their story does have a tragic and frustrating \ntwist. You see, Sergeant Davis knew when he returned home that he had a \nproblem with post-traumatic stress, and he was courageous enough to \nreach out for help. He sought care and he was diagnosed with PTSD.\n  But just a few months later, after a visit to Madigan Army Medical \nBase in my State of Washington, he was told something that shocked and \nappalled him and his wife. After just a 10-minute meeting and a written \nquestionnaire, Sergeant Davis was told he was exaggerating his symptoms \nand he didn't have PTSD. He was told, in effect, that despite serving \nin two war zones, despite being involved in three separate IED \nincidents, and despite his repeated deployments, he was making it all \nup.\n  He was then sent home with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder and \ntold his disability rating would be lowered and that the benefits he \nand his family would receive would ultimately be diminished. If this \nsounds like an isolated, shocking incident, here is something you will \nfind even more shocking. Sergeant Davis was one of literally hundreds \nof patients at that Army hospital who were told the exact same thing.\n  Soldiers who had been diagnosed with PTSD--not just once but several \ntimes--had their diagnosis taken away. In many instances these soldiers \nwere told they were embellishing or even outright lying about their \nsymptoms. In fact, so many soldiers were being accused of making up \nsymptoms by doctors at that hospital I began to get letters and phone \ncalls from them to my office.\n  Soon after that, documents came to light showing that the doctors \ndiagnosing these soldiers were being encouraged to consider not just \nthe best diagnosis for their patients but also the cost of care. These \nrevelations have led to a series of internal investigations that are \nstill underway today. Even more important, they have led to these \nsoldiers now, thankfully, being reevaluated, and today hundreds of \nthese soldiers, including Sergeant Davis, have had their proper PTSD \ndiagnosis restored.\n  This, too, could be viewed as an isolated incident. In fact, when I \nfirst raised concerns, the problems we saw at Madigan could be \nhappening at other bases across the country, that is exactly what I was \ntold--it was an isolated incident at one base, at one hospital. But I \nknew better.\n  I remembered back to this Salon article that ran a few years ago. In \nthat article, a doctor from Fort Carson in Colorado talked about how he \nwas ``under a lot of pressure to not diagnose PTSD.''\n  It went on to quote a former Army psychologist named David Rudd, who \nsaid:\n\n       Each diagnosis is an acknowledgement that psychiatric \n     casualties are a huge price tag of this war. It is easiest to \n     dismiss these casualties because you can't see the wounds. If \n     they change the diagnosis, they can dismiss you at a \n     substantially decreased rate.\n\n  Madam President, I also had my own staff launch an investigation into \nhow the military and the VA were diagnosing mental health conditions at \nother bases across our country, and I was very troubled by what I \nfound.\n  It became clear that there were other cases where doctors accused \nsoldiers of exaggerating symptoms without any documentation of \nappropriate interview techniques. They encountered inadequate VA \nmedical examinations, especially in relation to traumatic brain injury. \nThey found that many VA rating decisions contained errors, which in \nsome cases complicated the level of benefits that veterans should have \nreceived.\n  Now, to their credit, the Army did not run and hide as the questions \nabout other bases continued to mount. In fact, they have now taken two \nimportant steps. First, in April, they issued a new policy for \ndiagnosing PTSD that criticized the methods being used at Madigan and \npointed out to health officials throughout the entire system that it \nwas unlikely that soldiers were faking these symptoms. Then, in May, \nthe Army went further and announced they would review all mental health \ndiagnoses across the country dating back to 2001. That, in turn, has \nled Secretary Panetta to announce just last week that all branches of \nthe military are now going to undergo a similar review.\n  Without question, these are historic steps in our efforts to right a \ndecade of inconsistencies in how the invisible wounds of war have been \nevaluated. Servicemembers, veterans, and their families should never \nhave to wade through an unending bureaucratic process. Because of this \noutcry from veterans and servicemembers alike, the Pentagon now has an \nextraordinary opportunity to go back and correct the mistakes of the \npast.\n  We have to make sure these mistakes are never repeated. We still need \nto fundamentally change a system that Secretary Panetta admitted to me \nlast week has ``huge gaps'' in it.\n  That is why I am here this evening. Today, I am introducing the \nMental Health ACCESS Act of 2012. It is a bill that seeks to make \nimprovements to make sure that those who have served have access to \nconsistent, quality behavioral health care.\n  It is a bill that strengthens oversight of military mental health \ncare and improves the integrated disability evaluation system on which \nwe rely. As anyone who understands these issues knows well, this is not \nan easy task. The mental health care, suicide prevention, and \ncounseling programs we provide our servicemembers are spread throughout \nthis entire Department of Defense and the VA. Too often they are \nentangled in a web of bureaucracy and, frankly, too often this makes \nthem difficult to address in legislation.\n  In crafting this bill I identified critical changes that need to be \nmade at both the Department of Defense and the VA, and I set up a \nchecklist of legislative changes needed to do just that. Some \nprovisions in the bill will likely be addressed in my Veterans \nCommittee. Others will need to be addressed through Defense bills and \nwork with the chairs of those committees. But all of these provisions \nare critical, and today I want to share with you some of the most \nimportant ones.\n  High atop the list of changes this bill makes is addressing military \nsuicides which, as we all know, is an epidemic that now outpaces combat \ndeaths in this country. My bill will require the Pentagon to create \ncomprehensive standardized suicide prevention programs. It would also \nrequire the Department to better oversee mental health services for \nservicemembers.\n  It will expand eligibility for a variety of VA mental health services \nto family members so we can help families and spouses to cope with the \nstress of deployment and strengthen the support network that is \ncritical to servicemembers who are returning from deployment.\n\n  Third, my bill will improve training and education for our health \ncare providers. Oftentimes our servicemembers seek out help from \nchaplains, medics, or others who may be unprepared to offer counseling. \nThis bill will help prepare them through continuing education programs.\n  Fourth, my bill will create more peer-to-peer counseling \nopportunities. It would do it by requiring VA to offer peer support \nservices at all medical centers and by supporting opportunities to \ntrain vets to provide peer services.\n  Finally, this bill will require VA to establish accurate and reliable \nmeasures for mental health services. This will help ensure that the VA \nunderstands the problems they face so that veterans can get into the \ncare we know they can provide.\n  All of these are critical steps at a pivotal time, because the truth \nis, right now the Department of Defense and the VA are losing the \nbattle against the mental and behavioral wounds of these wars.\n  To see that, you don't need to look any farther than the tragic fact \nthat already this year over 150 active-duty servicemembers have taken \ntheir own lives or the fact that one veteran commits suicide in this \ncountry every 80 minutes. And while we all know there are a number of \nfactors that contribute to suicide--repeated deployments, lack of \nemployment security, isolation in their communities, and difficulty \ntransitioning back to their families--not having access to quality and \ntimely mental health care is vital.\n\n[[Page S4463]]\n\n  When our veterans cannot get the care they need, they often self-\nmedicate. When they wait endlessly for a proper diagnosis, they lose \nhope. Last year at this time, I held a hearing in my veterans committee \non the mental health disability system this bill seeks to strengthen, \nand I heard two stories that illustrate that despair.\n  Andrea Sawyer, the wife of Army SGT Lloyd Sawyer, testified about her \nhusband, who is an Iraq veteran and spent years searching for care. \nTogether, they hit barriers and they hit redtape so often that at one \npoint, she said, he held a knife to his throat in front of both her and \nan Army psychiatrist before being talked out of it.\n  Later, in that very same hearing, Daniel Williams, an Iraq combat \nveteran, testified about how his struggle to find care led him to stick \nthe gun in his mouth while his wife begged him to stop, only to see his \ngun misfire.\n  Those are the stories that define this problem. These are men and \nwomen we must be there for. They have served and sacrificed and done \neverything this country has asked of them. They have left their \nfamilies, left their homes. They have served multiple times and \nprotected our Nation's interests at home and abroad. This bill will \nmake a difference for them, but we have to make these changes now.\n  Today I am asking Members of the Senate from both sides of the aisle \nto please join me in this effort. We owe our veterans a medical \nevaluation system that treats them fairly, that gives them the proper \ndiagnosis, and that provides access to the mental health care they have \nearned and they deserve. We need to join together to get this \nlegislation passed, and I ask every Member of the Senate to help me get \nthis through. It is critical, as thousands of men and women come home \ntoday and thousands of them are waiting on care.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, let me begin by thanking the \nchair of the Senate veterans committee for her incredible leadership on \none of the most tragic issues of our times--the suicide rate among \nactive-duty personnel in our Armed Forces, and especially among \nveterans.\n  Last week I spoke to the Disabled American Veterans in Columbus. I \nhear these same issues all the time, particularly among men and women \nwho are sent for their second, third, fourth, and fifth deployments. \nOne veteran, active in the DAV, told me about an Ohio soldier who has \nhad a seventh deployment. That is not what we should be doing, and so I \nappreciate Senator Murray's leadership.\n  I am a member of that committee--the first Ohioan to ever serve on \nthe veterans committee for a full term--and I am on this committee \nbecause of these problems. So I am thankful for the leadership we have \non that committee and for what Senator Murray has done.\n  I remember when I was presiding some years ago, and she was talking \non the Senate Floor about her dad, who is a veteran, and I know that is \na big part of why she does what she does.\n  I thank the Senator from Washington State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/25/senate-section/article/S4463-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 503--DESIGNATING JUNE 2012 AS ``NATIONAL APHASIA \n   AWARENESS MONTH'' AND SUPPORTING EFFORTS TO INCREASE AWARENESS OF \n                                APHASIA\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota (for himself and Mr. Kirk) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 503\n\n       Whereas aphasia is a communication impairment caused by \n     brain damage that typically results from a stroke;\n       Whereas aphasia can also occur with other neurological \n     disorders, such as a brain tumor;\n       Whereas many people with aphasia also have weakness or \n     paralysis in the right leg and right arm, usually due to \n     damage to the left hemisphere of the brain, which controls \n     language and movement on the right side of the body;\n       Whereas the effects of aphasia may include a loss of, or \n     reduction in, the ability to speak, comprehend, read, and \n     write, but the intelligence of a person with aphasia remains \n     intact;\n       Whereas, according to the National Institute of \n     Neurological Disorders and Stroke (referred to in this \n     preamble as the ``NINDS''), strokes are the third-leading \n     cause of death in the United States, ranking behind heart \n     disease and cancer;\n       Whereas strokes are a leading cause of serious, long-term \n     disability in the United States;\n       Whereas the NINDS estimates that there are approximately \n     5,000,000 stroke survivors in the United States;\n       Whereas the NINDS estimates that people in the United \n     States suffer approximately 750,000 strokes per year, with \n     about \\1/3\\ of the strokes resulting in aphasia;\n       Whereas, according to the NINDS, aphasia affects at least \n     1,000,000 people in the United States;\n       Whereas the NINDS estimates that more than 200,000 people \n     in the United States acquire aphasia each year;\n       Whereas the people of the United States should strive to \n     learn more about aphasia and to promote research, \n     rehabilitation, and support services for people with aphasia \n     and aphasia caregivers throughout the United States; and\n       Whereas people with aphasia and their caregivers envision a \n     world that recognizes the ``silent'' disability of aphasia \n     and provides opportunity and fulfillment for people affected \n     by aphasia: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 2012 as ``National Aphasia Awareness \n     Month'';\n       (2) supports efforts to increase awareness of aphasia;\n       (3) recognizes that strokes, a primary cause of aphasia, \n     are the third-largest cause of death and disability in the \n     United States;\n       (4) acknowledges that aphasia deserves more attention and \n     study to find new solutions for people experiencing aphasia \n     and their caregivers;\n       (5) supports efforts to make the voices of people with \n     aphasia heard, because people with aphasia are often unable \n     to communicate with others; and\n       (6) encourages all people in the United States to observe \n     National Aphasia Awareness Month with appropriate events and \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/25/senate-section/article/S4463-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4463-S4464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 504--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC \n COMMITTEE TO RECOGNIZE WITH A MINUTE OF SILENCE AT THE 2012 OLYMPICS \n  OPENING CEREMONY THE ATHLETES AND OTHERS KILLED AT THE 1972 MUNICH \n                                OLYMPICS\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND (for herself, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Kirk, \nMr. Schumer, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Risch, Mr. \nLieberman, Mr. Brown of Massachusetts, Mr. Wyden, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \nCardin, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Levin, Mr. Begich, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Brown of \nOhio, Mr. Moran, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Grassley, \nMr. Lee, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Barrasso, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \nBlunt, Mrs. Feinstein, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Casey, and Mr. \nBoozman) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the flood insurance claims resulting from the hurricane \n     season of 2005 exceeded all previous claims paid by the \n     National Flood Insurance Program;\n       (2) in order to pay the legitimate claims of policyholders \n     from the hurricane season of 2005, the Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency has borrowed $19,000,000,000 from the \n     Treasury;\n       (3) the interest alone on this debt has been as high as \n     $800,000,000 annually, and that the Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency has indicated that it will be unable to pay \n     back this debt;\n       (4) the flood insurance program must be strengthened to \n     ensure it can pay future claims;\n       (5) while flood insurance is mandatory in the 100-year \n     floodplain, substantial flooding occurs outside of existing \n     special flood hazard areas;\n       (6) events throughout the country involving areas behind \n     flood control structures, known as ``residual risk'' areas, \n     have produced catastrophic losses;\n       (7) although such flood control structures produce an added \n     element of safety and therefore lessen the probability that a \n     disaster will occur, they are nevertheless susceptible to \n     catastrophic loss, even though such areas at one time were \n     not included within the 100-year floodplain; and\n       (8) voluntary participation in the National Flood Insurance \n     Program has been minimal and many families residing outside \n     the 100-year floodplain remain unaware of the potential risk \n     to their lives and property.\n\n     SEC. 103.

and\n       (B) reducing the current limits of coverage amounts \n     established in section 61.6 of title 44, Code of Federal \n     Regulations, would have on the ability of private insurers to \n     provide sufficient flood insurance coverage to effectively \n     replace the current level of flood insurance coverage being \n     provided under the National Flood Insurance Program.\n       (b) Report of the Administrator on Activities Under the \n     National Flood Insurance Program.--\n       (1) In general.--The Administrator shall, on an annual \n     basis, submit a full report on the operations, activities, \n     budget, receipts, and expenditures of the National Flood \n     Insurance Program for the preceding 12-month period to the \n     Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the \n     Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House \n     of Representatives.\n       (2) Timing.--Each report required under paragraph (1) shall \n     be submitted to the committees described in paragraph (1) not \n     later than 3 months following the end of each fiscal year.\n       (3) Contents.--Each report required under paragraph (1) \n     shall include--\n       (A) the current financial condition and income statement of \n     the National Flood Insurance Fund established under section \n     1310 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. \n     4017), including--\n       (i) premiums paid into such Fund;\n       (ii) policy claims against such Fund;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Commission on Natural \n     Catastrophe Risk Management and Insurance Act of 2012''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, which struck the \n     United States in 2005, caused, by some estimates, in excess \n     of $200,000,000,000 in total economic losses;\n       (2) many meteorologists predict that the United States is \n     in a period of increased hurricane activity;\n       (3) the Federal Government and State governments have \n     provided billions of dollars to pay for losses from natural \n     catastrophes, including hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanic \n     eruptions, tsunamis, tornados, flooding, wildfires, droughts, \n     and other natural catastrophes;\n       (4) many Americans are finding it increasingly difficult to \n     obtain and afford property and casualty insurance coverage;\n       (5) some insurers are not renewing insurance policies, are \n     excluding certain risks, such as wind damage, and are \n     increasing rates and deductibles in some markets;\n       (6) the inability of property and business owners in \n     vulnerable areas to obtain and afford property and casualty \n     insurance coverage endangers the national economy and public \n     health and safety;\n       (7) almost every State in the United States is at risk of a \n     natural catastrophe, including hurricanes, earthquakes, \n     volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, tornados, flooding, wildfires, \n     droughts, and other natural catastrophes;\n       (8) building codes and land use regulations play an \n     indispensable role in managing catastrophe risks, by \n     preventing building in high risk areas and ensuring that \n     appropriate mitigation efforts are completed where building \n     has taken place;\n       (9) several proposals have been introduced in Congress to \n     address the affordability and availability of natural \n     catastrophe insurance across the United States, but there is \n     no consensus on what, if any, role the Federal Government \n     should play; and\n       (10) an efficient and effective approach to assessing \n     natural catastrophe risk management and insurance is to \n     establish a nonpartisan commission to study the management of \n     natural catastrophe risk, and to require such commission to \n     timely report to Congress on its findings.\n\n     SEC. 203. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n       There is established a nonpartisan Commission on Natural \n     Catastrophe Risk Management and Insurance (in this title \n     referred to as the ``Commission'').\n\n     SEC. 204.

Res. 503\n\n       Whereas aphasia is a communication impairment caused by \n     brain damage that typically results from a stroke;\n       Whereas aphasia can also occur with other neurological \n     disorders, such as a brain tumor;\n       Whereas many people with aphasia also have weakness or \n     paralysis in the right leg and right arm, usually due to \n     damage to the left hemisphere of the brain, which controls \n     language and movement on the right side of the body;\n       Whereas the effects of aphasia may include a loss of, or \n     reduction in, the ability to speak, comprehend, read, and \n     write, but the intelligence of a person with aphasia remains \n     intact;\n       Whereas, according to the National Institute of \n     Neurological Disorders and Stroke (referred to in this \n     preamble as the ``NINDS''), strokes are the third-leading \n     cause of death in the United States, ranking behind heart \n     disease and cancer;\n       Whereas strokes are a leading cause of serious, long-term \n     disability in the United States;\n       Whereas the NINDS estimates that there are approximately \n     5,000,000 stroke survivors in the United States;\n       Whereas the NINDS estimates that people in the United \n     States suffer approximately 750,000 strokes per year, with \n     about \\1/3\\ of the strokes resulting in aphasia;\n       Whereas, according to the NINDS, aphasia affects at least \n     1,000,000 people in the United States;\n       Whereas the NINDS estimates that more than 200,000 people \n     in the United States acquire aphasia each year;\n       Whereas the people of the United States should strive to \n     learn more about aphasia and to promote research, \n     rehabilitation, and support services for people with aphasia \n     and aphasia caregivers throughout the United States; and\n       Whereas people with aphasia and their caregivers envision a \n     world that recognizes the ``silent'' disability of aphasia \n     and provides opportunity and fulfillment for people affected \n     by aphasia: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 2012 as ``National Aphasia Awareness \n     Month'';\n       (2) supports efforts to increase awareness of aphasia;\n\n[[Page S4594]]\n\n       (3) recognizes that strokes, a primary cause of aphasia, \n     are the third-largest cause of death and disability in the \n     United States;\n       (4) acknowledges that aphasia deserves more attention and \n     study to find new solutions for people experiencing aphasia \n     and their caregivers;\n       (5) supports efforts to make the voices of people with \n     aphasia heard, because people with aphasia are often unable \n     to communicate with others; and\n       (6) encourages all people in the United States to observe \n     National Aphasia Awareness Month with appropriate events and \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/25/senate-section/article/S4594-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SUPPORTING A MINUTE OF SILENCE AT THE 2012 OLYMPICS OPENING CEREMONY\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

Res. 504\n\n       Whereas, in September 1972, in the midst of the Munich \n     Olympics, the core spirit of the Olympics was violated when \n     members of the Black September Palestinian terrorist group \n     murdered eleven members of the Israeli Olympic Team \n     consisting of athletes, coaches, and referees;\n       Whereas one West German police officer was also killed in \n     the terrorist attack;\n       Whereas the international community was deeply touched by \n     the brutal murders at the Munich Olympics and memorials have \n     been placed around the world, including in Rockland County, \n     New York, United States; Manchester, United Kingdom; Tel \n     Aviv, Israel; and Munich, Germany;\n       Whereas the International Olympic Committee has an \n     obligation and the ability to fully and publicly promote the \n     ideals embodied in the Olympic Charter, which states, ``The \n     goal of Olympism is to place sport at the service of the \n     harmonious development of humankind, with a view to promoting \n     a peaceful society concerned with the preservation of human \n     dignity.''\n       Whereas no opening ceremonies of any Olympics since 1972 \n     have marked an official recognition of the terrorist attack \n     that brutally betrayed the vision of the Olympic Games; and\n       Whereas the London Olympic Games in 2012 will mark four \n     decades since this act of terror took place without a full \n     and public commemoration of the gravity of this tragic event \n     for all Olympians and all humankind: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) should observe a minute of silence to commemorate the \n     40th anniversary of the 1972 Munich Olympics terrorist attack \n     and remember those who lost their lives;\n       (2) urges the International Olympic Committee to take the \n     opportunity afforded by the 40th anniversary of the 1972 \n     Munich Olympics terrorist attack to remind the world that the \n     Olympics were established to send a message of hope and peace \n     through sport and athletic competition; and\n       (3) urges the International Olympic Committee to recognize \n     with a minute of silence at the 2012 Olympics Opening \n     Ceremony those who lost their lives at the 1972 Munich \n     Olympics in an effort to reject and repudiate terrorism as \n     antithetical to the Olympic goal of peaceful competition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/25/senate-section/article/S4594-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, JUNE 26, 2012\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.
