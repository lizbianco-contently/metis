Mr. President, in 1994, the Violence Against Women Act \npassed both Houses of Congress on strong bipartisan votes. In the 18 \nyears since then, incidents of domestic violence have fallen by 53 \npercent.\n  Despite that progress, staggering rates of abuse make it clear that \nwe still have a long way to go. More than a third of women and more \nthan a quarter of men in this country have been victims of violent \nsexual assault or stalking by a partner. Because of the unique nature \nof the crime, combating domestic violence and protecting those affected \nalso requires unique tools.\n  Victims have been abused by the very people who are supposed to love \nand care for them, so Congress must make certain law enforcement has \nthe means to stop these heinous crimes, and we must ensure communities \nhave the resources to support victims and help them heal. That is why \nthe Senate must move quickly to reauthorize this legislation, which \nexpired last year.\n  Many of the programs under the act have been funded for the last year \nby continuing resolutions, but a full reauthorization is necessary to \nensure authorities have all the resources they need to fight domestic \nviolence.\n  Women and families across the country are depending on us to act. \nSeveral from Nevada wrote to share their stories.\n  When I practiced law, this law was not in effect. The only good news \nduring that period of time that developed as I began to do more work in \nthe domestic relations field was as a result of some generous people \nestablishing in Las Vegas a domestic crisis shelter. What is that? It \nis a place where women and children can go to stay away from husbands \nwho were abusing them. It is so important. These are secret locations; \nyou cannot find them in the phone book. It gives these women and their \nchildren--sometimes just a woman--a place to go.\n\n[[Page S2614]]\n\n  I had a leadership meeting this morning and spent some time talking \nto them about some examples of things that took place before this law \npassed. It was very difficult to find ways of helping these women. With \nthis law, it is much easier. We must continue this extremely important \nlegislation. The women who wrote to me had some very sad stories. \nWithout this legislation, it would be even worse.\n  Coincidentally, I talked to Vice President Biden this morning and \nreminded him of what he had done. He has been watching what we do here. \nHe said thanks for continuing this legislation. It was his idea, and it \nhas been extremely valuable for this country.\n  Every day in America, three less fortunate women die at the hands of \ntheir abusers--by being abused by their spouses. In addition to those \nthree who die, there are nine more who are abused very much. They have \nserious injuries. Some have been made paralyzed as a result of the \nbeatings. It is hard to believe these beatings take place, but they do. \nIt is in our power--the 100 of us--to protect them and help them.\n  Reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act would help law \nenforcement continue to develop effective strategies to prosecute cases \ninvolving violent crimes against women. But also, in addition to the \ncriminal aspect of it, it allows these women a place to go.\n  It would provide funding for shelters and transitional housing \nprograms for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, and it \nwould help victims get back on their feet. It would make legal \nassistance available to victims of violence, and it would safeguard \nchildren victimized and affected by dating violence and stalking.\n  This reauthorization would also enact important improvements to the \nlaw, gleaned from 18 years of experience combating violence against \nwomen.\n  It would extend better protections for Native American women. The \nmost significant spousal abuse and abuse to children takes place on \nIndian reservations. This legislation will enlarge the breadth of the \nbill to protect these people who are so badly in need of help.\n  This legislation also includes nondiscrimination protection for all \nvictims, regardless of what they look like or where they are from.\n  It reduces bureaucracy and implements new accountability measures to \nensure Federal investments are properly spent.\n  It places great emphasis on training police to respond to reports of \nsexual assault, which has among the lowest conviction rates for any \nviolent crime. For police officers, it is one of the most dangerous \nthings they can do. Last year, we had a peace officer in Las Vegas--a \nsergeant who had been in law enforcement many years--who went with \nanother officer to respond to a domestic violence phone call. He was \nshot and killed as he walked in the door. So we do need to understand \nthat we need to continue to help train police and also make them better \ntrained to convict the people doing these bad things.\n  Many years ago, when I was a freshman in the Senate, I held a \nhearing, under the auspices of the Appropriations Committee, on spousal \nabuse. Maybe things have changed over the years--and I hope they have. \nThere are better counseling programs. But one thing we learned during \nthose hearings many decades ago was that the main thing that helped a \nman stop abusing his wife was to put him in jail. Maybe things are \nbetter now. At least we need to have better tools to make it so these \npeople can be convicted of these brutal crimes.\n  We know the tools and training this legislation provides are \neffective. Consider this legislation's successful record of reducing \ndomestic violence by 53 percent and helping police punish these \nabusers. We need to do better, but what we have done has been a big \nstep forward from the time I was holding those hearings, before this \nlegislation became effective.\n  That is why the Senate reauthorized this law unanimously in 2005, on \na 95-to-0 vote. That is pretty good. Again, in 2005, we did it \nunanimously. And in 2000, we did it by a 95-to-0 vote. Both times it \nwas unanimous. I hope we can do it again.\n  I look forward to a similar bipartisan vote this year, as Democrats \nand Republicans join together to renew our national commitment to \nending domestic violence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/24/senate-section/article/S2614-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

But if \nthis moves forward quickly with a short time agreement, but in an \neffort to weaken the bill, we want no part of that.\n  I look forward to conversations to begin with staff and to bring in \nSenator Leahy and others, and Senator McConnell and I can work on this.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there is no reason to fight over \nsomething that nobody wants to have a fight over. We are happy to work \non a reasonable time agreement and pass that in short order.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/24/senate-section/article/S2614-3", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2614-S2615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            BROKEN PROMISES\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is no secret that most Americans are \ntired of candidates for political office who make promises they don't \nkeep. And who can blame them? For years, politicians have been going to \nWashington promising to make government more effective, more efficient, \nto balance the books, make life more secure, and restore Americans' \nconfidence in their country again. And time and time again, they have \neither failed to get it done or didn't even make an effort in the first \nplace.\n  Frankly, it is hard to think of any politician who has promised more \nand delivered less than our current President. He was the one who would \nerase old divisions and bring people together. He was the one who would \nrise above politics as usual and usher in a new era of bipartisan \nharmony. A lot of people believed him. Naturally, a lot of them are \neven more jaded now than ever. They are jaded because a candidate who \nsaid he was different turned out to be just another politician who \nseems more concerned with reelection than reform. Not only has he \nfailed to step up to the challenges we face, he has actually aggravated \nthem. Social Security, for example, is now expected to go broke 3 years \nsooner than we expected. The Tax Code is more complicated than ever. \nThe national debt is bigger than any of us could have imagined. Health \ncare costs are higher. Gas prices are up. Millions cannot find work. \nAnd even most college graduates--those best equipped to step into the \nmodern economy--either cannot find work to match their skills or can't \nfind any work at all.\n  Instead of fixing problems, he has made them worse.\n  What is he doing now? Well, the President who was supposed to change \nthe direction of the country now wants to change the subject. He spends \nhis days running around the country blaming whatever doesn't happen to \npoll well that day for the consequences of his own policies. He spent 2 \nyears expanding government and constricting free enterprise, and now \nthat the results are in he spends his time pointing the finger at \nothers for problems that originated right in his White House. It is the \nmillionaires; it is the banks; it is big oil; it is the weather; it is \nFox News; it is anything but him. And it's absurd. I mean, if you \nbelieve that a President who got everything he wanted for 2 years--2 \nwhole years--has nothing to do with the problems we face, then I have a \nsolar panel company to sell you.\n\n  The President spent 2 years reshaping America in the image of Western\n\n[[Page S2615]]\n\nEurope, and now he wants us to believe our economy is performing as if \na Western European economy has nothing to do with it.\n  Nowhere is this more apparent than in the challenges facing the young \npeople in America today. As we all know, one of the defining \ncharacteristics of Western European economies is the high unemployment \nrate, particularly among young people and recent college graduates. \nSluggish growth and inflexible labor laws are two of the main reasons \nyoung people have been locked out of the labor market in those \ncountries literally for years. Today unemployment is above 20 percent \namong young people in the European Union. In Spain the unemployment \nrate among people under the age of 25 is a staggering 50 percent.\n  Some of this is no doubt a result of the European debt crisis, but \nthe more fundamental problem is decades of policies rooted in the same \nbig government vision the President has been busy imposing right here \nin the United States. It is hardly a coincidence that as President \nObama has tried to reshape the United States in the image of Western \nEurope, our own youth unemployment rate has been stubbornly high. That \nis what happens when you increase regulations on businesses that hire \ncollege graduates. That is what happens when you impose health care \nmandates on them. That is what happens when you impose new labor rules, \nsuch as the one Senator Enzi is leading the charge against this week \nthat makes it even costlier for businesses to hire. We see the long-\nterm effects of these things in Europe, and unless this President \nchanges course we will see the same lack of opportunity for young \npeople right here.\n  So today the President will bring his latest poll-tested message to \nthe students at the University of North Carolina, and I am sure he will \ngive a very rousing speech full of straw men and villains who stand in \nthe way of their dreams. I am sure he will also express his strong \nsupport for things on which all of us already agree. But what he will \nnot talk about is the extent to which the decisions he has made are \nlimiting their opportunities in the years ahead.\n  Some of them already see this. I mean, you have to think most of \nthese students are sharp enough to put this President's rhetoric up \nagainst his record and to conclude that it simply doesn't add up. As \nthe promises of this President's campaign collide with real life, I \nthink young people across the country will realize they got sold a bill \nof goods. The next time they are promised change, they will know enough \nto kick the tires first.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/24/senate-section/article/S2615-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from California.\n\n\n                       Surface Transportation Act\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very pleased with what just happened \nat the desk. For those who didn't follow it, the majority leader, \nSenator Reid, and Senator McConnell, just named the conferees so we can \nget moving with the House and settle our differences and move forward \nwith a very important transportation bill.\n  We all know how hard it has been on the construction industry. We all \nknow the housing crisis has made it very difficult for our construction \nworkers to get work. We all know at the same moment we have had this \nreal problem in the construction industry--where we have well over 1 \nmillion construction workers out of work and tens of thousands of \nbusinesses that want to do construction work--70,000 of our bridges are \nfailing, half of our roads are in disrepair, and the American people \nexpect an infrastructure that meets the needs of the strongest economy \nin the world, our economy.\n  So I am very pleased with what just happened. I am very pleased we \nsee the continuation over here of bipartisan support for a \ntransportation bill. We have Senator Reid working together with Senator \nMcConnell to name the conferees, and we had a unanimous vote in our \ncommittee last year on this bill. It has been a very tortured path to \nget to where we are now because, for some inexplicable reason, the \nRepublicans over in the House have insisted on just going to their own \nparty to reach agreement rather than going to the Democrats so we can \nhave bipartisanship over there. But I am very hopeful, with the naming \nof these conferees today, the House will now do its job and name \nconferees. I have been reading in the press that perhaps that will \nhappen tomorrow. So I am very hopeful.\n  Mr. President, it is 10:20 in the morning on Tuesday, and I want to \ncall attention to the fact we are now on the path we need to be on, \nstarting at this moment, to get to conference. There is no reason we \ncan't do that very soon when so much is at stake.\n  The Senate bill is a reform bill. There are no earmarks in that bill. \nThat bill is fully paid for. It doesn't add to the deficit. It protects \n2 million jobs and creates another 1 million jobs. What good news will \nit be for this economy to have this bill pass.\n  I know there are those who predicted this could never happen; that, \nA, we would never get a bipartisan bill out of our committee, but we \ndid it; that, B, we would never get it to pass on the floor, but we did \nit with 74 votes; and, C, that the House will never act, and the House \nactually did act to move to conference. It took them a long time, but \nwe are there. So there is no reason we cannot work together to get this \ndone.\n  If Senator Inhofe and I can agree, then I think we should be able to \nget a very strong bill through both Houses. On my committee--the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, which I am so privileged to \nchair--we have very conservative members, such as Senators Inhofe and \nSessions, and very progressive members, such as myself. We have Senator \nVitter on the other side and Senator Sessions, and on this side we have \nSenators Sanders and Cardin. So we have members who reach the entire \nideological spectrum, and if we can all vote for a bill, then this can \nhappen and it will send a great signal to this country.\n  I thank all the groups that have worked so hard to bring pressure on \nall of us to keep this moving forward. It starts with a coalition that \nincludes the AFL CIO and the chamber of commerce. Good for them. They \ndo not always agree, but they agree on this one.\n\n[[Page S2616]]\n\nThen we have all the business community that is behind us--the granite \npeople and the cement people and the general contractors. The list goes \non and on. There are many groups that have come together to push \nforward on this bill.\n  So I want to mark this moment. I am happy I was able to be on the \nSenate floor when the conferees were named. It is a great list of \nconferees.\n  We have in this bill the RESTORE Act, which will rebuild the gulf \nafter the terrible BP spill, and we have people on this conference who \nwere very instrumental in writing the RESTORE Act, including Senator \nBill Nelson and Senator Richard Shelby. Senator Vitter also was \ninvolved, and I want to take a moment to thank Senator Landrieu, who \nwas a driving force on this bill. There is no question that without her \ninsistence this wouldn't have happened. So what an opportunity we have.\n  Now, there are certain things I think we should keep out of this \nconference, and that is things that tear us apart. There is no reason \nto have controversy built into this conference. We can save those \nbattles for another day. I think, with this conference, we should just \nall rally around the consensus of what has to be done. If it is \nsomething outside the scope of the conference, if it is unanimous \nand everybody thinks it is a good idea--such as the RESTORE Act--then \nlet's do it.\n\n  There is a provision in the bill that helps our rural counties use \nthe proceeds from timber sales for their schools--this is so critical--\nand for their local governments. One could argue it is not part of the \ntransportation program, but it is a consensus. It is a coming together, \nand where we can do that it is very important we stick with those \nconsensus items and stay away from the highly charged controversies. We \nhave plenty of time for that. We don't have to put that into this \nconference. So I look forward to the House naming their conferees so we \ncan get this done.\n  I also want to say how important it is that we pass the Violence \nAgainst Women Act. This bill, which has 61 cosponsors--it is my \nunderstanding that is the case--is a strong bill, and it makes sure \npeople who are the victims of violence are taken care of, and it \ncontinues a great program that was put together by then-Senator Joe \nBiden.\n  I remember it well because I was in the House at the time and then-\nSenator Biden, now Vice President Biden, doing such a great job, spoke \nto me and said: Congresswoman Boxer, would you be willing to carry the \nHouse version of the Violence Against Women Act? This was in the early \n1990s. I looked at the bill, read the bill, and said I would be honored \nto do so. I was so proud to work with Joe Biden on this issue. We had \nworked together on coastal issues and now we worked together, at that \ntime, on violence against women.\n  I was able to get a couple of the provisions passed--a couple of, I \nwould say, smaller provisions passed: safety on campuses, campus \nlighting, and some other things. But the heart of the bill did not pass \nuntil I actually was over here in the Senate, when Senator Biden really \npicked up steam and drove that bill through. My understanding is that \nSenator Schumer--at that time in the House--picked up the bill and did \nthe same in the House.\n  This has been the law of the land--the Violence Against Women Act--\nsince the 1990s, so we don't need to have any arguments about it. I was \nvery glad to hear Senator McConnell say he didn't intend to have any \narguments about it because in this bill we cover even more people: \npeople who were brutalized, women who were brutalized, and it is very \nkey.\n  I see my colleague, Senator Harkin, has come to discuss a very \nimportant matter, a labor matter, and I would tell him I will finish in \nabout 3 minutes, if that is OK with him.\n  I want to conclude by saying that the Violence Against Women Act is \nwhat we call a no-brainer. It is a serious problem in our Nation. \nSenator Reid said three women are killed every day because of violence \nagainst women.\n  The shelters in our States are doing incredible work. They take in \nwomen and children. They make sure there is protection and crack down \non the violators and there is no reason to argue about that.\n  The last thing I wanted to talk about in the last couple minutes goes \nto the heart of what Senator McConnell said in his leader time. I have \nnoticed that almost every time Senator McConnell has a chance on the \nSenate floor he comes and attacks President Obama and he goes after \nPresident Obama and blames him for everything under the sun. I have to \nsay I support Senator McConnell's right to say whatever he wants to \nsay. He has every right to use his leadership powers to attack the \nPresident and do it as much as he wants. So I am not complaining about \nthat. But I am just saying it is very unfortunate for this country that \nthe Republican leader in the Senate said, and I quote--I am not quoting \ndirectly the words, but this is what he said--that his highest priority \nwas making President Obama a one-term President, and he is carrying it \nout on the floor of this Senate.\n  The things he blames this President for are unbelievable. The way he \nattacks the President for being out around the country--he doesn't \nattack the Republican candidates for President for traveling around the \ncountry. Let's face it, it is a few months to the election. Does he \nexpect the President to stay in the White House? I am glad the \nPresident is getting outside. I am glad the President is making \nspeeches. I am glad the President is fighting for students. I am glad \nthe President is fighting for senior citizens. I am glad the President \nis fighting for small business. I am glad he is fighting for fairness. \nWhy should a billionaire pay a lower tax rate than a secretary? I am \nglad this President is doing all that. To hear him attacked day after \nday after day is absolutely discouraging when we have so much work we \ncan do that we can talk about in our leader time. But I have decided I \nam going to follow this, and every time Senator McConnell does this I \nam going to use my privileges as a Senator to come down.\n  Let's never forget, this President inherited the worst economy since \nthe Great Depression from a Republican President who left us bleeding \n800,000 jobs a month, who left us with an auto industry flat on its \nback, who left us with a credit system that was frozen. This President, \nthrough his leadership, stepped up and led us out of that mess. The \nother voices, the naysayers, said: Let Detroit go bankrupt. Stay out of \neverything. This President didn't listen because he is a fighter for \nchange.\n  If this floor is going to be used to attack this President, count me \nin to stand and make sure the record is set straight. I hope we can go \nback to the work we need to do instead of using the floor of this great \nbody to attack our President, the President of the United States of \nAmerica. Everyone has a right to do it. Believe me, I don't argue that. \nBut I also have the right as a Senator--and so do others--to come to \nclear the record on that, and I intend to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/24/senate-section/article/S2616-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2616-S2627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF THE RULE SUBMITTED BY THE \n NLRB RELATING TO REPRESENTATION ELECTION PROCEDURES--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S.J. Res. \n36, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to S.J. Res. 36, a joint resolution \n     providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of \n     title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the \n     National Labor Relations Board relating to representation \n     election procedures.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill be 2 hours of debate, equally divided, between the leaders or \ntheir designees on the motion to proceed.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield such time to the Senator from South \nCarolina as he may need.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senator from \nWyoming for yielding but, more importantly, for his leadership on the \nsubject that brings us all to the floor.\n  The National Labor Relations Board has gotten a lot of attention \nlately and\n\n[[Page S2617]]\n\nfor reasons I don't think are too helpful to the cause. Obviously, \nbeing from South Carolina, their decision to entertain a complaint \nagainst the Boeing Company for moving to South Carolina, a complaint \nfiled by the machinists union that sat on their desk for 1 year and \nthen finally was brought forward by the NLRB to potentially close down \nthe South Carolina site and move the facility back to Washington, thank \nGod, is behind us now.\n  But at the end of the day, this organization, the National Labor \nRelations Board, seems to be hell bent on changing processes across the \nboard more for political reason than a substantive reason.\n  What brings us here today is the rulemaking proposal to change the \ntime for union elections for employees to vote on whether they want to \nbe part of a union. It does away with the preelection consultation, the \nidea of the employer and the people wanting to represent the employees \nsitting down and seeing if they can work out a proposal or a \ncompromise; it shortens the election time to as little as 10 days. So \nif you are in the company in question, you have a 10-day period before \nthe election. The current mean average is 38 days.\n  I would argue this is being done not to make things more efficient \nbut to change outcomes. Quite frankly, the outcome being desired is to \nmake the union position stronger, not to make the system more \nefficient. That is what happens.\n  I expect a Republican President to nominate people to a board such as \nthe NLRB with a business background. I expect a Democratic President to \nnominate people to the NLRB and like boards with maybe a more union \nbackground. But I expect the Board not to take the agency and turn it \ninto a political organization and try to create by rulemaking what we \ncan't create by legislating. That is what brings us here today.\n  The whole complaint filed by the machinists union in Washington, \ntaking that complaint up that the move to South Carolina was somehow in \nretaliation against the union in Washington when no one lost their job \nin the State of Washington and no one's pay was reduced I think was \ntaking the NLRB into an area it has never gone before.\n  This is just a continuation of that pattern and this is not good \nbecause the unelected aspect of our government, the NLRB and similar \nagencies, has a lot of sway over our economy. At a time when we are \ntrying to make sure we create jobs in America and make it easier for \npeople to locate their companies here, proposals such as this are \nundercutting what we need to be doing.\n\n  This is an unprecedented move. This kind of breathtaking change in \nthe rules has only happened, I think, two or three times, and this was \nproposed as Mr. Becker was on the way out. Congress, under the \nAdministrative Review Act, has an opportunity to stop this before it is \ntoo late. What this is being called on our side is sort of an ambush \nelection.\n  The point we are trying to make is that by changing this rule to a \n10-day period and doing away with preelection negotiations basically \ncreates an environment where people are having to cast votes and not \nunderstanding who is going to be representing them or the nature of \ntheir decision. Why do we want to shorten an election? Why do we want \nto do away with the ability to negotiate between the employer and \npeople who want to represent the employees?\n  I don't see this is addressing a problem that exists. I think this is \nmore motivated by getting at an outcome rather than reforming a \nprocess. I hope some of our Democratic colleagues will say this is \nexcessive and unnecessary.\n  If the Congress doesn't stand in the way between the American people \nand unelected bureaucrats, who will? This is your chance as a Member of \nCongress to do something about the unelected side of government that is \ngrowing more powerful by the day. We have a chance here to say no to a \nrule that makes no sense, that is going to skew the playing field and, \nquite frankly, I think represents the worst of special interest \npolitics.\n  I hope Senators will take an opportunity to exercise their authority \nas a Member of Congress and say: Whoa. Time out. We don't need to go \ndown this road. Let's let people understand who will be representing \nthem, let the people who are going to vote in an election regarding \nunionization of the workplace to have a meaningful understanding of \nwhat they are about to vote on. There is no reason to shorten the \nprocess to 10 days. I doubt most of us would like our elections to be \nshortened to 10 days.\n  This is not about reforming an election process that is broken. It is \nabout trying to change the outcome and skew it to the benefit of one \nside versus the other. Again, the rulemaking is not necessary. This is \na chance for a Member of Congress to stand and say no to the unelected \nside of government at a time when somebody needs to say no to them.\n  I just hope and pray we can get some bipartisan support for this \nbecause Senator Enzi has done a very good job of trying to explain to \nthe Senate and to our conference as a whole about what awaits the \nAmerican workforce if this rule is changed, why it is unnecessary. It \nis not about reforming a broken process; it is trying to get an outcome \nwhere one side benefits versus the other.\n  I just hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will look at \nthis as an opportunity for Congress to speak against the excessive \nrulemaking and what I think is an abuse of a process.\n  With that, I yield, and I appreciate very much the leadership of \nSenator Enzi.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Carolina, \nparticularly for the insight on the way that this particular Board \nabused his State and found out they were wrong and got it all taken \ncare of. But his comments are particularly valuable in dealing with \nthis shortening of the time as well.\n  I thank him for speaking and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  For more than 1 year, I have been working on a series of hearings, \nboth in Washington, DC, and in Iowa, focusing on the state of the \nAmerican middle class.\n  We have learned that the American middle class is disappearing, \nfalling into the widening gulf between the haves and the have-nots. The \npeople who do the real work in this country are being squeezed to the \nbreaking point. Their paychecks aren't rising. Their benefits are \ndisappearing. Their pensions are disappearing. Their jobs are being \nshipped overseas.\n  When we looked into the causes of this crisis, we found that the \nmiddle class is not disappearing due to some inevitable effect of \nforces beyond our control such as globalization and technology. In \nfact, the decline of the middle class is primarily due to policy \nfailures. We have failed to respond to our changing economy, while at \nthe same time we have allowed many of the underpinnings of a strong \nmiddle class, such as a fair minimum wage, strong overtime laws, and \ndefined benefit pensions to disappear.\n  One of the biggest factors in this downward spiral has been the \ndecline of American unions. As former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich \nexplained when he testified before the HELP Committee last year, when \nunions were strong, the middle class thrived and our country prospered. \nIn the mid-1950s, more than one-third of all American workers in the \nprivate sector were unionized and the unions demanded and received a \nfair slice of the American pie. Nonunionized companies, fearing their \nworkers would otherwise want a union, offered similar deals. As \nemployers boosted wages, the higher wages kept the machinery of our \neconomy going by giving average workers more money to buy what they \nproduced. That is what the former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich said.\n  But now, unfortunately, that productive cycle has broken down. \nWorkers have lost their unions, and they don't have money in their \npockets to spend and help grow the economy. That is costing us the jobs \nand holding back our economy.\n  There are lots of reasons for the decline in unions, but I think \nagain this chart which I showed yesterday is instructive. If we look at \nthe chart, from 1973 to 2010, we will see, first of all, in the green \nline is the number of workers\n\n[[Page S2618]]\n\ncovered by collective bargaining agreements. Look how unionization has \ndeclined. Here is the union membership. These are the ones covered by \ncollective bargaining agreements. Here is union membership going down \nthe same way. The red line is the middle class share of national \nincome. Look how it tracks it. So as union membership and collective \nbargaining has decreased, the middle class share of national income has \ndecreased also, almost parallel. Again, lots of reasons, but I think a \nbig one is the broken union election process. It has become so riddled \nwith abuses that people are giving up on it altogether. As I mentioned \nin my remarks yesterday, the number of union representation elections \nhas declined by an astounding 60 percent between 1997 and 2009. When \nworkers do file for an NLRB election, 35 percent give up in the face of \nextreme employer intimidation and withdraw from the election before a \nvote is even held, and that is after they have already signed the card \nto petition for the NLRB to have an election, one-third of them never \nget to an election.\n\n  The rule we are discussing today cannot solve all of these problems, \nbut as I said yesterday, it is a step in the right direction. It \naddresses some of the most abusive situations where unscrupulous \ncompanies are manipulating the process and creating delays so they can \nbuy more time to intimidate workers.\n  The primary way management can cause delay is to raise challenges at \nthe preelection hearing. Some of these disputes, such as challenging \nthe eligibility of an individual voter, can certainly wait until after \nthe election to be decided. That is what we do in elections across the \ncountry. If a voter's eligibility cannot be confirmed, they vote a \nprovisional ballot until their eligibility can be verified. We don't \nstop an election from happening until every voter's eligibility can be \nconfirmed. We don't do that. If there is a challenge, they vote a \nprovisional ballot and after the election they see whether they were \nqualified to vote. Some of these challenges are downright silly, but \nthey have their intended effect, and that is to delay.\n  In 2002, one employer raised a preelection challenge arguing that the \nInternational Association of Machinists was not a ``labor \norganization'' within the meaning of the statute. The NLRB actually \nheld a hearing on this question and, of course, found that the \nmachinists who had been representing workers since 1888 are indeed a \nlabor union. But the election was delayed by a month to address that \none issue.\n  Some anti-union consultants bragged openly about their ability to \nabuse the process and create delays. One union-busting law boasted on \nits Web site how a 27-day hearing contributed to a 5-month delay \nbetween filing of a petition and the election at a Massachusetts \nhospital organizing drive.\n  Why is delay so important to management who do not want to bargain in \ngood faith with workers? Well, by delaying an NLRB election, they give \nthemselves more time to conduct an anti-union campaign and make it more \nlikely they will win.\n  One former anti-union consultant wrote a book that is very \ninstructive. Everyone should read it. It is called ``Confessions of a \nUnion Buster.'' He described his strategy as ``[c]hallenge everything . \n. . then take every challenge to a full hearing . . . then prolong each \nhearing'' as long as possible, then ``appeal every unfavorable \ndecision.'' The consultant explained that ``if you make the union fight \ndrag on long enough, workers . . . lose faith, lose interest, lose \nhope.'' Let me repeat that. This is from an anti-union consultant who \nwrote this book called ``Confessions of a Union Buster,'' and he said, \n``if you make the union fight drag on long enough, workers . . . lose \nfaith, lose interest, lose hope.''\n  The impact on workers is clear. In 2000, workers at Dillard's \ndistribution center in Little Rock, AR, began efforts to organize a \nunion with the Union of Needletrades Industrial and Textile Employees, \nUNITE for short. The campaign involved a unit of between 500 and 600 \nworkers employed as pickers, packers, forklift drivers, loaders, other \nwarehouse workers, many making just over the minimum wage.\n  Dillard's management began talking with workers about the union \nalmost immediately after workers began signing cards--before the \npetition was even filed. Aware that the company was likely to quickly \nescalate its campaign, UNITE, the union, filed an election petition in \nthe spring of 2000, a couple of weeks after it began meeting with \nworkers. At the time it filed for the election, UNITE had signed union \nauthorization cards from 65 to 70 percent of the workers to join a \nunion.\n  Well, what happened? Soon after the union filed the election \npetition, the company began holding mandatory captive audience meetings \nand one-on-one meetings with all workers. Basically threats were made \nthat if the union were to succeed, the distribution center might lose \nits competitiveness and be forced to shut down.\n  The employer also launched legal challenges to the workers' petition. \nGet this. The management claimed that all professional and white collar \nworkers should be in the election unit--even those at the corporate \nheadquarters in a separate building adjacent to the distribution \ncenter.\n  Well, the company forced a dispute that took months to resolve. The \ncompany didn't want the white collar workers in the union, but by \nchallenging it and saying they should be in it, forced the NLRB to have \na hearing that took months to resolve.\n  The company took advantage of this delay to continue its anti-union \ncampaigning. It isolated union supporters by excluding them from \ncaptive audience meetings and changing their shifts or job locations. \nIt distributed and posted anti-union literature and continued one-on-\none meetings.\n  Support for the union began to wane as workers' fears grew. Workers \nfelt they were under surveillance at work and could not discuss the \nunion at the worksite or even outside the distribution center before or \nafter their shifts. Workers grew too scared even to accept union \nmaterials that their fellow workers handed out outside of the plant \ngates. Attendance at general meetings and organizing committee meetings \nfell sharply over the months leading up to the election. After facing \n2\\1/2\\ months of intense anti-union campaigning, workers voted against \nunion representation by a margin of two to one. About 3 months before \nthat, over 65 percent to 70 percent of the workers had signed a \npetition to form a union, but less than 3 months later, they voted two \nto one not to have a union.\n  The NLRB has put in place reasonable rules to limit the kind of game \nplaying that the workers from Dillard's experienced. The NLRB hasn't \ntried to advantage or disadvantage workers or stop employers from \nspreading their message. All the board has done is send a clear message \nto employers. They cannot abuse the process to buy themselves more time \nto intimidate their workers. They get a fair period of time to convey \nthe message, and then the workers deserve their day at the ballot box.\n\n  This is not the radical act of an out-of-control board. It won't even \naffect most employers, union or nonunion, one bit. As I pointed out \nyesterday, 90 percent of all of the petitions that are filed succeed \nwithout having NLRB input anyway. Management and workers get together \nand work things out. But it is in those 10 percent of companies that go \non this massive campaign to intimidate and frighten workers, that is \nwhat this rule is aimed at.\n  Preventing abuses of our laws that keep workers from having a union \nis a small step in the right direction to help putting the middle class \nback on track.\n  When I talk about this, a lot of people say, well, isn't it against \nthe law for management to fire workers for union activities? And I say, \nyes, it is. But what is the penalty? The penalty is basically nothing.\n  I pointed this out yesterday, and I will say it again. There was a \nyoung man in Iowa who had been organizing a union and was fired. He \nfiled a petition with the NLRB and it took him about 3 years to settle \nthe case. He found out that he had been fired because of union \nactivities and the penalty for the company was to give him all of his \nback pay minus whatever he earned in between.\n  How many people can go for 2 or 3 years and not take care of their \nfamily and pay their mortgage and pay to put food on the table without \nhaving a job? So, of course, that intervening time this person had to \nwork, all the wages were subtracted from whatever the\n\n[[Page S2619]]\n\ncompany had to pay him, and it turned out basically it was nothing. So \nthere is no penalty. As I said, all the employer has to do is pay back \nwages minus an offset of whatever the worker made in between the time \nhe was fired and the time the decision was made by the NLRB, so there \nis no penalty for the employers to do that.\n  So, again, allowing our labor laws to be abused is a policy choice. \nAs I said in the beginning, a lot of the reason for the decline of the \nmiddle class in America is because of policy choices that are made \nhere. We have tolerated these policy choices for far too long, these \nabuses. Working families have suffered as a result; union membership \nhas declined. As I pointed out, the number of workers covered by \ncollective bargaining agreements has declined, and the middle class has \ndeclined right along with it. There is much more we need to do to move \nthese trends back in the right direction.\n  I recently introduced a comprehensive bill, the Rebuild America Act, \nthat I think presents a bold agenda for restoring the American middle \nclass. That agenda--everything from investing in the infrastructure to \njob retraining, better educational benefits, better pensions, raising \nthe minimum wage--also has restoring the right to form a union to \nworkers who have been unfairly denied this basic freedom. It would \nprovide real penalties for employers who abuse and fire workers to bust \nunions and would try to restore real voice for the people who do the \nreal work in this country.\n  I hope that once we vote today and uphold the NLRB's eminently \nsensible actions, we can move on and have a real debate about some of \nthese important ideas about restoring the middle class in this country \nand building an economy that works for everyone.\n  I was listening to the comments made by my good friend from South \nCarolina, and he alluded to the recent situation with a complaint filed \nwith the NLRB by the attorney for the NLRB. A year or so ago the \ngeneral counsel's office filed a complaint with the NLRB that the \nBoeing company in Seattle had retaliated against its workers for union \nactivity, that type of thing. The fact is the NLRB--the body my \ncolleagues are attacking today--never acted on that. The company and \nthe workers settled it. Isn't that what we want? But somehow to listen \nto my friend from South Carolina, he is saying he is even opposed to \nletting the general counsel file a complaint. Well, that takes away the \nbasic right of anyone to have their grievances heard. So I hope that is \nnot what my friend from South Carolina meant. I want to point out that \nI think there was a lot of abuse of the NLRB during that process even \nthough the NLRB was doing exactly what we told them to do: Take into \naccount all of the factors, look at all the evidence before you make a \ndecision. That is what they were doing when it erupted here on the \nfloor and a lot of political pressure was put on the NLRB. There were a \nlot of threats on the NLRB. And as it turned out, it all worked out \nbecause the union and Boeing got together, settled their differences \nand we moved ahead. That is the way it ought to be in our country.\n  We should not cut off the right of people to actually file a \ncomplaint if they have a complaint. The duty of the NLRB is to \ninvestigate and to take into account all of the factors before they \nissue any findings. But that never happened in that Boeing case because \nBoeing is a good business. Boeing is one of our great businesses in \nthis country and does a lot for America. So you get the good \nbusinesses, and the Machinist Union is a great union, and they worked \nit out. That is the way things ought to be done, and 9 times out of 10 \nthat is the way it happens.\n  What we are talking about here is the rules for NLRB to take care of \nthose bad actors who are out there, and to give people who want to form \na union at least a level playing field without having all of these \nabuses and delays and intimidations and things like that.\n  That is what the issue is about, and hopefully this afternoon we will \nhave a good, affirmative vote to uphold the ability of the National \nLabor Relations Board to issue this ruling.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I wish to continue the debate a little bit on the Boeing situation \nbecause the company was creating 2,000 additional jobs--reducing none \nbut creating 2,000 additional jobs--in South Carolina at a new plant. \nThe NLRB general counsel, who was not confirmed by this body, went \nahead and decided to investigate and work on a complaint and created a \nlot of concern for 2,000 employees who didn't know whether they would \nbe able to work. The case actually wasn't settled.\n  I think the National Labor Relations Board realized they had made a \nmistake and, because of the national controversy it created, actually \nwithdrew the case even though it could have taken about 3 or 4 years \nthrough the courts to take care of it, and we covered that situation in \none of the hearings Senator Harkin asked for. I thought the company did \nan outstanding job.\n  What we are talking about today relates a little bit to that because \nthe South Carolina folks decertified in the small window they had, \nwhich says they weren't pleased with what they had been handed.\n  So some of these discussions are extremely important, and the time to \ndo those is extremely important. So today we are renewing this debate \non S.J. Res. 36, the Congressional Review Act Resolution of Disapproval \nto stop the National Labor Relations Board's ambush elections rule. \nThis rule is the second formal rulemaking the National Labor Relations \nBoard has pushed through in the last year--their third in the past 75 \nyears. There was only one before this Board decided they would take \nunusual action. As I mentioned, the first rule has been struck down \nalready by Federal courts because it went far beyond the agency's \nauthority. This ambush elections rule is also being challenged in the \ncourts, but it is set to go into effect in less than a week--on Monday, \nApril 30--and that is why the Senate must act today to stop the \nNational Labor Relations Board from stacking the odds against America's \nemployees and small businesses.\n  During yesterday's debate, both sides got to air their concerns. I \nwish to respond to some of what I heard.\n  There was much talk about the 90 percent of elections that go forward \nunder mutual agreement. The argument was that because both sides were \nable to come to an agreement and because the wide majority of elections \noccur in a timely fashion, parties should not mind losing their rights \nto raise issues prior to the election. This argument is turning the \nconcept of coming to agreement on its head. Yes, it is true that 90 \npercent of elections occur under mutual agreement and occur in 38 to 56 \ndays, but that is precisely because both sides have the ability to \nraise issues of concern, such as which employees belong in the \nbargaining unit, and have them resolved. In other words, both sides \nhave incentives to make fair requests because the other side has the \nleverage of exercising the right to contest. When all of these rights \nare taken away and an election is scheduled in as few as 10 days, the \nresult will be that less mutual agreement occurs.\n  The National Labor Relations Board has taken a process that is \nworking well and becoming swifter year after year and turning it into a \ncontentious process where the small business employer side feels \nentirely ambushed. If the National Labor Relations Board were truly \nintending to address the small minority of cases where long delays do \noccur, they should have drafted a rule that addressed only those cases.\n  Yesterday both Chairman Harkin and I quoted Presidents from each \nother's parties. I quoted John F. Kennedy's statement during labor law \ndebates in 1959 when he was a Senator here saying:\n\n       There should be at least a 30 day interval between the \n     request for an election and the holding of the election.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       The 30-day waiting period is an additional safeguard \n     against rushing employees into an election where they are \n     unfamiliar with the issues.\n\n  I agree that one of the most important reasons for a waiting period \nis for the employees to learn more about the union they may join. This \nis in fairness to the employee.\n\n[[Page S2620]]\n\n  In many cases, the election petition is the first time some employees \nhave ever heard about the union. They want to know what the union's \nreputation is for honesty, keeping their promises, treating members \nwell, and working well with the employer to make sure the business \nstays in business. Once a union is certified, it is very difficult for \nemployees to vote it out if they decide to. Employees are barred from \npetitioning for decertification for a full year after the election and \nbarred as well throughout the term of the collective bargaining \nagreement.\n  Employees should have a chance to understand that once they unionize, \nthey will no longer be able to negotiate a raise individually with \ntheir employer. Exceptional performance will not be rewarded, and \ngrievances cannot be brought straight to the employer but will instead \nhave to go through the filter of union officials.\n  Chairman Harkin quoted former President Dwight Eisenhower. I haven't \nhad a chance to look up the quote's context, but the gist of it was \nthat only a fool would oppose the right of an employee to join a union. \nMy comment on that is that a vote for this resolution does absolutely \nnothing to diminish the right of any employee to form a union. This \nresolution will not change the law one bit. If we are able to stop the \nambush elections rule, union elections will still occur in a median of \n38 days, with nearly 92 percent occurring in 56 days, just as it is \nnow. And I would even venture to guess that the unions will continue to \nwin the majority of elections. Last year they set a new record by \nwinning 71 percent of elections. That is under the old rule. So a vote \nfor this resolution may please both those former Presidents, whom we \nall admire, and forcing a fast election--an ambush election--may \nirritate employees into a negative vote.\n  Now, I know the President issued a policy on this that says that if \nit comes to his desk, he will veto it, and that is his right. I checked \nthe Constitution. The Constitution says we are an equal branch of \ngovernment with the President. We do not serve for the President, we \nserve with the President. That could be a quote from Senator Byrd, who \nused to sit at that desk and pull out his copy of the Constitution and \npoint out that the President gets to do what he wants to do, but we \nhave a responsibility to do what we need to do.\n  In this case, one of the administrative branches is overreacting--\ndoing something it should not do--and we need to say no. If it gets to \nthe President's desk and he vetoes it, that is his part of the process, \nalthough I think that when the law was written, it should have been \nthat if Congress, which passes the law and grants rulemaking authority, \ndisagrees in the Senate and the House, that ought to be the end of it. \nIt ought to be the end of a rule or regulation. It shouldn't be the \nbeginning of the process where the President can veto it, because he is \nin charge of the side that created the rule. But our job should be to \ntake a look at these things, decide if they are right or wrong, and if \nthey are wrong, to vote against them as part of the process.\n  So I think many will be joining me on this resolution of \ndisapproval--at least I hope they will. That is our job and our right.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield whatever time he may consume to my \ngood friend the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I join the distinguished leader of the \ncommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions in opposing S.J. \nRes. 36 and supporting the National Labor Relations Board rule that \nwould very simply modernize the process that workers use to decide \nwhether they want to form a union.\n  Right from the start, let's be very clear about what is at stake. It \nis a rule that the National Labor Relations Board has formulated \npursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act set by the Congress of the \nUnited States after comment that was solicited from all of the relevant \nstakeholders and people who would be affected by it, and they are rules \nthat are long overdue because of the inconsistency and delays that are \nendemic to the current process.\n  As I travel around the State of Connecticut and I hear from people \naround the country, I consistently hear about problems that exist under \nthe present process for choosing a union. This rule does not determine \nthe outcome; rather, it simply modernizes and improves the process, and \nit does it by a rulemaking process that is consistent with and pursuant \nto the Administrative Procedure Act, which is the way the Congress has \nsaid it should be done. In fact, it adopts the rulemaking procedure \nrather than doing it by individual cases, which is the way the U.S. \nSupreme Court and the courts of appeal have said to the Board it should \ndo more often. So, far from raising constitutional questions or issues \nof procedural lack of process, the NLRB has acted in accordance with \nthe will of the Congress and the Constitution in formulating this rule.\n  Why is it necessary? Well, for one thing, there are 34 regional \noffices of the National Labor Relations Board, and each of them has \ndifferent policies and practices for processing election petitions. We \nare talking about petitions that are submitted by workers who want to \nform a union and can do so by election when at least 30 percent of \nthose employees send the petition to the NLRB. The gap in time is an \nopportunity for intimidation by unscrupulous employers. Fortunately, \nthey are a small minority of employers--but they exist--who wish to \ndiscourage or deter workers from forming a union. That intimidation is \nunacceptable. We should do everything we can to stop it.\n  Second, the delays themselves are intolerable. Some of those delays \nare years--as long as 13 years in some instances--and the gap in time \ndiscourages or deters the exercise of rights that are guaranteed under \nthe law.\n  So this new rule is simply to modernize the process, end \nintimidation, and make sure that rights are made real, in real time, so \nthat employees can exercise those rights without any discouragement \nfrom employers.\n  Are the employers free to communicate with workers? Of course they \nare. The rights of communication on the part of the employers are not \neliminated by any means. Are they still part of the process? Yes, \nindeed, employers remain a part of the process if they wish to be. The \neffort here--in fact, as one of the employers who submitted comments to \nthe NLRB said quite pointedly--from Catholic Healthcare West, a health \ncare company with 31,000 employees, in its comments: ``Reforms proposed \nby the NLRB are not pro union or pro business, they are pro \nmodernization'' and will ``modernize the representation election \nprocess by improving the board's current representation election \nprocedures that result in unnecessary delays, allow unnecessary \nlitigation, and fail to take advantage of modern communication \ntechnologies.''\n  That quote from an employer really says it all.\n  Some of the litigation is not only against the interests of \nemployees, it also is costly to the employers, especially when it fails \nto succeed. It creates uncertainties for other employers, and it can \nblock representation and lead again to unnecessary delays.\n  This rule has an impact on real people in Connecticut and around the \ncountry. To give you a couple of examples, registered nurses who are at \na number of the hospitals in Connecticut have come to me about the need \nto reform this process. Members of the employee workforce at T-Mobile, \nfor example--Chris Cozza, a technician at T-Mobile USA in Connecticut, \njoined with 14 colleagues, came to me to recount his experience. He \nfiled for union representation with the support of the Communications \nWorkers of America, the CWA. He experienced problems of exactly this \nkind because his rights were delayed and thereby almost denied. When T-\nMobile USA filed a claim that officially challenged the status of the \nCWA as a labor organization, he could see--Chris Cozza and all of us \ncould see--that clearly CWA is a labor organization. This tactic was \nsimply a delaying one, and the NLRB rule would prevent the kind of \nfrivolous challenges and frivolous litigation that occurred there.\n  Let me conclude by saying, as has been said already, this rule is \nneither prounion or proemployer. It is simply profairness. It is \nantidelay,\n\n[[Page S2621]]\n\nantifrivolous litigation, and it is profairness in the workplace.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might consume.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, one of the things I have been checking on \nhere is the statement that was made earlier that one in five people get \nfired for working on organizing. That statement is based on a phone \nsurvey of union activists for their estimate if an employee is \nterminated during an organizing drive. It is not based on fact. The \nfact is, unions only filed objections in approximately 1.5 percent of \nthe elections, and that number includes objections based on many issues \nother than employee terminations.\n  Under the current law, it is illegal to terminate or discriminate in \nany way against an employee for their union activities. If this occurs \nduring an organizing campaign, the National Labor Relations Board is \nrequired to rerun the election since it created an unfair election. \nThis occurs in about 1 percent of all elections and has been decreasing \nin recent years. I would expect that to increase in succeeding years if \nthis rule passes because this is an attack on small businesses and the \nsmall businesses will not have the necessary information to know what \nis legal and illegal, especially if they only have 10 days to get their \nact together.\n  The National Labor Relations Board can go even further if they \nbelieve a fair election is not possible. They can certify the union, \nregardless of the vote, and order the employer to bargain.\n  I have information on some of the studies that have been done on \nthis, and the number does not come out nearly that high. Of course it \nis terrible if there is even one person who is fired for organizing \nactivities but there is recourse that can be done.\n  I want to raise an important privacy issue that has come up as part \nof the National Labor Relations Board's ambush elections rule. One \nsection of the initial proposed regulation concerned the private \ninformation of employees. It raised so much concern that it was dropped \nfrom the final rule. However, the National Labor Relations Board \nChairman has publicly stated that he plans to push this and other \ndropped provisions into law later this year, now that President Obama's \nso-called recess appointments have created a full board.\n  Under the current law, employers are required to provide employees' \nnames and addresses within 7 days once an election is set. The proposed \nrule would not only expand the type of personal information that an \nemployer must turn over, but would require that information to be \nturned over within 2 days of an election being set. Of course, if we \nare moving it from 38 days down to 10 days, I can see where they would \nwant it in 2 days instead of the 7 that has been normal. The expanded \ninformation that the National Labor Relations Board wants employers to \ngive to unions includes all personal home phone numbers, cell phone \nnumbers, e-mail addresses that the employer has for each employee. It \nalso would demand work location, shift information, and employment \nclassification.\n  Let's consider this for a moment. The National Labor Relations Board \nwants to give employers 48 hours to turn over information of employees \nwho are eligible to vote, despite the fact that the employee's \neligibility may not even be determined at that point because of the \nambush elections rule, the elimination of this preelection hearing so \nthose sorts of things can be worked out as to who is exactly going to \nbe covered. In essence, an employer will be forced to turn over \npersonal information of employees who may not even be in the bargaining \nunit. The rule even would have required that the employer alphabetize \nthe lists.\n  The threat of this new invasion of privacy is very alarming to most \npeople. The purpose of the information is so the union organizers can \ncome to your home, call you, e-mail you, find you outside your work \nlocation and catch you before and after shifts. There is no prohibition \non how many times the organizers can contact you or at what times. \nThere is no ``opt out'' for those employees who simply do not want to \nbe contacted. And there are no protections in place to ensure that the \ninformation does not go astray.\n  While a large part of this debate circles around the shortened \nelection time and what that means for employers, with good reason, I do \nnot want us to forget what this new rule could mean to the privacy of \nemployees. Supporters of expanding the information provided to the \nunions claim the National Labor Relations Board is merely modernizing \nthis standard. In this time of Internet scams, identity theft, online \nsecurity breaches, and cyber bullying, protecting personal information \nis not something to be taken lightly. Union elections can be a very \nintense and emotional experience for employees and employers alike. The \nlast thing we want is for an individual's personal information, such as \nan e-mail address, to be used as a harassment or bullying tool by an \nangered party.\n  I want my colleagues to know what is at stake in this debate. A \nsuccessful Congressional Review Act petition also prohibits an agency \nfrom proposing any ``substantially similar'' regulation unless \nauthorized by Congress. Therefore, by supporting my joint resolution, \nwe could put a stop to the Board's future attempt to force employers to \nhand over more personal employee information.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support this resolution of disapproval. \nThis is one of the most important votes we will have on labor issues \nthis Congress. We need to let the National Labor Relations Board know \nthat their duty as a Federal agency is to be the referee and decide \nwhat is fair for the parties involved based on the clear facts of the \ncase. Their job is not to tip the scale in favor of one party or \nanother. Tipping the scale is exactly what the National Labor Relations \nBoard is doing with the ambush elections rule. Congress needs to step \nup and say ``no'' to the overbearing and burdensome nature of these \nregulations coming out of so-called independent agencies. You can do \nthat by voting for my joint resolution, S.J. Res. 36.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, a couple things.\n  I keep hearing it stated that: ambush elections. I want to point out, \nthere is no timetable set in these rules--none whatsoever. I keep \nhearing: 10 days and 7 days and all that. That is not set. There are no \ntimetables at all. As I pointed out, 90 percent of NLRB elections are \nconducted under voluntary agreements between the parties, and those \nprocedures are unchanged.\n  The current median time right now between when a petition is filed \nand when an election occurs is 37 to 38 days. Jackson Lewis, the \nNation's biggest management-side law firm, said that--their attorney \nMichael Lotito told the Wall Street Journal he thinks the time under \nthese rules would be shaved to between 19 and 23 days. Joe Trauger, \nvice president of the National Association of Manufacturers, says the \nelections would be held in 20 to 25 days under the new rules--hardly an \nambush election.\n  The other issue I want to briefly mention has to do with the \ncontacts--contacting and the right of privacy I heard here. Right now, \nthe only way a union can contact people is at their homes--at their \nhomes. The only information the union is allowed to get after the \npetition is filed is the addresses of the workers, their home \naddresses. What the Board is considering--but has not implemented--is \nallowing unions to have access to e-mail addresses and/or phone \nnumbers. Well, it seems to me that is a lot less intrusive than going \nto someone's home.\n  Now, again, it is much harder, obviously, for a union organizer to go \nto a home. People go to their homes. They are with their families. They \nhave their children. They are busy. That is more intrusive than e-\nmailing them, it seems to me. So I would hope we would look upon the \npossibility that they might say that having their e-mail addresses and \nphone numbers is less intrusive than going to their homes.\n  But that is not part of these rules whatsoever. They would still have \nto contact them at their home, and the only information the employer \nwould have to give would be their home addresses.\n\n[[Page S2622]]\n\n  Again, keeping in mind what these rules are--they are very modest \nrules. I keep hearing that: Well, there have only been three rules \nsince the Board was comprised in 1938. Quite frankly, the Supreme Court \nand appeals courts have said, time and time again, they should do \nrulemaking because it is open, it is transparent, parties get to be \nheard. So I think this Board is being more open and more transparent \nthan any Board before it.\n  This is not anything overwhelming, but it is a step in the right \ndirection to make sure we level the playing field and we do not have \nthese undue delays where the management can intimidate--intimidate--and \nI gave some examples of it, and I have a whole ream of examples of \nwhere management has delayed and delayed and delayed in order to \nintimidate workers so they would eventually vote not to form a union.\n  Again, an employer has the right to communicate to their employees \nall day long--in captive audiences, one-on-one meetings with \nsupervisors. The union can only contact the worker at that worker's \nhouse, in the evening or on a weekend. So already the employer has much \nmore opportunity to converse with and to get its views known to its \nworkers than the union has--much more, all day long, at the job, on the \njob, through supervisors, one-on-one contacts, group meetings, over the \nloudspeaker, whatever it might be. So already there is much more \nability for the management to weigh in on this than it is for the \nunion.\n  The one thing we are trying to do with these rules is to say: Fine, \nyou can continue to do that. There will still be that disparity between \nthe ability of management to communicate to the workers and the union \nto communicate, but what these rules are saying is, fine, you can do \nthat, but you cannot continue to do it month after month after month \nand wear the workers down and intimidate them, make them afraid of \nlosing their jobs. And if you fire one person for union organizing, \nthat sends a chill across everybody else. You say: Well, but that is \nillegal. Well, it may be illegal, but as I have pointed out, time and \ntime again, there are no penalties for that. It may be illegal, but \nthere are not much penalties for that. Management can always find some \nexcuse--that they may have fired someone for something other than union \nactivity, but everyone would know that person was fired because that \nperson was trying to organize a union.\n  We are saying you cannot just continue to drag these things out month \nafter month after month. The proposed rules simply say we will have \nelections, and if there are challenges, if there are challenges by the \nmanagement as to who can vote in that election, then those challenges \nwould be held until after the election and then see whether those \nindividuals so challenged were really part of that unit and could vote \nor whether they could not and whether that would even make a \ndifference.\n  Again, if there were 100, let's say, who signed a petition to form a \nunion, and that was 50 percent of the workers out of 200, and the \nemployer was challenging 5 of those, well, as it is now they could \nchallenge those 5, have a hearing, appeal the hearing, appeal that, and \njust keep appealing it.\n  Well, the rules would say, OK, they can say those 5 are not part of \nit, their ballots would be set aside, and they would have the election. \nIf the election was, let's say, 150 to 20 that they wanted to form a \nunion, those 5 would not make a difference one way or the other. If, \nhowever, the election was very close and those 5 would make a \ndifference, then the results would be held in abeyance until such time \nas it is determined whether those 5 so challenged were part of that \nbargaining unit or not.\n  To me, this is a much more fair and decisive way of moving ahead \nrather than these constant delays and intimidations that go on right \nnow in some of the places--not all, not all, but in some of the places. \nIt is like a lot of times we pass laws not because there are, let's \nsay, broad-based incursions on a person's freedoms or certain things we \nwant to address, but a lot of times we pass laws because there are a \nfew bad actors out there one way or the other and we want to make sure \nthose bad actors are not able to act unreasonably, kind of in violation \nof what was intended by the National Labor Relations Act.\n  So that is what they are all about. They are very modest and, I \nthink, lend themselves to a much more reasonable path forward in union \norganizing and voting.\n  I ask unanimous consent if there is a quorum call that both sides be \ncharged equally on the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I do want to talk about this open and fair, \ntransparent process that was just referred to. Much has been said about \nthe flawed policy behind ambush elections we are discussing on the \nSenate floor. But I want to spend a few minutes discussing the \nrulemaking process that was followed or not followed for that matter by \nthe National Labor Relations Board.\n  While the other side portrays the changes as moderate, make no \nmistake about it, this new rule greatly alters the election system, \nespecially should Chairman Pearce be able to finalize the more \ncontroversial provisions that were previously proposed. This entire \nrule took under 1 year to complete. The National Labor Relations Board \nintroduced the proposed rule on June 22, 2011, and published the final \nrule only 6 months later on December 22, 2011.\n  Considering the scope of the rule and how much attention it garnered \nfrom stakeholders, it is absurd to think that a Federal agency could \npromulgate a rule that would have such a major effect on all employers, \nin only 6 months. As evidence of how critical this rule's impact will \nbe on stakeholders, the Board received 65,957 comments. Let me repeat \nthat. The Board received 65,957 comments during the 60-day comment \nperiod. That is an astounding number.\n  To compare, the Board's previous rulemaking on its notice posting \nrequirements garnered a little more than 6,000 comments. On November \n30, 2011, the Board voted to move toward finalizing a new amended \nproposed rule. The reason for this new amended rule was clear: The \nBoard was going to lose its quorum at the end of the congressional \nsession in late December 2011.\n  What continues to astonish me is that the Chairman claimed his staff \nread each of the 65,957 comments, twice, in such a short period of \ntime. In rushing to finalize the ambush elections rule, the Board \ndiscarded several well-established internal procedural precedents as \nwell. For example, until the ambush election rule, the Board did not \nadvance a major policy change without three affirmative votes. This was \na major policy change.\n  They never did it without three affirmative votes, whether through \nrulemaking or a case decision. This was not the case in the ambush \nelections rule where only two members voted in favor of finalizing the \nrule. Further, the Board rejected the tradition of providing any \ndissenting member at least 90 days to produce an opinion. Instead, \nChairman Pearce offered to publish a dissent after the final rule was \npublished. The process the Board used to promulgate the ambush \nelections rule was rushed through for no good reason. Yet in the \nprocess it decided to discard years of Board precedent.\n  I should also mention one of these people, one of the two who voted \nfor it, not three--one of the two who voted for the rule, and there \nwere two who voted for it--was a recess appointment because they knew \nthis body would not stand for that person with the radical views he \nheld, actually claiming before his appointment that he would cause this \nsort of a thing to happen; that he would even be able to institute, \nthrough Board procedures, card check.\n  Now, that is a pretty radical statement, and that alone was keeping \nhim opposed by both sides of the aisle. There were people on both sides \nof the aisle who opposed card check.\n  So two people voted for it; one person voted against it. That person \nwas not allowed the right to put in a dissent opinion. That is wrong. \nThat is not open and transparent.\n  Now I would like to talk a little bit about the targeting of small \nbusiness\n\n[[Page S2623]]\n\nthis regulation does as well. All of our States have a lot of small \nbusiness. Small business is the backbone of job creation in this \ncountry. We need to make sure that process can still follow. Once a \npetition for representation is submitted, the current median timeframe \nfor a union election to be held is 38 days. That is the median time. \nThe ambush election rule would shorten that timeframe to as few as 10 \ndays.\n  For small business owners, with the range of company responsibilities \nand limited resources, this puts them at a severe disadvantage. Most \nsmall business owners are not familiar with complex labor laws they \nhave to adhere to during the representation election process. For \nexample, they may not be aware that certain statements and actions \ncould result in the National Labor Relations Board imposing a \nbargaining obligation without a secret ballot election. They can \ndeclare the election over. Furthermore, most small businesses do not \nhave the resources to employ in-house counsel or human resource \nprofessionals familiar with these laws.\n\n  So holding an ambush election in as few as 10 days does not provide \nsmall business owners with enough time to retain a competent labor \nattorney, consult with them, and then adequately prepare for an \nelection. I have given the reasons before why it is unfair to the \nemployees. But it is also very unfair to a small business owner because \ntheir day-to-day responsibilities range from sustaining a competitive \nproduct, to managing personnel, to balancing the books at the end of \nthe day. I know. I have been there. I had a shoe store. They have to do \nall of those things.\n  The definition by the Federal Government for a small business is 500 \nor less employees. In Wyoming that would be a big business. My \ndefinition of a small business is where the owner of the business has \nto sweep the sidewalks, clean the toilets, do the accounting, and wait \non customers--and definitely not in that order. So those day-to-day \nresponsibilities to keep the business competitive take a lot of time, \nand given such a demanding schedule, it takes time for a small business \nowner to fully understand the pros and cons of unionization. It takes \neven longer for a small business owner to communicate these points to \ntheir employees.\n  Ambush elections make it logistically impossible for small business \nowners to fully discuss the effects of unionization with their \nemployees, partly because they will not even know what those effects \nare, and neither will their employees.\n  A union organizing campaign does not begin on the day an employer \nreceives a petition for representation. It typically starts months or \neven years before, when professional union organizers start conveying \ntheir side of the story to targeted small business employees. They work \non it for months. By unjustly curtailing an employer's ability to \nconvey their point of view, ambush elections deny employees the \nopportunity to hear both sides of the argument on unionization.\n  The small business employer is also at a disadvantage because the \nunion organizer will be in a position to set up the election to his \nbest advantage, essentially cherry-picking union supporters before the \nelection process begins. The organizers will have had limitless amounts \nof time to analyze which employees could be argued to belong in the \nbargaining unit, which may qualify as supervisors, and who is most \nlikely to support a union.\n  With ambush elections, the National Labor Relations Board will impose \nthe election before the employer has an opportunity to even question \nthose assumptions, especially since we have significantly restricted \nthe one tool--the preelection hearing--that the small businessman would \nhave to question who is in and who is out.\n  According to a recent Bloomberg study, unions win 87 percent of \nsecret ballot elections held 11 to 15 days, compared to a 58-percent \nrate when elections are held 36 to 40 days. By shortening the election \ntimeframe, labor unions will undoubtedly win more representation \nelections--perhaps. The perhaps is that they may really irritate the \nemployees and win less of them. The way that it is held in 11 to 15 \ndays is when the employer and the employees agree on all of the issues \nand get the election to move forward. So it can happen in a short \nperiod of time right now. Otherwise, the median time would not be 38 \ndays.\n  But I think this rule will alienate those people who have been \ngetting together and arriving at these agreements. So for small \nbusiness owners, the surge of union bargaining obligations means a less \nflexible workforce, increased labor costs, and fewer opportunities for \njob creation. And they are the job creators.\n  The National Labor Relations Board is only creating more uncertainty \nfor small business at a time when the country needs them to focus on \ncreating jobs. Small businesses account for over half of the jobs in \nthe private sector and produce roughly one-half of the privately \ngenerated GDP in the country. In 2010, small businesses outpaced gross \njob gains of large businesses by 3 to 1.\n  As the National Labor Relations Board has publicly indicated, ambush \nelections are only the beginning of a round of regulations aimed at \nmaking it easier for unions to win representation elections in American \nworkplaces. Proposed regulations, such as requiring small businesses to \ncompile a list of employee phone numbers and e-mails and then handing \nthem over to union organizers before an election are time consuming. \nThey are costly. They are extremely invasive. Furthermore, they are \nindicative of how this administration is more concerned about boosting \nlabor union membership than creating jobs.\n  We have to create jobs. We cannot continue to pick on the small \nbusinessman and put him at a disadvantage. This is a rule that is \nlooking for a place to act. It is not one that was needed or requested \nother than by labor organizers. I think it will have repercussions. So \nI would ask everyone to vote for the resolution of disapproval so this \ndoes not go into effect, although we have been promised, of course, a \nPresidential veto if it makes it to his desk.\n  But that is Congress. We have the right to say we do not think the \nrule is right. The President has the right to say his administration is \nright and veto the law. But we have to make that statement, and we have \nto make it on behalf of small businesses and employees.\n  A lot of this has to do with employee fairness and giving them the \ntime to figure out what the union will do with them and for them and to \nthem.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Alabama for morning business, \nas I understand it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n\n\n                             Postal Reform\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his \nthoughtful remarks on this important subject. I hope our colleagues are \nlistening.\n  Later today, I will offer a budget point of order on the postal bill. \nIt adds $34 billion to the debt. It violates the agreement we reached \nlast August, in which we said there would be limits to how much debt we \nwould increase and how much spending we would increase.\n  The first big bill coming down the pike adds $34 billion. Every penny \nof the new spending is added to the debt. There is no offset to it. \nThose of us who supported the concept of a limitation on spending--and \nI didn't think it limited it enough last summer, but many thought it \ndid, but agreed to that limit--have to know this. When I raise that \nbudget point of order, somebody will probably rise and ask for a vote \nto waive the budget, waive the limitations on spending and debt that we \njust passed last August.\n  We need not kill reform of the Postal Service. We need to send this \nbill back to the committee and let them produce legislation that either \nspends not so much or doesn't spend money or, if they do spend money, \npay for it through cuts in spending that are perfectly available.\n  GAO has said there is over $400 billion spent each year in \nduplicative and wasteful programs. We have GSA off in Las Vegas in hot \ntubs on taxpayers' money. We could pay for this bill if it is so \nimportant that we have to do it; if we don't, that is what the vote \nwould be.\n  I urge my colleagues to understand the importance of it. Our Members \nwho believed it was important to have a\n\n[[Page S2624]]\n\nlimit on spending in order to gain a debt increase last summer, \nincrease the debt ceiling, should vote against the motion to waive \nbecause to do so--to vote for waiving the budget would undermine, in \nthe first real opportunity, the agreement we reached.\n  I thank the Chair and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record three additional letters of support from the Motor and \nEquipment Manufacturers Association and National Council of Textile \nOrganizers and the Building Owners and Managers Association \nInternational.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association (MEMA) \n     represents over 700 companies that manufacture motor vehicle \n     parts for use in the light vehicle and heavy-duty original \n     equipment and aftermarket industries. Motor vehicle parts \n     suppliers are the nation's largest manufacturing sector, \n     directly employing over 685,000 U.S. workers and contributing \n     to over 3.2 million jobs across the country.\n       MEMA urges your boss to support S.J. Res. 36 and help \n     overturn the ``ambush election'' rule, which is part of the \n     NLRB's aggressive and unchecked regulatory agenda. Parts \n     manufacturers are very concerned by recent unnecessary and \n     unwarranted actions by the NLRB that threaten employer-\n     employee relations as well as job growth and productivity. \n     MEMA members strongly oppose the NLRB's ambush election rule \n     which would shorten the time frame during which union \n     elections may be held, limiting an employer's ability to \n     prepare for an election and an employee's opportunity to make \n     an informed decision about joining a union.\n       Please contact Ann McCulloch at amcculloch@mema.org or 202 \n     312 9241 with any questions. Thank you for your \n     consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n     Ann Wilson,\n       Senior Vice President, Government Affairs, Motor & \n     Equipment Manufacturers Association.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      Building Owners and Managers\n\n\n                                    Association International,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 24, 2012.\n     Hon. Mike Enzi,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ranking Member Enzi: The Building Owners and Managers \n     Association (BOMA) International urges you to support S.J. \n     Res. 36, which will prevent the National Labor Relations \n     Board (NLRB) from moving forward with its ``ambush'' election \n     rule. The rule is an attempt by the NLRB to enact the \n     Employee Free Choice Act through regulation. The NLRB's \n     actions are detrimental to workers, businesses and our \n     economy and must be stopped.\n       Under the rule, building owners and managers and the \n     companies they do business with could face an election held \n     to determine whether or not the employees want union \n     representation in as few as 14 days after the union files a \n     petition. This would leave little or no opportunity to talk \n     to employees about union representation or respond to any \n     promises by union organizers--no matter how unrealistic. \n     Union organizers lobby employees for months outside the \n     workplace without an employer's knowledge, so these \n     ``ambush'' elections would result in employees receiving only \n     half the story. In an effort to rush the election, the rule \n     also robs employers of free speech and due process rights. In \n     fact, under the rule, the NLRB could even conduct elections \n     before it settles which employees would be in the union. How \n     is a worker supposed to make an informed choice about unions \n     in these circumstances?\n       The median time from petition to election without this rule \n     is a far more reasonable 31 days. The legislative record \n     shows Congress intended an election period of at least 30 \n     days in order to ``safeguard against rushing employees into \n     an election where they are unfamiliar with the issues.''\n       The Building Owners and Managers Association (BOMA) \n     International is an international federation of more than 100 \n     local associations and affiliated organizations. Founded in \n     1907, its 16,500-plus members own or manage more than nine \n     billion square feet of commercial properties. BOMA \n     International's mission is to enhance the human, intellectual \n     and physical assets of the commercial real estate industry \n     through advocacy, education, research, standards and \n     information. On the Web at www.boma.org.\n       Again, on behalf of building owners and managers across the \n     country, I urge you to support S.J. Res. 36 and help rein in \n     this out-of-control agency.\n           Regards,\n                                                Karen W. Penafiel,\n     Vice President, Advocacy.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  National Council\n\n\n                                     of Textile Organizations,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 24, 2012.\n       Dear Senator: I am writing on behalf of the U.S. textile \n     industry and the nearly 400,000 workers the industry employs. \n     I am the president of the National Council of Textile \n     Organizations and I urge you to support S.J. Res. 36 when it \n     comes to a vote today. S.J. Res. 36 provides for \n     congressional disapproval and nullification of the National \n     Labor Relations Board's (NLRB or Board) rule related to \n     representation election procedures. This ``ambush'' election \n     rule is nothing more than the Board's attempt to enact the \n     Employee Free Choice Act through the regulatory process and \n     to deny employees and workers access to critical information \n     about unions. In addition, the ``ambush'' election rule \n     strips employers of their rights to free speech and due \n     process. The rule poses a threat to employers and workers \n     alike and needlessly interrupts an employer's day to day \n     business operation.\n       The National Council of Textile Organizations (NCTO) is a \n     unique association representing the entire spectrum of the \n     textile industry. From fibers to finished products, machinery \n     manufacturers to power suppliers, NCTO is the voice of the \n     U.S. textile industry. There are four separate councils that \n     comprise the NCTO leadership structure, and each council \n     represents a segment of the textile industry and elects its \n     own officers who make up NCTO's Board of Directors.\n       NLRB statistics note that the average time from petition to \n     election is 31 days, noting that over 90 percent of elections \n     take place within 56 days. NCTO strongly believes that the \n     current election time frames are reasonable, and permit \n     workers time to hear from the union and the employer. The \n     ability to take into account the perspectives of management \n     and the unions allows workers to make informed decisions, \n     which would not be possible under the new ambush election \n     rule if allowed to go into effect. NCTO is particularly \n     concerned about how our small and medium manufacturers would \n     be affected by the rule's time frames; employers will not \n     have the appropriate time to retain legal counsel, or to \n     speak with workers about union representation. The reality is \n     that union organizers are persuading workers for months \n     outside the workplace without an employer's knowledge; these \n     ``ambush'' elections would often result in workers'' hearing \n     only one perspective on union membership. Workers would be \n     made unrealistic promises that can't be kept and be offered \n     guarantees of benefits that unions have no way of attaining. \n     If the employer does not have an opportunity to explain their \n     position and any possible inaccuracies that could be levied \n     by the union, how can a worker make an informed and objective \n     decision regarding representation?\n       For these reasons, NCTO urges you to vote yes on S.J. Res. \n     36 when the Senate votes today. If left unchecked, the \n     actions of the NLRB will fuel economic uncertainty and have \n     serious negative ramifications for millions of employers, \n     U.S. workers, and consumers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Cass Johnson,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Also, there will be key vote alerts from the Associated \nBuilders and Contractors, Associated General Contractors, Brick \nIndustry Association, Competitive Enterprise Institute, Heritage Action \nfor America, International Franchise Association, International \nWarehouse Logistics Association, National Grocers Association, National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, National Federation of Independent \nBusiness, National Restaurant Association, National Roofing Contractors \nAssociation, National Taxpayers Union, the Retail Industry Leaders \nAssociation, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from \nGeorgia, Mr. Isakson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I haven't been able to hear all the \nspeeches, but I commend Senator Enzi on his detailed and eloquent \nexplanation on how we arrived where we are today.\n  I wish to add a history lesson of my own to tell you my journey in \nterms of where we are. As a student in college in the 1960s, in \nbusiness management, I learned a lot about the Industrial Revolution, \nthe labor revolution, the development of labor unions and labor/\nmanagement practices as they developed from the 1920s until the 1960s \nand now up until today.\n  It is absolutely correct that the playing field was unlevel in the \n1920s and\n\n[[Page S2625]]\n\n1930s. It is absolutely true that we had poor working conditions, \nsafety risks were high, and wage-an-hour issues were debated. There was \na place and an appropriate nature for us to level the playing field so \nmanagement and labor could go together, head-to-head, and negotiate and \narbitrate and have binding agreements upon themselves to protect the \nsafety of workers and also improve the environment of the workers in \nthe United States.\n  For 75 years those laws served us well. All of a sudden, it seems \nthere is a perfect storm. From every corner, the NLRB seems to be \nmaking proposals to try to tilt the playing field away from fairness \nand equity and it is not right.\n  Last year, 70 percent of the elections for unionization in the United \nStates of America were successful. There is not a problem in terms of \npeople being able to organize and negotiate collectively. The problem \nis that the regulatory bodies are attempting to circumvent the \nlegislative branch of government and to rule and regulate what they \ncannot pass on the floor of the Senate.\n  When Mr. Becker was appointed to the NLRB last year by the President, \nover the objection of the Senate and during the recess--it was an \nexample of where the President used a recess appointment to go around \nthe lack of approval, and advice and consent of the Senate.\n  This particular legislation we are talking about is similar to the \nspecialty health care decision. The specialty health care decision \nallowed unions to create micro unions within the same working body, \nwhere there could be a plethora of unions in one store, all to fracture \nand fragment the ability of a business to cross-train and compete \neffectively. It is an attack on the free enterprise system and \ncircumvents what our Founding Fathers intended us to do.\n  We have a legislative branch with the House and Senate; an executive \nbranch with the President, the Vice President, the Cabinet and his \nappointees; and we have a court system. The President makes initiatives \nthat go through the legislature. The legislative body takes initiatives \nand passes laws. Ultimately, the courts are the arbiters if either one \nor both ever challenges the ruling of one or the executive order of \nanother. That is the way it should be. But right now we have a two-\nlegged stool in America. Instead of legislative, executive, and \njudicial branches, we have a judicial and executive branch trying to \nrun the country. We all know what happens to a two-legged stool. It \nfalls over.\n  I talked with some businesspeople this morning who talked about the \nuncertainty of doing business in America. It didn't all have to do with \nambush elections or specialty health care movements or special posters \nto promote unionization in the workplace, but they were part of it. The \nregulations that come from the administration through the Department of \nLabor, the National Labor Relations Board, the National Mediation \nBoard, and a plethora of other organizations, are making it difficult \nfor America to do business in a time where it is essential that we do \nbusiness.\n  When the stimulus passed 18 to 24 months ago--maybe 30 now--it was \ndesigned to bring unemployment down to 6 percent. Unemployment remains \nabove 8 percent, and one of the reasons it does is that the deployment \nof capital by businesses is not taking place because of the uncertainty \nof the workplace and what lies ahead, whether it is health care, \nwhether it is ambush elections, card check, or whatever it might be.\n  So I come to the floor to commend the Senator from Wyoming for taking \nan initiative that is available to the Senate to bring a resolution of \ndisapproval forward for a resolution of an executive branch body that \ncircumvents the legislature itself. I hope he is successful in sending \nthe message that it is time for us to take American politics and \nAmerican justice and American legislation back to what our Founding \nFathers intended.\n  Let's stop trying to take a playing field--one that has been level \nfor 75 years, where we have had the greatest labor-management relations \nin the history of any country in the world--and tear it up or put us \ninto a situation where we are adversaries, as we were 75 years ago. \nLet's stop the ambush election. Let's stop the arbitrary posting. Let's \nstop the specialized unionization. Let's stop all of this and return to \nthe laws that have worked for three-quarters of a century. Three-\nquarters of a century is a great test of time. There is no reason now, \nthrough appointments to a regulatory body, to change the history of the \nSenate and the history of the court system.\n  I will end by quoting a President of the United States--a Democratic \nPresident of the United States--who, on April 21, 1959, was U.S. \nSenator John Fitzgerald Kennedy. In his campaign for the Presidency, he \ndeclared that elections should have at least 30 days between their call \nand the vote so employees can be fully informed on their choices from \nboth sides of the issue. If it was right for John F. Kennedy on April \n21, 1959, it is right for the Senate today, on April 24, 2012.\n  I commend the Senator from Wyoming on his presentation, his \nintensity, and his ability to bring this issue before the American \npeople and to the floor of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 20 minutes, and the \nSenator from Wyoming has 12 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, there are just a couple of things I wish \nto bring up in response to some of the statements that have been made \non the floor.\n  First of all, I wish to make it very clear that the NLRB has \nscrupulously followed all legal and procedural requirements for \nrulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act, and by increasing \nthe use of rulemaking, it has been the most inclusive and transparent \nBoard in history--in history. This process has given all sides abundant \nopportunity to provide input to the NLRB. There was opportunity for \nwritten comments, written responses to other comments, and even a \npublic hearing.\n  I would like to point out again that there is no requirement in the \nAdministrative Procedure Act to facilitate a dissent. Even though there \nisn't, the NLRB's traditional practice has given Member Hayes an \nopportunity to dissent. He was given that chance. But these practices \ndo not allow him to filibuster or run out the clock to thwart the \nactions of his colleagues.\n  The Board filed a notice of proposed rulemaking on June 22, 2011, \nprovided 60 days for filing public comments, and received over 65,000 \ncomments, of which, I might note, all but around 200 were form letters. \nThere were 65,000 comments, and all but around 200 were form letters. \nBut still there were 200 comments, ensuring a wide range of views and \nstakeholder input. The Board arranged an opportunity for staff from \nMember Hayes's office to brief congressional staff on his dissent from \nthe notice of proposed rulemaking, and, although not required to do so, \nthe Board also provided an opportunity for oral public comments at a \nhearing conducted on July 18 and 19, 2011, in which over 60 labor and \nmanagement lawyers, public interest groups, employer and labor \norganizations, workers, and other related constituents participated. \nThe Board provided an additional 14 days following the 60-day comment \nperiod in which to file written reply comments. Again, this is not \nrequired by the APA--the Administrative Procedure Act--or any other \nlaw. Then the NLRB held a public vote on a final rule on November 30 \nand published the final rule in late December. So quite frankly, under \nthe Administrative Procedure Act, which all other agencies follow, the \nNLRB bent over backward to be transparent and to allow dissent.\n  I have heard it said that Member Hayes was not allowed enough time. \nWell, he had his first dissent. But from June 22 until November, Mr. \nHayes had all that time to file a dissent if he wanted to--to write a \ndissent. I mean, is that not enough time to write a dissent? It seems \nto me that is more than enough time. But that was not done. So I just \nwant to make it clear that I think Mr. Hayes was given more than enough \ntime to write his dissent if he wanted to. He did write one dissent \nover the proposed rules, but he had the additional opportunity from \nJune 22 until November. Again, the APA, under rulemaking, doesn't \nentitle him to dissent, but the Board allowed him to\n\n[[Page S2626]]\n\nhave a dissent if he wanted to. They had access to public comments on \nthe proposed rules. They were given summaries and copies of specific \ncomments the other members found informative. His office had months to \nincorporate those comments and write a second dissent but chose not to. \nThat was his own choice. That was his own choice. He was not prevented \nfrom doing so. That was his own choice.\n  There are a lot of little items like that which I think are kind of \nbeing misinterpreted, but here is the essence of it, right here. Here \nis the essence of what this is all about. Stripped of all the falderal \nand all of this and all of that and which Board member was for card \ncheck and who wasn't and on and on and on, this is what it is about, \nright here, this statement. This is Martin Jay Levitt, who was an anti-\nunion consultant who wrote a book called ``Confessions of a Union \nBuster,'' published in 1993. ``Confessions of a Union Buster.'' Here is \nwhat he said:\n\n       Challenge everything . . . then take every challenge to a \n     full hearing . . . then prolong each hearing . . . appeal \n     every unfavorable decision . . . if you make the union fight \n     drag on long enough, workers lose faith, lose interest, lose \n     hope.\n\n  That is what it is about. It is about denying people their right \nunder the National Labor Relations Act to fairly and expeditiously have \na vote on whether to form a union. This is not new. This has been going \non since the 1940s and 1950s, since Taft-Hartley. There have been \nforces at work in this country since the adoption of the National Labor \nRelations Act in 1935 to break unions. They do not want to give workers \na right to have a voice in collective bargaining. They will go to \nextreme limits to deny union members their rights. They will do \neverything they can to try to break up unions. Taft-Hartley was the \nfirst of that, and we have had several things since that time.\n  Our job is to try to make it a level playing field--as level as \npossible, anyway--and to give workers a right that is not just a right \nin name only or in words but a real, factual right to form a union and \nhave the election without challenging everything, taking every \nchallenge to a full hearing, prolonging each hearing, appealing every \nunfavorable decision. As I quoted earlier, if you make the union fight \ndrag on long enough, workers lose faith, lose interest, and lose hope. \nAnd I might add, if you drag it on long enough, it gives the employer \nevery opportunity to intimidate workers so they won't join a union or \nmaybe fire people who were active in the union organization drive--to \nfind some reason why they should be fired, anyway. That is what this is \nabout.\n\n  What the NLRB has finally done, through an open process, through a \nrulemaking process, through perhaps one of the most open and \ntransparent processes in the history of the NLRB, is to say: Let's have \na system whereby certification votes can be held within a reasonable \namount of time. There was no time limit put in there. There is no 7 or \n10 days. That is what Mr. Hayes said in his dissent. He just plucked \nthat out of thin air. But that is not in the ruling. That is not in the \nruling at all. Most people who have looked at it have said: Well, it \nmay shorten it to 20 to 30 days, somewhere in there. It seems to me \nthat is fair enough. That is fair enough.\n  But that is really what this is all about, and I hope Senators, when \nthey vote, will recognize that what the Board has done is to take the \nunfair process we have had for so long and made it more fair for \neveryone.\n  I will point out one last time that the procedures the NLRB has come \nup with, which are under fire right now from the other side, apply to \ncertification votes as well as to decertification votes. If a company \nwants to decertify a union, then the union can't drag that out days and \nmonths at a time. They can't drag that out for decertification either. \nSo it seems to me that on both sides--certification and \ndecertification--we have a level playing field, and neither side can \ndrag it out interminably to try to frustrate the real desires and \nwishes of the workers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from South \nDakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I wish to commend the Senator from Wyoming \nfor his great work on the subject.\n  As Americans know firsthand, we continue to struggle with an economy \nthat is not performing well or meeting the needs of workers. The \nunemployment rate remains at about 8 percent, as has been the case for \nthe last 28 months. Much of this can be attributed to a lack of \ncertainty on the part of employers.\n  One need look no further than the regulatory policies being pushed by \nthis administration to understand why job creators are not creating \njobs. Back on December 22 of 2011, the technically independent National \nLabor Relations Board published the final rule on representation-case \nprocedures, better known as the ``ambush elections'' rule. This new \nrule could allow a union to organize an election in as little as 10 \ndays. This new rule is the most drastic and sweeping modification to \nthe union election process in more than 60 years.\n  According to the National Labor Relations Board, the median time in \nwhich an election is held is 38 days, and 92 percent of all elections \noccur within 56 days. In fiscal year 2011 the NLRB reports that 71.4 \npercent of unions won their elections, which is up 3\\1/2\\ percent from \nfiscal year 2010. It is hard for one to claim that union elections are \nbeing held up unnecessarily with these sorts of track records.\n  The changes put forth by the NLRB will radically change the process \nof union organizations and will limit an employer's ability to respond \nto union claims before an election, thereby stifling debate and \nambushing an employer and employees. Employers use the time after an \nelection petition has been received to ensure compliance with the \nNational Labor Relations Act, to consult with human resource \nprofessionals, and to inform--to inform--their employees about the \nbenefits and shortcomings of unionizing. It is nearly impossible for a \nsmall business owner to navigate the regulations of the National Labor \nRelations Act without the assistance of outside counsel, which will be \nhard to find in 10 days or less.\n  On April 21, 1959, then-Senator John F. Kennedy stated, and I quote:\n\n       The 30-day waiting period is an additional safeguard \n     against rushing employees into an election where they are \n     unfamiliar with the issues.\n\n  It appears that rushing elections is exactly what the NLRB and big \nlabor are hoping for. After all, unions win 87 percent of elections \nheld 11 to 15 days after an election request is made. The rate falls to \n58 percent when the vote take place after 36 to 40 days.\n  On a decision as important as whether to form a union, workers should \nhave the opportunity to hear from both sides, free from any pressure \none way or the other, an opportunity that the NLRB's recent decision \nwould take away.\n  In addition to ambushing employers with union elections, the NLRB has \nnow decided to recognize micro-unions. The NLRB ruled that so long as a \nunion's petitioned-for unit consists of an identifiable group of \nemployees, the NLRB will presume it is appropriate.\n  What does this mean for America's small businesses? This means that \nat your local grocery store there could be a cashiers union, a produce \nunion, a bakers union, the list goes on and on. Micro-unions, coupled \nwith ambush elections, can cause one small business to deal with \nseveral bargaining units in the workplace and little time to no time to \nraise concerns against such actions.\n  The Supreme Court has expressly stated:\n\n       An employer's free speech rights to communicate his views \n     to his employees is firmly established and cannot be \n     infringed by a union or the NLRB.\n\n  The recent actions of the NLRB have all but silenced any freedom of \nspeech once enjoyed by employers. For the State of South Dakota, \nincreased unionization will mean higher costs for the health care \nindustry, driving up health costs for hospitals and consumers. It will \nalso mean higher costs for hotels, tourism, small businesses, and other \nservice industries. The Federal Government should not be acting to slow \nor hinder job growth in our current economy but should instead be \nlooking for ways to foster job growth.\n\n[[Page S2627]]\n\n  In addition to radically changing the way in which union elections \nare organized, the NLRB promulgated a rule requiring most private \nsector employers to post a notice informing employees of their rights \nunder the National Labor Relations Act. I believe this is yet another \nexample of Federal overreach by this administration that benefits their \nspecial interest allies at the expense of American businesses that are \ncurrently struggling to create jobs, which is why I introduced the \nEmployer Free Speech Act last year.\n  If enacted, this legislation would prohibit the NLRB from requiring \nemployers to post a notice about how to establish a union. I am happy \nto report that on April 17, 2012, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals \nagreed with me and has stopped the NLRB from enforcing this unnecessary \nand burdensome rule.\n  This administration is making a habit of using regulatory policies to \nstrengthen unions and harm the economy. In these difficult times, the \nlast thing government should be doing is putting roadblocks in front of \nAmerican businesses as they attempt to do their part to turn our \neconomy around and to create jobs.\n  In the 74 years of the NLRB's existence prior to 2009, the Board had \npromulgated just one substantive rule. It is time that the NLRB return \nto its main function, which is to act as a quasi-judicial agency. These \nactions by the NLRB further push our government down a dangerous path, \none in which decisions no longer lie in the hands of those elected by \nthe people but by unaccountable bureaucrats sitting in Washington \ndisconnected from people.\n  For these reasons and many others, I am supporting S.J. Res. 36, and \nI want to encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand \nwith American employees and employers and to vote to stop the NLRB from \nmoving forward with what is a misguided and deeply flawed ambush \nelection rule.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Wyoming for getting this matter on \nthe Senate floor and giving us an opportunity to debate it. This is yet \nanother example of an administration that seems to be bent upon \ncreating more excessive overreaching regulations, making it more \ndifficult and more expensive for American small businesses to create \njobs and to get the economy growing again. I hope my colleagues will \njoin me in voting to stop this from happening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/24/senate-section/article/S2627-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2627-S2628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NLRB RESOLUTION OF DISAPPROVAL\n\n Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I am in support of S.J. Res. 36 and \nthank the Senator from Wyoming for introducing it.\n  I worry that the recent direction of the National Labor Relations \nBoard is killing American jobs, not creating them. This resolution \nconcerns a new rule regarding ambush or quickie union elections. But \nthis action is just the latest in a number of other anti-job creation \nactivities at the NLRB.\n  The case last year against the Boeing Corporation is a perfect \nexample of where the NLRB actions threatened to kill thousands of new \nU.S. jobs. By threatening to shut down a new plant producing the new \n787 Dreamliner in South Carolina, the NLRB's actions would have cost \nBoeing billions of dollars. This case has made U.S. companies \nreconsider building new plants at home, costing high-quality American \njobs.\n  I am particularly worried about a proposed rule by the NLRB that \nwould require employers to turn over employee personal contact \ninformation to unions, including personal e-mail addresses and cell \nphone numbers. This is a blatant violation of an individual's privacy. \nNo one should have access to that type of information, unless you want \nto provide it. As a Congressman, I fought for easy access to opt into \nthe Do Not Call List, so that you will not be disturbed by unwanted \ntelephone calls. This rule would allow unions to have access to that \nvery same information that the overwhelming majority of Americans do \nnot want to be public. The NLRB is completely out of touch with what is \nimportant to Americans.\n  The resolution on the floor of the Senate specifically addresses the \nnew NLRB rule that would shorten the time frame for a union election to \nas little as 10 days. The new rule is set to go into effect on April \n30. These ambush elections rush workers into making quick decisions, \nwhich are often uninformed ones, on an issue that directly affects \ntheir every day life in the workplace. Forcing workers to make this \nquick decision runs against the heart of our democratic system, based \non the principles of fairness and justice.\n  Quickie elections will be particularly harmful to small businesses. \nSmall businesses are the engine of our economy and our greatest job \ncreators. Small business owners have a range of responsibilities and \nfewer resources than larger corporations. They will struggle to respond \nto the new, accelerated timeframe for elections. Their compliance costs \nwill almost certainly rise; taking money that could have been put into \nenhancing their business, growing the economy, and creating jobs.\n  The NLRB continues to find ways to prevent job growth and inhibit our \neconomy instead of enhancing it. This new rule on ambush elections is \nno different. I thank the Senator from Wyoming, my ranking member on \nthe HELP Committee, for this resolution and I urge its passage.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, today I would like to discuss my strong \nopposition to the resolution before us, the resolution disapproving of \nthe National Labor Relations Board's final rule governing election \nprocedures. This rule seeks to modernize and streamline a process that \nis currently costly, inefficient, and promotes unnecessary delay.\n  Let's be clear about what the rule does and does not actually do. \nThis rule does not fundamentally change how workers are permitted to \norganize. This rule does not prevent employers from talking to their \nworkers about unionization. This rule is not the Employee Free Choice \nAct by fiat. This rule does not require that an election take place in \na set number of days. These are all of the claims that have been levied \nagainst this rule, and, factually, none of them are true.\n  The rule's modifications are purely procedural. Here is one example. \nUnder the current rules, companies often spend weeks litigating the \neligibility of a handful of workers even though the election is \nultimately decided by 50 or 100 votes. Those disputed votes couldn't \nhave determined the outcome of the election--the only consequence was \ndelay. So under the new rules, disputes about small numbers of voter \neligibility can be decided after the election. The workers in question \ncan cast provisional ballots, just as they do in political elections.\n  These exact circumstances played out in Minnesota. On April 8, 2008, \noffice clerical workers in Virginia, MN, filed a petition for a union \nelection. But because the parties litigated the status of a single \nemployee, the unit was not certified until June 10th of that year--64 \ndays after the petition was filed. Under the new rule, the issue \nconcerning that single employee could have been resolved after the \nelection, and the election would have been conducted with less delay \nand uncertainty.\n  These rules don't favor either unions or companies. They favor \nefficiency and modernization. They are narrowly tailored--targeting \nonly those elections that face the longest delays. A vast majority of \nelection schedules are agreed to by the parties--90 percent. This rule \nwould only affect the other 10 percent. These rules favor better use of \nresources. These are the types of government reforms that we should be \npromoting--cutting down on bureaucracy and redtape.\n  Unnecessary delays hurt workers seeking to exercise their rights in \nthe workplace--whether they are seeking to certify or decertify a \nunion. These rules simply give workers a chance to vote yes or no.\n  Working families in Minnesota and across this country are still \nstruggling. The middle class--has been ailing for decades. Without a \nstrong middle class folks who can afford to buy a home and a car and \nsend their kids to college--our country's economic future is tenuous. \nProtecting the ability of working people to have a voice--to vote yes \nor no--will bring more middle-class jobs with good wages and benefits \nthat can drive our recovery forward.\n  The NLRB's rules are modest and reasonable. They uphold the \nprinciples of democracy and fairness that have shaped our Nation's \nworkplace laws. I urge my colleagues to vote against this resolution.\n\n[[Page S2628]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Enzi \nresolution. If enacted, this resolution would prohibit the National \nLabor Relations Board, NLRB, from implementing commonsense, \nstraightforward changes to the union representation process that will \nensure union elections are conducted in a more fair and efficient \nmanner.\n  The new rules, which will go into effect on April 30, will make it \neasier and less burdensome for workers and employers to navigate the \nunion election process.\n  Workers and employers will now be able to electronically file \nelection petitions and other documents. Timely information essential to \nboth sides being able to fully engage in the election process will be \nshared more quickly. Timeframes for parties to resolve issues before \nand after elections will be standardized. Duplicative appeals processes \nthat cause unnecessary delays will be eliminated. Both sides will be \nrequired to identify points of disagreement and provide evidence at the \noutset of the election process, helping to eliminate unnecessary \nlitigation.\n  The modest reforms proposed by the NLRB do not mandate timetables for \nelections to occur, as some of my colleagues will allege; rather, the \nnew rules simply eliminate existing barriers that get in the way of \nproviding employees and employers with access to an open and fair \nelection process. As Catholic Healthcare West, which employs most of \nits 31,000 workers in my State of California, wrote during the public \ncomment period: ``[the] reforms proposed by the NLRB are not pro-union \nor pro-business, they are pro-modernization.''\n  I urge my colleagues to support modernization and oppose the Enzi \nresolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/24/senate-section/article/S2628-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2628-S2630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NLRB ELECTION RULES\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we find ourselves debating yet another \neffort in the campaign against working men and women in this country. \nOver and over again in this body, and in State legislatures across the \ncountry, some have sought to undermine the ability of their \nconstituents--dedicated teachers, electricians, assembly-line workers, \nand civil servants, just to name a few--to come together to bargain for \nfair wages and benefits. The resolution of disapproval before us is \njust another attempt to weaken unionized labor in this country, and I \nwill not support it.\n  The representation process we are debating, which is overseen and \nadministered by the National Labor Relations Board--NLRB--is used when \na group of workers want to hold a union representation vote or when an \nemployer wants to hold a similar vote to decertify a union.\n  Now let me be clear. What we are considering is a resolution that \nwould effectively nullify a number of worthwhile rule changes intended \nto streamline and modernize the process for administering a union \nrepresentation election. And, if adopted, it would essentially bar the \nNLRB from promulgating any similar rules in the future.\n  These changes will help cut down on needless delays that can occur at \npreelection hearings, eliminate the arbitrary minimum 25 day waiting \nperiod following a decision to hold an election, and will clarify the \nelection appeals process. And, the new rules will allow for the use of \nmodern technologies, including email and other forms of digital \ncommunication.\n  The NLRB proposed these amendments last summer, allowed for ample \ntime to consider public comments, and finalized the changes this past \nDecember. These are reasonable updates meant to accommodate modern \nforms of communication and discourage delay tactics that can unfairly \nstall a representation vote for months on end. The finalized rules will \nhelp ensure that the unionization process is fair and timely for \nemployees, employers, and unions. And despite what some of my \ncolleagues have stated, the rules are not encouraging an ``ambush.'' \nThey are encouraging an election. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nvoting against this disapproval resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, over the past 2 days my Republican \ncolleagues have raised several arguments about what the NLRB rule will \ndo. I now want to respond to their points and to clarify once again: \nthis is a modest rule that simplifies preelection litigation in the \nsmall number of cases where the parties don't reach agreement and must \nresort to litigation.\n  First, my colleagues across the aisle have pointed out that unions \nhave recently won about 71 percent of elections, and so, they argue, \nthe current system is completely fair to unions. This is an incredibly \ndeceptive statistic. Unions have filed far fewer petitions in recent \nyears--down from over 4,100 in 2001 to just over 2,000 in 2011. And in \nalmost a third of cases where petitions are filed, the petition is \nwithdrawn before an election. In other words, the process of getting to \nan election can be so slow, and employer anti-union attacks so potent, \nthat unions are discouraged from going through the entire election \nprocess. For the most part, only in the rare cases where support is \ntruly overwhelming or the employer does not oppose the union do unions \nwin.\n  In a related vein, Republicans have argued that elections are \ncurrently held promptly--on average, between 30 and 40 days after a \npetition is filed--and therefore no change in the rule is needed. But \nthis argument misses the point of the rule. Currently, in the 10 \npercent of cases that are litigated, it takes around 124 days to get to \nan election. It takes around 198 days when parties exhaust their appeal \nrights. This rule addresses those situations where employers engage in \nexcessive--and often frivolous--litigation to slow down the process. \nWithout question, in those cases, it takes far too long and these new \nNLRB procedures are a desperately needed fix to shorten that time \nperiod for the 10 percent of cases that are litigated.\n  I have also heard the argument that if employers engage in misconduct \nthat interferes with workers' choice during a long election campaign, \nthe NLRB can rerun the election. But the time it takes to get to a \nsecond election only compounds the frustration and loss of hope workers \nsuffer when their opportunity to make a choice is delayed for too long. \nMany unions won't bother to seek a second election, even if there was \nemployer misconduct, if workers are too discouraged.\n  One of the major improvements in this bill--deferring challenges to \nvoter eligibility until after the election when they are small in \nnumber--has also been mischaracterized. Opponents of the rule claim \nthat workers will be confused about who is in the bargaining unit with \nthem. The reality is, challenged voters will be deferred only when they \nare small in number relative to the size of the bargaining unit. So \nthere will be little or no confusion about the exact individuals in the \nunit. Moreover, workers will know full well the essential identity of \nthe group they are a part of; individual employees may come and go over \ntime as workers retire or find new jobs, but the identity of the unit \nis what remains constant. The unit identity is what workers need to \nknow to be able to make an informed choice about whether to vote for a \nunion.\n  I hear a lot from the other side how this rule will dramatically \nshorten the time to an election and how it will lead to so-called \nambush elections. There is no basis for this prediction. Opponents of \nthe rule can't even agree among themselves how much time the rule will \nshave off an election. Senator Enzi suggested that this rule will lead \nto an election in 10 days; Senator Barrasso suggested it will almost \nhalve the current median time of 38 days. An attorney from the \nmanagement-side labor law firm Jackson Lewis told the Wall Street \nJournal that he thinks the time would be between 19 and 23 days. The \nvice president of the National Association of Manufacturers predicted a \nhearing 20 to 25 days after the petition is filed.\n  The reason there are so many different numbers floating around is \nbecause the rule simply does not say anything about a timeframe for \nelections. Certainly it is true that in the 10 percent of cases that \nare litigated--where the process is abused and delays are rampant--the \nrule likely will shorten the time period by instituting more efficient \nprocedures. But as to the 90 percent of cases where there is voluntary \nagreement, the NLRB will continue to work with parties as it always has \nto arrive at a reasonable election date.\n\n[[Page S2629]]\n\n  In connection with their undue speculation about timing of elections, \nsupporters of this resolution have also argued that employers will not \nhave enough time to communicate with workers under the rule. Because \nthe rule does not actually address timing of an election in the great \nmajority of cases, this is pure speculation as well. Moreover, it is \nwell-known that election campaigns begin long before a petition is \nfiled. If employers wish to mount an anti-union campaign, they will \nalmost certainly do so when they learn a drive is happening. They will \nnot wait until a petition is filed.\n  Similarly, my colleagues have argued that workers will only hear the \nunion's side of the story under this rule. I must point out that it is \nemployers who continue to have the right to hold ``captive audience'' \nmeetings. They can hold meetings on work time where they can require \nworkers' attendance, and they can browbeat workers about why they think \nunions are bad. Unions have no such access to a workplace. The playing \nfield for communicating with workers is currently dramatically skewed \nin favor of employers. It will remain skewed in favor of employers \nafter this rule goes into effect. All this rule does is to put some \nlimits on those employers who would drag out elections to better \nexploit their communications advantage.\n  My colleagues on the other side argue that small businesses will have \nto confront election issues and familiarize themselves with the law in \na very short timeframe. As I have said repeatedly, there is no reason \nto expect an election will occur any more quickly in the great majority \nof cases. Employers would have ample time to review the law. What the \nnew rules do is to put small businesses on the same footing with large \nemployers that can afford excessive, all-out litigation of preelection \nissues. The process is simplified so that all employers have to deal \nwith straightforward and presumably cheaper procedures that give them \nall a fair and equal chance to address preelection issues.\n  My colleagues have argued that this rule creates an uncertain \nbusiness climate. In fact, the rule does just the opposite. It creates \na very predictable process because it applies uniform procedures \ndesigned to cut down on pointless litigation.\n  My Republican colleagues also suggest that this rule will cause more \nlitigation because unions will have less incentive to reach voluntary \nagreements. But, in fact, unions will continue to have every incentive \nto have an agreement on election issues. Hearings still take time and \nresources even though they are now more streamlined than before. Unions \nwould not want to undergo the expense, uncertainty, and delay of a \nhearing even though the process will be much improved under this rule. \nI am confident the great majority of cases will continue to be resolved \nby voluntary agreement.\n  Let me stress that this rule treats both sides the same way--the rule \napplies to elections to decertify a union as well as elections to \ncertify one. Although it has been pointed out that there are certain \ntimes, such as the first year after a certification vote, when workers \nare not permitted to petition to decertify a union, the NLRB does \nprovide adequate, defined time periods when workers are permitted to \nfile a decertification petition. Workers' right to file such a petition \nduring those time periods is well-established, and workers who don't \nwant a union have a clear method to vote the union out.\n  Finally, it has been pointed out that the NLRB recently lost a court \nbattle over its rule requiring a notice posting. But the reality is, \nthe NLRB won this court battle in one district court and lost in \nanother. One court upheld the core of the rule--that the NLRB can \nrequire a posting of workers' right to form a union. The DC Circuit \nCourt of Appeals has now blocked the rule to avoid confusion over who \nhas to implement the rule and who doesn't. That court likely won't \nissue a decision resolving this matter until the fall, but it has \nabsolutely no bearing on the legality or legitimacy of the rule we are \ndebating today. Indeed, the furor over notifying employees of their \nrights is a perfect example of the extremity of Republican opposition \nto worker rights. My colleagues have all spoken about the importance of \nworkers being informed about the pros and cons of unionization, but \nthey object to a simple poster that explains workers' rights under the \nlaw.\n  To conclude, this rule will cause no real change for the vast \nmajority of businesses that approach the NLRB election process in good \nfaith. It imposes no new requirements at all for parties who come to \nthe process in good faith and negotiate an agreement. The rule simply \naddresses the small number of employers that abuse the NLRB election \nprocess and deliberately cause delay to buy themselves more time to \nbombard workers with an anti-union message. The rule also makes NLRB \npreelection litigation more efficient, saving government resources. It \nis a commonsense reform that deserves our full support. I strongly urge \nmy colleagues to vote down the resolution disapproving of this NLRB \nrule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 5 minutes for the majority and 3 \nminutes for the minority.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will, obviously, yield to my good \nfriend, Senator Enzi, for his closing remarks, but I again just want to \npoint out that this ruling by the NLRB is imminently reasonable.\n  They went through rulemaking, as I have said before, one of the most \ntransparent boards we have ever had in history. Rather than going \nthrough the adjudicative process, they went through rulemaking and a \ncomment period. People were allowed to come in, and they even had an \noral hearing which is not even required by the Administrative Procedure \nAct. Mr. Hayes was allowed due time for filing dissents. He chose not \nto do so for whatever reason. So everything was complied with. In fact, \nthey bent over backwards to even do more than what the Administrative \nProcedure Act requires under rulemaking. So that is No. 1.\n  No. 2, the essence of the rule is eminently fair. It applies both to \ncertification and decertification. There is no 10 days. I keep hearing \nabout this 10 days. Mr. Hayes put that in his dissent, but there is \nnothing in the rule that requires a 10-day election. Nothing.\n  Lastly, again, what is this all about? I will say it one more time. \nThis is what it is about, this is it: This is Mr. Martin Jay Levitt who \nwrote a book, ``Confessions of a Union Buster.'' He was a consultant to \nbusinesses that didn't want to have unions formed, and here is what he \nsaid in his book. Here is the way they should do things if they don't \nwant to have a union:\n\n       [C]hallenge everything . . . then take everything \n     challenged to a full hearing . . . then prolong each hearing \n     . . . appeal every unfavorable decision. If you make the \n     union fight drag on long enough, workers . . . lose faith, \n     lose interest, lose hope.\n\n  That is what it is about. It is about establishing a level playing \nfield now so workers do indeed have their full rights--not a paper \nright but a full viable right to form a union and to have an election \nwithin a reasonable period of time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. If my friend needs some more time, \nI yield him whatever time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for the gift of time. \nThere is nothing that is a greater gift than that.\n  Of course, I would like everyone to vote for my resolution of \ndisapproval. This did not go through a process that was open and \ntransparent. In fact, there was only one person who voted for this who \nwas confirmed by the Senate. There were two people who voted for it. \nThe other one lost, in a bipartisan way, the ability to be on that \ncommittee, so he was recess-appointed. So one person confirmed by the \nSenate is making this rule, and there was also\n\n[[Page S2630]]\n\none person confirmed by the Senate who was against it. So it was a 1-\nto-1 tie. That would normally defeat anything.\n  The biggest thing that is being taken away in this, the biggest thing \nthat collapsed the time down to a potential 10 days, the biggest thing \nis eliminating the preelection hearing. That is when the employees--the \nemployees--get their fairness of finding out exactly who is going to be \nrepresented, who is going to be part of their unit, and get any of \ntheir questions answered about this organization that is about to \nreceive their dues. It seems like the employees, for fairness, ought to \nhave that right. It also ought to be for the employers to have that \nright, especially small businesspeople to have the time to get it \ntogether so they are not violating any of the National Labor Relations \nBoard's rules that they can easily step into and be in big trouble \nduring one of these elections.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution of disapproval \nand stop the National Labor Relations Board's ambush election rule. \nThis vote will send a message to the National Labor Relations Board \nthat their job is not to stack the odds in favor of one party or \nanother--under this administration or another--but to fairly resolve \ndisputes and conduct secret ballot elections.\n  We have heard from several speakers on the other side of the aisle \nthat this debate and vote are a waste of time. Debating the merits of \nthis regulation is not a waste of time for the millions of small \nbusinesspeople and millions of employees who are going to be negatively \nimpacted by it. In fact, once it goes into effect next week, I believe \nall of us will be hearing from unhappy constituents and asked what we \ndid to stop this legislation, and we will be asked. The contention that \nwe should not be able to raise concerns about the National Labor \nRelations Board's ambush election regulation before it goes into effect \nsounds a lot like what the National Labor Relations Board is trying to \ndo to small businesses and employees who have questions about a \ncertification election.\n\n  This regulation will take away the right to question whether the \nappropriate employees are in the bargaining unit or whether it includes \nsupervisors and managers who should not be in the union or whether it \nleaves out a group of employees who should be in the union because they \nhave similar jobs, and if they are excluded, they will lose ground \nagainst the newly unionized employees. This regulation takes away the \nright to present evidence and testimony at a preelection hearing and to \nfile briefs supporting a position.\n  Because of the Congressional Review Act, we Senators have had the \nopportunity to present evidence and have debate. That is a privilege \nthe NLRB is taking away from many small employers and employees, and \nthat will lead to some suffering of the employees.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the motion to proceed to S.J. Res. \n36. Again, it is a congressional privilege and we should take advantage \nof it. It is a chance to send a message that we want all of our boards \nto be fair and equal.\n  I yield back any remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to discuss one of the amendments \nthat I believe we will be voting on later, and basically what it does \nis it establishes a BRAC-like process in order to consolidate \nredundant, underutilized, and costly post offices and mail processing \nfacilities.\n  We found over the years that Congress was politically unable to close \na base or a facility that had to do with the military, so we adopted a \nprocess where a commission was appointed, those recommendations to \nconsolidate excess and underutilized military bases were developed, and \nCongress was given an up-or-down vote. This is sort of based on that \nprecedent.\n  The bill before us clearly doesn't offer any solutions. According to \nthe Washington Post editorial:\n\n       The 21st Century Postal Service Act of 2011, proposed by \n     Senators Joseph Lieberman and Susan Collins and passed last \n     week by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security Government \n     Affairs, is not a bill to save the U.S. Postal Service. It is \n     a bill to postpone saving the Postal Service.\n\n  I agree with the Washington Post. I usually do. The Service's \nannouncement that they lost $5.1 billion in the most recent fiscal year \nwas billed as good news. That is how dire the situation is, the fact \nthat they only lost $5.1 billion.\n\n       The Collins-Lieberman bill, which transfers $7 billion from \n     the Federal Employee Retirement System to the USPS--to be \n     used to offer buyouts to its workers and paying down debts--\n     can stave off collapse for a short time at best.\n       Nor do the other measures in the bill offer much hope. The \n     bill extends the payment schedule for the Postal Service to \n     prefund its employee retirement benefits from 10 to 40 years. \n     Yes, the funding requirement is onerous, but if the USPS \n     cannot afford to pay for these benefits now, what makes it \n     likely that it will be able to pay later, when mail volume \n     has most likely plummeted further?\n       The bill also requires two more years of studies to \n     determine whether a switch to five-day delivery would be \n     viable. These studies would be performed by a regulatory body \n     that has already completed a laborious inquiry into the \n     subject, a process that required almost a year.\n\n  The Washington Post goes on to say:\n\n       This seems a pointless delay, especially given a majority \n     of Americans support the switch to five-day delivery.\n\n  And finally they go on and say:\n\n       There is an alternative--a bill proposed by Rep. Darrell \n     Issa that would create a supervisory body to oversee the \n     Postal Service's finances and, if necessary, negotiate new \n     labor contracts. The bill . . . is not perfect, but offers a \n     serious solution that does not leave taxpayers on the hook.\n\n  So we now have legislation before us that makes it harder, if not \nimpossible, for the Postal Service to close post offices and mail \nprocessing plants by placing new regulations and limitations on \nprocesses for closing or consolidating mail processing facilities, a \nmove in the wrong direction. It puts in place significant and \nabsolutely unprecedented new process steps and procedural hurdles \ndesigned to restrict USPS's ability to manage its mail processing \nnetwork.\n  Additionally, the requirement to redo completed but not implemented \nmail processing consolidation studies will ultimately prevent any \nconsolidations from occurring this calendar year.\n  What we have to realize in the context of this legislation is that we \nnow have a dramatic shift, technologically speaking, as to how \nAmericans communicate with each other. That is what this is all about. \nWe now have the ability to communicate with each other without sitting \ndown with pen and paper, just as we had the ability to transfer \ninformation and knowledge by means of the railroad rather than the Pony \nExpress.\n  We now have facilities that are way oversized and unnecessary, and we \nare facing a fiscal crisis. According to the Postal Service:\n\n       The current mail processing network has a capacity of over \n     250 billion pieces of mail per year when mail volume is now \n     160 billion pieces of mail.\n\n  So now we have overcapacity that is nearly double what is actually \ngoing to be the work the Postal Service does, and all trends indicate \ndown. More and more Americans now acquire the ability to communicate by \ntext message, Twitter, and many other means of communications. So to \nsomehow get mired into while we cannot close this post office, we have \nto keep this one open, we have to do this--we have to realize it in the \ncontext that a large portion of the U.S. Postal Service's business is \nconducted by sending what we call ``junk mail'' rather than the vital \nways of communicating that it was able to carry out for so many years.\n  In addition, the Postal Service has a massive retail network of more \nthan 32,000 post offices, branches, and stations that has remained \nlargely unchanged despite declining mail volume and population shifts. \nThe Postal Service has more full-time retail facilities in the United \nStates of America than Starbucks, McDonald's, UPS, and FedEx combined. \nAnd according to the Government Accountability Office, approximately 80 \npercent of these retail facilities do not generate sufficient\n\n[[Page S2631]]\n\nrevenue to cover their costs. That is what this debate is all about. I \nhope my colleagues understand that we are looking at basically a dying \npart of America's economy because of technological advances, and in \nthis legislation we are basically not recognizing that problem.\n\n  When 80 percent of their facilities don't generate sufficient revenue \nto cover their costs, then any business in the world--in the United \nStates of America--would right-size that business to accommodate for \nchanged situations. This bill does not do that. It continues to put up \npolitical roadblocks that prevent tough but essential closings and \nconsolidations.\n  I grieve for the individuals who took care of the horses when the \nPony Express went out of business. I grieve for the bridle and saddle \nand buggymakers when the automobile came in. But this is a \ntechnological change which is good for America in the long run because \nwe can communicate with each other instantaneously. So we have a Postal \nService--and thank God for all they did all those years, in fact, to \nthe point where they were even mentioned in our Constitution. But it is \nnow time to accommodate to the realities of the 21st century, and the \ntaxpayers cannot continue to pick up the tab of billions and billions \nof dollars. Again, last year it lost only $5.1 billion, which they \nsuggested was good news.\n  All this bill does is place significant and absolutely unprecedented \nand new process steps and procedural hurdles designed to restrict \nUSPS's ability manage its mail processing network. Additionally, the \nrequirement to redo completed but not implemented mail consolidation \nstudies will ultimately prevent any consolidations from occurring this \nyear.\n  So what do we need to do? We obviously need a BRAC. We need a group \nto come together to look at this whole situation, find out where \nefficiencies need to be made--as any business in America does--and come \nup with proposals, because Congress does have a special obligation, and \nhave the Congress vote up or down. This bill will continue the failing \nbusiness model of the Postal Service by locking in mail service \nstandards for 3 years which are nearly identical to those that have \nbeen in place for a number of years.\n  The clear intent of this provision is to prevent many of the mail \nprocessing plant closures that the Postal Service itself has proposed \nas part of its restructuring plan. It also prohibits the Postal Service \nfrom moving to 5-day mail delivery for at least 2 years with \nsignificant hurdles that must be cleared before approval, even though \nthe Postmaster General has been coming to Congress since 2009 and \nasking for this flexibility.\n  One of the largest single steps available to restore USPS's financial \nsolvency would save the Postal Service at least $2 billion annually. If \nyou told Americans that we would save the taxpayers' money--because \nthey are on the hook for $2 billion a year--if you went from 6-day to \n5-day mail delivery, I guarantee you that the overwhelming majority of \nAmericans do support a 5-day delivery schedule rather than 6-day \ndelivery schedule.\n  This, of course, kicks the can down the road. The bill also has at \nleast five budget points of order against it about which the ranking \nmember of the Budget Committee came to the floor yesterday and spoke.\n  So the BRAC-like amendment is essential, in my view, to moving this \nprocess forward. I don't know how many more billions of dollars of \ntaxpayers' money is going to have to be spent to adjust to the 21st \ncentury. There is no business, no company, no private business in \nAmerica that when faced with these kinds of losses wouldn't \nrestructure. And they would restructure quickly because they would have \nan obligation to the owners and the stockholders. We are the \nstockholders. We are the ones who should be acting as quickly as \npossible to bring this fiscal calamity under control.\n  The GAO, the Government Accountability Office, states:\n\n       The proposed Commission on Postal Reorganization could \n     broaden the current focus on individual facility closures--\n     which are often contentious, time consuming, and \n     inefficient--to a broader network-wide restructuring, similar \n     to the BRAC approach. In other restructuring efforts where \n     this approach has been used, expert panels successfully \n     informed and permitted difficult restructuring decisions, \n     helping to provide consensus on intractable decisions. As \n     previously noted, the 2003 Report of the President's \n     Commission on the USPS also recommended such an approach \n     relating to the consolidation and rationalization of \n     USPS's mail processing and distribution infrastructure.\n\n  We pay a lot of attention to the Government Accountability Office \naround here and this is something the Government Accountability Office \nrecommends as well.\n  In addition:\n\n       [GAO] reviewed numerous comments from members of Congress, \n     affected communities, and employee organizations that have \n     expressed opposition to closing facilities. Such concerns are \n     particularly heightened for postal facilities identified for \n     closure that may consolidate functions to another state \n     causing political leaders to oppose and potentially prevent \n     such consolidations.\n\n  We should listen to the Government Accountability Office, take \npolitics out of this delicate process, and move forward with their \nrecommendations.\n  Our proposal would be composed of five members appointed by the \nPresident, with input from the House and Senate and the Comptroller \nGeneral, with no more than three members being of the same political \nparty.\n  The Postal Service, in consultation with the Postal Regulatory \nCommission, will be required to submit a plan to the BRAC-like \nCommission on closures and consolidations, which will include a list of \nclosures and consolidations, a proposed schedule, estimated annual cost \nsavings, criteria and process used to develop the plan, methodology and \nassumptions used to derive the estimates and any changes to processing, \ntransportation, delivery or other postal operations anticipated as a \nresult of the proposed closures and consolidations.\n  The Commission will be required to publish in the Federal Register \nthe definition of ``excess mail processing capacity'' with a period of \npublic comment.\n  After receiving the plans, the BRAC-like Commission will be required \nto hold at least five public hearings.\n  Finally, the Commission will be required to vote on the \nrecommendations, with the concurrence of at least four of the members, \nand submit the recommendations to Congress. Any recommendation will be \nthe subject of a congressional vote of approval or disapproval.\n  The amendment recognizes the fact that the current business model for \nthe Postal Service is no longer viable. If we continue to act in an \nirresponsible way by putting up political roadblocks, the American \ntaxpayer will be the one who ultimately suffers in the form of higher \npostage prices and bailouts. We should make hard choices now so future \ngenerations of Americans will have a viable Postal Service.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Washington Post editorial, ``A Failure to \nDeliver Solutions to Postal Service's problems,'' be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 18, 2011]\n\n      A Failure To Deliver Solutions to Postal Service's Problems\n\n       The 21st Century Postal Service Act of 2011, proposed by \n     Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman (I Conn.) and Susan Collins (R \n     Maine) and passed last week by the Senate Committee on \n     Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, is not a bill to \n     save the U.S. Postal Service (USPS).\n       It is a bill to postpone saving the Postal Service.\n       The service's announcement that it lost $5.1 billion in the \n     most recent fiscal year was billed as good news, which \n     suggests how dire its situation is. The only reason the loss \n     was not greater is that Congress postponed USPS's payment of \n     $5.5 billion to prefund retiree health benefits. According to \n     the Government Accountability Office, even $50 billion would \n     not be enough to repay all of the Postal Service's debt and \n     address current and future operating deficits that are caused \n     by its inability to cut costs quickly enough to match \n     declining mail volume and revenue.\n       The Collins-Lieberman bill, which transfers $7 billion from \n     the Federal Employee Retirement System to the USPS--to be \n     used for offering buyouts to its workers and paying down \n     debts--can stave off collapse for a short time at best.\n       Nor do the other measures in the bill offer much hope. The \n     bill extends the payment schedule for the Postal Service to \n     prefund its employee retirement benefits from 10 to 40 years. \n     Yes, the funding requirement is onerous, but if the USPS \n     cannot afford to pay for these benefits now, what makes it \n     likely that it will be able to pay later, when mail volumes \n     most likely will have plummeted further?\n\n[[Page S2632]]\n\n       The bill also requires two more years of studies to \n     determine whether a switch to five-day delivery would be \n     viable. These studies would be performed by a regulatory body \n     that has already completed a laborious inquiry into the \n     subject, a process that required almost a year. This seems a \n     pointless delay, especially given that a majority of \n     Americans support the switch to five-day delivery.\n       We are sympathetic to Congress's wish to avoid killing \n     jobs. And the bill does include provisions we have \n     supported--such as requiring arbitrators to take the Postal \n     Service's financial situation into account during collective \n     bargaining and demanding a plan for providing mail services \n     at retail outlets.\n       But this plan hits the snooze button on many of the postal \n     service's underlying problems. Eighty percent of the USPS's \n     budget goes toward its workforce; many of its workers are \n     protected by no-layoff clauses. Seven billion dollars' worth \n     of buyouts may help to shrink the workforce, but this so-\n     called overpayment will come from taxpayers' pockets, and it \n     is a hefty price to pay for further delay.\n       There is an alternative--a bill proposed by Rep. Darrell \n     Issa (R Calif.) that would create a supervisory body to \n     oversee the Postal Service's finances and, if necessary, \n     negotiate new labor contracts. The bill, which just emerged \n     from committee, is not perfect, but it offers a serious \n     solution that does not leave taxpayers on the hook.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I don't know what the ultimate result of the votes in the \nSenate will be. I do know that if it passes, it will be strongly \nopposed in the other body, the House of Representatives. If it is \npassed and signed into law, we will be back on the floor within 2 years \naddressing this issue again because this is not a solution. This isn't \neven a mandate. It is a proposal that will do business as usual and an \nabject failure to recognize there are technological changes that make \ncertain practices obsolete, and that is what this is all about. Is it \npainful? Yes. Is it difficult? Yes. But the overall taxpayer obviously \nwants us to act in a fiscally responsible manner.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, knowing we are scheduled to go out at \n12:50, I ask unanimous consent to stay in session for no longer than 10 \nminutes more, so we will break at 1 p.m., for Senator Collins and I to \nrespond to Senator McCain--hopefully, sooner than that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair, particularly since the Chair will \nbe occupied by the distinguished Senator from Montana between now and \nthen.\n  I wish to respond very briefly to the statement of my friend from \nArizona, with a couple big points. The first is that Senator McCain has \ndeclared the Postal Service of the United States dead much too \nprematurely. He compares it to the Pony Express. Of course, electronic \nmail and other changes have occurred but, today, every day, the Postal \nService delivers 563 million pieces of mail--every day. There are \nbusinesses and individuals all over our country who depend on the mail. \nThe estimate is there are approximately 8 million jobs in our country, \nmost of them, of course--almost all of them--in the private sector, \nthat depend in one way or another on the functioning of the U.S. Postal \nService.\n  It is not fair and it is not realistic to speak as if the Postal \nService is dead and gone and it is time to essentially bury it with the \nMcCain substitute. I cannot resist saying that Senator Collins and I \ncome not to bury the U.S. Postal Service; we come to change it but to \nkeep it alive and well forever because it is that important to our \ncountry.\n  Secondly, Senator McCain speaks as if the substitute legislation, S. \n1789, that we are proposing--bipartisan legislation--does nothing; that \nit is a status quo piece of legislation; it is not even a bandaid on \nthe problem. We all know, because we have talked about it incessantly \nsince we went on this bill, that the Postal Service is in financial \ndifficulty. Incidentally, I wish to say there is not a dime of taxpayer \nmoney in the Postal Service. Ever since the Postal Service reforms \noccurred, it has been totally supported by ratepayers, basically by \npeople who buy the services of the Postal Service, with two small \nexceptions which are small--one to pay for overseas ballots for members \nof the military so they can vote and another special program to \nfacilitate the use of the mail by blind Americans. But it has a \nproblem: $13 billion lost over the last 2 years.\n  This proposal of ours--Senator Collins and I, Senator Carper and \nSenator Scott Brown--is not a status quo proposal. It makes significant \nchanges. There are going to be about 100,000 fewer people working for \nthe Postal Service as a result of this bill being passed. There will be \nmail processing facilities that close. There will be post offices that \nwill be closed and/or consolidated. There will be new sources of \nrevenue for the Postal Service. The bottom line: The U.S. Postal \nService itself estimates that our legislation, if enacted as it is now, \nas it is phased in over the next 3 to 4 years, by 2016, will save the \nPostal Service $19 billion a year. This isn't a bandaid. This is a real \nreform, a real transformation of the Postal Service to keep it alive--\n$19 billion.\n  Let me put it another way. This is a bipartisan proposal. We have \nworked on it very hard to keep it bipartisan. We think it can pass the \nSenate and it can ultimately be enacted. If Senator McCain's substitute \nwere to pass the Senate, nobody thinks it is going to get enacted into \nlaw. It would not. Certainly, the President of the United States would \nnot sign it, and that will mean nothing will be done. What will be the \neffect of that? The effect will be that the post office will go further \nand further into debt and deficit. Also, the Postmaster General will be \nfaced with a choice of either enormous debts and deficits or taking \nsteps that will make the situation worse--which our bill, through a \nreasonable process, is trying to avoid--which is a kind of shock \ntherapy whose effect will be, as the McCain substitute would be, to \nactually drop the revenues of the post office and accelerate its \ndownward spiral.\n  I think the two numbers to think about--the ones that come from the \nPostal Service itself--are these: By 2016, if we do nothing, the Postal \nService will run somewhere between a $20 billion and $21 billion annual \ndeficit. If we pass this bill and it is enacted into law, that deficit \nwill be down to around $1 billion--a little more--and heading toward \nbalance in the years that follow.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote against the McCain substitute and the \nBRAC amendment. The BRAC-like Commission amendment I think is not \nnecessary. It is not necessary for us in Congress to give up and give \nin. We have a good resolution to the problem. Incidentally, if we get \nthis enacted, I think we will send a message to the American people \nthat we can face a tough problem that exists in a public service, deal \nwith it in a reasonable way, and ask people to sacrifice but keep a \nvenerable and critically important American institution alive and well.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor for my distinguished ranking \nmember.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am only going to speak very briefly. I \nwish to shine a spotlight on a provision of Senator McCain's substitute \nthat has not yet been discussed that actually raises constitutional \nissues.\n  All of us believe the labor force of the Postal Service is too large \nand unfortunately will have to be reduced, and we do that through a \nsystem of buyouts and retirement incentives through a compassionate \nmeans very similar to the way a large corporation would handle the \ndownsizing of its employees. But Senator McCain's alternative takes a \nvery different approach. It would have this new control board that \nwould be created to impose on the Postal Service an obligation to \nrenegotiate existing contracts to get rid of the no-layoff provision.\n  I will say I was very surprised when the Postmaster General signed \nthe kinds of contracts he did this spring. The fact is Senator McCain's \namendment--section 304 of which amends section 1206 of existing law--\nrequires existing contracts to be renegotiated. That creates \nconstitutional questions. The potential constitutional issue derives \nfrom the contracts clause of article I, which prohibits States from \npassing laws impairing the obligation of contracts. Of course, this \nprovision does not apply to the Federal Government. The Congressional \nResearch Service has explained in a memorandum to me on this topic in \nJuly of 2011 that the due process clause of the\n\n[[Page S2633]]\n\nfifth amendment has been held to provide some measure of protection \nagainst the Federal Government impairing its own contracts. I ask \nunanimous consent that the CRS memorandum I just referred to be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Congressional Research Service,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 7, 2011.\n\n\n                               MEMORANDUM\n\n     To: Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \n         Affairs Attention: Lisa Nieman.\n     From: Thomas J. Nicola, Legislative Attorney, 7 5004.\n     Subject: Congressional Authority to Alter Postal Service \n         Employee-Management Relations, Including Collective \n         Bargaining Agreements.\n\n       This memorandum responds to your inquiry regarding the \n     authority of Congress to alter Postal Service employee-\n     management relations, including collective bargaining \n     agreements. The employee-management authority that Congress \n     has granted to the United States Postal Service in the Postal \n     Service Reorganization Act of 1970, P.L. 91 375, is broader \n     than authority that it has granted to most federal entities. \n     Congress enacted the 1970 Act, codified in title 39 of the \n     United States Code, to enable the U.S. Postal Service to \n     operate more like a business than a government agency. Before \n     this statute became law, postal services were operated by the \n     Post Office Department, a cabinet level government agency.\n       The Act established the Postal Service as an independent \n     establishment in the executive branch of the United States \n     Government. While Congress applied to the Postal Service some \n     statutes including those relating to veterans' preference and \n     retirement that apply to federal agencies, it provided in 39 \n     U.S.C. section 1209(a) that, ``Employee-management relations \n     shall, to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of \n     this title [title 39 of the U.S. Code], be subject to the \n     provisions of subchapter II of chapter 7 of title 29[,]'' \n     i.e., the National Labor Relations Act, which governs private \n     sector employee-management relations. By contrast, provisions \n     relating to those relations for federal agencies are codified \n     in chapter 71 of title 5 of the United States Code.\n       In section 1005 of title 39, Congress identified subjects \n     of Postal Service collective bargaining--compensation, \n     benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment. This \n     scope of subjects differs from the scope for federal agencies \n     identified in chapter 71 of title 5, which is limited to \n     ``conditions of employment.''\n       Addressing the transition from the Post Office Department \n     to the businesslike U.S. Postal Service, Congress in 39 \n     U.S.C. section 1005(f), as amended, stated, in relevant part, \n     that:\n       No variation, addition, or substitution with respect to \n     fringe benefits shall result in a program of fringe benefits \n     which on the whole is less favorable to the officers and \n     employees in effect on the effective date of this section \n     [enacted on August 12, 1970], and as to officers and \n     employees/or whom there is a collective-bargaining \n     representative, no such variation, addition, or substitution \n     shall be made except by agreement between the collective \n     bargaining representative and the Postal Service.'' (Emphasis \n     supplied.)\n       In section 1207 of title 39, Congress provided procedures \n     for terminating or modifying collective bargaining \n     agreements. It stated that a party wishing to terminate or \n     modify an agreement must serve timely written notice on the \n     other party. If parties cannot agree on a resolution or adopt \n     a procedure for a binding resolution of a dispute, the \n     Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service \n     must appoint a mediator. This section also provided authority \n     to establish an arbitration board under certain circumstances \n     and said that board decisions are conclusive and binding on \n     the parties.\n       A collective bargaining agreement is a contract between the \n     Postal Service and a recognized bargaining unit. Can Congress \n     affect a collective bargaining agreement through legislative \n     action? The power of Congress over employee-management \n     relations at the Postal Service, including these agreements, \n     may be divided into prospective authority versus authority \n     over existing agreements. Congress has authority to modify \n     the scope of bargaining prospectively. In the Postal \n     Reorganization Act of 1970, Congress granted the Postal \n     Service authority to bargain over compensation, benefits \n     (such as health insurance and life insurance, for example), \n     and other conditions of employment, but it could amend that \n     statute to limit the scope of bargaining subjects in the \n     future. It could, for example, provide that health insurance \n     no longer will be the subject of collective bargaining after \n     collective bargaining agreements that address that subject \n     expire.\n       A more difficult question is whether Congress could modify \n     agreement terms that the Postal Service and recognized \n     bargaining representatives have bargained collectively and \n     included in collective bargaining agreements before they \n     expire. Article I, section 10, clause 1 of the United States \n     Constitution, the Contract Clause, provides that laws \n     impairing the obligation of contracts shall not be passed, \n     but this prohibition applies to the states, not to the \n     federal government. Nevertheless, the jurisprudence under \n     this clause may help inform an inquiry regarding the power of \n     Congress to modify terms of collective bargaining agreements \n     while they are in effect.\n       In United States Trust Co. v. New Jersey, the Supreme Court \n     said that, ``Although the Contract Clause appears literally \n     to proscribe `any' impairment, this Court has observed that \n     `the prohibition is not an absolute one and is not to be read \n     with literal exactness like a mathematical formula.' '' It \n     added that:\n       The Contract Clause is not an absolute bar to subsequent \n     modification of a state's own financial obligations. As with \n     laws impairing the obligation of private contracts, an \n     impairment [of those obligations] may be reasonable and \n     necessary to serve an important public purpose. In applying \n     this standard, however, complete [judicial] deference to a \n     legislative assessment of reasonableness and necessity is not \n     appropriate because the state's self interest is at stake. A \n     governmental entity can always find a use for extra money, \n     especially when taxes do not have to be raised. If a state \n     could reduce its financial obligations whenever it wanted to \n     spend the money for what it regarded as an important public \n     purpose, the Contract Clause would provide no protection at \n     all.\n       Based on the United States Trust Co. case, courts \n     subsequently developed a three-part test when assessing the \n     constitutionality of state action challenged as an impairment \n     of contracts--(1) whether the state action in fact impairs a \n     contractual obligation; (2) whether the impairment is \n     substantial; and (3) whether the impairment nevertheless is \n     reasonable and necessary to serve a public purpose.\n       Although the Contract Clause does not apply to the federal \n     government, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment has \n     been held to provide some measure of protection against the \n     federal government impairing its own contracts, but the \n     limitations imposed on federal economic legislation by the \n     latter clause have been held to be ``less searching'' than \n     those involving the state legislation under the Contract \n     Clause. In two Depression-era cases, however, the Supreme \n     Court held that some statutes which impaired obligations to \n     pay purchasers of federally issued war risk insurance and \n     bondholders that Congress had enacted as economy measures \n     exceeded constitutional limits.\n       If a court should be influenced by the reasoning expressed \n     in these cases, it may strike down as a Due Process Clause \n     violation a statute it finds to impair a term of a Postal \n     Service collective bargaining agreement before that agreement \n     expires. If a court should wish to avoid deciding a case \n     involving whether such a statute violates the Due Process \n     Clause, a constitutional ground, it may uphold the statute, \n     but require the United States to pay damages for breaching a \n     term of the agreement. Alternatively, because the limitations \n     on federal impairment of contracts have been held to be \n     ``less searching'' than those that apply to state impairments \n     under the Contract Clause of the Constitution, which are \n     permitted if found to be ``reasonable and necessary,'' a \n     court may uphold a statute that impairs a term of a current \n     Postal Service collective bargaining agreement and not assess \n     damages against the United States.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. There is also a Supreme Court case, Lynch v. The United \nStates, which makes clear that the due process clause prohibits the \nFederal Government from annulling its contracts and the United States \nis as much bound by its contracts as are private individuals.\n  In the landmark case of U.S. v. Winstar decided in 1996, the Supreme \nCourt cited Lynch for the proposition that the Federal Government ``has \nsome capacity to make agreements binding future Congresses by creating \nvested rights,'' even though the Contract Clause does not directly \napply.\n  Obviously, one Congress cannot bind another, and no Federal agency \ncan bargain away the right of Congress to legislate in the name of the \npeople. But no one would ever sign a contract with an instrumentality \nof the Federal Government if that contract could be rewritten by \nCongress at will.\n  Recognizing this, the courts have distinguished between acts which \naffect contracts in general, where the Federal Government is exercising \nits sovereign powers, and acts directly altering the obligations of \ncontracts to which the Federal Government is itself a party.\n  The Winstar case I mentioned before illustrates this distinction. \nWinstar was brought by a financially healthy Savings & Loan institution \nthat was asked by Federal regulators to take over failing thrifts \nduring the S crisis of the 1980s. After Winstar entered into a \ncontract with the Federal Savings & Loan Insurance Corporation \nstipulating that it could count the ``goodwill'' of the thrifts it took \nover to offset the liabilities it was assuming, Congress changed the \nunderlying\n\n[[Page S2634]]\n\nlaw. Based on that change, the regulators reneged, declared Winstar \n``inadequately capitalized,'' and seized its assets.\n  In that case, the Supreme Court held that even though Congress had \nthe right to change the law in general, the Federal Government could \nstill be liable for breach of contract it had entered into with \nWinstar, and for damages.\n  I am concerned that if the Postal Service reopens and renegotiates \nits collective bargaining agreements to comply with the McCain \namendment, courts could find the Postal Service in breach of those \nagreements, and force it to pay damages.\n  At a minimum, it strikes me that Senator McCain's language could tie \nup the Postal Service in litigation for years, which would defeat our \nefforts to reduce the workforce costs faced by the Postal Service.\n  Bottom line: I am very concerned that if the Postal Service is forced \nby the McCain substitute to reopen and renegotiate current collective \nbargaining agreements, the courts would find the Postal Service in \nbreach of those agreements and force it to pay damages and also that it \nwould be found to be unconstitutional. The approach we have taken does \nnot raise those constitutional concerns. It does not have Congress \nstepping in to abrogate contracts, which is a very serious and \npotentially unconstitutional step for us to take.\n  Finally, I would say I agree with everything my chairman has said. \nSenator McCain's amendment does not address the true problems of the \nPostal Service. Instead, it assumes that the Postal Service is \nobsolete, that they cannot be saved, and that we should just preside \nover its demise. I reject that approach.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/24/senate-section/article/S2634-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the pending business.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1789) to improve, sustain, and transform the \n     United States Postal Service.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid (for Lieberman) modified amendment No. 2000, in the \n     nature of a substitute.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate the good work of our \ncolleagues on this legislation. Unfortunately, the legislation spends \n$34 billion, all of which would be borrowed, all of which adds to the \ndebt of the United States and is contrary to the Budget Control Act \nlimitations that were passed just last August. It is really a grievous \nproblem, not one that can be avoided lightly.\n  Just last August we agreed to certain debt limits--the amount of debt \nwe would incur and add to the U.S. Treasury. It was a fought-over \nagreement, but we reached it and we stood by it. I believe we have a \nmoral obligation to not mislead the people who elected us when we said \nwe intend to stand by the limits on increasing debt. This bill \nincreases debt above that limit. The Congressional Budget Office scores \nit as adding $34 billion in debt to the United States.\n  Chairman Conrad has certified that a budget point of order is \nlegitimately placed against it. I would expect we would have a motion \nto waive the budget point of order. I would expect there might be a \nmotion to say, well, we do not agree with CBO or that somehow this is \nso important we need to add to the debt anyway. But, colleagues, if we \nmean what we say, if at this time in history we begin to at least stay \nwithin the limits we agreed and we don't do that, then I think we will \nlose further credibility with the American people.\n  I respect the work of my colleagues on the bill, but I think we are \nsetting a great precedent. It is a matter of importance for our own \nintegrity and the fiscal stability of America. I believe it is \nimportant that we adhere to that limit.\n  The spending measure, amendment No. 2000 to S. 1789, the 21st Century \nPostal Service Act, would violate Senate pay-go rules and increase the \ndeficit; therefore, I raise a point of order against this measure \npursuant to section 201(a) of S. Con. Res. 21, the concurrent \nresolution on the budget for fiscal year 2008.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of \napplicable budget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections \nof the act and budget resolutions for purposes of the pending amendment \nfor reasons that we described in the debate we had here on the floor \nyesterday. The U.S. Postal Service says this bill will, in fact, save \n$19 billion a year.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I ask unanimous consent that the vote on this motion \nto\n\n[[Page S2635]]\n\nwaive be placed at the end of the list of amendments that are in order \nto vote on now.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. If I may, if we are going to vote now--and Senator \nCollins and I spoke to this at great length yesterday. The CBO score my \nfriend from Alabama cites is a real misreading of the effect of this \nlegislation. It is a kind of form of accounting over the reality of \nbudgeting. The bottom line is that the U.S. Postal Service itself says \nthat if this bill--the substitute to S. 1789--is adopted--and it would \nbe phased in over 3 years--the Postal Service will save $19 billion \nannually. To me, that is what this is all about--no deficit, a saving.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the motion to waive the point of the \norder.\n  I would yield to my ranking member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the score for the substitute is \nincredibly misleading. As the Postal Service has told us, this bill \nwould save the Postal Service $19 billion, and that would return it to \nprofitability. The problem is the unique status of the Postal Service \nin that it is off-budget for operations but on-budget for workers' \nbenefits accounts. This is true despite the fact that these accounts \nthe Postal Service pays into are not funded with tax dollars.\n  The postal employees are contributing. The Postal Service, from its \nrevenue, is contributing.\n  For the retirement accounts, we are not talking about tax dollars \nfrom the Postal Service. These are contributions from the postal \nemployees and by the Postal Service from its revenues. But because of \nthe unified budget, it is considered to be an on-budget status for \nthese benefit accounts--most likely because they are shared with other \nFederal agencies that are using tax dollars.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the motions to waive. If they do not \nand this bill falls, it will spell the end of the Postal Service.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, very briefly, I join my colleague in \nsaying that if this point of order by our friend from Alabama is \nsustained and this bipartisan bill therefore is not able to be brought \nup, the effect will be that the Postal Service will continue to run \never-greater losses to a point where they, in fact, will have to turn \nto the Treasury, which they are not doing now, to bail them out. This \nis a responsible answer to a problem and a bipartisan one.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to support the motion to waive the \nSenator's point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I hope my colleagues listened to what \nSenator Collins said with respect to the way this has been scored. It \nis a very important point. As much as anybody in this Chamber, I am \ninterested in reducing the budget deficit. I want Senators to keep in \nmind these three points: One, for a number of years, the Postal Service \nhas overpaid its obligation into the Federal Employees Retirement \nSystem--$12 billion to $13 billion in overpayment. They are owed that \nmoney. They should be given that money. They are going to use it to \nhelp 100,000 postal employees who are eligible to retire to retire. \nThey will use that money to pay down their debt--$13 billion--and \nalmost wipe it out. They will use it for that purpose. CBO scores that \nas something that makes the budget deficit bigger. If they overpaid the \nmoney into the Federal Employees Retirement System, they ought to get \nit back. They should get people who are eligible to retire and want to \nretire to retire. They should use it to pay down a $12 billion line of \ncredit to the Federal Government.\n  The second point I wish to make is the one offered by Senator \nLieberman. If we do nothing and we get to May 15, the Postal Service is \nfree to close post offices across the country--3,700 of them. They are \nfree to close as many as 200 to 300 mail processing centers. There is a \nsmarter way to do this, which is in this legislation.\n  Lastly, we are going to have the opportunity today and tomorrow for \nall of us to better understand the amendments that have been agreed to \nand offered by both sides, what has been agreed to and put into the \nmanagers' amendment, which we will, frankly, have a lot more confidence \nin.\n  The Postal Service tells us today they are going to lose $23 million. \nThey lost that much yesterday. They are going to lose that much again \ntomorrow, the next day, and the next day. They owe $13 billion to the \nTreasury. What I think is more important to keep in mind is when we \nfinish our work today and tomorrow, and we look to see what that means \nfor the Postal Service, in terms of their operation on a daily basis \nand where will they be in terms of paying their obligation by 2016, we \nneed to keep our eye on the ball. I urge Senators not to vote for this. \nGive us a day for the body to work its will and then make your \ndecision. If we have not made any more progress, vote against it.\n  Lastly, several of our colleagues have well-intentioned amendments \nthat will literally drive up the cost and make it harder for the Postal \nService to move toward a balanced situation, to a sovereign situation. \nI urge Senators--and some of these amendments are offered by people we \nlove and it is hard to say no to them. But in this case, maybe the \ngreater devotion should be to the taxpayers of our country, to the \npeople who work for the Postal Service, and to their customers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senators who have \nexpressed their disagreement on the budget point of order. Even if one \ndisagrees over the $11 billion, there is $23 billion in additional \nspending that will be borrowed over the decade, according to CBO. With \nregard to the $11 billion, that money will be borrowed and given to the \nPostal Service. It increases the debt of the United States.\n  Therefore, CBO scores it as a violation of the debt limit in the pay-\ngo provision. It clearly is. So we are not saying we should not have a \npostal bill. Let's vote, stand firm with the debt limit agreement we \nhad in August. Let's ask our good committee to produce a bill that is \npaid for in some fashion. We spend $3,700 billion in the United States. \nWe need to find about $3 billion a year to fund their proposal to solve \nthis problem. That is what we should do. We are at a defining moment. \nThere is no middle ground. I say vote to sustain the point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, for a very long time, in a bipartisan \nway, a number of people have come together to save the U.S. Postal \nService. Senator Lieberman and Senator Carper and Senator Collins and \nSenator Brown have worked very hard, as have many others, because if \nthe Postal Service goes under or is dismembered, we are talking about 8 \nmillion jobs in this country--small businesspeople who are dependent on \na strong Postal Service.\n  The Postmaster General originally was talking about shutting down \n3,700 rural post offices in every State in this country. I hope Members \nunderstand that a post office in a rural town is more than just a post \noffice. If that post office disappears, in many cases that town \ndisappears. The Postmaster General was talking about specifically \nslowing mail delivery standards, shutting down half the processing \nplants in this country--over a short period of time, eliminating \n200,000 jobs in this country.\n  I hope we can proceed, have a serious debate on these issues, hear \nall the amendments, but at the end of the day, I hope we will go \nforward and save the U.S. Postal Service.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I too thank the chairman and ranking \nmember of the committee and Senator Carper for bringing something to \nthe floor that is bipartisan. I applaud that and the fact that the \ncommittee process is working.\n  But the fact is we did set a top line number when the country almost \nshut down last August 2. On one of the very first pieces of legislation \nwe passed, the highway bill, we violated that budget cap. It wasn't by \nmuch, but we violated it. Now we have a bill that violates it by $11 \nbillion.\n  What I say is that if the Postal Service is that important to this \nNation, if\n\n[[Page S2636]]\n\nit has bipartisan support, should we not figure out a way to deal with \nthe Postal Service in such a way to stay within the budget constraints \nwe have laid out? It seems to me things that are very popular in this \nNation are the very things we ought to make choices about and eliminate \nsomething else if we want to spend money in this way. I would like to \nsee a bill that is far more reformed, and I think if we did that, the \ntab on this would not be $11 billion above the budget.\n  What I say to everybody here is, please, our credibility is going out \nthe window. Sixty-four of us signed a letter to the leader and to the \nPresident asking that we deal in a real way with deficit reduction. The \ncountry almost shut down. The world watched. We established a top line \nnumber, and here we are, for something we like, violating that. We are \nlosing all credibility with our citizens--the citizens we represent. We \nare losing credibility in the world.\n  To me, if we are going to produce a bipartisan piece of legislation, \nit ought to be one that lives within the bipartisan agreement we had \nregarding what we are going to spend in this Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I add my strong voice to support the \nposition of Senators Lieberman, Collins, Carper, and Brown, who has \nalso been a great leader in this bipartisan effort to save the Postal \nService and put it on a more sound financial footing, not at the \nexpense of taxpayers generally but the users of the Postal Service.\n  This is about rural towns in America. This is about small businesses \neverywhere that rely on the Postal Service to get basic business done. \nDon't vote wrong today. Give the Postal Service a chance to save \nitself. That is what we are doing. We are giving rural communities a \nchance to fight and to be part of a growing economy. We are giving \nsmall businesses the opportunity to stay in business. Don't cut them \noff today. Let this debate go forward because we are trying to do the \nright thing and go in the fiscally responsible direction.\n  I see my colleague from Massachusetts who has been a very able leader \nin our effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for \nspeaking on this important issue. This is something that is ratepayer \ncosts, not taxpayer dollars. It is something we have worked on for a \ncouple months. All of a sudden we are here at the end now and everybody \nis saying, by the way, we cannot do it.\n  Bottom line: If we don't do this and pass it, we will not have a \nPostal Service. This is something we recognize--there is a new business \nenvironment that the Postal Service operates under but one focused on \nsustainment. If we don't give them the tools to do that, we are going \nto be losing the Postal Service.\n  There is a misconception somehow out there that there is a bailout \ngoing on. These are dollars that are ratepayer dollars, not taxpayer \ndollars. Our bill doesn't prevent the Postal Service from making \nchanges or streamlining operations, but it ensures that it rolls out \nchanges in a deliberate and responsible manner. It is fair to the \nemployees and gives postal customers the ability to continue to use the \nservice, provide short-term relief without taxpayer funding--that FERS \noverpayment of between $7 billion and $10 billion, part of which we can \nuse to help reduce the workforce without even blinking. It is a no-\nbrainer.\n  It provides long-term relief as well, curbside delivery, \nadministrative efficiencies and other reforms, retiree health care \nrestructuring. It focuses its primary attention on the primary costs, \nthe controversial Postal Service closures, going from 5-day service to \n6-day service. Listen, both sides are highly charged on these issues. \nHad they been involved in the conversations of upward of 400 hours \nbetween staff and Members working on these things, we could have worked \nthrough those, instead of waiting until, once again, the end hour to \nget on these issues.\n  Once again, I am with Senators Lieberman, Carper, and Collins, \nobviously, in my effort to continue to move this bill forward so we can \nhave a good conversation about how to reestablish that trust between \nthe American ratepayer, taxpayer, and the Postal Service. We need to do \nthis.\n  It is very important for us to do it. We need to move on and focus on \nthe things that matter. This matters. I want to make sure I can send my \nmom a card. I want to make sure we can continue to keep our people \nemployed. I want to make sure we have an institution that will be \nviable into the next century. I hope we will move forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, very briefly, I thank Senator Brown \nfrom Massachusetts for his statement and his work on the bill.\n  This point of order puts the whole bill in jeopardy. Right at the \nbeginning of the debate and the vote, it forces Members to decide \nwhether they want to deal with this crisis of the Postal Service. I \nthink it tests Congress again--in this case the Senate. Are we going to \nface a real problem in one of the iconic areas of American public \nservice, the Postal Service, which cannot continue to do business as it \nis now--and this bill will force it to change in ways that are \nsignificant but will still keep it alive--or are we going to turn away \nfrom the problem, which would be the effect of sustaining this point of \norder. It would also cut off the debate.\n   We have 39 amendments pending. This bill may change as the debate \ngoes on. The final vote on passage of the bill will require 60 votes. \nSo don't cut it off now.\n  Let's have this debate and prove to the American people that we can \ntake on a problem and, on a bipartisan basis, fix it. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for the motion to waive the point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I think there is merit in the discussion \nabout whether we vote now or vote later. The important thing is that we \nvote on this budget point of order. It is not as if the entire process \nof trying to fix the post office is going to collapse if we take this \nvote and it succeeds. All we are asking is that we find a way to pay \nfor it. This Senate agreed last August to the Budget Control Act; that \nwe were not going to exceed these limits, and that we would find, if \nthere was something essential that needed to be done--if that is the \ncase to be made here--we would at least find a way to stay within what \nwe agreed to do. This is the second time now, I believe--maybe more--\nthat we have violated that agreement. So what do we go home and tell \nour people? Well, this was so important--to save some post offices--\nthat we had to violate an agreement which was agreed to by a strong \nmajority here to save the country from default.\n  There are priorities. It is impossible for me to understand why we \ncan't, in this government that spends over $3.7 trillion, find a way to \nscare up $34 billion over a 10-year period of time to cover the cost \nthis bill is going to lay on us. So I would urge, whether we vote now \nor vote later on the point of order made by the Senator from Alabama, \nthat we consider this. We have a recess week coming up. Staff can get \ntogether and dig out $34 billion in cost savings we can apply to this \nso we don't have to worry about going home and telling people we didn't \nkeep our word, that we lied to them last August.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I sit on this committee. I voted on the \nlast postal reform bill. I am not unfamiliar with the issues. I think \nthe question before us is why can't we do both? Why can't we fix the \npost office and pay for it at the same time, if in fact the CBO says \nthat? Our answer, always, up here is that we want to fix the post \noffice but we don't want to make the hard choices on how to do that.\n  My colleagues have done great work. There are parts of this bill I \ndon't agree with. I am trying to amend parts of it. But I think we \nshould try to move forward with it. The ultimate question is, will we \ndo what is best for the post office and the American people. And doing \nwhat is best for the post office and the American people is any cost \nwhere the CBO says we will violate the budget agreement we should pay \nfor.\n\n[[Page S2637]]\n\n  I will offer right now to come up with easy ways to pay for this bill \njust through the duplication reports we have gotten from the Government \nAccountability Office. We all know it is out there. We all know there \nis $100 billion, at least, that we could come up with by consolidating \nprograms or mandating they be consolidated. So it is not a matter of \nfinding the money, it is a matter of whether we have the will.\n  We are on a collision course with history that says we are not going \nto succeed if we don't get our budgets in order. So I agree it is hard \nto stomach sometimes what the CBO tells us. It doesn't fit with common \nsense. When it works for us, we use it. When it works against us, we \nsay it doesn't matter. This is a budget point of order, and I think we \ncan do both, and I think we ought to do both.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, let me repeat for my colleagues one more \ntime: There are no taxpayer dollars authorized by this bill or \nappropriated by this bill. The score is caused by the unique status the \npostal service accounts have within the unified budget. The operational \naccounts are off budget. The employee health benefits and retiree \naccounts are on budget because those accounts are also used by Federal \nagencies.\n  Let me again quote from the inspector general who explains the system \nvery well. He says the source of the Federal employee retirement \nfunding comes from two streams of revenue. First, the U.S. Postal \nService contributes 11.9 percent of the employees' salaries to the fund \nand the employees contribute .8 percent. The postal service's \ncontribution comes from revenue paid for postage, and this money comes \nfrom ratepayers. The employee contribution is made in exchange for a \ndefined benefit.\n  There are no tax dollars authorized or appropriated by this bill. It \nis a quirk of the way the unified budget works. And that is why we \nshould vote to waive this point of order. We are not talking about \ntaxpayer dollars here.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the point of order raised by the Senator from Alabama.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate, equally \ndivided, prior to a vote on amendment No. 2056, offered by the Senator \nfrom Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, amendment No. 2056 requires the Postal \nService to take into consideration some pretty commonsense things, such \nas economic savings, before they urge the shutdown of a post office or \nmail processing center.\n  It also requires the Postal Service to take into account retail \nservice standards. That means the Postal Service would not be able to \nleave a community without access to basic postal services when it \ncloses down a post office.\n  If the Postal Service does not meet these criteria, the Postal \nRegulatory Commission can review and reject the Postal Service's \nproposal. This amendment adds much needed teeth to the amendment that \nSenator Moran and I offered when this bill was before the committee.\n  I am joined by a number of cosponsors, but in particular Senator \nFranken and Senator Levin. This is a commonsense amendment that allows \na lot of the post offices that are going to be closed to have another \nset of eyes and have the Postal Regulatory Commission take another \nlook.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I wish to echo the statement of my \nfriend, Senator Tester, and urge all my colleagues to support our \namendment.\n  The Tester-Franken-Levin amendment gives individuals and communities \nimpacted by closures a voice. It will give Minnesotans real recourse to \nchallenge closure decisions and a fighting chance to keep their local \npost offices and processing facilities open.\n  Right now, individuals affected by post office closures can appeal \nthe decision to the Postal Regulatory Commission, but the commission \ncannot stop closures. Our amendment will give the PRC the authority to \nreverse post office and processing facility closure decisions.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote on amendment No. 2056.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I support Senator Tester's amendment.\n  It simply creates safeguards to ensure that the Postal Service, when \nit closes a post office, does so as the result of a process that is \ntransparent and takes into account the unique needs of communities, \nparticularly small towns and rural areas.\n  This does not stop the decisionmaking process at the Postal Service \nto change the Postal Service. It makes it transparent and fair.\n  If I may, at this time I ask unanimous consent that if a voice vote \nis requested and acceptable for any of the amendments relative to the \npostal reform bill, including this one, that the 60-vote affirmative \nvote requirement be waived for that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I want to note for the benefit of our \ncolleagues that on the list of 39 amendments, the first amendment was \nSenator McCain's amendment No. 2001. He did not call it up, which is an \nexpression of his intention not to go forward with it. I thank him for \nthat, and I hope it sets a precedent that other of the sponsors of \namendments will feel moved to follow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I too support the amendment offered by \nSenator Tester and Senator Levin.\n  It simply makes clear that the Postal Regulatory Commission may \nreview an appeal of a post office closure if it violates either the \novernight delivery service standard or the retail service standards \nthat are created by our bill. So I urge support for the amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the bill before us would make some \nimportant changes to existing law. There is little doubt that change is \nnecessary; the Postal Service faces an extraordinary financial \nchallenge, and it must make changes to take into account a new reality \nin which physical mail has in many cases been replaced by electronic \ncommunication.\n  But in making these necessary reforms, we must ensure that all the \nAmerican people can continue to rely on the United States Postal \nService to provide universal service, as it has since our Nation's \nfounding. And we must ensure that in making changes, any reduction in \nfacilities and personnel yields real cost savings to the Postal Service \nthat outweigh the loss in service. One of the things we can do to \nassure that is to require that there be a real, objective way to test \nand challenge Postal Service proposals to close facilities. In an \neffort to meet those goals, I have joined with Senators Tester and \nFranken and others to propose an amendment that would\n\n[[Page S2639]]\n\nmake some important changes to the substitute amendment before us.\n  Here are some of the provisions of our amendment. Under current law, \nany interested party can appeal a proposed closure of a community's \nmain post office to the PRC, the Postal Regulatory Commission. The \nsubstitute before us extends that opportunity for appeal to branches of \na post office. The substitute does not, however, extend that same \nappeal right to postal processing facilities. While the substitute \nacknowledges the need for some oversight over the closure of processing \nfacilities, it is important to provide a meaningful chance to appeal a \nproposed closure of a mail processing facility. Our amendment does \nthat.\n  The importance of providing a meaningful appeal process was \nreinforced by a recent experience of mine. In February, I wrote to \nPostmaster General Donahoe about the decision to close six processing \nfacilities in Michigan. In my letter, I asked four questions: How many \njobs would be affected at each facility? Of those, how many would be \ntransferred to other facilities? How far would each transferred worker \nhave to transfer? And what were the projected cost savings or \nadditional costs at each affected facility? It seems to me that \ninformation is crucial to making informed decisions about whether to \nclose a facility. But when the Postal Service responded to my letter \nnearly 8 weeks later, the response did not answer any of these \nquestions satisfactorily. An inability to provide that kind of basic \ninformation indicates to me that a fair opportunity to appeal is \ncrucial.\n  Our amendment also clarifies that during the appeal process for post \noffices, branches, and processing facilities, the proposed closure \nshall be suspended--not just that it ``may be'' suspended, as is the \ncase under current law. If the Postal Service can close a post office, \nbranch or processing facility while the closure is under appeal, the \nappeal would be a sham.\n  Also, under current law and the substitute before us, the PRC has the \nauthority to affirm a proposed closing or order that the matter be \nreturned to the Postal Service for further consideration. Our amendment \nwould grant the PRC the additional authority to reverse a closure \ndecision.\n  Our amendment would also require that the Postal Service consider \nwhether a proposed closing or consolidation is consistent with new \nretail service standards that the bill requires, and whether the \nproposed action achieves real and substantial cost savings. And our \namendment provides that the PRC set aside Postal Service decisions to \nclose post offices and branches that do not achieve substantial \neconomic savings. If our goal is to help save the postal service money, \nsurely it is important that we do not allow actions that degrade \nservice to our communities without actually saving money.\n  Postal reform is among the most significant issues we will consider \nthis year. It touches every town and village, every person and every \nbusiness across our Nation. The Postal Service's universal service \nobligation--the obligation to ensure that all Americans have access to \nan affordable, efficient postal system in order to communicate with one \nanother--is among the most important obligations any agency or \ndepartment has. It sets the Postal Service apart from private-sector \nfirms that are under no obligation to serve all markets. The Postal \nService's first obligation is not profit. It is service.\n  Historically, the United States Postal Service has played a vital \nrole in uniting Americans across the vast expanse of this continent, in \nconnecting Americans far from home with their loved ones, in helping \nbusinesses reach customers across the Nation and the globe. \nEstablishing a postal service was among the first acts of the \nContinental Congress, an act that predates even the Declaration of \nIndependence. The need to establish an efficient postal system for the \ncolonies was deemed so important that Benjamin Franklin, one of the \nmost respected leaders not just in America, but the world, was named \nour first postmaster general.\n  I have heard from many of my constituents on this issue, as I am sure \nall of us have. They recognize the need to reform the Postal Service \nand find efficiencies so that it can continue to serve all Americans. \nBut they also want us to do this the right way--to ensure that any \nchanges we make, in fact, put the Postal Service on a sound financial \nfooting, and that we carefully balance the need for savings with the \nneed to maintain service for all people and in every community across \nthe Nation. I believe our amendment will help us meet those goals, and \nI urge the bill's managers and all our colleagues to support its \nadoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2056, as modified.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment and \nask for a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Amendment (No. 2056), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] for himself, Mr. \n     Johnson of Wisconsin, and Mr. McCain, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2060.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide transparency, accountability, and limitations of \n                   Government sponsored conferences)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED CONFERENCES.\n\n       (a) Travel Expenses of Federal Agencies Relating to \n     Conferences.--\n       (1) Limitations and reports on travel expenses to \n     conferences.--Chapter 57 of title 5, United States Code, is \n     amended by inserting after section 5711 the following:\n\n     ``Sec.  5712.

Limitations and reports on travel expenses to conferences.''.\n\n       (b) Limitations on Annual Travel Expenses.--\n       (1) In general.--In the case of each of fiscal years 2012 \n     through 2016, an agency (as defined under section 5701(1) of \n     title 5, United States Code) may not make, or obligate to \n     make, expenditures for travel expenses, in an aggregate \n     amount greater than 80 percent of the aggregate amount of \n     such expenses for fiscal year 2010.\n       (2) Identification of travel expenses.--Not later than \n     September 1, 2012 and after consultation with the \n     Administrator of General Services and the Director of the \n     Administrative Office of the United States Courts, the \n     Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall \n     establish guidelines for the determination of what expenses \n     constitute travel expenses for purposes of this subsection. \n     The guidelines shall identify specific expenses, and classes \n     of expenses, that are to be treated as travel expenses.\n       (c) Conference Transparency and Limitations.--\n       (1) Definitions.--In this subsection--\n       (A) the term ``agency'' has the meaning given under section \n     5701(1) of title 5, United States Code; and\n       (B) the term ``conference'' has the meaning given under \n     section 5712(a)(1) of that title (as added by subsection \n     (a)).\n       (2) Public availability of conference materials.--Each \n     agency shall post on the public Internet website of that \n     agency a detailed information on any presentation made by any \n     employee of that agency at a conference, including--\n       (A) any minutes relating to the presentation;\n       (B) any speech delivered;\n       (C) any visual exhibit, including photographs or slides;\n       (D) any video, digital, or audio recordings of the \n     conference; and\n       (E) information regarding any financial support or other \n     assistance from a foundation or other non-Federal source used \n     to pay or defray the costs of the conference, which shall \n     include a certification by the head of the agency that there \n     is no conflict of interest resulting from the support \n     received from each such source.\n       (3) Limitation on amount expended on a conference.--\n       (A) In general.--No agency may expend more than $500,000 to \n     support a single conference.\n       (B) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this paragraph shall \n     be construed to preclude an agency from receiving financial \n     support or other assistance from a foundation or other non-\n     Federal source to pay or defray the costs of a conference the \n     total cost of which exceeds $500,000.\n       (4) Limitation on the annual number of conferences an \n     agency may support.--No agency may expend funds on more than \n     a single conference sponsored or organized by an organization \n     during any fiscal year, unless the agency is the primary \n     sponsor and organizer of the conference.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. This is a straightforward amendment on conferences. We \nall have seen what happened with the GSA conference. This is all about \ntransparency and creating a system where we are actually getting to see \nwhat is spent on conferences. There is not one branch of the Federal \nGovernment that does not have teleconferencing available and \nvideoconferencing available.\n  What we do know is from 2000 to 2006, the Federal Government--that is \nthe last time we have records--spent over $2.2 billion on conferences. \nWe know the travel budget is $15 billion a year and a minimum $500 \nmillion a year is spent on conferences at a time when we need to spend \nless, and they have grown remarkably during the Bush administration as \nwell as this administration.\n  This is just simple good government transparency, where we have put \non a Web site what they are doing and why they are doing it. We limit \nforeign conference travel to 50. We limit the maximum amount to \n$500,000, unless they can make an exception for that based on cause and \nreason.\n  So it is simply a good government program to get some visibility on \nwhat we are spending on conferences, and I would ask for a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I strongly support this amendment. I wish \nto commend the Senator from Oklahoma for offering an amendment that \nwould prohibit the kind of lavish spending on Federal conferences we \nhave seen recently at GSA. So this is an excellent amendment. It will \nsave money, provide more transparency, and put a cap on how much can be \nspent. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I also support the amendment, and I \nthank Senator Coburn for introducing it. This is disclosure and \nlimitation of spending on conferences. Unfortunately, the excessive and \noutrageous spending by GSA on the conference in Las Vegas brought the \nwhole area of Federal spending on conferences into the public Klieg \nlights, and I reached a conclusion that we are spending too much.\n  This amendment would require the posting online of all agency \nconference spending. It limits the amount that can be spent on \nconferences and limits the number of conferences agency employees can \nattend and it imposes a 20-percent across-the-board cut on agency \nbudgets for this purpose. I hope the amendment passes. I hope the bill \npasses as amended.\n  There are a couple parts of that that we have begun to work with \nSenator Coburn and his staff on which I think will make this a better \namendment. But bottom line, this responds to a need, and I support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator in Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, just briefly, I support this amendment. I \nam happy Senator Coburn has offered this amendment and it was debated. \nI hope it is accepted on a voice vote.\n  Let me say, we brought a bill to the floor that has been brought \ntogether by two Republicans and two Democrats. We just had a vote on \nwhether to waive a budget point of order. Give us a chance to air the \nbill, offer amendments, and look to see what we can agree on in a \nbipartisan vote. We have an early opportunity to go back and forth on \namendments not just for the Democratic amendments but Republican \namendments as well.\n  My hope is at the end of the day we will approve both. Hopefully, we \nwill be able to say we passed a bill with bipartisan support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the Coburn amendment, amendment No. 2060.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2033\n\n    (Purpose: To establish the Commission on Postal Reorganization)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I call up amendment No. 2033.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself and Mr. \n     Coburn, proposes an amendment numbered 2033.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record of Wednesday, \nApril 18, 2012 under ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment would establish a \ncommission on postal reorganization, basically a BRAC. It is the same \nthing we have done in the case of military bases. For many years we \nwere unable to close a single one. This would establish a commission on \npostal reorganization. They would come out with their findings and \nrecommendations and Congress would vote up or down.\n  Recently, the Government Accountability Office released a report just \nthis month entitled ``Challenges Related to Restructuring the Postal \nService's Retail Network,'' which supports this BRAC-like policy \nprocess, and it goes on to say that this Commission could broaden the \ncurrent focus on individual facility closures, which are often \ncontentious, time consuming, and inefficient to a broader network with \nwide restructuring similar to the BRAC approach.\n  This is obviously an admission that we are unable to make these tough \ndecisions ourselves, but it has proven successful in the BRAC process, \nand I think it will in this case.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n[[Page S2641]]\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment. This \namendment would create a commission similar to the base closure \ncommission to oversee Postal Service decisions regarding which post \noffices, processing plants, and district offices are to close or \nconsolidate.\n  In this bill we have constructed what I think is a clear and fair \nsystem for making exactly those decisions. The language in the bill is \nnot status quo language. If this bill is enacted, there are post \noffices that will close or be consolidated as well as mail processing \nfacilities that will close. That simply has to happen, but it will \nhappen according to a system of due process that gives most heed to the \nfiscal crisis of the Postal Service.\n  In other words, I think we have a congressional answer to this \nproblem. We don't have to yield it to another BRAC commission.\n  I urge opposition to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the McCain amendment No. 2033.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Illinois (Mr. Kirk).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided on amendment No. 2020, as modified.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President and colleagues, this amendment is for the \nmore than 25 million Americans--more than 800,000 of them serving in \nthe military--who vote by mail in our system of government, the most \nopen and free system of government in the world. Those millions of \nAmericans may vote absentee, they may vote in what is called no-excuse \nabsentee, or they may vote in an all-mail election, but they deserve \nthis fall to have the assurance from the U.S. Senate that as we reform \nthe Postal Service, the election will not be disrupted.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this. I think it has been discussed \nat length on both sides of the aisle. It has always been bipartisan to \ntry to expand the franchise. I hope we can pass this on a voice vote.\n  I wish to thank both Chairman Lieberman and Senator Collins, who had \na real challenge handling all of these amendments and who have been \nvery gracious, both of them, as always.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment. I \nthank Senator Wyden and those who worked with him on this amendment \nfor, frankly, calling our attention to this important matter and \nworking to ensure that our efforts to salvage the U.S. Postal Service--\nto change it, to keep it alive--do not come at the expense of our \ncritical efforts to ensure access to the voting booth by mail as well \nas no-excuse absentee programs that rely heavily on dependable mail \nservice. I support the amendment.\n  If there is no further debate, I urge that we adopt the amendment by \nvoice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2020, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2020), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2058, as Modified\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent to call up my amendment No. 2058 \nand that it be modified with the changes at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment, as modified.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S2642]]\n\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2058, as modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To improve access to postal services in communities \n       potentially affected by a postal closing or consolidation)\n\n       On page 40, strike lines 16 through 18 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(iv) to provide postal services to the community served \n     by the post office--\n       ``(I) through a rural carrier; or\n       ``(II) by co-locating an employee of the Postal Service at \n     a commercial or government entity;\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on amendment No. \n2058, as modified, offered by the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. This is a straightforward amendment. It modifies the new \nservice requirement to encourage colocation in other businesses.\n  One of the things that is going to happen to the Postal Service where \nthey can't--85 percent of our post offices are losing money. So what we \ncan do is keep service but have it at a different location for a much \nlower cost. All this amendment does is encourage the Postmaster General \nto consider that as part of the service standard in meeting that \nrequirement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, this amendment by the Senator from \nOklahoma is right in line with the bill. We do encourage the Postal \nService to look at colocations--for example, in a local pharmacy or a \ngrocery store. In many small communities, that may well be a viable \noption, and it may well improve customer access. So I think this is a \nvery good amendment that is in line with other language already in the \nbill. I urge its adoption by a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues that this is \nanother good amendment offered by the Senator from Oklahoma. What the \nPostmaster General has in mind for our communities across America, \nwhere there are 33,000 post offices, is to give a number of them an \noption--a menu, if you will--to see whether it makes sense in those \ncommunities to shorten somewhat the length of time the post office is \nopen in a day--maybe to 6 or 4 hours a day--whether to use a colocator \nin a supermarket maybe or in a convenience store or to in some cases, \nsay, to State and local government operations in those communities: Why \ndon't we put them under the same roof? Why doesn't that make sense?\n  Frankly, all those ideas may make sense. The idea is not to tell a \ncommunity which of those options they have to choose but to say: This \nis the menu. And this is one of the great options that should be on the \nmenu.\n  I commend the Senator for offering the amendment. I urge a ``yes'' \nvote on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the \namendment, the question is on agreeing to the amendment, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2058), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the next \namendment on the list, the so-called McCaskill-Merkley amendment, be \ndropped a few places down because we are working on some compromise \nlanguage that we hope will lead to a voice vote of acceptance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2061, as Modified\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To achieve long-term cost-savings by allowing the Postmaster \n General to reduce the postal workforce through mandatory retirements \n                        for eligible employees)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES \n                   OF THE POSTAL SERVICE TO RETIRE.\n\n       (a) Definition.--In this section, the term ``retirement-\n     eligible employee''--\n       (1) means an employee of the Postal Service who meets the \n     age and service requirements to retire on an immediate \n     annuity under section 8336 or 8412 of title 5, United States \n     Code; and\n       (2) does not include an individual described in section \n     8336(d) or 8412(g) of title 5, United States Code.\n       (b) Authority.--Subject to subsection (c), not earlier than \n     the date that is 2 years after the enactment of this Act, the \n     Postmaster General may issue rules and regulations \n     prohibiting a retirement-eligible employee from performing \n     service as an employee of the Postal Service.\n       (c) Limitation.--The Postmaster General may only issue \n     rules and regulations under subsection (b) if the Postmaster \n     General determines that issuing the rules and regulations \n     would achieve financial savings for the Postal Service.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on amendment No. \n2061, as modified, offered by the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, this is an amendment we have changed \nsomewhat from the original version to address some of the concerns.\n  What this amendment does is 2 years from now it will give the \nauthority to the Postmaster General to create a retirement requirement \nfor postal employees. There are 175,000 postal employees eligible for \nretirement right now. Nothing happens for the next 2 years. It gives \nplenty of time for planning. It gives him the authority to create that \nprinciple, which says that when you become retirement age--because they \nare going to have a continuing need to have fewer and fewer employees--\nthere is the ability to make retirement mandatory. That is all it does. \nIt is for those who are best capable of retiring with full pensions. \nThey have to have complete and full pension capability. It will allow \nhim to do that 2 years from now--not now but 2 years from now--and it \nonly gives him the authority should he want to. So it does not mandate \nit, it does not require it, and it actually does not take effect for 2 \nyears.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, while I think the changes the Senator \nhas made in his amendment do improve it considerably, I am still very \nconcerned about the idea of imposing a mandatory retirement system, and \nlet me tell you why.\n  First, to me, it smacks of age discrimination in some cases. Second, \nwe could be losing some of our most experienced and best personnel we \nneed to implement the major changes that are authorized by this bill. \nThird and finally, I find it a little odd that we would want to tell \npeople who are still in their working years and have had a good career \nand are contributing and are good employees that we do not want them to \nwork anymore. I think the approach in our bill of offering incentives \nis a better way to go.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, the difference is you are going to pay \n$25,000 to people to retire. The Postmaster General has already said he \nneeds to have 120,000 fewer employees. That will grow over a period of \ntime. We are setting a precedent with the buyout, one. We are setting a \nprecedent that has never before been done in the Federal Government. \nNo. 2, and probably more important, is the fact that----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This amendment reflects the efforts of a lot of \npeople to deal with rural post office closings in a way that will be \nstraightforward and fair to rural communities across this country. It \nis going to prevent any closings for 1 year while the reforms which are \nembedded in this bill have a chance to begin to work. It then sets some \nclear standards for potential closures.\n  I want to thank Senator Moran who did some great work on this subject \nin committee. He deserves credit for beginning the process of taking a \nhard look at rural post offices and how we were dealing with them. I \nobviously want to thank Senator Merkley who has worked on this, Senator \nTester who has worked on it, and Senator Sanders. But I really want to \nthank Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman for continuing to model to \nthis body what true bipartisanship looks like, and who continually \nstrive for that very elusive and rare but valuable commodity in a \ndemocracy, that thing known as compromise. This amendment now \nrepresents one of those compromises. I am proud to be a part of it. I \nthink it strikes the right note of protecting rural post offices but \nalso with a realistic eye toward the future and how we are fair to \nrural communities in a way that is predictable and one that, frankly, \nshows some accountability for the Postal Service.\n  I ask that this be taken up by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I appreciate the work that has been \ndone on this amendment. I know there is a lot of interest on both sides \nof the aisle because of the concern about rural post offices. This \nestablishes, again, some standards. It effectively asks the Postal \nService before it considers closing a rural post office for 1 year \nafter enactment of this legislation\n\n[[Page S2644]]\n\nthat it explore every other opportunity to continue to provide service \nother than closing the post office.\n  The one clear authority given in the modified amendment is to close a \nrural post office when there is no significant community opposition, \nwhich is to say, when the Postal Service has convinced the people of \nthe community that they have a good alternative to the current post \noffice. So I think we have reasoned together.\n  I hope this enables our colleagues who may have been thinking of more \nabsolute prohibitions to closing post offices to step back from that. \nThis is a rational, fair approach. I support the modification and the \namendment.\n  I urge that the amendment be adopted by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2031), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I move to reconsider the vote and ask unanimous \nconsent that the motion be laid upon the table.\n  The motion to lay upon the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on amendment No. 2080 \noffered by the Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, very briefly, first I want to thank the \nchair of the committee and my colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, \nfor working and assisting me in modifying this amendment.\n  I thought this amendment was important from the standpoint and based \non our experience in Maine with the recent proposal by the Postal \nService to close a distributional and processing facility. As my \ncolleague Senator Collins will attest as well, we discovered that much \nof their methodology was indeed faulty in the savings that they had \nsuggested would be achieved by closing this facility.\n  There were many questions raised with those numbers and reports. As \nwe know, before the U.S. Postal Service can make any determination for \nclosing a facility, they have to prepare and publish an area processing \nstudy.\n  Based on that study, I have recommended that we now have independent \nverification of the numbers and proposals by the U.S. Postal Service so \nthat we can make sure those numbers are accurate and that we verify the \nmethodology in addition to the savings.\n  One of the examples I can give from this proposal is one they made \nfor a facility in the State of Maine to eliminate two management \npositions, for a savings of $799,000. When we questioned the veracity \nof that number, they backtracked and said it was only $120,000. \nIncredulously, they have now submitted their final area processing \nstudy this year and returned to the higher figure of $800,000 for the \ntwo management positions. We know that cannot be accurate. Therefore, \ngiven the evidence of these proposals, we need to have independent \nverification by the Postal Regulatory Commission before any closure can \ngo forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, first, I congratulate my colleague from \nMaine for an excellent amendment. As she indicated, the Postal Service \nmade a major miscalculation, a mathematical error, in the study it did \non the Hampden processing center in our State. So that Senators know, \nthe amendment would say if a proposed consolidation of a mail \nprocessing center is appealed to the Postal Regulatory Commission, the \nCommission can be asked to review the underlying study's methodology \nand the estimated savings to make sure it is correct because right now \nthere is no way to challenge a mistake that is made by the Postal \nService in conducting these very important studies that are going to \ndecide whether processing centers stay open.\n  I commend my colleague from Maine for a very well thought out \namendment, and I urge its adoption by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2080) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2043, as Modified\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I call up amendment No. \n2043 and ask that it be modified with the changes at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Udall] proposed an \n     amendment numbered 2043, as modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To strike the limitations on changes to mail delivery \n                       schedule, with an offset)\n\n       Strike section 208 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 208.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on amendment No. \n2043, offered by the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, this amendment strikes a \nprovision allowing the USPS to move to 5-day service in 2 years. Two \nyears is simply not enough time to see the changes we are making in \nthis bill take effect before we cut this essential service.\n  My amendment doesn't say we can never move to 5-day service, but it \nsays that 2 years is not enough time for the Postal Service to \nimplement the many cost-saving measures in the bill.\n\n[[Page S2645]]\n\n  Why eliminate one of the key competitive advantages and hurt rural \nAmerica before we know the effects of these reforms? It makes no sense.\n  Why would we make a change that would reduce mail volume by almost 7 \npercent? Isn't that why we are in this crisis in the first place?\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in protecting rural jobs and go on \nrecord to say clearly that moving to 5-day service should be a last \nresort.\n  I reserve my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I rise to oppose the amendment of my \nfriend from New Mexico. I know there are a lot of people who don't want \nto lose 6-day delivery. But the greater imperative is not to lose the \nPostal Service as we know it.\n  The Postmaster asked for the immediate authority to go from 6 days of \ndelivery to 5. In this bill we have given the Postmaster authority in \nmany different areas to save money. We said, as a result, that we will \nnot give him the authority to go from 6 days of delivery to 5 for 2 \nyears, hoping that within the 2 years he can save enough money not to \nhave to make this change. Frankly, I am skeptical that he can. We \nwanted to give him 6 days of delivery--that last opportunity.\n  To pull this procedure out of the bill, with a lot of due process \nbefore the move can be made from 6 to 5 days, removes the credibility \nfrom the bill and will jeopardize its ultimate adoption.\n  With a lot of respect and affection for my friend from New Mexico, I \nurge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, this amendment would also take $8.9 \nbillion that is supposed to go to pay for retiree health benefits of \npostal workers and instead redirect those funds to maintain 6-days-a-\nweek delivery of the mail. I hope we always have 6-days-a-week \ndelivery. I think that is an asset. I think we should strive to \npreserve it. That is why our bill prohibits going to 5-day delivery for \n2 years, to wring all the waste out of the system.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, Saturday service is \nabsolutely essential in rural areas.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2082, as modified.\n\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the Postal Service from closing or consolidating, \n        or reducing the workforce of certain postal facilities)\n\n       On page 33, strike line 24 and all that follows through \n     page 34, line 6 and insert the following:\n       ``(C) Limitations.--\n       ``(i) In general.--Except as provided in clause (ii), \n     during the 3-year period beginning on the date of enactment \n     of the 21st Century Postal Service Act of 2012, the Postal \n     Service may not close or consolidate a postal facility if--\n\n       ``(I) the closing or consolidation prevents the Postal \n     Service from maintaining service standards as required under \n     section 201 of the 21st Century Postal Service Act of 2012; \n     or\n       ``(II) the Postal Service--\n\n       ``(aa) did not close or consolidate the postal facility \n     before May 15, 2012; and\n       ``(bb) conducted an area mail processing study with respect \n     to the postal facility after January 1, 2006 that--\n         ``(AA) was terminated; or\n         ``(BB) concluded that no significant cost savings or \n     efficiencies would result from closing or consolidating the \n     postal facility.\n       ``(ii) Exception.--Clause (i) shall not apply with respect \n     to a postal facility described in clause (i)(II) for which--\n\n       ``(I) an audit under clause (iii) concludes that the mail \n     volume and operations of the facility have changed since the \n     date of termination or completion of an area mail processing \n     study described in clause (i)(II)(bb) to such an extent that \n     the study is no longer valid; and\n       ``(II) an area mail processing study completed under this \n     subsection concludes that the closing or consolidation or the \n     postal facility is justified, taking into consideration the \n     savings to the Postal Service and the impact of the closing \n     or consolidation on postal customers.\n\n       ``(iii) Audit by inspector general.--\n\n       ``(I) In general.--Upon the written request of the \n     Postmaster General, the Inspector General shall conduct an \n     audit of the mail volume and operations of a postal facility.\n       ``(II) Completion.--Not later than 90 days after the date \n     on which the Inspector General receives a request under \n     subclause (I), the Inspector General shall submit to the \n     Postmaster General and the Postal Regulatory Commission a \n     report containing the conclusions of the audit under \n     subclause (I).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on amendment No. \n2082, as modified, offered by the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this was an amendment I originally \noffered relative to processing facilities that have been subject to \nefficiency reviews. At the suggestion of the chairman of the committee, \nSenator Lieberman, as well as ranking members, we have modified the \namendment. The sum total of its change would be for those limited \nfacilities which have been found since the year 2006 to be efficient. \nBefore they could be closed, the postal service would have to call on \nthe U.S. Postal Service's inspector general to conduct an audit to find \nthat the previous findings have been terminated and are no longer \nvalid.\n  That is the only change that was recommended by the committee and the \nstaff, and I have added that modification to the amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I want to salute Senator Durbin on his \nthoughtful amendment and thank him for his collegiality in \nnegotiations. We think it helps us. But we have been misled, \nmanipulated, and disregarded in our attempts to get information from \nthe Postal Service. I don't know if the Easton AMP study has been \nconcluded or suspended. I can't get an answer from the Postal Service. \nAnd if I can't get an answer, then the little guy on the Eastern Shore \ncan't get an answer. I believe there are other Senators in the same \nboat who have been disregarded by the Postal Service.\n\n[[Page S2646]]\n\n  Does my colleague believe his amendment provides protections for mail \nprocessing centers where the Postal Service has postponed or suspended \ntheir study for a significant period of time--like at the facility in \nEaston, MD?\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is a pleasure working with Senator Mikulski and I \nthink the Senate can appreciate how hard she works for her \nconstituents. I am sympathetic to hear that the Senator's inquiries to \nthe Postal Service on behalf of seniors, small businesses, and other \nconstituents have gone unanswered.\n  It is my intent for, and the Postal Service has assured me that, the \nmail processing facility in Easton, MD, where the Postal Service has \nissued a formal notification that they are postponing their study for a \nsignificant period of time, is covered by my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank my friend from Illinois. He \nhas explained the amendment totally. It is a good amendment. I support \nits passage, and urge we adopt it by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2082), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on amendment No. 2034 \noffered by the Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I have serious concerns with the FECA \nprovisions in this bill, especially since they would reduce benefits \nfor many employees who were already injured while working in service to \nthis country, such as Federal firefighters, FBI agents, prison guards, \nand civilians serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. In addition, unlike most \nState workers' comp programs, this bill would reduce benefits for \nelderly disabled employees when they reach retirement age.\n  My amendment offers a reasonable alternative by replacing the FECA \nprovisions in this bill with the Republican-led bipartisan FECA reform \nbill that passed the House by voice vote last year. The House chose not \nto make benefit changes without the additional information it sought \nfrom GAO, and we should follow their lead.\n  This amendment, supported by more than 20 organizations, would make \ncommonsense reforms that will improve program efficiency and integrity \nwithout reducing benefits for disabled seniors, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, this amendment would strike the Federal \nworkers' compensation title in the bill and replace it with very minor \nprovisions that provide no significant cost savings.\n  The amendment would strike the reforms that bring parity between \nworkers' comp benefits and retirement benefits for Federal workers. It \nmakes it much more comparable to the States' workers' comp plans. The \nFederal plan is more generous than any State plan. The amendment does \nnothing to combat the rampant fraud nor constrain costs which have \nincreased by $1 billion.\n  In the current workers' comp program, we have 2,000 postal employees \nwho are over age 70; we have 6 Federal workers who are age 100 or \nolder. These individuals are not coming back to work. We are trying to \nfocus this program, as it should be, on returning injured workers to \nwork. It is very similar to the proposals that the Obama administration \nhas made. It grandfathers in everyone for 3 years as well as those age \n65 and older.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wish to join my friend from Maine in \nrespectfully opposing Senator Akaka's amendment.\n  This workers' compensation program has gotten out of control. Senator \nCollins has worked hard on this with others. Her reform proposal for \nthe Postal Service struck the Obama administration as so sensible that \nthey asked our committee to extend it to all the Federal Government \nemployees.\n  I urge opposition, respectfully, to the Akaka amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Cutting workers' compensation benefits governmentwide is \nnot fair and it is not necessary to save the Postal Service. We should \nfollow the House's example and enact bipartisan reforms contained in my \namendment and wait until GAO finishes its analysis before making \ndecisions on benefit levels.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to adopt my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2034.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise on behalf of amendment No. 2047, \nwhich I have cosponsored with Senator Blunt. I deeply appreciate his \nleadership.\n  This bipartisan amendment would allow for a nonpaid advocate to \nrepresent communities facing a closure or a consolidation. Advocates \nwould represent their communities' interests throughout closure \nproceedings and would work with the Postal Service to identify \nalternative methods to maintain service standards. Advocates would have \naccess to documents, data, and reports related to the proposed closure. \nAdvocates would also have authority to appeal a final decision on \nclosure to the Postal Regulatory Commission if there was a concern it \nwould hurt service standards.\n  Finally, the amendment would allow the strategic commission already \ncontained within this bill to develop interagency agreements so that \npost offices could provide additional government services, such as the \nissuance of Social Security cards and hunting and fishing licenses, \nsimilar to what it already does for passports.\n  In 2011, to take 1 year, the Postal Service accepted 5.6 million \npassport applications that generated $182 million in revenue. This \namendment has\n\n[[Page S2649]]\n\nthe potential to cut government costs, improve access, and help keep \npost offices open by supplementing revenue streams in a way that is \nparticularly helpful to our rural communities. I hope the Senate could \nadopt this amendment.\n  I yield to my colleague Senator Blunt and thank him for his work.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I worked with Senator Bennet on this \namendment. I think it does ensure that communities are not notified a \nfacility is closed without having any opportunity to have input. It \nprovides for advocacy and also gives the post office system some \nflexibility that they do not have now to provide postal services in new \nand innovative ways.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. I also want to, as a cosponsor of this \nimportant piece of legislation, commend Senators Bennet and Blunt for \nworking together in a truly bipartisan way to make sure we get another \ngood addition to this bill. I agree the communities affected by postal \nclosings should have that strong advocacy to protect them against \narbitrary and capricious closings. This bill also asks the Strategic \nAdvisory Commission, established in our bill, to look into how other \nFederal and State agencies and the Postal Service might enter into \ninteragency agreements in order to better utilize the services and \nimprove efficiencies as referenced by the Senator from Colorado.\n  They are both fine improvements, and I and the prime sponsors of the \namendment support this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2047), as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2083\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2083.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Corker], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2083.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 39, strike line 20 and all that follows through \n     page 45, line 17, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 205. OTHER PROVISIONS.\n\n       (a) Frequency of Mail Delivery.--Section 101 of title 39, \n     United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(h) Subject to the requirements of section 3661, nothing \n     in this title or any other provision of law shall be \n     construed to prevent the Postal Service from taking any \n     action necessary to provide for a 5-day-per-week delivery \n     schedule for mail and a commensurate adjustment in the \n     schedule for rural delivery of mail.''.\n       (b) Overall Value of Fringe Benefits.--Section 1005(f) of \n     title 39, United States Code, is amended by striking the last \n     sentence.\n       (c) Modern Rate Regulation.--Section 3622(d) of title 39, \n     United States Code, is repealed.\n       (d) Delivery Service Standards, Mail Processing, and \n     Community Post Offices.--Sections 201 and 202 of this Act, \n     and the amendments made by those sections, shall have no \n     force or effect.\n       (e) Applicability of Reduction-in-force Procedures.--\n     Section 1206 of title 39, United States Code is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(d) Collective-bargaining agreements between the Postal \n     Service and bargaining representatives recognized under \n     section 1203, ratified after the date of enactment of this \n     subsection, shall contain no provision restricting the \n     applicability of reduction-in-force procedures under title 5 \n     with respect to members of the applicable bargaining unit.''.\n       (f) Historic Post Offices.--Section 404(d) of title 39, \n     United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(7)(A) In this paragraph, the term ``historic post office \n     building'' means a post office building that is a certified \n     historic structure, as that term is defined in section \n     47(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, this amendment is a balanced approach that \nstrives to give the U.S. Postal Service maximum flexibility in multiple \nareas as they work toward financial stability. Here is the best part. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, this amendment results in \nsavings of $21 billion over the next 10 years. I do not think we have \nseen amendments that do this, that save $21 billion.\n  In conclusion, it is clear the Postal Service needs to make drastic \nchanges. I applaud those portions of S. 1789 that allow the Postal \nService greater flexibility. But too many provisions in S. 1789 would \nput more restrictions on the Postal Service, not fewer, and limit the \norganization's ability to adapt to changing times.\n  I urge support of my amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose this amendment. It \ndeals with some issues that the committee and the bipartisan bill have \ndealt with in a fair and balanced way. It kind of breaks through that \nproposal we have made. It would permit the Postal Service to move to 5-\nday delivery service immediately. It would increase rates without a \ncap. It also removes some protections that are in the bill at this \ntime.\n  I think this amendment, if adopted, would lead to the kind of \ncurtailments in postal operations that would actually not help the \nPostal Service but diminish revenues and put it more dramatically into \ndeficits.\n  With respect to my friend, the Senator from Tennessee, who sponsored \nit, I oppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered, \nand the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL.

I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S2650]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To allow supervisory and other managerial organizations to \n     participate in the planning and development of changes in, or \ntermination of, pay policies and schedules and fringe benefit programs)\n\n       At the end of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 106. SUPERVISORY AND OTHER MANAGERIAL ORGANIZATIONS.\n\n       Section 1004 of title 39, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (b), in the second sentence, by inserting \n     ``as provided under subsection (d) and any changes in, or \n     termination of, pay policies and schedules and fringe benefit \n     programs for members of the supervisors' organization as \n     provided under subsection (e)'' before the period; and\n       (2) in subsection (e)(1), by inserting ``, or termination \n     of,'' after ``any changes in''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a vote on amendment No. \n2049 offered by the Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Akaka.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, current law provides postmasters and post \noffice supervisors with the opportunity to consult over pay and \nbenefits. This is not collective bargaining and does not result in a \ncontract.\n  Unfortunately, the Postal Service tries to modify, reduce or \neliminate supervisors' benefits outside the normal consultation \nprocess, arguing that Congress intended this consultation for the \ncreation but not elimination of benefit programs. This amendment simply \nclarifies existing law that the consultation requirement applies to any \nchanges to pay or benefits.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I rise to support the amendment offered by my friend \nfrom Hawaii. The Postal Service is going to need the support of all its \nemployees and managers to turn around its current decline.\n  Postmasters and postal supervisors are a real and important human \nasset for the Postal Service and we should do what we can to foster \nproductive and constructive collaboration between the Postal Service \nand the senior employees. The Akaka amendment just clarifies and \nstrengthens existing requirements for consultation, not collective \nbargaining, for the scheduling of changes and terminations of pay and \nbenefit programs. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, let me just reinforce that this is not \ngiving collective bargaining rights to postmasters or to postal \nsupervisors. I support Senator Akaka's amendment. All it is trying to \ndo is strengthen a provision that is in current law that asks for the \nPostmaster General to consult with the postmasters and the other \nsupervisory organizations when there are changes made in work schedules \nor benefits. They should have the right to have their views heard. It \ndoes not give them a veto. It does not authorize collective bargaining \nor contract negotiations in any way. I wish to emphasize that because \nthere has been misinformation about what this amendment, in fact, \nentails.\n  I support this amendment and I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I ask for a voice vote.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I object. I would like a rollcall vote. I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I believe the next amendment in order \nis amendment No. 2025 by the Senator from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2025.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Paul] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2025.\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n               (Purpose: To end the mailbox use monopoly)\n\n       At the end of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. ENDING THE MAILBOX USE MONOPOLY.\n\n       Section 1725 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by \n     striking ``established, approved, or accepted'' and all that \n     follows through ``mail route'' and inserting ``or post office \n     box owned by the Postal Service or located on Postal Service \n     property''.\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, it is a Federal crime for anyone but the \nU.S. Postal Service to use a mailbox. The United States is the only \ncountry in the world that grants a mailbox monopoly. You can purchase \nyour mailbox, you can install it, you can fix it, but you do not truly \nown it because you do not control what goes in your mailbox. If someone \nvandalizes your mailbox, you are responsible for it. You repair it. But \nyou cannot decide what goes in it. If you put something in a mailbox \nwithout the permission of the U.S. Postal Service, if your child puts a \nbirthday invitation in a mailbox, it can be a $5,000 fine. If an \norganization puts something in a mailbox other than through the Postal \nService, it is a $10,000 fine.\n  My amendment would grant individual owners of mailboxes the right to \nmake decisions about their mailboxes. Adopting this amendment would \nrestore individual mailbox choice. So I am for mailbox choice, and I \nhope the body is. It seems to me a fundamentally American concept to \ncontrol access to your own mailbox. I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would like to inform the Senate that this \nwill be the last vote tonight. I have spoken to Senator McConnell. I \nknow there are a lot of important things that committees have to do \ntomorrow, so we are going to start voting on finishing the postal bill \ntomorrow at 2 o'clock. We appreciate everyone's cooperation today. We \nwill need some more tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, there are at least three problems with \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Kentucky.\n  The first is a practical problem. How is the Postal Service going to \ndeal with a situation where at one house there is a monopoly on the use \nof the post office box and at the next house there is not a monopoly? \nHow is that going to work?\n\n[[Page S2651]]\n\n  Second, mail often contains highly sensitive pieces, such as medical \nrecords, bills, personal correspondence. Continuation of the mailbox \nmonopoly is necessary to preserve the safety, the security, and the \nprivacy of mail.\n  The third argument is that if you repeal the mailbox monopoly, you \nwill leave rural America behind. There will be plenty of competition in \nlarge cities, but who will be left to serve rural America? Only the \nPostal Service. And that will further drive up its costs because it \nwill be losing customers.\n  I strongly urge opposition to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL.

WEDDLE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute and bid \nfarewell to a Kentuckian I knew well and considered a good friend. The \nHonorable Judge James G. Weddle of Casey County, KY, passed away \nrecently, shortly after announcing he would be stepping down from the \nbench. He was 71.\n  Judge Weddle had a remarkable legal career that spanned over 45 \nyears; much of it in public service. A graduate of the University of \nKentucky School of Law, Judge Weddle served as Casey County Attorney \nfor 16 years, and served as a circuit judge on the 29th Judicial \nCircuit of Kentucky from 1998 until his untimely passing; he planned to \nretire in May.\n  What strikes me the most about Judge Weddle, after having the benefit \nof his friendship, is how much he valued public service to the people \nof Casey County and Kentucky. Right up until the end of his career, he \nwas always striving to be better. He felt he had not yet reached his \npeak. Being the best--and doing the best, for the benefit of all who \ncame into his courtroom was important to him.\n  A scholarly man, Judge Weddle was sure to read all the latest law \nbooks and articles, and often knew more about recent legal events than \nlawyers in his courtroom who were half his age. He was well known for \nhis ability to cite case after case without having to reference a \ncomputer or his law books. Simply put, he loved the law. And he loved \nthe people of his community. You couldn't ask for a finer combination \nof passions in a Kentucky circuit court judge. The people of the \nCommonwealth were blessed to have him.\n  Elaine and I extend our deepest sympathies to the judge's family, \nespecially his wife, Zona; his son, James; his daughters, Lucinda, \nSuzanne, Andrea, and Sarah; his grandchildren, Jack, Jeb, and Beau; his \nbrother, R.C.; his sister, Delores; and many other friends and family \nmembers. The judge was preceded in death by his sister, Norma Jean.\n  At this time, Mr. President, I would like to ask my Senate colleagues \nto join me in honoring the memory of the Honorable Judge James G. \nWeddle. The people of Kentucky are the better for his many years of \nservice.\n  A newspaper in my home State, the Casey County News, published an \nexcellent article highlighting the Judge's life and career, as well as \nhis obituary. I ask unanimous consent that said materials be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to appear as \nfollows:\n\n              [From the Casey County News, Apr. 18, 2012]\n\nJudge Weddle Remembered--Circuit Court Judge Dies Days After Announcing \n                               Retirement\n\n                           (By Larry Rowell)\n\n       A Casey County native who devoted his life to his family, \n     the law, and to the people of Casey County has died after an \n     extended illness.\n       Casey Circuit Court Judge James G. Weddle died in the early \n     morning hours of April 11 at home surrounded by family \n     members. He was 71.\n       Just a few days before, Weddle had announced that he was \n     retiring May 1 from the 29th Judicial Circuit, which included \n     Casey and Adair counties.\n       Weddle was serving his second eight-year term, having first \n     been elected in 1998.\n       Prior to serving as a circuit judge, Weddle became an \n     attorney in 1966 after graduating from the University of \n     Kentucky School of Law. He served as Casey County Attorney \n     for 16 years and also in private practice.\n       Fellow judges and attorneys had nothing but high praise for \n     Weddle and a legal career that spanned more than 45 years.\n       ``I have known Judge Weddle for many years and he was \n     distinguished by his dedication to his work. No other judge I \n     know anywhere worked harder with a completeness and constancy \n     of his work,'' said Chief Justice John Minton of the Kentucky \n     Supreme Court.\n       Casey and Adair County Commonwealth's Attorney Brian Wright \n     prosecuted many cases before Weddle.\n       ``I had a lot of respect for Judge Weddle, especially for \n     his legal mind. He devoted his life to the legal \n     profession,'' Wright said.\n       Also, Weddle was known for his vast knowledge of legal \n     cases and his ability to cite cases without ever pulling a \n     law book off the shelf.\n       ``He read books, books, and books, and articles on the \n     Internet. He didn't golf or hunt or fish. His life was the \n     law,'' Wright said.\n       Still, Weddle was known for being a fair judge who had an \n     open mind.\n       ``It was never his way or the highway when it came to the \n     law,'' said Janelle ``Tootsie'' Roberts, who served as \n     Weddle's secretary for 22 years.\n       Wright said that in one particular case he was trying \n     before Weddle, he was able to show the judge a prior case \n     that changed the way he thought about it.\n       ``He was always open to something new,'' Wright said.\n       Roberts said that in addition to loving the law, Weddle \n     also was a history buff who had a knack for remembering dates \n     and events.\n       ``Judge Weddle loved history and sometimes in court he \n     would ask, Today is December 7, can anyone tell me what \n     happened on that date?''' Roberts said.\n       And there was another belief that Minton, Wright, and \n     Roberts shared about Weddle his love for the people of Casey \n     County.\n       ``In the last conversation that I had with Judge Weddle \n     where he told me he was going\n\n[[Page S2652]]\n\n     to resign, he told me how important his work was to him and \n     how reluctant he was to give it up. He kept thinking he was \n     going to get better,'' Minton said.\n       ``I hate to lose dedicated people like Judge Weddle. It's a \n     loss to the state and to the counties he served. And, he \n     loved Casey County,'' Minton said.\n       A memorial service for Weddle was held on Monday. A \n     complete obituary can be found on page 4.\n\n\n                     THE HONORABLE JAMES G. WEDDLE\n\n       Judge James G.

Mr. President, this is a week to bear witness. Today, \nApril 24, we mark Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day--the day on which \nwe remind one another of the organized campaign of deportation, \nexpropriation, starvation--and atrocity perpetrated by the Ottoman \nEmpire against its Armenian population, beginning with the detention \nand eventual execution of hundreds of Armenian community members on \nApril 24, 1915, just as, a few days ago, we marked Holocaust \nRemembrance Day, bearing witness to the attempt by Nazi Germany to \ndestroy Europe's Jewish population.\n  Why do we mark these days? Because in recognizing and condemning the \nhorror of these acts, we affirm our own humanity, we ensure that the \nvictims of these atrocities will not be forgotten, and we warn those \nwho believe they can perpetrate similar crimes with impunity that they \nwill not escape the world's notice. We remind ourselves that we must \nnever again allow such mass assaults against human decency without \nacting to stop them. And we mark these atrocities because only by \nacknowledging the violence and inhumanity can we begin the process of \nreconciling populations who even today are haunted by the damage done \ndecades ago.\n  The Ottoman campaign against the Armenians resulted in the deaths of \nover 1.5 million people. Large numbers of Armenians fled their homeland \nto seek safety elsewhere, including in Michigan and other communities \nin the United States. Some have sought to deny that these events \nconstituted genocide, but the historical record is clear and \nundeniable. I ask any who deny the historical reality of the Armenian \ngenocide to read ``Giants of the Earth,'' the moving memoir of native \nDetroiter Mitch Kehetian and his search for the fate of beloved family \nmembers during the tragedy.\n  It is important for us to remember that these atrocities were not \ncommitted by the Republic of Turkey. I hope that the governments of \nTurkey and Armenia, encouraged by the good will of the community of \nnations, can heal the divisions that remain from long-ago events that \nnonetheless remain painful. We should also remember that Turkey played \na valuable role in supporting the international community's efforts to \nfree Libya from dictatorship and value the role Turkey is playing today \nin helping to resolve the tragedy unfolding in neighboring Syria.\n  It is doubly tragic that the Armenian genocide is now seen as the \nbeginning of a decades-long series of mass atrocities. The inability or \nunwillingness of the international community to come to the aid of the \nArmenians emboldened others--including Adolph Hitler, who told his \ncommanders on the eve of the invasion of Poland, ``Who, after all, \nspeaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?'' And so, he \nlaunched the Holocaust, ending the lives of six million Jews simply \nbecause they were Jewish.\n  All people would like to believe that they live in a more enlightened \nage, one in which we have overcome the inhumanity of the past. And yet \nour own time is not immune from mass atrocity. Recent events in Libya \nand Syria, to name just two, remind us that violence, oppression, and \ndisregard for human rights remain with us.\n  Just as mass atrocity is still with us, so are human courage and the \ndetermination to stand against atrocity. When the international \ncommunity came together to support the people of Libya against the \noppressive Libyan regime, we helped accomplish something important and \npowerful for Libyans, but beyond that, we sent a message to other \ndictators that they might not escape a response from the international \ncommunity.\n  I say ``might not'' because we still have a long way to go as a world \ncommunity in confronting murderous dictators. The current regime in \nSyria is engaged in a campaign of attack and intimidation against its \nown people. The examples of history make clear the international \ncommunity's obligation to speak out and to take action. It is \nunfortunate that nations in a position to do so, such as China and \nRussia, have blocked the United Nations from taking stronger steps. The \nUnited States and its allies must now seek to implement additional \nsteps to protect innocent civilians and hold the Assad regime in Syria \naccountable, including the possibility of establishing safe havens \nalong the border with Turkey.\n  While we mark these historic crimes, it is also important to \nrecognize signs of progress. It is significant that the United States \nis now taking what promises to be not just a stronger approach to mass \natrocities, but a more effective one. A presidential directive signed \nby President Obama last August states clearly: ``Preventing mass \natrocities and genocide is a core national security interest and a core \nmoral responsibility of the United States of America.'' And yesterday, \nthe President announced that he will implement the recommendations \nresulting from a comprehensive review of U.S. policy with regard to \nmass atrocity.\n  The creation of an Atrocity Prevention Board will ensure that \nprevention of these human tragedies is a focus of U.S. policy, a \nnational security interest we will pursue, bringing all appropriate \nelements of American policy and power to bear. Importantly, U.S. policy \nrecognizes that military action is not our only means to prevent mass \natrocity, and that every aspect of our international involvement--\nintelligence, diplomacy, economic and development policy, as well as, \nwhen called for, military power--can be called upon.\n  We cannot prevent the madness that, even in our era, too often leads \nto unspeakable crimes. But we can remember. We can speak out. And we \ncan act, with the range of instruments at our disposal, to prevent \nthose in the forefront of such madness from acting on their inhuman \nschemes. May Americans never forget the genocide visited upon the \nArmenians we remember today. And may our collective memories always \nremind us of our responsibility to prevent atrocity in our own time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/24/senate-section/article/S2652-2", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2652-S2653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 TIBET\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to draw the Senate's attention to \nthe ongoing, intensifying and intolerable oppression occurring in \nTibet.\n  Over the past year, at least 32 Tibetans, most of them young men and \nwomen, have set themselves on fire to protest Chinese policies that are \ninfringing on Tibetan self-governance, cultural traditions and \nreligious beliefs and practices. Of them, it is believed that at least \n23 have died. Eleven have self-immolated in the past 2 months alone. \nThese incidents do not represent a temporary deviation from a peaceful \nnorm but are instead the latest response to a tragic, and unfortunately\n\n[[Page S2653]]\n\nlengthy, history of religious and cultural controls, human rights \nviolations and oppression of the Tibetan people.\n  Reports from Tibet indicate that the Chinese government is further \nrestricting access to foreign journalists and tightening security \nthroughout the region. Chinese police and other officials in Tibet are \nforcing some nuns and monks to publicly denounce the Dalai Lama. \nSchools in some provinces have been forced by the government to switch \ntheir official language of instruction from Tibetan to Mandarin \nChinese. These policies, among others, have incited Tibetans to protest \nand fight for the survival of their cultural identity and basic \nfreedoms.\n  In recent weeks, a state-run Chinese website and news agency accused \nthe Dalai Lama of encouraging Tibetans to set themselves on fire and of \nadvocating ``Nazi'' racial policies. Mr. President, many of us in the \nSenate have had the privilege of meeting the Dalai Lama and I am proud \nto consider him a friend. It is baseless, offensive, and deplorable to \nslander the Dalai Lama in this way or to suggest that he is inciting \nviolence. He is a man whose entire life has been devoted to peace.\n  For decades, the Dalai Lama has sought to work with the Chinese \ngovernment to reach a peaceful resolution over Tibet's political \nstatus. The Dalai Lama has, time and time again, extended a hand of \nfriendship to Beijing, which has consistently responded by drastically \nmisrepresenting his views and accusing him of inciting violence, \nperhaps to draw attention away from their own brutal actions. The \nChinese government must know that violent crackdowns and cultural \ngenocide will never be condoned.\n  We share many interests with China and the future can bring our two \ncountries closer. China's tremendous economic transformation in the \npast few decades has brought great benefits to the Chinese people and \nhas spurred economic development in other countries. That said, the \neconomic emergence of China and its increased presence on the world \nstage must be accompanied by respect for human rights. China cannot be \na global leader while crushing peaceful dissent in its own backyard, \ndestroying the culture of the Tibetan people, and imprisoning Tibetan \nleaders.\n  I want to mention one of these imprisoned leaders, Tenzin Delek \nRinpoche. Tenzin Delek was recognized by the Dalai Lama as a \nreincarnate lama in the 1980s. He was detained in April 2002 on charges \nof exploding bombs and spreading politically charged leaflets and, \nfollowing a closed trial, sentenced to death on December 2, 2002. After \nappeal, Tenzin Delek's sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. No \nevidence of his involvement in any illegal activity has ever been made \npublic. In fact, before being detained, Tenzin Delek was well-known for \neducating children in rural areas and helping to build monasteries. \nTenzin Delek's imprisonment is just one of the many examples of \npersecution of Tibetan leaders that appear to be motivated by a desire \nto curb Tibetan religious and cultural expression.\n  Many Tibetan protestors, both imprisoned and free, are not seeking \nindependence from China. Tibetan leaders, including the Dalai Lama and \nthe Tibetan Prime Minister, Lobsang Sangay, who I was pleased to meet \nearlier this year, have explicitly stated that they support the Middle-\nWay' policy, which seeks autonomy for Tibet within the People's \nRepublic of China. Tibetans are not fighting for separation from China; \nthey are fighting for the freedom of religious belief guaranteed to \nthem by the Chinese Constitution. They are fighting for the security of \ntheir monks and monasteries. They are fighting for freedom of \nexpression, association, and assembly, for personal liberty, for \nunrestricted media access, and for the fundamental principles of \ndemocracy that we in the United States take for granted.\n  We cannot and will not abandon the Tibetan people, who have long been \nour unwavering friends. We will stand by them to protect the principles \nof democracy in the face of China's repressive policies. Together, the \nTibetans and the Chinese can peacefully reach a solution that meets the \nneeds and aspirations of both peoples. It is imperative that we support \npeaceful dialogue and discourage violent confrontation whenever it \noccurs, whether supported by the Chinese authorities or Tibetan \nprotestors.\n  I am a cosponsor of Senator Feinstein's resolution, S. Res. 356, A \nResolution Expressing Support for the People of Tibet, and I urge other \nSenators to do so. We can foster closer, cooperative relations with \nChina, but until China works with Tibetan leaders to pursue a new way \nforward, their reputation in the community of nations, and their \nability to act as a global power, will remain tarnished. I hope that, \nin the years to come, the young Tibetans who sacrificed their lives in \nthe past year will be remembered as the catalysts for a political \ndialogue that cemented a peaceful future for both Tibet and China.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/24/senate-section/article/S2653-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               97TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to solemnly recognize the \n97th anniversary of the Armenian genocide.\n  In 1948, the General Assembly of the United Nations passed the \nConvention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide \nbased in part on the horrific crimes perpetrated by the Ottoman Empire \nagainst the Armenian people between 1915 1923. Yet, in the 63 years \nthat have passed since the Convention was adopted, successive U.S. \nadministrations have refused to call the deliberate massacre of the \nArmenians by what it was--a genocide.\n  For many years, I have urged these administrations to right this \nterrible wrong, and I do so again today, calling on President Obama to \nacknowledge unequivocally--as he did as a Senator--that the Armenian \ngenocide is a widely documented fact supported by an overwhelming body \nof historical evidence.\n  The Armenian genocide--along with the Holocaust--is one the most \nstudied cases of genocide in history. A number of sovereign nations, \nranging from Argentina to France, as well as 43 U.S. States have \nrecognized what happened as genocide. Yet, successive U.S. \nadministrations continue only to refer to the Armenian genocide as \nannihilation, massacre or murder.\n  Every day that goes by without full acknowledgment by the United \nStates of these undeniable facts prolongs the pain felt by descendants \nof the victims and the entire Armenian community.\n  There is no room for discretion when dealing with unspeakable crimes \nagainst humanity; genocide must be called genocide, murder must be \ncalled murder. And every day that goes by without the U.S. \nacknowledgment of what happened to the Armenian people in the early \n20th century undermines the United States' role as a beacon for human \nrights around the world.\n  The United States' credibility is particularly important as we seek \nto compel international condemnation of and active response to those \nwho are perpetrating extreme violence today--whether it be in \nindividual cases of human rights abuses or in cases of government-\ndriven attacks against citizens protesting for greater freedom and \nopportunity.\n  The United States cannot and does not turn a blind eye to atrocities \naround the globe. In fact, the United States is often the first to \nspeak out in the face of violence and unspeakable suffering. But sadly, \nour Nation is on the wrong side of history when it comes to the \nArmenian genocide. It is long past time to do the right thing.\n  So this April 24, as we pause to remember the victims and to honor \nthe countless contributions Armenian Americans have made to our great \ncountry, I hope that the U.S. will finally and firmly stand on the \nright side of history and officially condemn the crimes of 1915 1923 by \ntheir appropriate name--genocide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/24/senate-section/article/S2653-2", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2653-S2654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        REMEMBERING GEORGE COWAN\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to speak about the \nlife of George Cowan who died last Friday in Los Alamos at the age of \n92.\n  From 1949 through 1988, he distinguished himself at the Los Alamos \nNational Laboratory where he was a scientist--a nuclear chemist--and a \nsenior administrator.\n  In 1984, he was instrumental in founding The Santa Fe Institute which \nhas achieved great recognition for its work in complexity and self-\norganizing systems.\n\n[[Page S2654]]\n\n  A Founding Director of the Los Alamos National Bank, he was one of \nthe several leaders in that community who labored to bring banking to a \ntown that was considered ``temporary'' and not deserving of its own \nbank. In 1963, LANB was chartered and has grown to be one of the \nleading financial institutions in New Mexico. At his death, George was \nstill serving on the Board of Directors.\n  George's interests and contributions are too numerous to detail in \nthese brief comments, but I will mention his passion to understand the \nkeys to the early development of children. He believed there were great \nbenefits society could reap by giving more attention to successful \nmodels of early childhood education.\n  George's life and work were invaluable to our Nation and to my home \nState of New Mexico. I was proud to count him as a friend, and prouder \nstill that he considered me one.

Make a Difference Day is a celebration of \nneighbors helping neighbors, and this annual day of service mobilizes \nmore than 3 million volunteers to effect change in their communities.\n  This group of outstanding volunteers from Yardley, PA is led by Neha \nGupta. Neha founded Empower Orphans, a non-profit organization that has \nleveraged $325,000 in donations and grants to clothe and feed Indian \nchildren, create a sewing center and set up libraries at four schools. \nNear to her home in Bucks County, PA, Neha, now 15, identified children \nin need.

Mr. President, today I wish to \nrecognize and honor the public service of Rick Lee Mossman, who is \nretiring from the National Park Service after 35 years of dedicated \nservice to protecting our nation's treasures and the people who visit \nthem.\n  Rick was born on April 30, 1955, to Dick and Carolyn Mossman in \nTopeka, KS. By the time he was 7 years old, Rick knew he wanted to \nbecome a park ranger. His life's work began in May of 1975, when he \nstarted his first job with the National Park Service as a seasonal GS 3 \ngeneral ranger at Buffalo National River in Arkansas. In a career \nspanning more than 3 decades, Rick Mossman served at nine National Park \nService units from Washington, DC to Alaska. During this time, he was \nan interpreter, front country and backcountry patrol ranger, a district \nranger, and finally a Chief Ranger at his current location of Wind Cave \nNational Park in South Dakota.\n  For the last 12 years, he has served on an All-Risk Incident \nManagement Team tasked with responding to disasters such as Hurricanes \nIsabel and Rita or to managing the search effort for lost hikers. He \nhas been the team's incident commander since September of 2009.\n  Rick earned a degree in Wildlife Biology at Kansas State University. \nHe and his wife Julie of 21 years have two sons, Thomas 18 and Jackson \n16.\n  Rick has passionately protected many of the special places that help \ndefine the United States of America. He has done this with a strong \nsense of dedication to duty and commitment to excellence. His work on \nthe Intermountain Incident Management Team speaks to this. When a \ndisaster befalls a National Park Service unit in the Intermountain \nRegion or elsewhere in the Nation, the first call from the Regional \nOffice is to Rick and his team to respond and help park service \nemployees in peril. It is this dedication to helping others at a \nmoment's notice that defines Rick's work ethic.\n  The focus of Rick's life work has been the protection of public lands \nand the resources contained therein. He has accomplished this duty with \nan intense love for the places he worked. It is because of the service \nof people like Rick Mossman that visitors, past and present and future, \nenjoy the scenic beauty and heritage that make up the National Park \nService.\n  I am proud to recognize and honor Rick's service to the National Park \nService and am delighted to join with his family and friends in \ncongratulating him on his retirement. I wish Rick and Julie all the \nbest as they begin a new chapter in their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/24/senate-section/article/S2654-3", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was ordered read the second time, and placed on \nthe calendar:\n\n       S. 2338.

Res. 432\n\n       Whereas many nations throughout the world, and especially \n     within the Western hemisphere, celebrate ``Dia de los \n     Ninos'', or ``Day of the Children'', on the 30th of April, in \n     recognition and celebration of their country's future--their \n     children;\n       Whereas children represent the hopes and dreams of the \n     people of the United States and children are the center of \n     families in the United States;\n       Whereas the people of the United States should nurture and \n     invest in children to preserve and enhance economic \n     prosperity, democracy, and the American spirit;\n       Whereas according to the 2010 Census report, there are more \n     than 50,000,000 individuals of Hispanic descent living in the \n     United States, more than 17,000,000 of those are children;\n       Whereas Hispanics in the United States, the youngest and \n     fastest growing ethnic community in the Nation, continue the \n     tradition of honoring their children on Dia de los Ninos, and \n     wish to share this custom with the rest of the Nation;\n       Whereas the primary teachers of family values, morality, \n     and culture are parents and family members, and we rely on \n     children to pass on family values, morals, and culture to \n     future generations;\n       Whereas the importance of literacy and education are most \n     often communicated to children through family members;\n       Whereas families should be encouraged to engage in family \n     and community activities that include extended and elderly \n     family members, and that encourage children to explore and \n     develop confidence;\n       Whereas the designation of a day to honor the children of \n     the United States will help affirm for the people of the \n     United States the significance of family, education, and \n     community;\n       Whereas the designation of a day of special recognition for \n     the children of the United States will provide an opportunity \n     for children to reflect on their future, to articulate their \n     aspirations, and to find comfort and security in the support \n     of their family members and communities;\n       Whereas the National Latino Children's Institute, serving \n     as a voice for children, has worked with cities throughout \n     the Nation to declare April 30, 2012, to be ``Dia de los \n     Ninos: Celebrating Young Americans'', a day to bring together \n     Hispanics and other communities nationwide to celebrate and \n     uplift children; and\n       Whereas the children of a nation are the responsibility of \n     all of its people, and people should be encouraged to \n     celebrate the gifts of children to society: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 30, 2012, as ``Dia de los Ninos: \n     Celebrating Young Americans''; and\n       (2) calls on the people of the United States to join with \n     all children, families, organizations, communities, churches, \n     cities, and States across the Nation to observe the day with \n     appropriate ceremonies, including activities that--\n       (A) center around children, and are free or minimal in cost \n     so as to encourage and facilitate the participation of all \n     people;\n       (B) are positive and uplifting, and help children express \n     their hopes and dreams;\n       (C) provide opportunities for children of all backgrounds \n     to learn about one another's cultures and to share ideas;\n       (D) include all members of the family, especially extended \n     and elderly family members, so as to promote greater \n     communication among the generations within a family, enabling \n     children to appreciate and benefit from the experiences and \n     wisdom of their elderly family members;\n       (E) provide opportunities for families within a community \n     to get acquainted; and\n       (F) provide children with the support they need to develop \n     skills and confidence, and to find the inner strength and the \n     will and fire of the human spirit to make their dreams come \n     true.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/24/senate-section/article/S2658-2", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2658-S2659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 433--DESIGNATING APRIL 2012 AS ``NATIONAL CHILD ABUSE \n                           PREVENTION MONTH''\n\n  Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Kerry) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 434\n\n       Whereas Alzheimer's disease is the sixth leading cause of \n     death in the United States;\n       Whereas Alzheimer's disease is the only disease among the \n     10 leading causes of death in the United States that lacks a \n     means of prevention or a cure, and the progression of which \n     cannot be slowed;\n       Whereas more than 5,000,000 people in the United States \n     suffer from Alzheimer's disease;\n       Whereas, in 2011, 15,200,000 family members and friends \n     provided 17,400,000,000 hours of unpaid care valued at \n     $210,500,000,000 to patients with Alzheimer's disease and \n     other dementias;\n       Whereas, by the year 2050, as many as 15,000,000 people in \n     the United States will have Alzheimer's disease if scientists \n     do not make progress in the prevention or treatment of the \n     disease;\n       Whereas the Federal Government spent an estimated \n     $140,000,000,000 under the Medicare and Medicaid programs to \n     care for patients with Alzheimer's disease in 2011;\n       Whereas spending relating to the treatment of Alzheimer's \n     disease under the Medicare and Medicaid programs is projected \n     to be more than $850,000,000,000 per year, in 2012 dollars, \n     by the year 2050;\n       Whereas scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer's \n     disease have already identified--\n       (1) more than 100 genes linked to Alzheimer's disease;\n       (2) biomarkers to identify the people who are at risk for \n     Alzheimer's disease; and\n       (3) other promising leads in gene, protein, and drug \n     therapies to benefit people who have Alzheimer's disease or \n     are at risk for developing the disease;\n       Whereas an emphasis on early diagnosis, workforce training, \n     education, and support for patients and the families of \n     patients, as well as other programs and initiatives \n     spearheaded by State and local governments, advocacy \n     organizations, doctors, hospitals, and long-term care \n     facilities, are already making a difference in reducing the \n     burden of Alzheimer's disease for patients, families, and \n     communities;\n       Whereas the National Alzheimer's Project Act (Public Law \n     111 375; 124 Stat. 4100), which Congress passed unanimously \n     on December 15, 2010 and President Barack Obama signed into \n     law on January 4, 2011, required the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services to create the first National Plan to Address \n     Alzheimer's Disease, and established the Advisory Council on \n     Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services to assist the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services in this task;\n       Whereas, shortly after the National Alzheimer's Project Act \n     was enacted, the Department of Health and Human Services \n     created the Interagency Group on Alzheimer's Disease and \n     Related Dementias to inform the National Plan to Address \n     Alzheimer's Disease;\n       Whereas, in formulating the draft National Plan to Address \n     Alzheimer's Disease, the Department of Health and Human \n     Services, the Interagency Group on Alzheimer's Disease and \n     Related Dementias, and the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's \n     Research, Care, and Services focused on 3 main topics, long-\n     term services and support, clinical care, and research;
