Mr. President, this morning we will immediately resume \nconsideration of the Internet tax moratorium bill. Last night, many \ncolleagues remained in the Chamber to debate the underlying legislation \nand an amendment that we hope will be offered shortly--as a matter of \nfact, most of the same Senators are already here this morning and are \nprepared to resume this important debate. We will proceed with that \nshortly.\n  We do want to take a moment to comment on the schedule. Today, it is \nmy expectation to have votes on the Internet tax moratorium and to \nfinish that bill. The tax moratorium expired last week, and I believe \nit is important for us to work through any amendments and vote on \npassage of that bill today. With the cooperation of all Senators, we \nwill be able to complete our work on this bill at an early hour this \nafternoon.\n  It would also be my intent to begin consideration of the Commerce-\nJustice-State appropriations bill as soon as possible. We must continue \nto make steady progress on these appropriation bills in order to \ncomplete our work by November 21. Senators can expect votes throughout \nthe morning and afternoon as we work through the end of the Internet \ntax bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/07/senate-section/article/S14227-6", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14227-S14228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 2799\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time \ndetermined by the majority leader, after consultation with the \nDemocratic leader, the Senate proceed to the consideration of H.R. \n2799, the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask the \nmajority leader--we have, of course, Senator Hollings, the ranking \nmember of the subcommittee, who has asked, at what time do you propose \ngoing to that, today or at some other time?\n  Mr. FRIST. The plan would be to go to it after we finish the Internet \ntax bill. So we would like to go to that bill today. If it is very \nlate, of course, we will start early Monday morning.\n  Mr. REID. I respectfully say to my distinguished friend that we are \nnot going to finish the Internet tax bill today. I guess we can finish \nit by taking it off the floor. On our side there are a significant \nnumber of amendments, and we know there are some on your side. Simply, \nI ask the leader what time does he propose, in effect, that we have had \nenough talk on the Internet tax bill, because it is not going to be \ncompleted today.N O T I C E\n\nEffective January 1, 2004, the subscription price of the \nCongressional Record will be $503 per year or $252 for six months. \nIndividual issues may be purchased at the following costs: Less \nthan 200 pages, $10.50; Between 200 and 400 pages, $21.00; Greater \nthan 400 pages, $31.50.

JAMES, Public Printer.\n[[Page S14228]]\n\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Again, people were here very late last night. I encourage \nthe managers to do everything humanly possible to finish the Internet \ntax bill. If, after aggressive work, we cannot do that, then we can \nmake a decision. By the end of today, I would like to lay down the \nCommerce-Justice-State appropriations bill. If that is the case, I \nwould plan on going to that on Monday. We can talk about the \nappropriate time. For us to finish our work, we have to keep moving, \nand it is important to lay down that bill today.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the majority leader we want to \ncooperate. We have tried to do that on these appropriations bills, and \nwe will cooperate on Commerce-State-Justice. But until there is some \ndetermination made when we are going to go off the Internet tax, I am \ngoing to object.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I point out that we went on to the \nInternet tax moratorium bill last night with the anticipation of \namendments being proposed and votes starting this morning--stacked \nvotes. That is what we usually do on a Thursday evening. Whether that \nis a good idea or a bad one, it is a very common practice. We had \nanticipated at least three amendments and then stacked votes this \nmorning and moving forward with the bill.\n  Then, I was told later in the evening there would be one amendment \nthat would be proposed and we would stack it for this morning; and not \ntoo late last night, the sponsors of the amendment said they were going \nto file the amendment and debate it this morning.\n  With all due respect, that is not the way we usually do business \nhere. We tell people what we are going to do and go with their word and \nmove forward. I think we need to get this done because the Internet tax \nmoratorium has expired. If we don't want the Internet tax moratorium to \nprevail, that is a decision to be made by the body. We should make the \ndecision. I hope the majority leader will stick with his comments. \nThere are not that many items of dispute on the Internet tax \nmoratorium. It has been debated on several occasions in past years. So \nI hope relevant amendments--and I don't think there are more than two \nor three, to be honest--are offered and we can move forward with those \nwith a reasonable debate time and dispose of this today, understanding \nthat all Members have the problem of scheduling and want to leave.\n  So I urge the cooperation of all Members so we can dispose of \nimportant amendments and move forward. I see my colleague from North \nDakota who is ready to speak. I wish he had been here last night to \nspeak. We could have done an amendment and debated it. Instead, we put \nit off for this morning, which I hope will make comments more \nabbreviated so we can move to the substance of the amendment and \npassage of the bill.\n  I thank the leader and I appreciate his commitment to try to get this \ndone today.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, let me close this out and then we can turn \nto the bill. I ask all of our colleagues to spend the appropriate time \nand do our best to cooperate to finish this important bill, which I \ntried very hard to finish last week with the understanding that we \nwould bring it up this week and we would finish it this week. We cannot \npoint fingers on either side of the aisle because there are challenges \non both sides of the aisle. I ask this in order for us to finish the \nNation's business.\n  Last night on the floor--I know we have the Syria accountability bill \nand Military Construction, which we are going to get. The problem is \nthat we have to finish the business we have on the floor. We have to \ncontinue the appropriations process as we go forward, and we cannot do \nit unless people come together and understand there is an urgency that \nrequires cooperation.\n  I go back to my original comments. I understand there is objection to \ngoing to Commerce-Justice-State. I will continue to discuss that as the \nday goes forward. I would like to lay that down today at some point.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/07/senate-section/article/S14228-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.J.

Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in response to the distinguished chairman of \nthe Commerce Committee, people worked here late last night. No one \nshould criticize anyone for not being here later. I left around 10 \no'clock. There may have been a quorum call, but very few. There were \ngood, strong, substantive speeches given on this issue. No one can be \ncriticized, especially my friend from North Dakota, for not being here \nlast night. He was here all during the day yesterday and offered a \nnumber of amendments to the Agriculture appropriations bill. My friend \nfrom North Dakota might be criticized for some things, but one of them \nis certainly not that he doesn't work hard. He works as hard as anyone \nin the Senate.\n  I also say to the distinguished majority leader, I did last night \nspend a few minutes indicating and asking why we are not doing the \nSyria accountability bill and Military Construction. It is obvious--and \nwe should stop feigning--we have a problem here. The problem is there \nhas been a decision made to spend 30 hours next week on a circus \ntalking about judges--168 to 4.\n  I am not going to object to this, other than to say let's be \nrealistic here. There are games being played, and we don't want to be \npart of those games. We want to cooperate. Military Construction should \npass now, rather than getting into next week when there is some effort \nto stop it. That can be passed by a unanimous consent agreement right \nnow.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator from Nevada yield?\n  Mr. REID. I don't have the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I hope we can get things done here. There is \nso much to be done. I said last night, and I spoke from the heart, \npeople in Nevada at our military bases, Fallon and Ellis, need this \nMilitary Construction bill passed. I don't know why we are not going to \ndo it today. If it is brought up next Monday or Tuesday,\n\n[[Page S14229]]\n\nnothing is going to happen on it, so let's get that done.\n  The Syria Accountability bill--I understand what is going on here. \nThere is an effort made so there will be a vote Monday night on Syria \nAccountability because there is a time limit on it. If that is the \ncase, fine. Remember, this is an important piece of legislation that \nrequires our immediate attention. I don't think we should be doing \nthings that take away for 1 minute our going into Syria's \naccountability, supporting the Hezbollah, and all the other activities \nthey do that simply are not appropriate.\n  We are in a situation where we have bills that need to be passed and \nconference reports that need to be approved. It is not going to happen \nfor reasons I don't understand.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague from Arizona, I know, did not \nintend to think that if I were here last night, I would have advanced \nthe cause of his legislation. I have no amendment to offer to the \nlegislation. I had an opportunity yesterday to speak on several \namendments. I think he probably inartfully described his angst about \nlast evening. I didn't cause this legislation to be delayed. I am sure \nhe knows that.\n  Aside from that, I wonder if the Senator from Nevada will tell me \nabout the urgency of legislation on the floor. The majority leader \nexpresses an interest in moving this Senate along on legislation we \nneed to get done. I am pretty unimpressed with the plea to do that when \nwe understand that next week we are going to find nearly 2 days taken \nin a carnival situation with judgeships, when we have approved 98 \npercent of the judges who have been sent to us by the White House.\n  Now, in the middle of next week, as we try to finish this session, we \nare told we are going to have 30 hours, or take the better part of 2 \ndays, to sit here around the clock to talk about the several judges we \nhave not confirmed. I ask the Senator from Nevada if that seems to him \nlike we have an urgent situation when somebody is going to take 30 \nhours out of the middle of next week and move off to have a 30-hour \ndiscussion on judgeships.\n  I am pretty unimpressed with the plea for cooperation and expedited \nprocedures on these issues as long as somebody is going to take nearly \n2 days out of the middle of next week to do something that has nothing \nto do with moving appropriations bills.\n  As I ask the question, I wish to make an additional comment. I am an \nappropriator as well. I am not very impressed with what has happened. \nWe were supposed to have done the appropriations bills and finished by \nOctober 1. We have been off and on appropriations bills. Look, if this \nis a priority, let's get on appropriations bills and stay on \nappropriations bills. That is what we ought to do. Isn't that the case, \nI ask my friend from Nevada?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to respond to my friend's question. As I \nindicated earlier, to my knowledge, no one works harder in the Senate \nthan the Senator from North Dakota. He is an appropriator and \nauthorizer, understanding from his long years in Congress, both in the \nHouse and the Senate, that the last few weeks and days of a legislative \nsession can become very intense. That is why I am at a total, absolute \nloss to understand how we could do this. We have been told; we heard it \non the news--I went home last night and my wife said it was on the news \nat 6 o'clock Wednesday night until 12 o'clock Thursday night, we are \ngoing to be on the Senate floor listening to a discussion of what bad \nlegislators we are because we haven't approved 100 percent of the \njudges the President has requested--168 to 4--and we have been told \nthey are going to bring up another failed nominee, Priscilla Owen, next \nweek.\n\n  I understand they are also going to bring up a woman by the name of \nKuhl from California and a woman by the name of Brown from California. \nI don't know if this is an effort to try to somehow embarrass the two \nDemocratic--\n  Mr. McCAIN. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  Mr. REID.--Senators from California or what the reason might be.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator yield for a parliamentary \ninquiry?\n  Mr. REID. For a parliamentary inquiry? I will be happy to do that, \nwithout losing my right to the floor. Yes.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have a parliamentary inquiry: Wouldn't \nrule XVIIII 1(b) begin to apply concerning proceedings while \nlegislation is before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct. Under the procedures of \nthe Senate, there would be a warning issued to Senators speaking on \nmatters other than the business before the Senate in the first 3 hours.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate that very much. I appreciate my \nfriend from Arizona bringing that to my attention. What I am going to \ntalk about for a while is the Internet tax problem. Internet tax is a \ndifficult situation, of course. It is something with which we need to \ndeal. We understand there is some confusion as to what we are really \ndealing with. Some believe it has something to do with sales tax. This \nlegislation does not. It deals with access.\n  It is a very important issue, but it seems to me this matter could be \nresolved in a matter of minutes. I am told the Presiding Officer's \namendment, in effect, would extend the present law for a couple years. \nIt is my understanding the distinguished Senator from Alaska has \nsuggested this be extended for 2 years and, if I am not mistaken, there \nare others who believe it should be extended for 2 years.\n  I believe that should happen. I hope we will extend this for a couple \nyears and then during that period of time make a determination as to \nwhether the legislation that is now before the Senate should be \nimplemented. I understand that.\n  Also, one of the real problems we have is this schedule, which makes \nit very difficult to deal with this legislation. My friend from Arizona \nsuggested we deal with relevant amendments. This is not going to happen \nin this present atmosphere. There will certainly be efforts made to \noffer not only relevant amendments, but, I would assume, maybe some \nnongermane amendments. I don't know that to be the case, but I assume \nso because we have so few opportunities to amend different pieces of \nlegislation as they come through.\n  On appropriations bills, we have been cooperating the best we can. As \nI indicated last night, we have done everything we can to make sure we \ndid not have amendments that were offered to appropriations bills that \nwould slow down the process. We have worked very hard in doing that.\n  I am not going to talk for a long time this morning.\n  I have no intention of interfering this morning with people's \nschedules. I know there are a lot of schedules that we have to move \nalong. I want to do that. People have airplane schedules to meet on \nFriday. We were told yesterday that there would not be anything after \n12 today. At least people on our side made arrangements that that \nwould, in fact, be the case. If there is some change, we need to know \nabout that.\n  I am happy that we got the CR passed. I look forward at a later time \ntoday to cooperate and agree to bringing forth Commerce-State-Justice. \nWe want to do that at the appropriate time. Until there is some \ndecision made on how long we are going to be involved on the Internet \ntax situation, we are not going to be able to give that consent.\n  Finally, responding to my friend from North Dakota in a very brief \nway, what is taking place here is something that I have never seen in \nthe many years--more than two decades--I have served in the Congress, \nthat we would have in the late days of a legislative session this \ncarnival, as the Senator from North Dakota referred to it--this circus, \nas I referred to it--and that is what the American people will think of \nit.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I believe the Senators from Tennessee and \nDelaware have an amendment filed. We are ready to consider that \namendment or other amendments, if Senators have amendments that they \nwould bring them to the floor so we can move forward with legislation.\n\n[[Page S14230]]\n\n  I mention to my friend from North Dakota, who is an articulate and \npassionate defender of his point of view on the Internet tax issue, the \nreason why I mentioned his absence last night was I meant he would have \ncontributed a good deal to the debate and discussion given his many \nyears of involvement in this issue, which I have always enjoyed, not \nonly on that issue but on numerous others.\n  So I would ask if our colleagues would file their amendments, bring \nthem forward, as well as amendments that may be applicable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me weigh in here by acknowledging \nthe mistake we made in the Commerce Committee. In light of that \nstatement, let me first commend our colleague from Oregon, Senator \nWyden. His intent is good. We followed it. We supported it in the \nCommerce Committee. We made certain that the Internet was allowed to \nexpand and progress without any tax burden. In that light, we passed \nthe temporary moratorium. The intent of the Commerce Committee, when we \nreported this measure that is now before us, was to make permanent that \nmoratorium with respect to individual taxes.\n  What occurred in reporting was that we realized there was a certain \nlanguage difficulty there. The fact is that the CBO today cannot \nschedule or account for that language on the budgetary impact. We knew \nthat shortly after the reporting. It was all reported out on a verbal \nvote. We said this is going to the Finance Committee. They have tax \nexperts and they will clean up our act for us and get the intent of the \nfull committee and the Congress to continue and make permanent this \nmoratorium.\n  The fact is, under the present language, the moratorium extends not \njust to the individual consumer, but it goes the entire way down the \npipeline as a tax exemption, thereby invading the power of the States \nto tax or not tax; thereby becoming, as the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. \nAlexander, says, an unfunded mandate. So now we have before us not the \nintent of the Congress at all.\n  I recently was in China, and I can tell you we do not have to worry \nabout trying to control the Internet. It is not with taxes that the \nChinese are trying to control the Internet and its usage, expansion, \nand its progress. On the contrary, they are trying by law to control \nit, and they cannot. That cat is out of the bag and it is going to \ngrow.\n  The fundamental problem is just what the Senator from Tennessee has \nspotted. We have now invaded States and the locals and their taxing \npower, and that is not right. Right is right and wrong is wrong, and we \nmade a mistake. Over the horizon, some of these corporate America \ngiants are piggybacked. They said, oh, now look at what we have. If we \ncan get in on this kind of extension, we will do away with some $4 \nbillion to $8 billion in taxes. Of course, they are not passing it on \nto the consumer. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the expansion or \nthe progress and success of the Internet. That is what we have \nconfronting us.\n  In that light, the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Carper, and the Senator \nfrom Tennessee, Mr. Alexander, have gotten together an amendment that \nthe distinguished Chair has joined in, and this Senator from South \nCarolina has joined in, so that we can pass this bill and extend it. \nThat is what we all want to do. We like the present law and that is \nwhat we in the Commerce Committee thought we were doing, we were \nprotecting consumers by extending the present law to make it permanent. \nWe could then send that over to the House side, and if we can send that \nto the House, we can dispose of this knotty problem and move on to more \nimportant legislation.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from North Dakota for handling this \nbill. Once again, I wish to acknowledge the leadership of Senator Wyden \nfrom Oregon. He has led us on this Internet effort for a long period of \ntime. He has made absolutely certain that the Internet continues to \nprogress and succeed. We cannot come in now and tell the States how to \ntax and what to tax and not to tax.\n  We are not trying to give a tax cut to corporate America. We want to \nmake sure there is not a tax increase to consumers on the Internet. \nThat is what the present law did until it expired a few days ago, and \nthat is what ought to be extended and made permanent.\n  I thank the Senator from North Dakota for handling this measure and \nagain commend my colleague on the committee, Senator Wyden, for his \nleadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am going to be brief. I have appreciated \nthe distinguished Senator from South Carolina working with me on this \nover the years.\n  The distinguished Senator from South Carolina is absolutely right. \nThe committee bill did the job right. The committee bill kept in place \nthe technological neutrality that we have established over the years--\nthe Senator from South Carolina, Senator Stevens, who has now left the \nfloor, Chairman McCain, and others. The reason we did that years ago is \nthat we did not have technological neutrality. The Internet was subject \nto taxes that were not subject to other areas, such as the snail mail \ndelivery of papers.\n  What has happened, however, is under the substitute that is being \noffered by the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander, we \nget away from the competitive neutrality that the distinguished Senator \nfrom South Carolina has been advocating.\n  I want to be very specific about how that is being done, because I \nthink a lot of Members believe that if they vote for the proposal by \nthe Senator from Tennessee that it is somehow a safe vote, that all \nthey are doing is continuing the status quo and it is really kind of an \ninnocuous approach. It is not a safe vote. It is a vote to increase \ntaxes.\n  I want to be very specific in explaining how that is the case. What \nhas happened as a result of changes in technology over the last few \nyears is you now have, in a number of jurisdictions, DSL--Internet \naccess through DSL being taxed but Internet access through cable modems \nnot being taxed. That is what has happened as a result of the changes \nin technology and the various changes in government policy. So you \nalready have been moving away from the competitive neutrality we have \nsought with respect to this issue.\n  Let me repeat that. Today, Internet access through DSL is being taxed \nin a number of jurisdictions and Internet access through cable modem \ncan't be taxed anywhere.\n  Unfortunately, what would happen under the proposal of the Senator \nfrom Tennessee is that you would make it easier to continue that \ncompetitive disadvantage and, particularly under the proposal of the \nSenator from Tennessee, it would be easier to tax wireless Blackberry \nservices.\n  I am of the view that with 391 separate taxes on telecommunications \nadministered in 10,000 different jurisdictions, people across America \nwho have these Blackberrys, which have wireless Internet access, would \nbe subject to scores of new taxes.\n  So I say to colleagues who are looking at this issue and thinking \nthat somehow the idea of a 2-year proposal is kind of an innocuous safe \nhaven and really not a tax increase--I ask them to think about what it \nis going to mean for Blackberry users across the country.\n  These are wireless devices. In a number of jurisdictions where \nInternet access is obtained through DSL, those services are already \nbeing taxed. That would be expanded under the 2-year alternative.\n  What I would like us to do is what I believe we sought to do 5 years \nago when Senator Hollings, Senator McCain, and others got together, and \nthat is to ensure strict neutrality with respect to technology. The \nInternet wouldn't get a preference; the Internet wouldn't be hurt. The \nproblem now that wireless users are facing with respect to DSL will be \ncompounded if this 2-year alternative goes forward. I hope my \ncolleagues will reject it for the reasons I outlined this morning.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, shortly the sponsors will be proposing an\n\n[[Page S14231]]\n\namendment. In the meantime, I ask to speak as in morning business for 4 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. McCain are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Let me say about this bill, no matter the merit of it, I \nknow people feel very strongly about it. The Senator from Tennessee, \nwho was here in the Chamber a few minutes ago, the Senator from Ohio, \nMr. Voinovich, the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Allen, the distinguished \nSenator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden--they have strong feelings about this. \nTheir views do not coincide. I know how strong their feelings are.\n  But this legislation, with all due respect to the distinguished \nchairman of the Commerce Committee, isn't going to go anywhere today or \nMonday or Tuesday. I think there should be some effort made to resolve \nthe issue. I am a member of the Commerce Committee. I don't understand \nall the issues, but I understand the issues on this floor and nothing \nis going to happen.\n  I would say to the majority that if they are looking for votes today, \nthey would be better off looking for votes to pass the most important \npiece of legislation that I see that we could vote on quickly, and that \nwould be the vote on the conference report dealing with Military \nConstruction. We could vote on that. We could have a vote with debate \nequally divided with 5 minutes each. We could pass it. We could go to \nthe Syria Accountability Act. We agreed last night to reduce our time. \nThere are 90 minutes. We have agreed to take one hour half each and \ndivide it up, as we indicated last night, several different ways. It \nseems to me we could do that, and we could be out of here by 12 o'clock \nafter 2 very important votes.\n\n  Let me tell you what the problem is. There is an effort made so we \nhave something to do on Monday and Tuesday. I say to everyone that as a \nresult of the carnival which is going to be started at 6 o'clock on \nWednesday, nothing is going to happen Monday and Tuesday of any \nsignificance. There may be a vote on the Syria Accountability Act \nbecause it would be an easy vote to get up. They may bring up Military \nConstruction, and they may say, Isn't it too bad that the minority, the \nDemocrats, aren't allowing us to pass Military Construction. But \nremember: I have offered numerous times over several days to take this \nup by unanimous consent. So all the pleas of sorrow and concern next \nweek about our not taking care of our military officers around the \ncountry certainly will speak volumes because it simply is without any \nfoundation because we can do that right here.\n  We are on the Internet tax bill. One of the things we need to talk \nabout on this Internet tax bill is the importance of judges. Judges \nenforce these laws. We have been involved in passing out of this Senate \n168 judges. We have turned down four. If the Internet tax measure is \nworth talking about, why don't we just move a little bit to the 30 \nhours which is going to begin next Wednesday and start talking about \njudges today? That is fine. I don't see any reason why we should not do \nthat.\n  We can talk about the record that was set and that we have the lowest \nvacancy rate in the judiciary in some 15 years. Is it necessary because \nwe have the lowest rate in some 15 years to spend 30 hours--2 days of \nthe Senate's time--talking about judges in the circus atmosphere that \nwill be there? It is all planned. It is going to be quite a show. It \nhas all been laid out in the press. They are going to have all 51 \nRepublicans here, and that way it will be very easy to discern whether \nor not there is a quorum present.\n  I am gathering my thoughts.\n  We will have a lot of time to spend on Internet tax.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you very much. I appreciate very much bringing the \nSenate to order.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am sorry to say the Senate is still not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the point is if there needs to be a \ndiscussion on judges, we don't have to wait until Wednesday at 6 \no'clock. We can start talking right now on this legislation because \njudges have to enforce the law. It is a law we are talking about. They \nhave to do it on a trial level and they have to do it on an appellate \nlevel.\n  We have given this President 98 percent of the judges he wants--98 \npercent of the judges he wants. People talk about the Constitution. We \ncan talk about the Constitution also. The majority makes these \nstatements that a filibuster is a brand new thing; it has never \nhappened with judges; isn't it a terrible thing this is happening in \nthe Senate. Of course, it is without foundation. There is no truth to \nit. Filibusters have taken place on previous occasions, and it will \ntake place again long after we are gone.\n\n  To think we have to wait until Wednesday to talk about judges--we \ndon't have to wait until Wednesday. We can talk now. This is a \ncomplicated piece of legislation. Don't you think we are going to need \njudges to interpret the law? Of course we are. The record we have is \npretty good. Do you think the advise-and-consent clause of the \nConstitution meant every judge the President suggested to us we just \napprove them? Would the President be happy if we had 100 percent of his \njudges? How about 99 percent or 99.5 percent? Ninety-eight percent \nisn't good enough. It is not good enough, so now we are going to spend \n30 hours talking about why it shouldn't be 98 percent, it should be 100 \npercent. I don't know what the proper ratio is the President wants.\n  I am just giving everyone a little idea that we don't have to wait \nuntil Wednesday at 6 o'clock to talk about judges. We will talk about \nthem now. I am proud of what we have done here in the Senate dealing \nwith judges.\n  I am glad Miguel Estrada was not confirmed. He wouldn't answer the \nquestions. He wouldn't allow us to look at his memoranda when he was at \nthe Solicitor's Office.\n  I am glad we did not approve Priscilla Owen who the President's own \nattorney, Mr. Gonzales, said was not a good judge when he served with \nher in the Texas Supreme Court.\n  I am glad that twice we did not approve William Pryor from Alabama \nwho is an embarrassment to the State of Nevada and this country and \nshouldn't be a judge.\n  We have approved 168 judges. That is how many we have approved.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Nevada yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if perhaps next week when the other side wishes \nto take 30 hours in the middle of the week to talk about the handful of \njudges--I believe the four who have not been confirmed by the Senate--I \nwonder if perhaps we should not take the time next week to talk \nindividually about the 168 we have confirmed. Perhaps we ought to go \nthrough each one and talk about all 168.\n  If time is not the issue--if the majority leader says time is urgent \nto talk about all of these other bills but in the middle of next week \nthey will use 30 hours to come to the floor and talk about the 4 who \nhave not been confirmed--perhaps we ought to take 60 hours to talk \nabout the 168 we have confirmed.\n  Let us move on the things that matter now and scuttle the 30 hours \nnext week and this 30-hour discussion of the handful of judges who have \nnot been approved. That doesn't make any sense to me.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will my friend from Nevada yield for another \nparliamentary inquiry?\n  Mr. REID. In just a minute.\n  The Internet bill which we are talking about here on the Senate floor \nis an important piece of legislation. I was present last night and \nlistened to the statements of the Senator from Oregon. The Senator from \nOregon understands legislation. He understands the importance of this \nInternet tax bill. He understands the definition of access. He \nunderstands what unfunded mandates mean, which was talked about by the \nSenator from Tennessee at such great length. I think it is important we \nunderstand this Internet tax bill. It deals with some very important \nissues. It is a bill that seeks to protect the\n\n[[Page S14232]]\n\nInternet access from taxation. As the lines between the Internet and \nthe media continue to blur, there is some concern the law could lead to \nStates losing some of their existing tax base over time. For example, \nsome long distance telephone traffic is now carried on the Internet. \nMovies, videos, and music programming can be downloaded onto the \nInternet as well as being viewed over cable and broadcast media.\n\n  I say to everyone within the sound of my voice someone needs to \ninterpret this law. If we pass something here, we will need someone to \ninterpret this law.\n  I know this is Friday morning and there is a lot to do. But I simply \nwanted everyone to know this sham, this scam, this circus, this \ncarnival that is going to begin on Wednesday at 6 o'clock is just as I \nhave described it. What we are going to do, as the Senator from North \nDakota indicated, if you want to talk about 4 judges, or maybe add 2 \nmore or 6, is we will talk about 168. We are happy to do that.\n  I know I could talk a lot longer. I understand the Pastore rule. I \nhave a lot of stuff which I could talk about--the Internet tax, and \nweave in the judges, but as kind of a relief to everybody, I am going \nto sit down for the time being.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada, who \nunderstands parliamentary procedures as well as anyone.\n  There are some discussions going on about some agreement that might \nbe reached on this issue with some of my colleagues. I hope we can make \nprogress on that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have not spoken on this issue this \nmorning. This is a very important issue. I have been a supporter of the \nmoratorium. I have supported the initial moratorium and the extension \nof the moratorium and will support again a moratorium. As far as I am \nconcerned, it could be permanent if the proposition is, let us not tax \nthe connection to the Internet. That was the presumption from the \nstart. Let us not retard the growth of this industry. Let us not allow \nStates to create some special tax that could be discriminatory or \npunitive with respect to the Internet itself.\n  Having said that, it is very important we create a definition that is \nappropriate. We have a current law. That current law could just be \nextended. Some of my colleagues say, if you just extend that and do not \ndo anything about the circumstance with DSL, then you have an \nunfairness. That is something I understand and I am certainly willing \nto deal with that. But if we do not deal with the issue of how you \ninterpret or how you describe what it is you are exempting, you can \nhave serious financial problems. We are talking about billions of \ndollars' worth of problems for State and local governments.\n  When we passed this moratorium out of the Commerce Committee, my \ncolleague, Senator Hollings, was absolutely correct. We passed it out, \nI believe, 31 to 0. But we did it by saying we understand the \ndefinition of what is going to be exempted is not yet right. There is \ngreat controversy about it. So we will move this bill to the Senate but \nwill work on solving the problem of the definition and what it means \nand its consequences before we get to the Senate. We tried very hard to \ndo that but regrettably that has not been done. I want people to \nunderstand the framework in which this comes to the floor. Yes, the \nCommerce Committee passed it 31 to 0, but with the caveat that the \ndefinition of what is exempt is not yet solved or at least not yet \nagreed. So between then and now we have tried hard to see if we could \nfix that. At this point, it is not yet fixed.\n  Mr. BURNS. If the Senator will yield on that point, 9 times out of \n10, whenever we get in trouble in this body it is in dealing with \ndefinitions up front. That is our problem now.\n  I know they are trying to work out some way over there to define \ncertain parts of this, but there has to be something between the \namendment pending and where we want to go. We are all in agreement that \nin this industry, when the moratorium was first put on--to allow this \nindustry, this industry that was a baby industry, to build out--what we \ndid was right. The second time we extended it was the right thing to \ndo. We have seen an explosion in an industry.\n  There are, however, some sections that are discriminatory. There were \nsome loopholes found by the States. So we have an inequitable situation \ndue to definition.\n  I hope the parties can work this out to the satisfaction of the \nintent of the Commerce Committee when we passed it the first time, when \nwe extended it the second time, and now when we want to extend it \nanother time.\n  Maybe status quo is not exactly right. But nonetheless, it is \nsomething we have to work on. The Senator from North Dakota and the \nSenator from South Carolina have a point that we have not worked on the \ndefinition and how it will be determined or defined in the taxing \nentities of the States, or even, for that matter, counties and cities.\n\n  I appreciate the Senator from North Dakota allowing me this time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I agree with that view expressed by \nSenator Burns.\n  Let me continue by saying definitions are everything. The reason the \nStates are very concerned is if the definition is not correct--that is, \nif it is not specific in exactly what Congress proposes--we could see \nbillions and billions of dollars lost to the State and local \ngovernments in revenue they otherwise would have expected.\n  We have a situation where we have a moratorium that expired. The \nmoratorium ought to be extended. I was prepared to extend it \npermanently if we could find a definition that would be acceptable. \nThat has not yet proven to be the case. Some are now discussing, and I \nwas in some discussions a few moments ago, about a shorter term \nextension, perhaps 4 years, and use the definition that exists in \ncurrent law in the moratorium that expired November 1 and try to fix \nthe position with respect to DSL, which is a problem. I don't know how \nthis will come out, but we have a responsibility to try to get this \nright. We would not want to do something permanently that has a problem \nattached to it, that will be a growing problem for State and local \ngovernments.\n  Let me describe something that was in the newspaper recently because \nit tells the dilemma we face if we get this wrong. We have been moving \nin information technology from the old circuit switch telephone network \nto an Internet-based network. Whether we communicate by voice, e-mail, \nwireless, instant message, the data is being transmitted over the \nInternet in digital packets.\n  If anyone wonders what I mean, look at a story in the Minneapolis \nStar and Tribune. It is Quest Corporation announcing this past week \nthat it will roll out an Internet-based telephone service in Minnesota. \nIt describes that. That is the Internet-based service called VoIP, \nVoice Over Internet Protocol. They say the approach to moving this out \nover the Internet--that is, telephone service over the Internet--will \nsave on regulatory expenses and other costs and break the regulatory \nlogjam that exists. The article goes on to say:\n\n       The Quest Internet phone service would also be exempt from \n     salestax if Congress, as expected, extended and expands a tax \n     ban on Internet access to include Internet telephone service.\n\n  You can see the consequences. If you do not understand exactly what \nyou are doing and you have a definition that is not articulate and not \nfocused exactly on what you intend to accomplish, we can have very \nsignificant consequences for State and local governments.\n  Let me end where I started by saying I happen to have supported both \nof the previous moratoriums, and I will support a moratorium now \nbecause I don't believe we want tax policy that retards the development \nof the Internet. I don't believe we want tax policy that in any way \ninjures or interrupts the substantial expansion in technology and \ninformation technology that we have seen in a very short period of \ntime.\n  However, even as we do this, let's make sure that we do not injure or \nprovide significant problems for State and local governments because \nwhile we want to exempt the connection to the Internet, we did not want \nto, with an unfunded mandate as my colleague from Tennessee calls it, \nor some other approach, we begin preempting a retinue of State and \nlocal taxes that have\n\n[[Page S14233]]\n\nbeen legitimately allied to various kinds of services. It is not \nunusual to pay a tax on certain kinds of telephone services. It is not \nunusual. That is one of the methods by which State and local \ngovernments have developed a revenue base.\n  We described a very specific area that is off limits. Let's make sure \nthat description is appropriate, fair, and specific relating to how the \nCongress intends this to work.\n  I know my colleague from California wishes to speak. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. President, I very much hope we do not pass the underlying bill \ntoday. I believe it is premature. In my 10 years in the Senate, I have \nnever heard from more California cities, specifically 104 of them, \nindicating their concerns about what the underlying bill would do to \nthe budgets of their cities.\n  Here in my hand are some of the letters. This issue has energized \ncities in my State like no other. City mayors are incensed that we \nwould pass a law without knowing with certainty how it would impact \nlocal revenues.\n  I have received letters from the League of California Cities, which \nrepresents all of California's 478 cities, from county administrators, \npolice officer associations, firefighter associations, all of whom are \nconcerned about this bill--and I cannot answer their questions about \nit.\n  But, they understand the larger issue. They are telling us the bill \ncontains language that threatens their ability to collect existing \ntaxes on certain telecommunications services. And, again, I cannot \nanswer these questions, and these questions cannot be answered on the \nfloor of the Senate today. They are too complex.\n  This is precisely why the Carper-Alexander amendment is the most \nappropriate approach: extend the moratorium for another 2 years and do \na study. Bring the cities together with the professionals, and see \nexactly what taxes are impacted by the underlying bill.\n  I want to take a moment to commend Senators Allen and Wyden for their \nwork and also to thank Senators McCain and Hollings for guiding the \nissue through the Commerce Committee.\n  I also know the minority and majority staff on the Commerce and \nFinance Committees have been working to provide the Senate with the \ninformation it needs to weigh the competing views, and I thank them. \nBut the competing views are still there, and there are no answers for \nthe cities.\n  Since we originally passed the Internet Tax Freedom Act, we knew this \nday would come, the day when we would need either to extend the tax \nmoratorium or allow the temporary moratorium to expire.\n  California has a passionate interest in maintaining unfettered access \nto the Internet. We have a globally recognized concentration of high-\ntech and telecommunications firms. We provide much of the \ninfrastructure required to gain access to the Internet and many of the \nservices that make the Internet so useful. However, we have to make \nsure that maintaining tax-free access to the Internet does not \ninadvertently destroy the budgets of cities and counties throughout my \nState and the Nation. Many of them have come to rely on a variety of \ntelecommunications services fees and taxes as an important part of \ntheir revenue base.\n  Now, I support the permanent extension of the Internet Tax Freedom \nAct, but if I had to vote today on it, I would have to vote no. I am a \ncosponsor of Senator Wyden's original legislation that would make \npermanent the current moratorium. But if I had to vote today on the \nAllen-Wyden bill, I would vote no because a number of uncertainties \nhave arisen and nobody can answer those uncertainties.\n  Additionally, as a letter circulating through the Senate today \nindicates, we have been told that we violate the Unfunded Mandates Act. \nI was here when that Act was passed in 1995. I voted for that Act. Now \nwe hear from the Congressional Budget Office that the underlying bill \nwould, in fact, create an unfunded mandate on States and local \njurisdictions. I think we need to find out how and what can be done to \nprevent that from happening.\n  If this bill's definition of telecommunications services is \ninterpreted in an overly broad way, as many of us think it may be, it \nwill negatively impact local budgets. It will lead to the possibility \nof reduced preparedness in our firehouses and our police stations and \nless money for our schools, and it will do so at a time when States and \ncities face large budget deficits.\n  Right now, in San Diego, CA, a huge debate is going on as to whether \nthe San Diego County firefighting forces are adequate; whether they \nhave the vehicles, whether they have the training, whether they have \nthe ability to really respond to fire conflagration. If we move ahead \nprecipitously today, this bill will make that situation worse.\n\n  I must tell you, as a former mayor, these are my concerns. For San \nFrancisco, the city in which I served, the bill's current definition of \ntelecommunications services could lead to a loss of $30 million \nannually. San Francisco, as their experts compute, will lose $30 \nmillion of existing taxes if we pass this bill in its present form. \nThat translates into 300 police and firefighters.\n  In the city of Pasadena, the mayor, Bill Bogaard, says this would \ncost his city $11.4 million. That is the legislation before this body \ntoday. Let me quote from his letter:\n\n       By using vague language to include broadband Internet \n     access under the moratorium, we fear that the bill will allow \n     telephone and cable companies to use that protection to avoid \n     paying local franchise or utility fees.\n\n  He goes on to state:\n\n       It is our understanding that it was not the intent of the \n     bill's sponsors to endanger local franchising authority, but \n     the legislation has yet to be changed to correct these \n     unintended consequences.\n\n  Mr. President, this is not the first time in this debate we have \nheard someone mention unintended consequences. The distinguished \nSenator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg, mentioned last night that \nsince this debate has started we have been hearing it from all of our \nmayors and State officials all across this great land.\n  I wish to quote from one more of the letters I have received from our \nmayors. This is from Judith Valles, the mayor of the City of San \nBernardino, which was the focus of one of California's main wildfires. \nShe wrote to me to point out, and I quote:\n\n       Currently, 150 cities in California levy a utility users \n     tax, or what is called a UUT, which in many cases includes \n     telephone and cable television services. Utility users taxes \n     provide a critical contribution to local discretionary \n     revenue, on average 15 percent of general purpose revenues, \n     making the utility users tax vital in helping fund critical \n     city services, particularly public safety.\n\n  This comes from a mayor who is still dealing with the threat that her \ncity faced due to the recent California wildfires. And why? Because we \nare afraid to step back and give the telecommunications industry and \ncities more time to work out a solution to this issue with which they \ncan both live?\n  I appreciate Senator Wyden's frustration that if we let the debate \nrage on too long, it will never end. I appreciate that sometimes you \nhave to make a decision, and that if it is not perfect, you fix it \nalong the way. But this is not one of those times.\n  If you run the risk of repealing taxes that are already in place, you \nunavoidably affect local budgets, and I am not willing to do that at \nthis time. I believe people want their tax dollars used on the local \nlevel. They want better police. They want better fire protection. They \nwant the emergency services for adequate protection, particularly at \nthis point when America stands a risk from terror. And it makes no \nsense to rush to pass a bill when you have cities all across this \ncountry saying: Don't do it. It is going to inevitably impact what we \nnow levy.\n  This will not affect the telecommunications companies because the \nCarper-Alexander amendment extends the current law with minor changes. \nJust extend the moratorium for 2 years, do the study, permit the \nparties to come together and work this out.\n  I do not think it is one Member's goal to undermine the existing tax \nbase of local cities and counties across this great Nation in passing a \npermanent moratorium. We have never wanted to do that. We are told \ntoday that the underlying bill does, in fact, do that. So why--why--\nrush to pass it? My goodness.\n\n[[Page S14234]]\n\n  I love my high-tech companies, but the cities and counties are where \nthe people are, and they need police and fire and emergency services. \nIn a day of cutbacks, it makes no sense, because we don't know what we \nare doing today--and to simply willy-nilly pass a bill that may well do \nthat makes no sense. We then will have to shuffle around and find a way \nto correct it at some point in the future. In the meantime, budgets are \nupset all across the Nation. That is not good government, it is not \ngood public policy, and it is not good legislation.\n  I am here to add my support and the support of 104 cities in \nCalifornia to the Carper-Alexander amendment. I would be most happy to \noffer my services in any way I can to work with the committee chair, \nthe ranking member, and Senators Wyden and Allen, to try to find a \nsolution. It makes no sense to pass something without an adequate study \nand the reconciliation of the industries.\n  I remember when we were working out a solution to the taxation of \ncellular phone calls. At that time, we told the parties that we needed \nthem to develop a mutually agreeable solution to the problem of how to \ntax mobile phone calls and then present it to Congress. The cellular \nindustry and local governments did exactly that. We now have a cellular \nphone tax standard in place that most people can live with. It is my \nunderstanding that the cities and States would be comfortable with this \nsame approach to Internet access taxes. That is the kind of approach I \nbelieve will make this debate much more productive.\n  The debate on this issue should not be centered on who is right and \nwho is wrong. Unfortunately, that is where we are today. On one side we \nhave the telecommunications industry saying the cities are overreacting \nto the impact this bill will have on their budgets. On the other side, \nwe have the cities saying the telecommunications industry is seeking \nspecial, nearly unprecedented, tax treatment.\n  Why is it we would not want to give these two stakeholders time to \nput their heads together and bring Congress an agreement they can both \nlive with?\n  Let me be clear: I want a permanent extension but not at the cost of \nlaying off firefighters, police officers, and teachers.\n  Should the Carper-Alexander amendment not be adopted, I will offer my \nown amendment that simply strips out this confused language in the \ncontext of a permanent moratorium. While not a perfect solution to the \ncomplex problem we face, it is far better than forcing our cities and \nStates to send out pink slips to public safety personnel. I am hoping \nit will not come to that. Cities and their technical experts have my \nattention. This is true throughout the rest of the United States.\n  I hope the Carper-Alexander amendment will be passed and that the \nmoratorium will continue for 2 years so a study can be conducted and a \nreconciliation of conflicts within this legislation settled so that we \ncan move ahead knowing we have not inadvertently decimated up to 15 \npercent of the tax base of local communities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letters \nwhich I have from cities around the State of California be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  City of Burbank,\n\n\n                                   Office of the City Council,\n\n                                  Burbank, CA, September 12, 2003.\n     Re HR49 (Cox); SB52 (Wyden) and SB 150 (Allen)--Oppose.\n\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Hart Senate Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing on behalf of the City \n     of Burbank to urge your opposition to provisions included in \n     the ``Internet Tax Non-Discrimination Act of 2003'' that \n     would modify the definition of ``Internet Access'' to include \n     telecommunications services ``to the extent such services are \n     used to provide Internet Access''. This expansion of the \n     definition would result in a loss of badly needed revenues \n     for California's cities and significantly affect our city's \n     ability to provide essential services. This is particularly \n     important during these tough economic times.\n        Currently 150 cities in California levy a utility users \n     tax (UUT), which in many cases, including our city, includes \n     telephone and cable television services. The UUT provides a \n     critical contribution to local revenues (nearly 15% of \n     general fund revenues); in fact, it is our third largest \n     revenue source (behind sales tax and property tax), making \n     the UUT vital in helping fund critical city services, \n     particularly public safety. The City of Burbank, along with \n     other cities, are already experiencing flat growth in the UUT \n     due mostly to the intense competition between phone service \n     providers, particularly cellular. Therefore, any additional \n     reduction to our UUT (or any other revenue source for that \n     matter) will have dire fiscal consequences.\n        The City of Burbank's UUT projection for Fiscal Year 2003-\n     04 is $16.5MM which is needed to pay for essential safety and \n     human services programs. Although it is difficult to \n     segregate the impact of excluding the internet access portion \n     of our UUT revenues, here are some examples as to what total \n     UUT figure of $16.5MM can fund for one full year: Salaries \n     plus benefits for 36 fire fighters; salaries plus benefits \n     for 40 police officers; run our library program (salaries/\n     benefits plus operating costs); run both the Daycamp/Summer \n     Parks/Teen Program and the Organized Sports program \n     (salaries/benefits plus operating costs); and run the Senior \n     Nutrition Program, the Human Services Program, the \n     Transportation Program, the Senior Recreation Program \n     (salaries/benefits plus operating costs).\n        As you contemplate this limitation on local governments' \n     ability to raise local revenue, it is essential to put this \n     restriction in the context with other limitations California \n     local governments currently face as we try to meet critical \n     local service needs. Remember that over the past several \n     decades, cities' control of discretionary revenue sources has \n     been severely eroded by state actions.\n        With the passage of Proposition 13, the state was given \n     control over the allocation of local property taxes. In the \n     early 1990s, the state exercised this control diverting \n     billions in dollars of local property taxes to meet the state \n     obligation to fund schools. In the 2003-04 fiscal year alone, \n     this shift is estimated to be a loss of $5.4 billion from \n     cities, counties and special districts.\n        In addition, cities and counties are faced with a \n     shortfall of Vehicle License Fee revenues in the current \n     fiscal year due to the ``deferral'' of payment of $825 \n     million in backfill owed until 2006. This will have a \n     critical impact on the ability to provide local services \n     during the current fiscal year. The utility users tax \n     represents one of the few local revenue discretionary revenue \n     sources with rates, exemptions and terms determined at the \n     local level to conform to community interests and needs.\n        Although Burbank fully supports and recognizes the \n     importance of fostering the development of the Internet and \n     other new technologies, Congress must also recognize as it \n     considers this legislation that cities in California face \n     serious fiscal constraints at both the state and local level \n     already.\n        We need your help to ensure that this legislation is \n     amended to remove this detrimental expansion of the \n     definition of ``Internet access.'' We look forward to working \n     closely with you on this urgent matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Stacey Murphy,\n     Mayor.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  City of Concord,\n\n\n                                          Office of the Mayor,\n\n                                     Concord, CA, October 1, 2003.\n     Re S. 150--Internet Tax Non-Discrimination Act--Oppose/Amend.\n\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: The House has passed and the Senate \n     is poised to pass legislation (H.R. 49/S. 150) that, \n     according to the MultiState Tax Commission, will result in a \n     loss of revenue to state and local governments of up to $8.75 \n     billion annually by 2006, and could be even greater as right-\n     of-way rents from non-tax franchise and access line fees are \n     also lost.\n       In a report released September 24, the MultiState Tax \n     Commission estimated that for every $1 billion these bills \n     cost state and local governments, our local communities will \n     lose: Almost 20,000 police officers; almost 20,000 \n     firefighters; more than 27,000 hospital workers; almost \n     25,000 teachers; and more than 17,000 college instructors.\n       The legislation began as a simple extension of the Internet \n     Sales Tax moratorium, which was scheduled to expire November \n     1, 2003. H.R. 49/S. 150 has been amended to make the tax \n     moratorium permanent and to expand the types of services that \n     cannot be taxed.\n       Services for accessing the Internet that are taxable or \n     subject to franchise fees today--such as dial-up telephone \n     service, DSL and cable Internet services--would be exempt \n     from taxes and potentially free from franchise obligations.\n       Under current law, Internet access, ``does not include \n     telecommunication services''. This bill would expand the \n     definition of Internet access and thereby impose not only a \n     permanent moratorium on Internet access fees but also on \n     traditional telecommunications taxes.\n       I urge you to amend the bill to clarify that the moratorium \n     does not apply to traditional telecommunication services.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                 Mark A. Peterson,\n                                                            Mayor.\n\n[[Page S14235]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                               City of Covina,\n\n                                     Covina, CA, October 21, 2003.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: The City of Covina is writing to \n     express our concerns with S. 150, the ``Internet Tax Non-\n     Discrimination Act.'' We fear that the language of S. 150 \n     will deprive municipalities nationwide of billions of dollars \n     in tax and fee revenues in the years ahead and, in the \n     meantime, will result in litigation and confusion. It has \n     been our experience that some industry participants will use \n     the language of S. 150 to avoid paying local \n     telecommunications and utility taxes, as well as franchise \n     fees and rights-of-way fees owed on infrastructure deployed \n     in the public rights-of-way.\n       As currently worded, S. 150 poses a direct threat to two \n     traditional, yet separate and distinct, municipal powers. \n     These powers must be preserved. Municipal budgets are already \n     strapped by the recession, reduced federal and state budgets, \n     and the demands of homeland security. Local governments can \n     not afford to be hamstrung still further to the point where \n     vital municipal services are curtailed or eliminated \n     altogether.\n       The first traditional municipal power that S. 150 threatens \n     is the ability of local governments to impose \n     telecommunications taxes or to apply local utility taxes to \n     the provision of telecommunications services. Municipalities \n     in many states are authorized to impose such taxes, and many \n     municipalities currently rely on such taxes as a critical \n     part of their budget. Now, by expanding the scope of the \n     Internet tax moratorium to include telecommunications \n     services to the extent they are used to access the Internet, \n     S. 150 could immunize the bulk of all future \n     telecommunications services from local telecommunications and \n     utility taxes. That would not only starve local budgets; it \n     also would be highly regressive and unfair: Poorer residents \n     who lack a computer or can afford only plain/traditional \n     telephone service would continue to be subject to local \n     taxes, while businesses and wealthier residents with \n     computers, who can substitute e-mail and future technologies \n     like voice-over-Internet-protocol for dial tone service, \n     would be immune from local taxes.\n       The second traditional municipal power that S. 150 \n     threatens is the ability of local governments to impose \n     franchise fees as ``rent'' for use of public rights-of-way on \n     companies, such as telecommunications and cable service \n     providers that use public property for private profit. Over \n     one hundred years of court-supported municipal rights are at \n     stake here. In 1893, the Supreme Court clarified that right-\n     of-way fees are not taxes but payments in the form of rent. \n     City of St. Louis v. Western Union Tel. Co., 148 US 92, 99, \n     13 S.CT. 485, 488 (1893). Ironically, the Supreme Court was \n     then considering whether the federal government could require \n     local governments to allow telegraph companies access to the \n     public right-of-way without compensation. More recently, the \n     5th Circuit in City of Dallas v. FCC, 118 F. 3d 393 (5th Cir. \n     1997) cited the holding of St. Louis when it found that a \n     franchise fee is not a tax, but an expense of doing business \n     that is essentially a form of rent. Covina receives a five \n     (5) percent franchise fee on incumbent local \n     telecommunication cable service providers as compensation for \n     use of local rights-of-way.\n       Federal legislation requiring local governments to allow \n     private use of public property such as the right-of-way, free \n     from local fees and charges, could be viewed as \n     constitutionally suspect. Such legislation might constitute a \n     federal taking of local government property without \n     compensation, or federal commandeering of local government \n     property to implement a federal regulatory program. Please \n     consider these concerns in developing a program that achieves \n     federal goals without harming local governments.\n       The City is prepared to work with you to:\n       Clarify that in adopting S. 150 and its House counterpart \n     (H.R. 49), the Congress does not intend to interfere with or \n     in any way limit the imposition or collection of any \n     municipal telecommunications taxes or utility taxes \n     applicable to telecommunications, nor with any municipal \n     rights-of-way fees nor gross percentage fees collected in \n     lieu of right-of-way fees.\n       Clarify that S. 150 does not preempt the imposition or \n     collection of excise taxes of general applicability \n     (including telecommunications and utility taxes) on services \n     that employ telecommunications, cellular or cable television \n     facilities, even if those services offer access to the \n     Internet.\n       Without these clarifications, the adverse financial impact \n     of S. 150 on local governments will be immense: the loss of \n     billions of dollars in telecommunications fees and taxes in \n     the years ahead for cities across the nation--fees and taxes \n     that have been consistently upheld in court. If the \n     legislation is passed with the currently proposed language, \n     Covina can calculate the loss to its already-strained \n     municipal budget, with direct effects on the General Fund. \n     Municipalities in California and elsewhere have long imposed \n     gross receipt-based fees on telecommunications, cable \n     television and other providers' use of local rights-of-way \n     for private profit, and many municipalities across the nation \n     have imposed gross receipts-based taxes on the provision of \n     telecommunications service or utility services, including \n     telecommunications and cable television services. Federal \n     preemption of these rights, whether intended or not, will \n     result in immediate financial loss to Covina, and the size of \n     that loss will only grow in the future as more communications \n     shift to broadband, Internet-based technologies. We are \n     confident this is not the legacy you intend or desire. We are \n     offering to work with you in any way we can to avoid such an \n     unfortunate result.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Walter Allen III,\n     Mayor.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 City of Pasadena,\n\n\n                                          Office of the Mayor,\n\n                                 Pasadena, CA, September 26, 2003.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: The City of Pasadena has some \n     concerns with legislation that has been approved by the House \n     and is pending in the Senate (HR 49, S 150) that would extend \n     on a permanent basis the current moratorium on state and \n     local taxation of Internet access fees.\n       While the City has not actively opposed the extension of \n     the 1998 Internet Tax Freedom Act moratorium (even though it \n     does represent a federal intrusion into an issue \n     traditionally handled on the local level), we do believe \n     there is room for interpretation regarding the manner in \n     which the legislation treats broadband Internet access. By \n     using vague language to include broadband Internet access \n     under the moratorium, we fear that the bill will allow \n     telephone and cable television companies to use that \n     protection to avoid paying local franchise or utility fees. \n     These fees are fair and equitable payments for a company's \n     use of the public right-of-way, and to lose that revenue \n     would be damaging to our local budgets that are already \n     strained.\n       It is our understanding that it was not the intent of the \n     bill sponsors to endanger local franchising authority but the \n     legislation has yet to be changed to correct these unintended \n     consequences. I hope that you will urge your colleagues to \n     amend the legislation to extend the Internet tax moratorium \n     to ensure local franchising, utility fees, and right-of-way \n     authority are protected. Thank you for your assistance with \n     this important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Bogaard,\n     Mayor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                             City of Lakeport,\n\n                                   Lakeport, CA, October 14, 2003.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: The City of Lakeport seeks your \n     assistance in opposing language added to the Internet Tax \n     Non-Discrimination Act (S. 150) that would expand the \n     coverage of the moratorium by adding ``telecommunications \n     services'' to the definition of Internet access. It would \n     prohibit a local tax on any ``telecommunication service'' \n     that is used for Internet access. Nearly all telephone \n     services, including local dial up, wireless, satellite, and \n     broadband (DSL and cable modem), provide Internet access.\n       This language would have a major adverse impact on our City \n     and the financing of its essential services, such as police, \n     fire, streets, and parks.\n       Soon, major telephone and Internet service providers will \n     offer ``packages'' that bundle together Internet access and \n     unlimited telephone services. Unfortunately, under the \n     proposed language, such bundled services will likely be \n     considered ``tax-free'', which we find regressive and unfair. \n     Even if the average consumer would continue to be subject to \n     the local tax (UUT) on traditional telecommunication \n     services, those persons who could afford computers and high-\n     speed Internet access (i.e., DSL and cable modem) would slip \n     through this loophole and permanently escape taxation on \n     similar services. No matter how much we wish to support the \n     continued growth of the Internet, discriminatory taxation, or \n     favoring the ``haves'' over the ``have-nots,'' is not the \n     answer.\n       Finally, we want to assure you that we are in no way asking \n     for your opposition to this language as a way of helping us \n     achieve new tax revenues. We are only asking for help with \n     protecting our city's badly needed existing tax revenues on \n     telecommuncation services.\n       Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter. If you \n     have any questions or need additional information, please \n     feel free to call the League of California Cities Executive \n     Director, Chris McKenzie, or your staff can contact the \n     League's Washington representative, Eve M. O'Toole.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      R.E.

For \n     the City of Monterey this amounts to $2.4 million annually or \n     about 6% of the General Fund budget. This revenue source \n     directly supports police, fire, parks, streets and library \n     services. The significance of the UUT has only increased as \n     our City's other discretionary revenues have come under \n     siege.\n       As you contemplate this limitation on local governments' \n     ability to raise discretionary revenue, it is essential to \n     put this restriction in the context with other limitations \n     California local governments currently face as we try to meet \n     critical local service needs. Remember that over the past \n     several decades, cities' control of discretionary revenue \n     sources has been severely eroded by state actions.\n       With the passage of Proposition 13, the state was given \n     control over the allocation of local property taxes.

Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the City of Moreno \n     Valley, I respectfully request that you oppose provisions \n     included in the Internet Tax Non-Discrimination Act of 2003 \n     (H.R. 49 and S. 52) that would change the definition of \n     ``Internet access'' to include telecommunications services \n     ``to the extent that such services are used to provide \n     Internet access.'' This expansion of the definition would \n     result in the loss of badly needed revenues for California's \n     cities, and negatively affect our city's ability to provide \n     essential services.\n        Moreno Valley is one of 150 cities in California that levy \n     a utility users tax (UUT), which in our case includes \n     telephone and cable television services. Utility users' taxes \n     contribute significantly to the health of these cities' \n     discretionary budgets. On average, the UUT comprises fifteen \n     percent (15%) of general-purpose revenues in cities where it \n     is collected. In Moreno Valley, the $9.4 million UUT \n     comprises twenty one percent (21%) of the city's general fund \n     revenue for fiscal year 2003/2004. Our largest general fund \n     expense, by far, is public safety; sixty one percent (61%) of \n     the city's general fund will be spent this year for police \n     and fire services. Exemption of telecommunications services \n     from taxation based solely on their relation to consumer \n     Internet use will greatly hinder our efforts to finance these \n     fundamental services.\n        Please consider this particular limitation on local \n     governments' ability to raise discretionary revenues in \n     context with state legislative actions, which have \n     historically eroded local control of general-purpose funds. \n     With the passage of Proposition 13, the state assumed control \n     over the allocation of local property taxes. The state abused \n     this authority in the early 1990's by ``temporarily'' \n     shifting property tax dollars earmarked for local government, \n     to meet the state's obligation to fund schools. A decade \n     later, this shift results in a loss of $5.4 billion from \n     cities for fiscal year 2003/2004 alone.\n        In the state budget for the current year, first-quarter \n     revenue payments from the Vehicle License Fee, another \n     constitutionally-protected revenue source for cities, have \n     been ``deferred'' until 2006. The result: an immediate loss \n     of $825 million for cities statewide, and $1.8 million for \n     Moreno Valley. Additionally, $135 million in property tax \n     revenue was shifted from local redevelopment agencies this \n     year, augmenting Moreno Valley's revenue losses by $300,000.\n        Moreno Valley and other California cities have managed to \n     retain adequate service levels despite the poor fiscal \n     management practices of the state, primarily through the \n     development of new revenue sources. While the City fully \n     supports and recognizes the importance of fostering the \n     development of the Internet and other new technologies, we \n     hope the Senate recognizes that local governments cannot \n     maintain vital services if the state and Federal governments \n     continue to impair their ability to generate revenue.\n        We need your help to ensure that this legislation is \n     amended to remove this detrimental expansion of the \n     definition of ``Internet access.'' If there is any additional \n     information we can offer you regarding this urgent matter, \n     please contact us.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              William H. Batey II,\n     Mayor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               City of Novato,\n\n                                     Novato, CA, October 13, 2003.\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     Hart Building, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the City of Novato, I \n     am writing to urge your opposition to provisions included in \n     the ``Internet Tax Non-Discrimination Act of 2003'' that \n     would modify the definition of ``Internet Access'' to include \n     telecommunications services ``to the extent such services are \n     used to provide Internet Access''. This expansion of the \n     definition would result in a loss of badly needed revenues \n     for California's cities and significantly affect our city's \n     ability to provide essential services.\n       Currently 150 cities in California levy a utility users tax \n     (UUT), which in many cases includes telephone and cable \n     television services.

Include how much revenue your City estimates is \n     collected from your UUT? And what services in your City do \n     these tax revenues support? Please be as specific as possible \n     and translate into terms of potential cuts to specific \n     programs or personnel. The significance of the UUT has only \n     increased as our City's other discretionary revenues have \n     come under siege.\n       As you contemplate this limitation on local governments' \n     ability to raise discretionary revenue, it is essential to \n     put this restriction in the context with other limitations \n     California local governments currently face as we try to meet \n     critical local service needs. Remember that over the past \n     several decades, cities' control of discretionary revenue \n     sources has been severely eroded by state actions.\n       With the passage of Proposition 13, the state was given \n     control over the allocation of local property taxes. In the \n     early 1990s, the state exercised this control diverting \n     billions in dollars of local property taxes to meet the state \n     obligation to fund schools. In the 2003-04 fiscal year alone, \n     this shift is estimated to be a loss of $5.4 billion from \n     cities, counties and special districts.\n       In addition, cities and counties are faced with a shortfall \n     of Vehicle License Fee revenues in the current fiscal year \n     due to the ``deferral'' of payment of $825 million in \n     backfill owed until 2006. This will have a critical impact on \n     the ability to provide local services during the current \n     fiscal year. The utility users tax represents one of the few \n     local revenues discretionary revenue sources with rates, \n     exemptions and terms determined at the local level to conform \n     to community interests and needs.\n       Although the City of Novato fully supports and recognizes \n     the importance of fostering the development of the Internet \n     and other new technologies, Congress must also recognize as \n     it considers this legislation that cities in California face \n     serious fiscal constraints at both the state and local level \n     already.\n       We need your help to ensure that this legislation is \n     amended to remove this detrimental expansion of the \n     definition of ``Internet access.''

Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the Citizens of \n     Placentia, I am writing to express my Concerns about S. 150, \n     the Internet Tax Non-Discrimination Act. I am very concerned \n     about language in the bill that expands the definition of \n     ``Internet access'' and thereby imposes a permanent \n     moratorium not only on state and local taxes on Internet \n     access fees but also on traditional telecommunications taxes. \n     I strongly urge that you amend the language to clarify that \n     the moratorium only applies to Internet access and to to \n     other taxable telecommunications services or products, or to \n     franchise or rights-of-way fees.\n       Under current law, Internet access ``does not include \n     telecommunication services.'' The bill would change this to \n     ``does not include telecommunication services except to the \n     extent that such service is used for Internet access.'' While \n     this proposal may have been well intended in that it proposes \n     to ensure that the moratorium does not favor one form of \n     technology over another, the language is so broad it can be \n     interpreted to\n\n[[Page S14237]]\n\n     mean we will be prohibited from collecting taxes on \n     traditional telecommunications services.\n       As you know, states and cities across America are suffering \n     from the most severe fiscal crisis since World War II. The \n     loss of our telecommunications revenue would be a significant \n     blow to Placentia. The city could lose an estimated $500,000 \n     if this bill is enacted as currently drafted. We can not \n     afford such a loss.\n       As reported by the Senate Commerce Committee, S. 150 is \n     unacceptable. Again, I urge you to amend the bill to clarify \n     that the moratorium does not apply to traditional \n     telecommunications services. If you have any questions, feel \n     free to contact me at 714/993-8117.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Robert D'Amato,\n     City Administrator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           City of San Bernardino,\n\n\n                                          Office of the Mayor,\n\n                           San Bernardino, CA, September 12, 2003.\n     Hon.

Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: The City of San Luis Obispo seeks \n     your assistance in opposing language added to the Internet \n     Tax Non-Discrimination Act (S. 150) that would expand the \n     coverage of the moratorium by adding ``telecommunications \n     services'' to the definition of Internet access. It would \n     prohibit a local tax on any ``telecommunication service'' \n     that is used for Internet access. Nearly all telephone \n     services, including local dial up, wireless, satellite, and \n     broadband (DSL and cable modem), provide Internet access.\n       This language would have a major adverse impact on our City \n     in funding essential services such as police, fire, streets \n     and parks. In our city, utility user taxes (UUT) are one of \n     our ``Top Five'' General Fund revenues, representing 12% of \n     general-purpose revenues. ``Telecommunication services'' \n     account for a significant portion of UUT revenues, bringing \n     in $1.3 million in 2002-03. This is the equivalent of 15 \n     police officers. In these fiscally tough times, where we have \n     already made significant reductions in day-to-day public \n     safety services to balance the budget, any further revenue \n     cuts will result in crippling service reduction in our \n     community.\n       And the impact will only get worse in the future. Soon, \n     major telephone and Internet service providers will offer \n     ``packages'' that bundle together Internet access and \n     unlimited telephone services. Unfortunately, under the \n     proposed language, such bundled services will likely be \n     considered ``tax-free,'' which we find regressive and unfair. \n     Even if the average consumer would continue to be subject to \n     the local tax (UUT) on traditional telecommunication \n     services, those persons who could afford computers and high-\n     speed Internet access (such as DSL and cable modem) would \n     slip through this loophole and permanently escape taxation on \n     similar services. No matter how much we wish to support the \n     continued growth of the Internet, discriminatory taxation is \n     not the answer.\n       Finally, we want to assure you that we are not asking for \n     your opposition to this language as a way of helping us \n     achieve new tax revenues: we are only asking for help in \n     protecting our City's badly needed existing tax revenues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  David F. Romero,\n                                                            Mayor.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, this is a very important issue we have \nin front of us. I wish to pause for a moment and address an issue I saw \nin the Washington Post this morning that affects what we are doing here \nthis morning and what we do every single day; that is, our ability to \nwork together to ask questions on behalf of American taxpayers, on \nbehalf of all of the people we represent, to be able to get answers \nfrom each other and from the administration, and to have the best \ninformation we can so we can make the right decisions.\n  I was quite shocked this morning to see in the Washington Post a \nheadline that says: ``White House Puts Limits On Queries from \nDemocrats.'' Reading this more closely, it says:\n\n       The Bush White House, irritated by pesky questions from \n     congressional Democrats about how the administration is using \n     taxpayers' money, has developed an efficient solution.\n\n  It will not entertain any more questions from opposition lawmakers.\n\n  I thought for sure I was not awake. So I rubbed my eyes again and \nlooked at it again and read the same thing. It went on to say:\n\n       The decision, one that Democrats and scholars say is highly \n     unusual, was announced in an e-mail on Wednesday to House and \n     Senate appropriations committees.\n\n  Further down there is a comment from Norm Ornstein, a congressional \nspecialist at the American Enterprise Institute. He said:\n\n       I've not heard of anything like this happening before. This \n     is obviously an excuse to avoid providing information about \n     some of the things the Democrats are asking for.\n\n  I appreciate that in these days of debate and the important issues we \nhave in front of us, we have been asking some pesky questions of this \nadministration. Pesky questions such as: How specifically will we spend \n$87 billion going to Iraq, and what specifically will be done to \nrebuild? What is the plan for our soldiers? What is the plan in terms \nof making sure we complete the mission and bring them home safely?\n  We have asked pesky questions such as: Why is it that subsidiaries of \nHalliburton get billions of dollars in no-bid contracts when our own \nbusinesses and our own States are unable to find out about bidding \nprocesses and unable to participate in what should be an open, \ntransparent process, given the fact these are American tax dollars, \npublic tax dollars? And we have asked pesky questions about Bechtel.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I am honored to yield to my friend and leader from \nNevada.\n  Mr. REID. Is it true that you served in the House of Representatives \nbefore serving in the Senate?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. During your tenure there, I am sure you had many occasions \nto send inquiries to the administration. Whether it was Veterans \nAffairs, the Social Security Administration, White House council, you \nhave done that over the years; is that not true?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Absolutely.\n  Mr. REID. Over the years, it is true that you have received \nresponses?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. And there was never a question raised as to whether it was \na\n\n[[Page S14238]]\n\nDemocratic Congressman or Senator or Republican House Member or Senator \nasking the question; isn't that right?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Absolutely.\n  Mr. REID. Didn't you always feel that no matter what political party \nthe Member of Congress was who asked the question, it had no bearing on \nthe answer? Isn't that true?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I read that article to which you refer. It seems there is \nnow new criteria established at the White House, that only if you are a \nRepublican will they answer questions of a Member of Congress. Is that \nwhat that article said?\n  Ms. STABENOW. That is exactly what it says.\n  Mr. REID. How many people live in the State of Michigan?\n  Ms. STABENOW. We have over 9 million people in the State of Michigan.\n  Mr. REID. And Michigan is represented by two Democratic Senators.\n  Ms. STABENOW. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. The distinguished senior Senator, Carl Levin, who everyone \nacknowledges is one of the finest Senators ever to serve in this body.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Absolutely.\n  Mr. REID. He is an expert on issues relating to defense. I am sure on \na weekly basis, if not more often, he makes inquiries at the Pentagon \nand other offices of the executive branch of Government as to questions \nhe has in his role as the lead Democrat on the defense committee; is \nthat right?\n  Ms. STABENOW. In fact, I add that over the years, under Democratic \nand Republican Presidents, the senior Senator from Michigan asked very \nimportant questions about contracting. He was the first, I believe, to \ncome forward with the acknowledgement and questions about the $600 \nwrenches and other questions of excesses at the time in the past from \nthe Pentagon. To Democratic or Republican Presidents, he has asked some \npretty ``pesky'' questions.\n  Mr. REID. What that article says is a State of 9 million people, \nwhich has democratically elected Democratic Senators, these two \nSenators would not be able to ask questions of that administration; is \nthat what it does?\n  Ms. STABENOW. That is how it appears. We have a lot of very serious \nquestions our constituents want us to ask of the administration.\n  Mr. REID. I direct this to the Senator in a way that I can only say \nis as sincere as I can be. I very much appreciate the Senator bringing \nthis to the attention of the American people through the Senate. It is \nour ability to bring matters to the floor that make this country \nbetter--there are other ways of showing how great this country is, but \ncertainly one is being able to bring matters to the Senate floor \nwithout getting permission of the administration.\n  I applaud the Senator from Michigan for jumping on this issue very \nquickly, as the Senator has done on many other issues.\n  Ms. STABENOW. In the State of Michigan, we have many questions being \nasked--a lot that we asked of the administration on homeland security, \nhow we are funding our borders and keeping them secure. Why is it we \nare not providing more for our first responders? We have given some \ndollars but certainly a very small amount of what they need. Why are we \nnot funding more for communications equipment that allows one city's \npolice department to talk to another city's police department, or the \npolice department to talk to the fire department, or the EMS workers to \nbe able to do their job in a community? Why is it we are not providing \nmore dollars directly for those kinds of responsibilities? They are \nright on the front lines. When you have a problem, when there is a \nserious crisis, whether it is homeland security or some other crisis in \nthe community, you pick up and call 911, and we want to know people are \nprepared.\n  Those are questions about appropriations. Those are questions we \nasked of the administration. How are you moving forward and designing \nand implementing a Department of Homeland Security? What are we doing \nat the borders?\n  In my State, we have other questions we are asking that we are \nassuming the administration will endeavor to answer. It relates to the \nissues of Canadian trash trucks now coming across our borders into \nMichigan--about 200 a day--that are not being thoroughly inspected at \nthe border because there is not a way to do it without putting an \ninspector in the back of every truck.\n  We have serious concerns about what is happening in terms of homeland \nsecurity. Those are questions. How can we work together? How can we \nmake sure we are addressing those issues that will allow our citizens \nto be safe, as it relates to these trash trucks coming across the \nborder. They need to be stopped.\n  Over 165,000 people in my State signed an online petition to support \nmy request to the EPA that they get involved in stopping these trucks \nand using the authority they have. Now, we go through the \nappropriations process on this matter. I have been very appreciative of \nthe fact that we have worked together on a bipartisan basis in the \nSenate to address these issues and put more equipment at the border. I \nhave been pleased to have the support of leaders on the other side of \nthe aisle to support efforts to do that, to work together on behalf of \nthe people we represent and make sure they are safe.\n\n  But when I see things such as this kind of a story, that e-mails are \ngoing out saying the White House doesn't like our ``pesky'' questions \nabout how dollars are spent and suggestions that maybe they could be \nspent differently and better and more wisely in our States--they don't \nlike those questions, so they sent out an e-mail saying they are not \ngoing to answer them anymore. They are only going to answer the \nquestions coming from the Republican committee chairs. They are not \ngoing to answer questions coming from us. This is deeply disturbing and \nit should be disturbing to every single one of the people we represent. \nIt should be, frankly, disturbing to people on both sides of the aisle.\n  I was in the House of Representatives for 4 years under a different \nadministration. I asked a lot of tough questions of a lot of \nDepartments and I expected answers. I expected that when my Republican \ncolleagues asked questions of that Democratic administration, they \nwould be given answers as well.\n  We are a separate branch of Government. We are the appropriators, all \nof us. The Constitution didn't say, by the way, only the majority party \ncan have access to information and only the majority party is \nresponsible for appropriations and guaranteeing the wise use of \nAmerican tax dollars. They said the Congress of the United States is \nresponsible, and that is all of us.\n  I think it is very important that we send a message very quickly from \nthe Senate that we object to this, object to it together. We work hard \non appropriations. We ask a lot of questions. We have a lot of give and \ntake. Amendments are proposed; they rise, they fall. That is the \nprocess. We all respect each other and we all respect that process. At \nthe end of the day, we assume that if we are asking, as they say, \n``pesky'' questions, we will get answers regardless of who we are. We \nmay not agree with the answers.\n  That is why we live in a democracy. That is the democratic process. \nWe respect the fact there are differences in views, priorities, and \nvalues, but we do not accept--I do not accept--that we will be blocked \nfrom receiving information. It would be astounding if every time, as a \nMember of this body, I had to ask for a freedom of information request \nfrom the administration in order to get questions answered on items of \nimportance to the people I represent--whether it be agriculture, \nmanufacturing, homeland security, health care, education, the \nenvironment, or transportation. I could go on and on. We have critical \nissues we are responsible for addressing and responsible for doing it \nin the most efficient and effective way we can.\n  There is only a limited amount of resources and we have to make sure \nwe make wise decisions with those resources. That is our job.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2141 to Amendment No. 2136\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Ms. Stabenow] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2141.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S14239]]\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       Since, Article I of the U.S. Constitution grants Congress \n     the power of the purse; and\n       Since, Congressional oversight of Executive Branch \n     expenditures of public funds is essential in order to prevent \n     waste, fraud, and abuse of taxpayers dollars; and\n       Since, Congress can only exercise its oversight \n     responsibilities if the White House and Executive Branch \n     agencies are responsive to requests for information about \n     public expenditures;\n       Therefore it is the Sense of the Senate that,\n       The White House and all Executive Branch agencies should \n     respond promptly and completely to all requests by Members of \n     Congress of both parties for information about public \n     expenditures.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I simply say this is a very short \namendment. In part, it indicates:\n\n       Since, Congressional oversight of the Executive Branch \n     expenditures of public funds is essential in order to prevent \n     waste, fraud, and abuse of taxpayer dollars; and\n       Since, Congress can only exercise its oversight \n     responsibilities if the White House and Executive Branch \n     agencies are responsive to requests for information about \n     public expenditures;\n       Therefore, it is the Sense of the Senate that,\n       The White House and all Executive Branch agencies should \n     respond promptly and completely to all requests by Members of \n     Congress of both parties for information about public \n     expenditures.\n\n  I hope we will have unanimous support for this amendment and that we \ncan quickly send a message to the White House and ask that they reverse \nthe policy laid out this morning in this article.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to join the comments of the Senator \nfrom Michigan. It is, I am sure, painful and distracting for the \nadministration to receive inquiries from Congress. It sure would be a \nlot easier if Congress wasn't around to mess up their work. I mean, we \nask all these hard questions about what they are doing with the \ntaxpayers' dollars. What are you doing to make America a safer place? I \nam sure if they did not have to answer those questions and be held \naccountable, they would have a lot more time to do other things.\n  I think the reason for the questions gets down to a basic document \ncalled the Constitution. If I remember correctly from early lessons, we \ndo have three coequal branches of Government and a system of checks and \nbalances. This administration has decided that particular part of the \nConstitution is going to be ignored.\n  Frankly, I don't think that serves our Nation very well. Whether it \nis a Democratic administration or a Republican administration, the fact \nis they have to be held accountable. The way they are held accountable \nis not only through an election, but through the operations of Congress \nwhich appropriates moneys, passes laws, and asks hard questions.\n  Now we see the official policy of this administration is to say we \nare only going to answer Republican-approved questions. That, to me, is \na sad commentary on this administration which has, frankly, written a \nrecord of concealment in the years they have been here.\n  You recall the lawsuit that was involved when we drew up the Energy \nbill. We asked the Vice President of the United States, who was one of \nthe designers of the administration's Energy bill, which special \ninterest groups were sitting in the room when they wrote the bill. He \nsaid to Congress: It is none of your business. We don't have to tell \nyou. We brought a suit against the administration asking for that \ninformation and we were unsuccessful.\n  Today we know there were special interest groups present. We just \ndon't know who they were. If you look at the bill, you can see who they \nlikely were. They are the ones that were rewarded--oil companies and \nmajor energy companies. They are the ones who did very well with this \nEnergy bill.\n  When the Senator from Michigan raises this question as to what this \nnew administration policy means, I think she really hits the nail on \nthe head. Congress has an important constitutional role of oversight on \nthis administration and any administration, and for this administration \nto decide that certain Senators and Congressmen cannot ask questions \nthat will be answered, I think is going to set us back.\n  I had the same experience with the Department of Justice. Attorney \nGeneral John Ashcroft, who served in this Senate for years and asked \nmany questions of previous administrations, really loathes to answer \nany questions that come particularly from Democratic Senators. That has \ncaused a lot of, I guess, concern because some of us believe there are \nimportant questions that need to be asked and answered.\n  The PATRIOT Act, for example, was a new delegation of authority 2 \nyears ago to the Government. It gave the Government more power than \nthey had before, power that comes close to, if it doesn't, infringing \non our rights and liberties. We asked some questions: How is this \nDepartment of Justice using the PATRIOT Act? Unfortunately, the \nAttorney General has not been responsive. One might say: Well, he comes \nto Congress, doesn't he? He submits himself to questions? If we look at \nthe record, we will see this Attorney General's record of coming to \nCongress and being held accountable is a record that shows he doesn't \ncare to do that either.\n\n  They don't answer written inquiries, and the Attorney General does \nnot appear personally. Frankly, that leads to mistrust, and it doesn't \nspeak well of a democracy where that is the hallmark of their policy.\n  It strikes me Congress has some important responsibilities here, and \none of them is reflected in the issue raised by the Senator from \nMichigan. Another one is reflected in this so-called 30-hour debate, \nthis one-sided debate which is to take place next week. It appears the \nRepublican majority in the Senate, 51, believe they have been treated \nunfairly because the President has only had 168 of his judicial \nnominees approved while 4 have been held up. That is right, the score \nis 168 to 4, and they are arguing that is unfair, so unfair we need to \ntie up the Senate, we need to stop consideration of appropriations \nbills, we need to stop any consideration of bills that might help the \nmen and women in uniform who are fighting for us in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. We don't have time for that, but we have to spend 30 \nstraight hours in a one-sided debate on the Republican side arguing \nthat holding up 4 judges out of 172--4 out of 172--is somehow \nunconstitutional or unfair or unjust.\n  It goes to the heart of this same document, our Constitution, which \nsays the Senate is not a rubberstamp. The Senate has the power to not \njust consent to judges, but to advise and consent, and that advise-and-\nconsent role includes asking hard questions of judicial nominees.\n  The four who have been held up so far from the Bush White House, I \nthink, represent the most extreme of his nominees. But there are many \nothers who have been approved who have philosophies entirely consistent \nwith the President and his administration.\n  Make no mistake, out of the 168 nominees who have gone through this \nSenate, a record number for any President, 168 have been approved. Of \nthose, we will find many conservative Republicans with views much \ndifferent than my own. We accept that. But for these 4, we think they \nhave crossed a line, a line which really calls on us in our capacity as \nSenators with responsibility of the advise-and-consent clause to say at \nsome point we have to say no for 4 judges out of 172.\n  I might add on this bill that is before us, at a later moment I will \nbe offering an amendment. It is an amendment which really doesn't \nappear to have much to do with the Internet tax question, but it is an \namendment I am going to continue to offer on every available bill until \nthe Senate goes on record and passes it again and enacts it into law. \nIt is an amendment which passed this Senate about 2 weeks ago by a vote \nof 96 to 3. It is an amendment which says Federal employees who are \nmembers of our National Guard and Reserve units who are activated will \nhave their Federal salaries protected while they are serving our \ncountry.\n  This is exactly what happens to State employees in dozens of States \nand city and county employees across America where their units of \ngovernment have said: If you go off to serve our Nation in the Guard \nand Reserve, we will stand behind you. We will make up the difference \nin your salary. We will protect your families' income while you are \nserving our Nation and risking your lives.\n  Sadly, the same standard is not applied to Federal employees. Here we\n\n[[Page S14240]]\n\nare with 10 percent of the Guard and Reserve in Federal employment--\n120,000 of those who are in the Guard and Reserve are in Federal \nemployment; 23,000 have been activated, and we do not make up the \ndifference in their salaries while overseas.\n\n  For some, there is no difference, but for some there is a big \ndisparity. I offered this amendment on the floor, and it was adopted 96 \nto 3.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield so I can make an announcement?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, without losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, for the benefit of my colleagues, we \nhave been in some intense negotiations on the Internet tax issue. We \nhave made significant progress. We still have one significant hurdle \nremaining where we can perhaps get all sides together. There is about a \n50-50 chance. But we should know in about 20 minutes as to whether we \nwill reach this very important agreement which would basically \neliminate any major issues associated with the Internet tax issue.\n  I thank my colleague from Illinois for yielding. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, with the chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee, and my friend from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, who has \nworked with me on this now for 7 years, we have made some significant \nheadway in the last half hour, 45 minutes. To get this done, there are \nsome difficult choices that have to be made. One that would be very \npainful for me, given my involvement in the original law, would be to \naccept some sort of time limit rather than make it permanent.\n  I say to the Senate, I am willing to look at that in the name of \ntrying to find common ground. What we can't have as we go through this \nis to have DSLs, this tremendously exciting service which in so many \ninstances is going to be the key for folks getting Internet access in a \nwireless fashion, hammered again and again in the future. We are going \nto see if we can find common ground.\n  The point of this law more than 5 years ago was to ensure \ntechnological neutrality so the Internet and the various ways it is \ndelivered would not, in some way, advance some at the expense of \nothers. We still have to find a way for that technological neutrality.\n  We may be able, given the fact that the staffs are working now to \nhave a breakthrough on this in the next half an hour, but as the author \nof the original law in the Senate, I want to make it clear that I am \nopen to trying to find some common ground and make some significant \nconcessions to do it. That is what we are considering now.\n  I thank the Senator from Illinois for yielding.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I, of course, thank the Senator from Oregon. I appreciate \nthe hard work of the Senator from North Dakota, the Senator from \nArizona, and the Senator from Oregon on this important legislation.\n  I mentioned earlier the reservist pay amendment which I will be \noffering at some point on this legislation, but there is another \namendment which I will be offering which I would like to alert the \nsponsors of so it comes as no surprise. It is our understanding that if \nthere is a tax moratorium on Internet operations, which I would support \nwith carefully defined circumstances, it will result in a substantial \nsavings to telecommunications companies across the United States. I am \ngoing to be offering an amendment during the course of consideration of \nthis bill which says that the savings to these companies shall be \npassed on to the consumers in America.\n  It strikes me that at a point in time when we are in a recession, \nwhen families are struggling, some facing unemployment, others trying \nto make ends meet, that if we are going to relieve this industry of \nsubstantial taxation, millions if not billions of dollars over time, \nthe savings ought to go to families, the customers. I think that would \nbe a good move on our part.\n  So if we want to talk about invigorating the economy, then why not \nreduce the telephone bill or the tax bill that a family faces on a \nmonthly basis?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield to the Senator for Nevada, without yielding the \nfloor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I say to my friend from Illinois, in \nrelation to the amendment that is pending, I asked the White House by \nletter to give me the breakdown of the cost of all of these trips they \ntake around the country campaigning for people. Who pays for that? Is \nit paid for by the taxpayers of this country? Is it paid for by the \nRepublican National Committee? The President is a rich man. Does he pay \nfor it personally?\n  It has been months and I have had no response. I think I am entitled \nto an answer to that most important question. People are concerned \nabout that. The President goes to his ranch, he goes off on day trips \ncampaigning only.\n  Would the Senator agree with me that that is the direction of this \namendment, and that I am entitled, as a Member of the Senate, to an \nanswer to the question as to who is paying for these junkets around the \ncountry?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reclaiming my time, I say to the Senator from Nevada that \nis a perfect illustration as to why the Stabenow amendment should be \nenacted, because what Senator Stabenow is trying to achieve is the \nright of the Senator from Nevada and any Senator, Democrat or \nRepublican, to ask legitimate questions about the expenditure of public \nfunds. If we decide that is going too far and perhaps inconveniencing \nthe administration by forcing them to be held accountable, then we \nmight as well pack up and go home.\n  As they say, if we are here in order to total up years for \nretirement, it is a pretty easy job; but if we want to come here and go \nto work to try to achieve good for this country and make certain that \npeople who are misusing public resources are, in fact, held accountable \nfor it, then it is hard work.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. How many people live in the State of Illinois?\n  Mr. DURBIN. About 12\\1/2\\ million.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Senator from Illinois, I spoke through the \nChair to the distinguished junior Senator from Michigan about the State \nof Michigan. There are 9 million people in Michigan, two Democratic \nSenators. Under the rule that we have just learned about that the White \nHouse is not going to answer questions of Democrats, 9 million people \nwho live in the State of Michigan in effect cannot have their Senators \nasking questions of the White House.\n  The Senator from Illinois, who represents 12\\1/2\\ million people, \nthere is a Democratic Senator and a Republican Senator who has \nannounced his retirement, who is not going to run for reelection--the \nSenator who has announced his retirement and in effect is a lame duck, \nfine man that he is, can have his questions answered, but the Senator \nwho was just reelected representing 12\\1/2\\ million people cannot have \nhis questions answered. Does that seem fair?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Nevada, it not only does not \nseem fair, it raises another question in my mind. Why would we on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle approve any executive appointment of \nsomeone who is going in the executive branch and from that point \nforward will never speak to us again? Now, if we are being asked by \nthis administration to approve people to hold offices within this \nadministration who have not answered all the questions in committee and \nhaving been approved on the Senate floor will from that point forward \nnever communicate with us again, then, frankly, I think we are derelict \nin our responsibility.\n  So I say to the administration, think this through. If they are \nsaying that the people we appoint in the Senate are not going to answer \nthe questions propounded by Democratic Senators, then, frankly, I think \nit is untoward of them to suggest that we should just approve all of \nthese appointments.\n  I think it is fair game for the President to fill vacancies, and I \nhave supported the overwhelming majority of the President's requests. \nBut if the policy is once approved by the Senate, these executive \nappointments, these people working in these agencies, will refuse to \ntake telephone calls or answer letters of inquiry from Members of the \nSenate, refuse to be held accountable for their actions as public \nofficials, then I think we are derelict in\n\n[[Page S14241]]\n\nour responsibility to the people we represent.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator from Illinois yield for a question \nwithout losing his right to the floor?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask my friend from Illinois, who serves \nwith me on the Appropriations Committee--who served on a number of \ncommittees in the other body before he was in the Senate--who has as \nmuch knowledge of procedure as anyone having served in the other body \nand served in this body, it has been my experience in over a quarter of \na century on \nthe Appropriations Committee, through \nsix administrations--President Ford, President Carter, President \nReagan, former President Bush, President Clinton--that both Republicans \nand Democrats were able to ask questions and expect answers from the \nexecutive branch.\n  Further, it was my experience that throughout all of these \nadministrations, Republican and Democratic alike, there was not a \nrestriction made because we were required to ask these questions. Is \nthat the experience of the distinguished Senator from Illinois? Has the \nSenator had the same experience in both bodies--I am speaking now of \nappropriations but, of course, a lot of other committees are involved--\nif we asked questions about where the money went, we received the \nanswers irrespective of whether one was a Republican or Democratic?\n  Mr. DURBIN. In reply, I say the Senator from Vermont is absolutely \ncorrect. Allow me to use another illustration. Just last weekend, there \nwas the downing of the Chinook helicopter in Iraq with 15 of our \nsoldiers killed initially and another soldier who has died just last \nnight, I understand, so 16 soldiers died and 20 more were seriously \ninjured. The pilot of that helicopter was from my home State. It was a \nNational Guard helicopter.\n  After that occurred, unsolicited I received communications from \nreliable military sources that suggested that the Guard helicopters in \nactivated units were not adequately equipped and prepared to deal with \nshoulder-fired missiles. This is as serious a question as can be given \nto any Member of the Senate. Naturally, the families--the servicemen \nfirst and their families--wanted to know the answer. So what I did was \nto write a letter directly to the Secretary of Defense, Donald \nRumsfeld, saying please look into this immediately; see if the National \nGuard units that have been activated are sufficiently protected with \nequipment.\n  During the course of asking this question, more communications came \nmy way. Now we have received a lot of communications suggesting that \nfamilies all around Illinois, and even around the country, are telling \nus about deficiencies in the equipment available to our servicemen in \nIraq and Afghanistan, and particularly to activated guardsmen and \nreserves.\n  Consider that just yesterday, the President signed an $87 billion \nappropriation for the effort in Iraq and Afghanistan which, as I \nunderstand it, about $67 billion was for our men and women in uniform, \nwhich I supported. As much as I disagree with the President's foreign \npolicy, I am not going to shortchange our men and women in uniform for \nthe resources they need to be successful in their mission and come home \nsafely.\n  Having done that, having given the appropriation to the \nadministration, now we have families and servicemen coming to me, as \nthe Senator from Illinois, saying they do not think the money is being \nspent properly. I have a responsibility to their families and to my \nState to ask the hard questions of the administration. Are you doing \nall that you can to protect our servicemen? Frankly, I think that is \nwhy I was elected. If I am not given a chance to even ask that question \nor to have my inquiry answered, what, then, can I say to these families \nor to these servicemen who believe that I am their elected \nrepresentative and have that responsibility?\n\n  Senator Stabenow, in her amendment, says this new policy of the \nadministration, of refusing to answer letters from Democratic Senators \nand Democratic Congressmen, takes away from the voice of those families \nand those servicemen and people across the United States who rely on us \nto stand up and hold any administration accountable, whether it is \nDemocratic or Republican.\n  I think, honestly, her amendment goes to the heart of why we are here \ndoing business in the Chamber of the Senate. I support her very \nstrongly. I urge my Republican colleagues who have been very loyal to \ntheir President, and that is understandable and admirable, to think \nlong and hard about this policy. Things change in this town. The tide \nof politics can hit the shore and go back out to sea and come back \nagain. You never know, a year, 2 years, 3 years from now, whether or \nnot policies taken by this administration establish a precedent which \nis not healthy for our constitutional democracy. Certainly this \ndecision by the administration to turn down inquiries and letters of \nrequest on matters as basic as the protection of our men and women in \nuniform and whether or not our helicopters are adequately protected--\ntheir decision as a policy basis, which I understand has been included \nin an e-mail and sent across the administration--raises some important \nquestions.\n  I see the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, Senator \nConrad, has taken the floor. Again, he is a perfect illustration of why \nthis new policy of the administration, refusing to answer inquiries \nfrom Democratic Senators about their spending policies and taxing \npolicies, make it impossible for him to do his job on the Budget \nCommittee to make certain that every administration is held \naccountable.\n  I am going to yield the floor and say to my friend and colleague from \nMichigan, thank you for bringing this issue up. This is not just a \nmorning newspaper article. This is a serious constitutional question. I \nhope some of my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle, after \nfirst reacting they want to stand by their administration, will think \nlong and hard if this is a policy we in America should be asked to live \nwith, when future Congresses and future Presidents are elected and we \nare all told we are trying to share a responsibility of accountability \nacross our Government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I ask to speak as if in morning \nbusiness for no longer than 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Lautenberg are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, less than 6 months ago, we enacted the \nJobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act which contained $20 \nbillion in temporary State fiscal relief. Yet before us is legislation \nthat may effectively take back a significant portion of that much-\nneeded relief for States. In my earlier career, I was tax commissioner \nin the State of North Dakota. My successor, a Republican, a man who \ncurrently holds the office, was in my office just a couple of weeks ago \nexplaining the impact of the committee bill on our State. He estimated \nthis bill would cost our State $20 million. That may not be a lot of \nmoney in Washington. I can tell you that is a lot of money in North \nDakota. That is $20 million we would be taking away from the State of \nNorth Dakota they have every right to collect.\n  Let me make absolutely clear that I am not for taxing access to the \nInternet. I am not for that. I have supported the moratorium. I will \ncontinue to support the moratorium. But as Senator Dorgan made clear on \nthe floor this morning, definitions do matter. Unfortunately, the bill \nout of the committee has left a lot of open questions. Lawyers looking \nat it are telling us it would restrict the States far beyond a simple \nextension of the moratorium. I do not believe that is the intention of \nthe Congress. I certainly hope it is not the intention of the committee \nto go\n\n[[Page S14242]]\n\nbeyond the definition of access we agreed to in 1998 and reaffirmed in \n2001 in a way that would preempt States' abilities to levy taxes as its \nelected representatives see fit.\n  On the floor of the Senate, we have seen a bipartisan effort to make \ncertain what we do here is what we really mean. I have been very \ninterested to see four distinguished former Governors--Senator \nAlexander, Senator Voinovich, Senator Carper, and Senator Graham, who \nare among our most respected colleagues on issues such as these, and \nall of them served successfully as Governors--warning Members of \nCongress the legislation before us has unintended consequences. I hope \nwe listen carefully to our colleagues, Senator Alexander, Senator \nVoinovich, Senator Carper, and Senator Graham, and that we pause and \nget this right.\n  We should not tax access to the Internet. That would inhibit its \neconomic potential. It would reduce opportunity in our society. But at \nthe same time we shouldn't be going beyond that principle and that \nconcept in restricting the States' rights to levy taxes that are \nreasonable and appropriate. That is not the appropriate role of the \nFederal Government.\n  I hope very much we will take a few moments and get this right so \nthat this is not a rush to judgment and we not impose on hard-pressed \nStates. We already know there is some $90 billion of shortfall by the \nStates all across the country. The last thing they need is the Federal \nGovernment to come in here and take away legitimate sources of revenue \nfrom them. That makes no sense.\n  I hope my colleagues are going to be sufficiently patient and that we \nget this right. As Senator Dorgan said--again, I want to emphasize--\nearlier on the floor, definitions matter. I heard Senator McCain say \nthe same thing last night; that it is important to get these concepts \nright, to get them carefully defined so we are not doing something \nother than what we really intend to do, which is to provide a \ncontinuing moratorium on the taxation for Internet access.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for 10 minutes. I understand we have a lull on the \nInternet tax bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Allard are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask my friend from North Dakota--this \nis on the Stabenow amendment--we would like to have a couple-word \nchange. If he would look at the amendment where it says, in the last \nparagraph, ``The White House and all Executive Branch agencies should \nrespond promptly and completely to all requests by Members of \nCongress,'' that between ``all'' and ``requests,'' if we could add the \ntwo words ``constitutionally appropriate.'' Would that be agreeable to \nhim, so it would read: ``completely to all constitutionally appropriate \nrequests by Members of Congress''?\n  I assume that most Members of Congress would not make \nunconstitutionally appropriate requests, but that seems to be \nperfecting language that some of my friends would like to have added.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Arizona, this is \nnot my amendment, so I would have to consult with the author of the \namendment.\n  As you know, the amendment is prompted by a news story today from the \nWhite House suggesting they will not be answering inquiries except by \ncertain Members of Congress. So that prompted her to offer this \namendment.\n  I will certainly consult with--she is on the Senate floor, so perhaps \nwe can ask her directly.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, do I still have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to ask a \nquestion of the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask the Senator from Michigan if she \nwould be agreeable to a two-word addition in the last paragraph, that \nbetween the words ``all'' and ``requests'' the words ``constitutionally \nappropriate'' be added. I wonder if that would be agreeable to her. If \nit is not agreeable to her, I will not propose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, the only question I have is the word \n``appropriate.'' We certainly want this to be within constitutional \nparameters. I would say, at this point, the question I would have would \nbe about ``appropriate.'' Who decides what is ``appropriate,'' given \nthe judgments the administration is making? Possibly we can work \ntogether to find something else other than that word. But at this point \nthat would be my concern.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, will the Senator from Michigan allow me to \nask a question?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Certainly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. This amendment is offered by the Senator from Michigan, and \nit never took into consideration doing anything that was \nunconstitutional?\n  Ms. STABENOW. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Everything the Senator does is within the framework of the \nConstitution. So I would hope that the matter could be disposed of as \nwritten because it goes without saying that we want this to be \nconstitutional. We would never try to do anything that would be outside \nthe parameters of the Constitution.\n\n  So I hope this amendment could be accepted. It appears to me it \nshould be done by voice. If that is not the case, I know that a number \nof other people have more to talk about on this amendment. So I would \nhope the majority would make a decision quite soon as to what is to be \ndone with this amendment.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I mentioned that the event that has \nprompted this amendment, I understand, was in the newspaper this \nmorning. It was apparently a report that the White House would limit \ntheir responses to questions from Members of Congress.\n  I, at one point, chaired the appropriations subcommittee here in the \nSenate that actually funds the operations of the White House. We always \nwork very closely with the White House. When they request the necessary \nfunding, we provide it. We never have any difficulty. The same is true \nwith respect to the agencies. We fund all of the agencies of the \nexecutive branch. We spend a great deal of money in doing that. We work \ntogether to find the appropriate number and the appropriate amount of \nresources that are needed.\n  The White House is a little different. When they make the request, we \nfund the request. That is the way we deal with the White House.\n  But with the executive agencies, of course, we have disagreements and \ndifferences from time to time, but we end up sending billions and \nbillions--hundreds of billions--of dollars for expenditures through \nthese agencies. If ever--if ever--the Members of the Congress are \nprevented from asking questions about how the money is used, how the \nmoney is spent, then there is something fundamentally broken.\n  So I was as surprised as my colleague from Michigan to read the story \nin the newspaper this morning. I know it is nettlesome, I know it is a \npain, it is a bur under the saddle to get questions from Members of \nCongress if you are a member of the executive branch.\n  At one point, I was a member of the executive branch in State \ngovernment,\n\n[[Page S14243]]\n\nand all the State legislators were always peppering us with questions. \nSure, that is a nuisance. Nobody likes that. But the fact is, the \ncongressional actions here determine how much money is made available. \nThe same is true in the State legislatures. They have every right--in \nfact, they have a responsibility--to the taxpayer to try to determine \nhow that money is spent. If they have questions about it, they ask \nthose questions. If they ask those questions, they darn well expect an \nanswer, even if it is considered a nuisance by those who are receiving \nthe questions.\n  So my hope is they will just accept this amendment at some point \ntoday. I understand what has prompted the amendment.\n  Let me just, for a moment, talk about the underlying proposition \nbefore the Senate; that is, the bill that is brought to the floor \ntoday, the moratorium on Internet taxation. I want to see us pass a \npiece of legislation. I do not think it is satisfactory to have the \nmoratorium expire on November 1, and then to just let that be the word. \nThat is not where I would like to see this end up.\n\n  So we have a bill on the floor that came from the Commerce Committee. \nThat legislation passed the Commerce Committee unanimously, but it was \nnot quite the way it seemed when you take a look at that vote because \nwe also agreed that the definition of that Internet tax moratorium was \nfaulty or at least not agreed to, and we would work on it coming to the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  We have not yet reached a compromise. That definition is the key. It \nis the linchpin to this legislation. So we have to find a way to \nresolve that. We thought this morning perhaps there was a way to do \nthat. That appears not to be the case. I think we still have some \ndistance between the various thoughts about how one would craft this in \na way that is helpful to not retard and not injure the buildout of the \ninfrastructure for the Internet and, at the same time, be fair to State \nand local governments with respect to their revenue base and not be \npreempting the opportunity they need and they would have, as they have \nalways had, to tax certain services. So we continue to try to talk and \nsee if we can find a way to reach some kind of agreement on this \ndefinition.\n  Now, I want to make an additional point because I think it is \nimportant to continue to make this point even as we work on these \nissues. We have this issue on the Senate floor today. I understand why \nthat is the case, because this issue had a November 1 deadline by which \nthe moratorium on Internet taxation expired.\n\n  We have a responsibility to try to see if we can pass this \nlegislation. So there was a deadline with respect to this legislation.\n  But there was a deadline on appropriations bills as well. That \ndeadline was October 1. It is now November. We still have \nappropriations bills that have not been considered in the Senate. \nYesterday there was great urgency about an appropriations bill. \nEverybody cooperated to try to get that done. We are told today there \nis great urgency about legislation. We are told that the majority \nleader wants the Congress to work on Veterans Day and so on.\n  Then we are told, despite the fact that there is this urgency to get \nappropriations bills done and they request cooperation, that beginning \nnext Wednesday we will spend 30 hours so that the majority can talk \nabout the four judges they have not been able to get confirmed.\n  It seems to me perhaps we should talk about the 168 judges we have \nconfirmed. If we are going to take time in the middle of next week, \nafter having worked on Veterans Day, because we believe there is such \nan urgency--and I believe there is an urgency with appropriations \nbills; we should get them done--if we are going to take 30 hours in the \nmiddle of the week in order to try to convince the American people that \nthe Congress is not moving forward on judgeship nominations, and they \nare going to take 30 hours to talk about four judges who didn't get \nconfirmed by the Senate, I think perhaps then we need to take much more \ntime to talk about the 168 judges we did confirm.\n  I am a little miffed at having these talk shows and others get all \ntheir talking points about how the Senate is stalling on judgeships. We \nare not stalling on judgeships. Most all of the Federal judges who have \nbeen nominated by this President have been confirmed by this Senate.\n  We have an advise and consent responsibility. The Constitution does \nnot say the President has a right to pick somebody and say to that \nperson: For the rest of your life you will be a Federal judge.\n  That is not the way the Framers of the Constitution described it. \nThis described a dual role. The President shall nominate; the U.S. \nSenate shall confirm--advise and consent. Even George Washington ran \ninto some tough sledding. Even George Washington lost a Federal judge \nin the Senate because they wouldn't confirm one of George Washington's \njudgeship appointments or nominations. So it started with George \nWashington.\n  But when you talk about cooperation, this Senate has provided \nextraordinary cooperation with this President. We have confirmed 168 \njudges. We have tried in every way possible to be cooperative. We have \nthe lowest vacancy rate in 15 years on the Federal bench. Why? Because \nthis Senate has worked with the President to confirm 168 judges.\n  I understand my colleague wishes me to yield. I do so without losing \nmy right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, if my colleague would allow me to speak \nfor 5 minutes in morning business about an important issue to me.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Providing that I am recognized at the conclusion of the \nremarks of the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. McCAIN are located in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, will the Senator from North Dakota \nyield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Kansas for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, if I can ask for permission to speak up \nto 3 minutes on a personal tribute in morning business and that the \nfloor not be lost to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will agree, provided I am recognized following the \npresentation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Brownback are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know my colleague from West Virginia is \npreparing to speak. I will not be long. I will make a couple of \ncomments to finish what I was discussing about next week's schedule.\n  It is true the minority party in the Senate does not schedule the \nSenate; the majority party does and the majority leader does. This \nSenate is 51 to 49. Some pretend it is 100 to zero. In the \ncircumstances, for example, with the energy conference, I am a \nDemocratic conferee, and we have been disinvited and not allowed to \nattend any of the conferences with respect to the Energy bill. That is \nthe wrong way, in my judgment, to do business in the Senate. It \npretends as if one-half of the Senate doesn't exist when you do that.\n  Having said all that, I understand we don't schedule the Senate; the \nmajority leader does. We find ourselves now in the first week in \nNovember, with a number of very important appropriations bills not yet \ncompleted, with stories earlier in this week that the majority may well \nwant to put unfinished appropriations bills in another appropriations \nconference and create an omnibus bill, and bring it to the Senate as a \nconference report so Members of the Senate would be prevented from \noffering any amendments to the legislation.\n  Well, that is not acceptable; it is not the way to do business. I \ndon't know whether that is what is being planned. I can only tell you \nthat is what I read early this week, as described by some majority \nparty aides, I guess they are called.\n  In addition to the urgency of getting appropriations bills completed, \nwe are\n\n[[Page S14244]]\n\nnow told next week's schedule will include 30 hours of debate on \njudges. Actually, there won't be any business before the Senate to \ndebate; it will just be an opportunity for the majority party to \nruminate for 30 hours about how unfair it has been that 4 nominees have \nnot been approved by the Senate--4. Mr. President, 168 judicial \nnominees sent to us by the President have been confirmed by the Senate, \nand 4 have not been. Yet you would be led to believe by all of the \ninformation spewed out of this Chamber, from all of the political vents \nthat exist here, that somehow the Senate has just been unwilling to \napprove judgeships.\n\n  We have the lowest vacancy rate on the Federal bench in 15 years. \nWhy? Because this Senate has been cooperative with this President with \nrespect to judgeships. He has nominated and we have confirmed 168. If \nnext week they want to spend time, in a moment when it is urgent to \nfinish our work on appropriations bills, instead to talk about the 4 \njudges who were not confirmed by the Senate, I want to come to spend \nsome time talking about the 168 judges, including 2 from my State, both \nRepublicans, both of whom I supported and was pleased to do so--I want \nto talk about the 168 judges we did confirm. I want the American people \nto understand what our record is with judges.\n  My colleague from West Virginia knows about the Constitution, perhaps \nmore than anyone in this Chamber. He has studied it, he has lived it, \nand he carries it in his pocket every day. His copy of the Constitution \nis one I enjoy seeing when he pulls it out of his pocket during debate \non the floor of the Senate, because he describes it in vivid detail and \ngives life to this fabric of American Government. The Constitution does \nnot say the President has a right to put a man or woman on the Federal \nbench for the rest of their lives. That is not what the Constitution \nsays. The Constitution says we will provide lifetime appointments to \nthe judiciary in the following manner: The President shall nominate, \nand the Senate shall give its advice and consent. So there are two \nsteps: The President shall nominate and the Senate shall decide yes or \nno.\n  There are circumstances where a President might say: I want to put \nsomeone on a very important Federal bench who is way outside the norm \nin terms of behavior, thought, or experience, or whatever; and the \nSenate has a right to say in that circumstance we are sorry, that is a \nperson we are simply not going to confirm, Mr. President.\n  That is not terribly unusual. George Washington failed to get one of \nhis nominees confirmed--America's first President. So it is not unusual \nfor the Senate to say, no, this is not a candidate we agree should be \nput on the Federal bench for a lifetime.\n  In most cases, the President has sent us nominees we are satisfied \nwith, and 168 of them have been approved; 4 have not been. In the \nmiddle of this time, when time is so critical and the appropriations \nbills are so urgently needed to be completed, the majority wants to \nruminate and vent for 30 hours in the middle of next week about the 4 \nwho have not been approved.\n  I say, as my colleague from Nevada has, I make no excuses for \ndeciding not to support the nomination of Mr. Estrada. I make no \nexcuses for that. Mr. Estrada wouldn't answer the questions when asked \nby the Senate Judiciary Committee. How do I know that? Because the same \nday that he was a witness before that committee, the same day his \nnomination was considered by that committee, a nominee for a judgeship \nin North Dakota was there before the committee. That candidate from \nNorth Dakota, whom I supported--and, incidentally, is a Republican--is \na fine judge. I was pleased to support him. He answered the very \nquestions put to him by that committee that Mr. Estrada refused to \nanswer.\n  Mr. Estrada refused to answer questions. He and the administration \nrefused to release information that was requested. I have no reason to \nmake any excuses for deciding to vote against Mr. Estrada. I wouldn't \nhave voted for him and didn't vote for him. I am not apologetic about \nthat.\n  If next week in the middle of all of this urgency we are going to \ntake 30 hours and decide just to have the majority party ventilate \nabout the four who did not get approved by the Senate, then I say--my \ncolleague from Nevada is here--I would like to be part of a process \nthat talks about the 168 Federal judges we did approve, all Republican \nincidentally--168 of them we did approve. We will get some pictures and \nget their story. I will talk about a few of them. I hope my colleagues \nwill as well because the American people need to understand the story, \nand the story is not of the four who didn't get approved by the Senate.\n  The story is the lowest vacancy rate in 15 years on the Federal bench \nbecause the Senate has moved forward on judgeships and because we have \nconfirmed judges sent to us by this President and because we have \nsucceeded in that effort. That is the story next week. If we are going \nto have 30 hours for the other side to ventilate about the 4 who didn't \nmake it, I want 60 hours to talk about the 168 we did confirm.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, through its shortsighted actions, this \nadministration perpetuates an infinite mirage and a boundless facade. \nThis administration hopes to fool the American people into swallowing \nits wrongheaded policies with no questions asked. These\n\n[[Page S14245]]\n\npolicies have a superficial appearance of reality, but they are beyond \ncomprehension--beyond grasp. They hover like a mirage on the horizon. \nWe are lulled into believing that if we just stay the course, we will \neventually reach some sweet, glorious watering hole. However, the truth \nis that there is nothing tangible, nothing solid, nothing with form or \nsubstance on the horizon.\n  Regardless of whether it is Iraq or an energy bill, one need only \nconnect the dots to see that the same questionable tactics are readily \napparent. When the President announced to the world, ``Either you are \nwith us or against us,'' he alienated many potential allies abroad. The \nadministration uses the same posturing in terms of an energy bill. It \nis either the administration's way or no way, as it opposes any \nalternative approaches that do not fit into its little black box.\n  There was a horrible rush to pass the Iraqi resolution in this body \nlast year. This administration is using the same tactics to dictate the \nterms of a very bad energy bill this year. This facade is all too \nobvious as the White House's only goal is to pass a bill seemingly \nregardless of its substance or lack thereof.\n  The administration's national energy policy plan will do about as \nmuch to improve the Nation's energy security as the administration's \ninvasion of Iraq has done to stem the tide of global terrorism. In the \npast, the administration attempted to make a case that linked September \n11 and Saddam Hussein. These links have failed to materialize, but the \nadministration is still trying to make that link. Not one Iraqi was \namong the hijackers of airplanes on September 11--not one. So it must \nbe a matter of great chagrin to the administration that it has been \nunable to bring forth the evidence of that linkage.\n  Predictably, the administration is now attempting to make the same \nconnections between its national energy policy and a comprehensive \nenergy strategy. This link will also be proven groundless in the not \ntoo distant future.\n  For many years, the Middle East has been a hotbed for a number of \nreasons, especially because of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the \ncontinuing U.S. military presence in the region, but an underlying \nreason for our continued presence in the region is for the protection \nof our oil lifeline. We likely would not have such close ties to the \nMiddle East if it were not so important to our economic base. Because \nof this tethering, we are being pressured into passing an energy bill. \nUnfortunately, even if this Congress passes the administration's \nprescribed energy bill, that will do little, if anything, to reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  Instead of striving to disentangle ourselves from this foreign oil \ndependency, the Bush administration seems intent on sinking our \nmilitary and energy fortunes deeper and deeper into the hot sands of \nthe Middle East.\n  I have spoken on this floor before regarding my concern for this \nNation's energy future. I have also addressed the Bush administration's \nlipservice and corporate coddling, which is the sum total virtually of \nits energy policy. As a recent report from the General Accounting \nOffice concludes, the Vice President's national energy policy \ndevelopment group did not solicit a broad range of views. That group \nnever sought to project future energy demand or engage future sources \nof supply. There was no plan with specific goals and objectives \ndesigned to ensure energy diversity. But the Bush administration \ninsists it has an energy policy.\n  A lot of energy went into producing it, and it has expended much \nenergy to get its bill passed. In fact, just before the lights went out \nin Manhattan, Cleveland, and Detroit, Vice President Cheney was quietly \nworking with the Republican leadership to void key electricity \nprovisions that this body was about to pass.\n  I say to my colleagues, all is not lost. Help is on the way. While \nthis Nation's citizens were stranded and sweltering in darkened subway \ntunnels in New York and without drinking water in Cleveland and \nDetroit, more rewards were being handed out. Yes, while the citizens of \nthose cities suffered, the administration was very busy. While our \nelectricity system was in a shambles, the Bush administration was \neagerly handing out hundreds of millions of dollars in sole-source \ncontracts to Halliburton--have my colleagues heard of that name \nbefore?--and Bechtel to rebuild Iraq's water and electricity \ninfrastructure. Oh, the irony.\n  Even more telling, in its statement of administration policy, the \nWhite House told energy conferees to trim the estimated $50 billion-\nplus cost of the energy bill because the pricetag was excessive.\n  Let the American people hear this: We can cut taxes for the rich, we \ncan spend $21 billion just this year to rebuild Iraq's infrastructure, \nbut the energy pricetag in the next decade at home is too expensive. \nThe truth is, regardless of its costs, the Bush administration will \nnever fully fund the programs in an energy bill as the White House is \ntoo distracted by other so-called priorities.\n  The Center for Responsive Politics reports that the energy industry \ngave more than $2.65 million to the Bush-Cheney campaign in 2000. The \noil and gas industry gave 68 percent of that total. Not surprisingly, \nmedia accounts are ripe--ripe, I say--with stories of the \nadministration's contributors who have been tripping over themselves to \ncurry favors for their particular energy interests.\n  What about other groups? Were the interests of the State and tribal \ninterests, labor unions, consumer groups, and environmental \norganizations at the table?\n  A lack of consensus on energy legislation has rightfully raised \nconcerns that the final product will be but a patchwork of compromises \nthat do not truly solve our urgent problems.\n  The Republican majority and the White House have put together what \namounts to a ``pig in a poke'' energy bill that includes a number of \nitems that remain enormously controversial and that have little to do \nwith building the bipartisan consensus essential for the development of \na national energy strategy. The legislation passed by this Senate last \nyear and this year has been largely ignored.\n\n  Now the majority is preparing to ram this hodgepodge through the \nconference, and we are being forced to swallow it, hook, line, and \nsinker. This is no way to legislate and it certainly is no way to \ndevelop such an important national policy.\n  We cannot continue to conduct the Nation's business in this way. The \nstakes are too high. Partisanship alone is threatening enough to our \nability to develop comprehensive solutions to our energy problems, but \nit is not just partisanship that is reason for worry. It is the utter \ncontempt with which this Bush administration apparently views the role \nof the legislative branch.\n  As the General Accounting Office has learned, this administration \nsimply will not tolerate legislative inquiry. This administration will \nnot tolerate fact-finding. Requests for information are often simply \ndenied. There is no room for debate, just dictums. We are not expected \nto stand on this floor and offer amendments. We are urged to sit \nquietly, we are expected to sit quietly, and wield the rubberstamp. The \npeople of West Virginia did not send me here to be a rubberstamp. I am \ncertainly not a rubberstamp.\n  Energy policy, in my estimation, drives so much of our economy and \ndefines so much of our national prosperity and security that backroom \nbargaining can threaten our Nation's future.\n  The administration used numerous promises and assumptions to sell the \nIraqi war to the American people. We were assured that the postwar \nconstruction would largely be paid for with Iraq oil revenues and the \ncooperation of other nations--nations that got the back of our hand. \nBut the President now tells us we cannot count on that money in the \nshort term and the American taxpayers will have to foot the bill.\n  We are hearing the same type of rhetoric now. We heard claims that \nthe administration's energy bill would fix all of our energy problems. \nI hope the American people are smarter than that because this energy \nbill is no panacea, and it could very well turn out to be a Pandora's \nbox.\n  We need a comprehensive approach to our energy policy. What do I mean \nby comprehensive? A comprehensive approach fully integrates four \nfundamental principles: energy security to encourage fuel diversity; \nfiscal soundness to increase economic growth and\n\n[[Page S14246]]\n\nthe efficiency of production; consumer protections to guard against \nfraud, market manipulation, and abuse; and environmental sensitivity to \nminimize the impacts from wastes and emissions.\n\n  These are essential elements for any comprehensive energy policy. \nThese elements must be fully integrated through a policy that is \ndesigned to maximize fuel diversity and efficiency of production while \nminimizing consumer abuse and environmental degradation. These elements \ncould provide a complementary path forward, but this Energy bill is a \nsignificant detour.\n  With these guiding principles in mind, we must then begin to make the \nhard choices. We must develop a truly strategic plan. Planning requires \nthat we decide how much, to what extent, and when actions must be \ntaken. It requires the development of criteria so the progress can be \nmeasured.\n  For the past three decades, the United States has struggled to find \nand secure its energy future. Administrations since Richard Nixon have \nbeen trying to craft a sensible energy policy, with some small \nsuccesses, but mostly with little significant progress to show. All too \noften, America's energy agenda has shifted--lurching first in one \ndirection, then in another. The net effect has been that the Nation has \ngrown more and more dependent on foreign oil, making America's energy \nsecurity increasingly vulnerable to manipulation and terrorist attack.\n  This Nation has not had a serious, thoughtful energy strategy or a \ncomprehensive set of energy policies for a long while. Too often, the \nGovernment has, instead, reacted to shortages, dislocations, and \nvarious energy crises. For example, the Government has tried to control \noil and natural gas prices, which only served to exacerbate supply \nshortages. For a period of time, one administration tried to prohibit \nthe use of natural gas and forced the use of coal for power generation. \nTwo decades later, another administration discouraged the use of coal \nand Federal priorities shifted to the increased use of natural gas. \nToday, the Nation finds itself caught in what Federal Reserve Chairman \nAlan Greenspan calls ``the gas trap.''\n  The energy bill soon to be before this Congress is primarily another \nreactionary effort. While there may be some strong trees planted, it is \nby no means a healthy forest. From past energy efforts, only a few \nactions, such as creating the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the Clean \nCoal Technology Program, have proven to be truly farsighted. I fear \nthat most of this energy bill will continue a business-as-usual \napproach.\n  Furthermore, we must, once and for all, realize that our energy and \nclimate change policies are two sides of the same coin. Yet we are \ndoing little, if anything, to address seriously these critical links. \nThis energy bill includes nothing substantial to address either global \nclimate change or advanced clean energy technology exports. If these \nand other key provisions are not included, why should I support such a \nflawed, misguided energy conference bill?\n  Furthermore, the administration has been seeking my support for its \nso-called FutureGen project, claiming this purported $1 billion, 10-\nyear proposal would build one large powerplant as an experiment to \naddress climate change. My support for this project is largely \ncontingent on identifying the long-term resources for FutureGen and \nknowing that it will not erode other critical energy programs. So I \nhave to say that, if the administration is expecting my support for \nFutureGen, then, in coming years I expect that the administration will \nsupport my climate change and international technology transfer \nprovisions as well. If the administration is still around.\n\n  Global warming is an Achilles' heel for this White House--one among \nother Achilles' heels. The President has shown no desire to address \nthis problem in an energy bill or anywhere else.\n  In the end, the President would dearly love a showy Rose Garden \nceremony in which to sign an energy bill and thus have a 2004 campaign \npress release to tout its so-called success. But, given this \nadministration's track record, an energy bill would simply be another \nempty soapbox for the President to stand on to announce a bankrupt \ndeal.\n  I say, where have we seen that before? While the Congress has passed \nbills and supported the Bush administration's rhetoric, the necessary \nresources to carry all this out never materialize.\n  The American people deserve much better than this. As the blackout of \nAugust 14 vividly demonstrated, this Nation's energy system--which is \nthe lifeline of our economy and national security--is on life support. \nAs we struggle to define and implement a national energy policy needed \nto address these issues, we again find ourselves on a collision course.\n  We need a new framework based on a consistent and cohesive set of \npolicies. But we must recognize that we must get to that critical \njuncture. This new framework must be designed to strengthen the law, \nnot gut it. Most importantly, as we approach this crossroads, we must \nseek to fully integrate our energy and environmental policy goals and \nobjectives in a complementary way.\n  We were told we had to rush into Iraq to contain Saddam's WMD \nprograms. Now we are being told this energy bill will reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil, counteract increasing fuel prices, and do so \nmany other things.\n  Americans should not be fooled. They will not. There are few, if any, \nbenchmarks or yardsticks from which we can truly chart our progress. \nSadly, such milestones are anathema to this administration. At the same \ntime, we have squandered a huge opportunity. The bipartisan cooperation \nin the development of this energy bill was purely superficial. Soon \nthis Senate could be asked to vote on this legislation. There is \npressure to cajole Members to swallow hard and pass it. Despite some \nsolid provisions, why should I be a party to this boondoggle?\n  A cherry-picked energy plan based on soliciting big industry campaign \ncontributions is a bankrupt policy. It takes this Nation nowhere, and \nit puts our Nation's future at risk. It is time that the dots were \nconnected. The same pattern by this White House continues to repeat \nitself. That pattern is statements of policy that build on infinite \nmirages and boundless facades.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today, in the few days before \nVeterans Day, to pay tribute to one of America's and one of Ohio's \nfallen sons. Twenty-seven year-old Army Specialist James Christopher \nWright, who served in the 4th Battalion, 42nd Field Artillery Regiment, \nof the 4th Infantry Division, passed away on September 18, 2003, while \ntrying to secure a hostile area near Tikrit, Iraq.\n  James Wright--known as Jimmy by his family and friends--was from \nDelhi Township, OH. In the early 1990s, he graduated from Oak Hills \nHigh School and Diamond Oaks Vocational School.\n  Growing up, Jimmy was a fun-loving kid. Friends say he was always \nready with a smile or a joke. He could make any situation seem \ncomfortable.\n  He could put people at ease.\n  Christina Schwaller, who attended Oak Hills High School with Jimmy \nsaid that he was ``very outgoing and lovable, very much the clown. He \nwas always laughing--you never had a bad moment when he was around.''\n  Jimmy also loved cars. It's a love he shared with his older brother, \nEddie. When Jimmy was still in high school, and Eddie had just \ngraduated, they bought low-riding pick-up trucks and spent hours upon \nhours outfitting them. In Iraq, Jimmy was the proud driver of a Humvee. \nToday, Eddie drives a Porsche with a memorial to his brother painted on \nthe front hood.\n\n[[Page S14247]]\n\n  In 1996, Jimmy enlisted in the Marines and served four years. In that \ntime, he toured in Bosnia, Greece, and Italy. Jimmy felt strongly about \nserving our Nation. He had a deep, abiding sense of duty--something he \nlearned from his family. His father, Edward, served in the Army for 20 \nyears and did two tours in Vietnam. He learned from his family about \nsacrifice and service.\n  After his tour with the Marines was over, Jimmy decided to settle \ndown for a short time in Delhi Township and later Waco, TX, with his \nwife, Alina, whom he had met when they were both stationed at Fort \nBragg in North Carolina. She, too, had been a Marine. As they were \nsettling in to their new civilian life, the world turned upside-down \nwith the tragic terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Once again, \nJimmy and Alina felt the familiar pull of duty--duty to the victims of \nSeptember 11th, duty to their families, duty to our country. Alina \nremembers Jimmy saying then that ``it was time to put the uniform back \non. He couldn't just sit back and not do anything.''\n  Jimmy and Alina both enlisted--this time into the Army. Jimmy was \ndeployed to Iraq on April 1, 2003. Three weeks later, he learned that \nhis wife was pregnant with a baby boy whom they named Jamison Edward. \nFive months later, Jimmy Wright gave his life fighting to secure the \nsafety and freedom of the Iraqi people--fighting to secure a peaceful \nworld and future for his unborn son. As his brother Eddie said, ``When \nJimmy died, he was doing something he loved. I'm proud of my brother. \nHe's a hero.''\n  He received the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, the Armed Forces \nServices Medal, and the Good Conduct Medal.\n  Specialist James C. Wright did not have to re-enlist. He did not have \nto fight and die for us and for his son, Jamison Edward. But he did. As \nReverend Thomas King said at Jimmy's memorial service in Ohio, ``Jimmy \nknew the dangers he faced, but he never backed down.'' He felt it was \nhis duty--his calling--to serve. He believed in what he was doing--in \nwhat he was fighting for. He wanted his son to live in a world without \nterrorism--a safe world--a world of freedom and liberty and hope.\n  Pliny the Elder wrote that ``hope is the pillar that holds up the \nworld.'' Jimmy was a man of courage, of love, of duty--and his broad \nshoulders of hope will continue to hold up the world safely above our \nheads.\n  He will continue to be that pillar as we remember his life--as we \nremember how he followed his heart, lived a life full of love, and \ndutifully responded to the call of his country.\n  Left to cherish and honor his life are his wife, Alina; his unborn \nson, Jamison Edward; his parents, Edward and Barbara; his two brothers, \nEddie and Mark and their families; and his grandmother, Josefa Wright. \nLet me say to all of them that you all remain in my thoughts and \nprayers.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n   Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, today, I rise to honor recently fallen \nsoldiers in Iraq and to recognize the mission these men and all Fort \nCarson soldiers have been accomplishing since the conflict began.\n   This past Sunday the State of Colorado lost four of its courageous \narmy warriors when a Chinook helicopter assigned to the 12th Aviation \nBrigade and attached to the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment crash landed \noutside of Baghdad. These were brave and loyal soldiers defending the \nprinciples of freedom and liberty and fighting the terrible war against \ntyranny and terrorism.\n   This helicopter was shot down in the single deadliest attack on \nAmerican troops since the war began. This attack killed a total of 16 \ntroops and injuring another nineteen. It was transporting the troops to \nQatar. Some were headed home for leave while others were getting much \nneeded rest before returning to Iraq to wage peace and rebuild the \ncountry after more than twenty years of neglect and oppression.\n   As I learn more of the four men from Fort Carson who lost their \nlives, my heart swells with pride. I am very proud of the commitment \nand sacrifice these soldiers gave to our country and our way of life. \nYet, I am also saddened. I am deeply grieved knowing that for each of \nthe brave souls have a family left behind.\n   It is a somber realization that some parent or spouse will receive \nthe worst possible news. Men in dark green uniforms will show up to \nexplain the unexplainable. As honorable as this task is, no one from \nthe army can comfort the families of Specialist Darius Jennings, \nSpecialist Brian Penisten, Sergeant Ernest Bucklew or Staff Sergeant \nDaniel Bader. These were good men and proud Americans who were pausing \nbriefly in their duty to improve the conditions in Iraq and fully \nexpected to return soon to rejoin their units.\n   This tragedy is magnified when you learn of the stories behind these \nyoung men and the lives they left behind.\n   Sergeant Dan Bader was returning to Fort Carson to see his wife and \nfourteen-month-old daughter. Last spring he tearfully kissed his wife \nand child goodbye and deployed for Operation Iraqi Freedom promising to \nreturn soon and was ever more eager to see his daughter grow with each \npassing day. He was a towering man of six foot three who was not afraid \nof anything. He fought for his family, for his unit and for America. \nHis daughter will grow up knowing her father was a hero but not knowing \nher father.\n   Specialist Brian Penisten was also coming home but he was coming \nhome to start a new family. He was coming home to his fiance in Pueblo, \nCO so they could get married this month. He called her before heading \nto the helicopter and told her everything was okay and ended the \nconversation with the words, ``I love you Mrs. Penisten.'' But now \ninstead of a wedding his two families will be attending a funeral for \nthis fallen hero.\n   This attack represents another example of the cowardice and terror \ntactics employed by Saddam loyalists and the foreign insurgents intent \non our failure to bring peace and freedom to Iraq and the region.\n  They will not succeed. Both the American troops and the Iraqi people \nare working hard to make the country better. Everywhere you turn, the \nmessage is the same. The Iraqi citizens are happy to have us there and \nour troops understand why we must be there. Whether you count the \nsocial programs being worked by our soldiers, the re-enlistments of our \nFort Carson soldiers or the over all morale of the troops, the message \nis clear. We are committed and will not quite until our task is done.\n  Some of these troops have been in the country since before Christmas \nof last year. This deployment and combat environment could easily \ndestroy morale and incentive to re-enlist. That is not so for these \nfine soldiers of Fort Carson.\n  Even through Sunday's disastrous loss, the spirit of Fort Carson \nstays strong. The executive Officer for the 3rd Armored Cavalry, said \nafter losing his four men, that, ``morale is saddened and humbled but \nwe remain resolved to continue the fight.''\n  The unit's 5,000 soldiers serving in Iraq don't have time to be \nhorrified or mourn the dead. They have a job to do.''\n  He added that they were obviously saddened by the events but ``we are \nsoldiers, cavalry troops and have to execute the mission given to us.''\n  There has been plenty of discussion lately of America's resolve and \ncommitment to seeing this through. Let me tell you that the men and \nwomen serving in Iraq are not confused and know how committed this \ncountry is to ensuring that democracy flourishes in Iraq.\n  The men and women of the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment are still \nfighting the war on the Syrian border but that has not deterred them \nfrom performing great measures for the Iraqi people. The 3rd Cavalry \nhelped rebuild a town's schools and hospitals with the help of the \nlocal mayor and town council.\n  Another program brought bookbags full of school supplies to over 200 \nlocal youth. This is a sharp contrast to the Hussein regime who did not \nprovide basic education for all children.\n  One of the American commanders said ``most people in the communities \nhere are peaceful and just want to resume moral lives but the actions \nof the aggressors place them in a position where they feel they can't \npublicly support coalition forces.'' And the Iraqi mayor said ``we are \nvery grateful for what they have done.''\n\n[[Page S14248]]\n\n  Fort Carson has retention goals that it must meet to fulfill its \nmission. This is true during war as well as during times of peace. Fort \nCarson has deployed over 12,000 troops to Iraq since last year. That \nconstitutes 80 percent of its troops. Men and women from the 3rd \nArmored Cavalry Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 10th Special Forces \nGroup and 7th Infantry Division have all supported Operation Iraqi \nFreedom.\n  Surprisingly, though the 3rd Armored Cavalry is still deployed in \nIraq, the unit has not only reached its retention goals, it has greatly \nexceeded them. In the last quarter of this past year 294 soldiers re-\nenlisted while the objective was 129. This unit is retaining almost \nthree times its goal for that period and for fiscal year 2003. Over the \nyear, the regiment had 834 soldiers re-enlist though the goal was 554 \nreenlistments.\n  It is clear to me that the soldiers who are laying their lives on the \nline; they are committed to this cause; and we need to follow their \nlead. Secretary of State Colin Powell, while leading the first gulf \nwar, said that the truly great leaders were also great followers. We in \nthe Congress need to follow the lead of men and women from Fort Carson \nand commit to this cause. We must not waver when it is politically \ncorrect to do so, when the elections are near, or when the costs are \nhigh.\n  The cost of failure is greater than any supplemental bill brought \nforward to this body. The cost of failure is immense. The cost of \nfailure will be realized not only here but through out the Arab world. \nIraq is a unique opportunity to show that freedom and democracy can \nflourish in the region.\n  This mission is that important.\n  Any loss of life is tragic and we must reflect on the ultimate \nsacrifice we ask of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines when we \nsend them into harm's way. We always hope that every person that \ndeploys to a war zone will return home to their parents, wives, \nchildren and community. Today we have four families who will be met by \nthe dark green uniforms that they all dread.\n  We can never bring SP Darius Jennings, SP Brian Penisten, SGT Ernest \nBucklew or SSG Daniel Bader back to their families alive. As much as we \nwould want, that is not possible. What Fort Carson is doing is \n`continuing the fight' and that is exactly what this Congress and this \ncountry needs to do. We need to continue the fight even when that means \nmore money appropriated, even when that means a new round of \ndeployments to Iraq, Afghanistan or other yet to be determined hot \nspots, even if that means standing up to the world community and \ndemanding they do their share.\n  The war on terror is not going to be won over night. The terrorists \nhave been honing their skills and will not quit because we ask them to. \nSurgical strikes to obscure targets will not deter them. United Nations \nresolutions with no force deployment will not dissuade them. What will \nconvince these international thugs is a commitment to stand firm in our \nresponsibility and not second guess our actions when things get \ndifficult.\n  I stand today to honor these four fallen soldiers, each of the \ninjured, and all of the men and women of Fort Carson. Your commitment \nand sense of duty is a commendable example to all Americans. I salute \nFort Carson and everything the soldiers stand for, so let this body \nrecognize SP Darius Jennings, SP Brian Penisten, SGT Ernest Bucklew, \nSSG Daniel Bader and all of Fort Carson left to carry on the fight and \nmore importantly carry on the peace.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/07/senate-section/article/S14248-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14248-S14250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                AIR QUALITY AND THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I stand here to raise some questions and \nissues of importance.\n  There are so many difficult problems that Americans must face every \nday. These include crowded roads, finding adequate and affordable \nhealth care, getting a good education for their children, and improving \ntheir economic situation.\n  I believe our constituents want and should expect the Federal \nGovernment to do whatever is possible to minimize these burdens with \nminimal intrusion.\n  I also believe that Americans want to trust that the government is \nworking to protect them from involuntary risks or dangers that will \naffect their lives, like defective products, unfair trade practices, \nand corporate fraud.\n  Or, perhaps one of the public's greatest expectations about such \nrisks is that the Federal Government will effectively stop pollution \nthat would shorten lives, put people in the hospital or otherwise harm \ntheir quality of life or their earning power. Not to speak of cancer or \ndevelopmental damage that might occur to their families.\n  It is my duty, as a Senator from Vermont and as the ranking member of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee to see that the Federal \nGovernment meets the public's expectations. Sadly, it is my duty to say \nthat in this matter the administration has grossly failed those \nexpectations and has betrayed the public's trust.\n  I am not here to simply be critical. I am here representing those \npeople, those communities, those populations who are sufferring because \nthis administration refuses to acknowledge that air pollution causes \nillness and death. Actually, maybe they do know this, but they're \nwilling to look the other way at the misguided request of big \npolluters.\n  There is a reason we have a Clean Air Act. To protect human health \nand the environment. I can not imagine any member of Congress or any \nelected or appointed official that would say that we don't need a \nFederal Clean Air Act. But this administration is getting close to that \npoint.\n  I want my colleagues to know that I will be vigilant in pointing out \nplaces where this administration is at war with the Clean Air Act. And \nthey are numerous.\n  I plan to work vigorously to defend the Clean Air Act throughout my \ntenure in this body. I will not bend on this. I will fight efforts to \nundermine the act in the energy bill, in appropriations bills, in any \nvenue that members may look for an opportunity.\n  Mr. President, 32,000 or more people are dying every year due to \npower plant pollution. This is not a new number. It was first reported \nin the year 2000 and is based on reliable, peer-reviewed science. That \nis a crisis by anyone's definition. It is a call to action.\n  But, instead of taking urgent steps or really any steps at all to \ncontrol that pollution, this administration has given the dirtiest, \noldest power plants a permanent exemption from installing modern \ncontrols that would cut millions of tons of pollutants.\n  Not only will this administration not force these power plants to cut \npollution in the future, but they announced earlier this week that they \nwould no longer penalize those power plants and refineries for \nviolating pollution limits in the past.\n  This reversal is stunning and unprecedented, to my knowledge. Just \nweeks ago, we were assured that the administration would continue to \nprosecute polluters who violated Clean Air rules in the past. Now they \nare saying let's just pretend nothing bad ever happened.\n  That is like saying, ``Let's pretend that the thousands of lives \nshortened by increased pollution from those illegal activities don't \nmatter.''\n  The combined effect of the change in rules and the evisceration of \nenforcement cripples the Clean Air Act.\n  This Bush administration is trying to unilaterally reverse the great \nprogress in air quality that we have made due to the bipartisan \nagreement in the amendments to the act passed in 1990.\n  I hope and will be working to stop this reversal through the courts \nor by other actions.\n  The so-called ``clear skies'' proposal that the Administration has \nadvertised with taxpayer dollars is too little and too late.\n  It puts off real reductions in smog and acid rain causing pollutants \nfrom power plants for many years beyond what the public's health \ndemands.\n  It puts them off beyond what the Clean Air Act could do right now if\n\n[[Page S14249]]\n\nonly the Administration had the guts to stand up to the polluters' \nlobbyists and use the act constructively.\n  At the same time that the President's proposal defers any real and \nsignificant reductions in pollution, it immediately suspends or cuts \nback on the important parts of the Clean Air Act that work right now to \nprotect local air quality from upwind sources and to push emissions \ncontrol technology forward.\n  By the agency's own analysis of clear skies in the year 2020, \nhundreds of coal-fired units representing tens of thousands of \nmegawatts, will still be operating without modern pollution controls.\n  This means that people downwind of those plants will continue to \nsuffer in communities across the nation, in 20 or more states like \nAlabama, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, \nKansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, and on.\n  This just does not make sense. The administration's proposal still \nleaves many many plants uncontrolled 18 years from now.\n  It defies the imagination that we won't ask those power plants to use \nmodern controls for a minimum of eighteen years. The technology is \navailable now and it doesn't cost that much.\n  And yet, this delay in the President's proposal and its suspension of \nparts of the current Clean Air Act, will result in more than 8,000 \npeople downwind of those plants dying prematurely every year when \ncompared to my bill, the Clean Power Act, or to a vigorous \nimplementation of today's Clean Air Act.\n  I have been prepared, as I have noted several times over the last 2 \nyears, to work with the administration to work on compromise \nlegislation. My offer has been met with deafening silence.\n  That is unfortunate for all those whose lives will be shortened, for \nthe additional acid rain that will fall, for the asthmatic children who \nwill suffer, for the increase in global warming, for the smog-blocking \nscenic vistas, and for the new lakes and fish contaminated by mercury. \nBut that silence is not unusual.\n  I have come to expect that the administration will not answer \nstraightforward questions or provide simple technical assistance.\n  And I have come to expect that the administration will not honor the \npublic's or Congress' right to obtain documents and information on \nvital environmental policy matters.\n  So it was not a surprise to me that EPA has refused to honor its \npromise to analyze the impacts of controlling mercury emissions at \nvarious levels from powerplants. If they did a decent job, it would \nshow that the Clear Skies proposal is weak and far less effective than \ntoday's control technology. Today's control technology--it is even \nworse than that.\n  It is also not a surprise to hear rumors that EPA and the utilities \nare seeking another delay in the legal deadline to control mercury and \nother air toxics. As it is, this deadline is already many years later \nthan required by the Clean Air Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have an \nadditional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. What is surprising is that anyone who has children \nwould consider such a delay. Mercury, much like lead, can cause \nsignificant neurological and developmental damage to fetuses when a \nmother consumes normal quantities of fish. It can also increase the \nrisk of heart, kidney and liver effects in adults. The National Academy \nof Sciences has documented these risks well. Let me repeat that. The \nNational Academy of Sciences has documented these risks well.\n  However, in case the mothers and fathers who are considering \nextending this deadline or proposing ineffectual rules, I have joined \nwith 12 other Senators in sending a letter to the Office of Management \nand Budget and the EPA. The letter explains their legal and moral \nduties, in the event that they have been forgotten. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the letter be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, my inescapable conclusion, unless newly \nconfirmed Administrator Leavitt can change it, is that the Bush \nadministration does not care about the burdens that polluters lay upon \nthe public.\n  Perhaps the administration does not care about the deathly ill senior \ncitizens suffering from pollution-induced heart or lung disease, or the \nparents who are struggling to help their learning disabled or \nphysically handicapped child cope with everyday life, or the 150 \nmillion Americans who are breathing unhealthy air.\n  Whatever their reasons, this administration is making it harder to \nbreathe, to see, and to trust.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 6, 2003.\n     Hon. Joshua B. Bolten,\n     Director, The Office of Management and Budget, Washington, \n         DC.\n\n     Hon. Michael O. Leavitt,\n     Administrator, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Director Bolten and Administrator Leavitt: We are \n     writing to urge the Office of Management and Budget and the \n     Environmental Protection Agency to promulgate expeditiously a \n     proposed rule to set maximum achievable control technology \n     (MACT) standards to reduce utility emissions of hazardous air \n     pollutants (HAPs), including mercury, as required by the \n     Clean Air Act. As you may know, this proposed rule must \n     comport with, at a minimum, the requirements of sections 112 \n     and 307 of the Clean Air Act, the Administrative Procedures \n     Act, Executive Order 12866, and all applicable settlement \n     agreements. News accounts suggest that the rule is being \n     written to include an arbitrary reduction requirement and \n     compliance date that are not justifiable given the Clean Air \n     Act's specific language, and in a manner that may not produce \n     a defensible proposal.\n       The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 require EPA to \n     promulgate national technology-based standards for utilities \n     that emit hazardous air pollutants, if deemed appropriate and \n     necessary by the Administrator. After many years of Agency \n     delay on that utility MACT standards rule, a settlement \n     agreement was entered into between EPA and environmental \n     organizations. The settlement agreement required EPA to sign \n     a determination of whether regulation of utility HAP \n     emissions is appropriate and necessary, and to follow a \n     positive determination with a proposed and finalized rule, by \n     dates certain. Pursuant to that settlement agreement, as last \n     modified in November 1998, EPA Administrator Carol Browner \n     finally made a regulatory determination in December 2000 that \n     it was appropriate and necessary to regulate utility HAP \n     emissions through the MACT regulatory process. Under this \n     agreement, EPA must now publish a proposed utility MACT rule \n     by December 15, 2003, and a final rule by December 15, 2004, \n     with the compliance date set for December of 2007.\n       In general, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 require \n     EPA to set a MACT standard that achieves the maximum degree \n     of reduction in emissions of hazardous air pollutants from \n     all new and existing major and area stationary sources, \n     taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission \n     reduction, and any non-air quality health and environmental \n     impacts and energy requirements. But, section 112 of that Act \n     defines MACT for new facilities as an emission standard no \n     less stringent than what is achieved in practice by the best-\n     performing similar source for which the Administrator has \n     emissions information. Existing sources are required, at a \n     minimum, to meet the average emissions of the best \n     performing 12% of existing units, though EPA can set a \n     more stringent standard. Section 112 (f) also requires EPA \n     to assess the remaining (i.e., ``residual'') risks posed \n     to human health within eight years after the promulgation \n     of MACT standards, and regulate sources of HAPs to provide \n     an ample margin of safety to protect public health. The \n     EPA has moved responsibly in the past to regulate mercury \n     emissions from all major non-utility sources, leaving \n     utilities as the largest source of mercury air emissions \n     in the country.\n       According to data collected by EPA and presented to \n     industry groups in December 2001, there are technologies \n     available today to reduce mercury and other HAPs from \n     utilities in an efficient and economical manner. In fact, \n     EPA's own analysis shows that several of today's technologies \n     can control mercury emissions from coal-fired utilities by \n     99% for new sources, and by 98% for existing sources, without \n     subcategorization by coal type. The upcoming utility MACT \n     proposed rule must reflect this technological capability. \n     Furthermore, given that this technology is already available \n     today, there is no defensible reason to delay for any source \n     the compliance date of December 2007, a deadline mandated by \n     both the Clean Air Act and the settlement agreement.\n       Section 112 (d) of the Act allows for subcategorization of \n     the standard, but only by class, type, and size of source, \n     assuming it does not result in a delay of the compliance \n     date. In other words, subcategorization is allowable for \n     physical differences in plant design. We are concerned that \n     EPA may be\n\n[[Page S14250]]\n\n     considering subcategorization by coal type, which does not \n     constitute one of these allowable distinctions. Including \n     such a subcategorization in the MACT rule would not be \n     legally defensible.\n       As you know, the Executive Order on regulatory review (No. \n     12866) enhances planning and coordination with respect to new \n     and existing regulations, with the understanding that the, \n     ``. . . American people deserve a regulatory system that \n     works for them, not against them: a regulatory system that \n     protects and improves their health, safety, environment, and \n     well-being. . . .'' In particular, E.O. 12866 states that in \n     deciding whether and how to regulate, agencies should assess \n     all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives. \n     Further, in choosing among alternative regulatory approaches, \n     agencies should select those approaches that maximize net \n     benefits, including potential economic, environmental, public \n     health and safety, and other advantages, as well as \n     distributive impacts and equity.\n       Despite that directive, we are concerned that EPA and OMB \n     may not be considering a full range of regulatory options \n     that includes accurate implementation of the Clean Air Act, \n     namely, a standard based on technologies available today that \n     can achieve a 98%+ reduction in mercury emissions. We expect \n     the upcoming proposal to reflect what the law requires by \n     offering either the most stringent technology standard for \n     public comment, or at least a range of options that includes \n     this most stringent standard. We also expect that the \n     regulatory impact assessment, as required by the Executive \n     Order, which accompanies the proposed rule to include an \n     assessment, and the underlying analysis, of the costs and \n     benefits (including reductions in other air pollutants \n     such as fine particulate matter) of potentially effective \n     and reasonably feasible alternatives to the proposed rule \n     that have been identified by the public.\n       We are also troubled that the Clean Air Act Advisory \n     Committee established under the Federal Advisory Committee \n     Act to advise EPA on development of utility MACT standards \n     has not received promised analyses and has been \n     inappropriately and abruptly excluded from the regulatory \n     process. EPA worked with industries, environmental \n     organizations, and State and local agencies in the context of \n     these FACA workgroup meetings over a two year period. During \n     these meetings, environmental stakeholders requested specific \n     considerations and mercury reduction scenarios to be included \n     in a model the Agency was developing.\n       The Agency promised to incorporate group recommendations \n     and deliver findings of this updated modeling to the \n     workgroup by March 4, 2003, yet the analysis was not \n     available by that time. The Agency promised then to share the \n     analysis by April 15, 2003, yet the analysis was again not \n     available, and EPA staff abruptly cancelled that day's \n     workgroup meeting, saying, ``We will get back to you \n     regarding a future meeting.'' The utility workgroup was never \n     able to schedule a subsequent meeting with the Agency, and \n     has still not received the modeling analysis promised almost \n     eight months ago. This failure to deliver promised analysis \n     is unacceptable, and the abrupt exclusion of stakeholder \n     involvement is not good governance.\n       We expect the Environmental Protection Agency and the \n     Office and Management and Budget to propose utility MACT \n     standards on schedule. We expect that proposal will use the \n     best performing facilities as the guide in setting standards \n     that obtain the maximum reductions achievable. We also expect \n     EPA to deliver on its promises by swiftly completing and \n     distributing to the workgroup the modeling analysis for \n     group-specified mercury reduction scenarios. Further, we \n     expect EPA to continue to work in good faith to incorporate \n     public comment on the proposal and finalize a thoughtful rule \n     by December 15, 2004, while maintaining the December 2007 \n     compliance date. To do any less would be legally \n     indefensible, and would prolong damage to the public's \n     health.\n       It is well documented that mercury from utility air \n     emissions endangers our health and environment by depositing \n     into our lakes, streams, and oceans and bioaccumulating in \n     the fish we eat. The National Academy of Sciences has \n     confirmed that fish consumption by pregnant women can lead to \n     neuro-developmental damage in fetuses, and that all other \n     adults can be put at greater risk of heart, kidney, and liver \n     effects. Due to this public health threat, 44 States now post \n     advisories warning the public about the risks of fish \n     consumption. Dozens of other toxic air pollutants are \n     released in significant quantities from power plants as well, \n     including arsenic, cadmium, and lead, many of which are known \n     carcinogens. The Clean Air Act does not allow for \n     promulgation of a rule on this matter that is ineffectual in \n     reducing to the maximum extent achievable the major HAPs \n     emitted by utilities.\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter. We look \n     forward to your prompt response.\n           Sincerely,\n         Jim Jeffords, Olympia Snowe, Joseph Biden, Ted Kennedy, \n           Hillary Rodham Clinton, Jack Reed, Dick Durbin, Patrick \n           J. Leahy, Susan M. Collins, Frank Lautenberg, John F. \n           Kerry, Lincoln D. Chafee, Charles Schumer.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Mr. President, Mr. Carper, the Senator from Delaware, \nis on the floor. He may want to speak in a few minutes. I have a few \ncomments I would like to make about the debate we are having about \nunfunded mandates and Internet access taxes.\n  First, I thank Senator McCain, the chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee, who has been working very hard to help bridge what is a \nfairly big philosophical difference of opinion some of us have, and I \nexpress my appreciation to the leader, Bill Frist, because he created \nsome time today and last night for us to debate and talk about the \nissues. I think we have made some progress.\n  But here is where we are. As with most of our debates in the Senate, \nwe have two valid principles in which most of us believe: First is, no \ntaxation of Internet access. I have yet to run into a Senator who \nreally wants to tax Internet access. Virtually all of us are willing to \nkeep State and local governments from taxing Internet access.\n  I am a little bit of a purist on unfunded Federal mandates, with \nWashington politics telling State and local officials what to do, but \nthe amendment which I have offered, and which Senator Carper and others \nhave joined in, would ban State and local government taxation of \nInternet access.\n  That is the first principle. We want the Internet to grow. We don't \nwant local taxation. We don't want taxation that discriminates.\n  The second principle is, we don't want unfunded Federal mandates. \nThat may be a little bit of a Washington word, but most people know \nwhat it means. It means Senators and Congressmen who come to Washington \nand pass laws and claim credit and send the bill to the school boards \nand Governors and mayors. Nothing makes local officials madder. This \nCongress, to its great credit, since 1995, has been very resolved \nagainst unfunded Federal mandates. So we don't want to tax Internet \naccess and we don't want unfunded Federal mandates.\n  We haven't found out how to put the two together. We have offered a \nsolution. There are really two basic ones out there. Ours would be to \njust take the current law, the current ban on taxing Internet access or \nallowing State and local governments to make that decision, and extend \nit for 2 years, and then to make a change to minimize discrimination \nbetween providers, providers being phone companies and the cable \ncompanies. That is our proposal.\n  The proposal on the other side was to create a much broader \ndefinition of what we mean by Internet access which would create a huge \nunfunded Federal mandate and take away, we believe, billions of dollars \nfrom State and local government tax bases, cause them to cut services \nor raise taxes on many other things, and make it permanent. That is the \nproposal.\n  Our argument is that our 2-year extension of the current law, with \none adjustment to level the playing field between telephone companies \nand cable companies, is better for the country than a permanent \ninstallation of a very broad definition. So the issues are duration and \ndefinition.\n  The reasons for our amendment are these. One, we want to preserve the \noriginal intent of the Congress. The 1998 law was to keep the basic \nInternet access tax free. By that we mean, when you hook up your \ncomputer to AOL, the intention is that that is tax free. In our \namendment, even as the telecommunications industry moves more on to the \nInternet, that would continue to be tax free. It is really a \nsignificant infringement on State and local prerogatives to decide what \ntaxes to raise\n\n[[Page S14251]]\n\non their own. We want to make sure no one will be able to tax e-mail or \nsurfing the Web. We want to make sure that States don't lose the bulk \nof their telecommunications revenues. Those were our major goals.\n  The opponents have raised many objections to these ideas. They say \nthe Internet is so valuable that it should not be taxed. Well, we don't \ntax it any more than it is now. We don't allow taxing any more than it \nis now. And it makes me wonder. I agree the Internet is valuable. I \nsupported the first moratorium. But it is a grown-up business now. It \nis no baby in a crib. We had 3 years and then 2 years. Now we are \ntalking about another 2 years.\n  The telephone is valuable. Television is valuable. Airplanes are \nvaluable. The automobile was a great invention. We don't tell State and \nlocal governments what to do about their tax policy for those \nbusinesses. The Internet is not a baby in a crib anymore. It can at \nleast afford to hire some of the most expensive lobbyists; we know \nthat.\n  Then they talk about interstate commerce, that we are messing around \nwith interstate commerce when we talk about telling States what to do \nabout taxing Internet access. I read the Constitution again to make \nsure I was right. Article I, section 8, says Congress has the power to \nregulate commerce among the States, but it doesn't say exactly what to \ndo about it. It means Congress can impose limits. They can do some \nthings.\n\n  There is also another provision called the 10th amendment which \nreserves all the powers to the States unless they are specifically \ndelegated to the Congress. That is where the whole prohibition against \nunfunded Federal mandates came from. That is why, in 1995, this \nCongress passed as its first bill S. 1 of the new Republican Congress, \nto stop unfunded Federal mandates--Congress telling Governors and \nmayors and school boards what services to provide and how to spend \ntheir money.\n  As long as we are allowing States to make decisions about taxation on \ntelephones and telegraphs and bus tickets and airline tickets and \nseverance taxes, all of which are interstate commerce, I don't know why \nwe worry so much about that.\n  There is the assertion that we might be taxing broadband. That is \nInternet service delivered by telephone and cable companies. We are \nreally not taxing anything. We are trying to decide whether we should \nwrite some rules for what States should do. Broadband is a wonderful \nthing. It is always just around the bend. We want to it come. What we \nhave said is that except for grandfathered States that now tax DSL \nInternet phone service, it can't be taxed in the next 2 years. We are \njust trying to level the playing field for 2 years, as we take the \ncurrent law and extend it for that period of time.\n  Multiple taxation would be banned under our amendment, just as it is \ntoday. Discriminatory taxation is banned under our amendment, just as \nit is today. Taxes on e-mail and basic Internet access, banned, just as \nthey are now.\n  So it seems to us our amendment is a good one. We are willing to \ncontinue to visit and talk with the Senator from Virginia and the \nSenator from Oregon, who have worked very hard and believe very \nstrongly in this. But our arguments are, the Congress has promised not \nto pass any more unfunded mandates. We have made it a violation of the \nBudget Act to do so. We should respect that as much as we possibly can. \nNo. 2, their proposal is potentially a huge unfunded Federal mandate \nwhich we have promised not to do.\n  We believe our amendment is better at reconciling two valid \nprinciples: One, continuing the ban on basic Internet access and, two, \nmaking an adjustment to create a more level playing field between cable \nand telephone while making a minimum offense to the principle of \nunfunded Federal mandates.\n  We also believe that a short term--a couple of years--allows us to \ncraft wise decisions about what is happening in a rapidly changing \ntechnology, and theirs would impose an inordinately broad definition of \nwhat we mean by Internet access permanently or for an unreasonably long \nperiod of time.\n  There was a letter sent around from the Republican Policy Committee \nwhich asserted that the objective of the unfunded mandate law was to \nstop the Federal Government from imposing affirmative duties or \nregulations on the States. It basically argues that the Allen-Wyden \namendment is not an unfunded mandate. All I can think is that that memo \ndidn't make it all the way through the vetting process. It argues that \nthe unfunded mandate law Congress passed in 1995 doesn't apply to \nsituations where the Congress might say, for example, States may not \ncollect taxes on telephones and telegraphs. If we were to say that, \nthat would mean State and local governments would be deprived of $20 \nbillion of their tax base next year, and they would have to raise taxes \non food or medicine or income or property or something else, or cut \nservices.\n  By the very plain terms of the Unfunded Mandates Act of 1995, it \nincludes both affirmative actions. For example, when we pass a bill \nthat says Memphis shall do thus and so for disabled children but we \nonly pay for half of the cost, that is one kind of unfunded mandate.\n  But according to the Congressional Budget Office and the plain \nEnglish in the 1995 law, it also includes the definition of direct cost \nof a mandate, ``the amounts State and local governments would be \nprohibited from raising in revenues to comply with the mandate.'' An \nunfunded Federal mandate also includes our telling the States you \ncannot raise revenues from these sources. If we think it is so \nimportant to do that, we are supposed to pay that.\n  I am afraid in this case the Allen-Wyden amendment, while they have \nworked hard to try to narrow it, still raises the possibility many \nbillions of dollars would be lost to State and local tax bases. In \nother words, we would be imposing a multibillion dollar unfunded \nFederal mandate on State and local governments.\n  We believe there is a better way, that we can continue the ban on \nInternet access, but do it in a way that minimizes the unfunded Federal \nmandate. Because the leader asked us to, and we want to, we will be \nworking over the weekend, and our staffs are meeting this afternoon. We \nwill be working early next week, and we hope we can come to some \nagreement in a very short period of time.\n  I am grateful to Senator Carper for his leadership in helping us come \nup with a sensible path in the future. I wanted to give that report on \nthe status of where we are.\n  Mr. CARPER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Yes.\n  Mr. CARPER. Let me just say if I have provided leadership, I know the \nSenator from Tennessee has. I have enjoyed the opportunity to work \nclosely with the Senator from Tennessee, Senator Voinovich, Senator \nGraham of Florida, and others on this issue. I reflect on the role we \nas Senators are trying to play in this and the disadvantage some of us \noperate from. The Presiding Officer and I serve on the Banking \nCommittee together. If the issue before us is like the Fair Credit \nReporting Act, we have a fairly good idea, using our background and \nexperience, as to what is fair and reasonable; what makes sense and \nwhat is good public policy. If the issue is energy policy, I think our \nbackground prepares us to make reasonably good judgments there.\n  When we come to issues with respect to the Internet and the \ntransmission of information over the Internet, for a lot of our \ncolleagues--certainly this one--it doesn't take long to get in over our \nheads. If we are honest, I think most will say that. In order to help \nus through a difficult issue like the one we have now, whether there \nshould be a continuation of a moratorium on Internet taxes and in what \nform, and should it be extended, we have bright people who work on our \nstaffs, and we speak to people from the outside, whether they happen to \nbe from the industry or State and local governments, to round out our \nknowledge. But it is still a different result.\n  For this Senator--I suspect I speak for the other Senators here at \nthis moment--what I think we can maybe best do is figure out the fair \nthing to do. I always like to talk about the Golden Rule, to treat \nothers like I want to be treated. I try to apply that even in this \ninstance. If you look back to the 1995 law Senator Alexander talked \nabout, the genesis of that law was Governors like he and I used to be, \nand even mayors in places like Gillette, WY, who didn't want the \nFederal Government to tell them what to do and not give them\n\n[[Page S14252]]\n\nthe money to do it. Similarly, whether you are a Governor or mayor, we \ndidn't much appreciate the Federal Government coming in and saying we \nare going to take away your ability to raise revenues as you see fit \nand not make up for the shortfall.\n\n  That sense of outrage sort of grew out of State and local officials, \nand eventually came here and compelled the Congress to take steps to \nenact the 1995 legislation, banning unfunded mandates both under \nspending and on the revenue side. Today you cannot do that. For the \nmost part, Congress and the President since have done a good job \nadhering to that law.\n  What is before us now is how do we be true to the spirit of the \nunfunded mandates law, not taking away the revenue base of the States \nand, at the same time, trying to be fair to consumers. People want to \nhave access to the Internet, whether residential consumers or \nbusinesses, and how do we manage to be fair to the businesses that are \nproviding these services? I am not going to suggest any of that either. \nIf I could, we would have finished before this week and we would all be \nin Wyoming, Tennessee, or Delaware, doing other things. But we are not \nthere yet.\n  The hangup is, as the Senator suggested, the moratorium that has been \nin effect for the last 5 years says you cannot access the Internet and \nadd a tax to somebody who has a monthly internet bill. It says if two \nStates or more want to tax in that transaction, you cannot do that. \nMultiple taxes are something you cannot do. The same legislation has \nsaid if there is a discriminatory tax somebody wants to impose on \nInternet transactions, you cannot do it. For example, Delaware has no \nsales tax. To say for a person who goes to the local book store and \nbuys a book in Delaware that you don't have a sales tax, but if you buy \nthat same book over the Internet, you have a tax imposed, that is a \ndiscriminatory tax. The law in effect for 5 years said you cannot do \nthat.\n  What Senator Alexander, Senator Voinovich, Senator Graham, Senator \nEnzi, and a number of others are seeking to do is to simply say the law \nin effect for the last 5 years, which prohibits those kinds of \nactivities, stays in effect. Because the world is changing in the way \npeople access the Internet, through broadband and DSL, which a couple \nof months ago I could not even spell, today turned out to be a key \ncomponent of this debate. But how do we change the old 5-year \nmoratorium in a way that is fair, for instance, to the baby bells, to \ntheir business interests? What can we do that is fair and will enable \nthem to be competitive, level the competitive playing field for them. \nThey have suggested that whether you are getting your Internet service \nfrom a cable provider or a telephone company, State and local \ngovernments should not be allowed to tax that access to the Internet, \nat least for the end user.\n  Here is where our divide is with our friends, Senator Allen of \nVirginia and Senator Wyden from Oregon. The question is: Where do we \nprohibit the imposition of the tax? At what point? Starting with the \nconsumer in his or her home, the business in its operation, all the way \nback up to the ISP, through the infrastructure to the backbone--where \ndoes access to the Internet begin? We argue in our definition in our \nproposal the access begins between the provider, ISP, and the consumer, \nwhether a business or an individual.\n  Other colleagues, who have a different view, have a much broader \nvision of where the Internet access comes from--much more expansive, \nand by their expanded definition, they expand the prohibition \ndramatically on what State and local governments can tax to raise \nrevenues. I think there is an honest disagreement here. We believe we \nshould focus on what I call the last mile. There are others who believe \nwe should focus on the first mile, all the way through the last mile. \nWhen we do that, we take for the States potentially a fair amount of \nrevenue generation capability off of the table at a time when obviously \nthey are hurting and they need every dime they can raise.\n  I don't know if we can resolve this difference. I think we had a good \nhonest go of it today. Senator McCain is trying very hard to broker \nsome kind of agreement. We may be successful or we may not. Ultimately, \nwe may have to just vote.\n  I say this to our friends who have a different view than Senator \nAlexander, Senator Voinovich, the Presiding Officer, and myself: We in \nDelaware have learned over the years to make our State a real \nattractive place to do business. If other States want to impose fees or \ntaxes on services, and we are smart enough in my State to not do that \nand then go to the businesses that are maybe being mistreated by \nregulatory or tax policies in another State, and say, Come to Delaware; \nyou won't have to put up with any of that frankly, it has a good \nargument.\n  In a variety of ways, financial services and other sections of our \neconomy are stronger today because we have chosen not to impose certain \ntaxes or fees. We have gone to sections of the economy and said: Look \nwhat we have in our State.\n  I say to those who have a different view than Senator Alexander, \nSenator Enzi, and myself: Don't discount the competitive nature of \nStates and how some of us will elect not to impose a tax on any of this \nbusiness in an effort to be far more attractive to those kinds of \nbusinesses as we go down the road.\n  I thank my colleague for the good work he is doing and say to him how \nmuch I have enjoyed working with him on this issue, clean air issues, \nand others. I hope this is a harbinger of things to come.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is still under a unanimous consent \nagreement to yield as much time as the Senator wishes to the Senator \nfrom Delaware.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, as I was listening to Senator Carper, I \nwas thinking about what he just said. I believe I am right about this, \nbut Senator Carper can correct me: What we are saying in our amendment \nis if the Senator from Delaware or I hook up a computer to the \nInternet, our amendment would prohibit State and local governments from \ntaxing that event; isn't that right?\n  Mr. CARPER. I think the Senator has that right.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. That would be true even if Internet access moved over \nfrom the current way many people do it--and this is hard for people to \nunderstand many times--over to the cable or the phone company; is that \nright as well?\n  Mr. CARPER. Five years ago when this legislation was written on the \nmoratorium, I don't believe DSL existed. The idea of people accessing \nthe Internet over broadband was not something people thought much of. \nThe idea of accessing the Internet over wireless I don't think is \nsomething we thought we had the capability of doing. The world has \nchanged.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. So from the point of view of the Federal Government \ninterfering with local governments, we would be making a pretty \nsignificant interference there because we would be affording to the \nInternet access connection a protection that we didn't afford the \ntelephone, that we didn't afford the telegraph, that we didn't afford \nthe purchase of food, the purchase of medicine--anything. If you hook \nup your Internet, nobody can tax you. That would be our proposal.\n\n  The other point the Senator from Delaware is making--Delaware in \nparticular has done this--is, say, in the District of Columbia there \nwas a big cable company or big phone company, and the District of \nColumbia said: We may not be able to tax the connection between Senator \nAlexander's computer, but we can sure tax the cable company, we can \nsure tax the telephone company that provides that connection, and they \nraise the taxes to a very high level for certain of these points along \nthe Internet architecture. I assume it is entirely possible the \nGovernor of Delaware may ride the train down to the District and say: \nThe tax may be 20 percent, but come live with us in Delaware; come to \nour State; we don't have a right-to-work law; other States do; we don't \nhave an income tax; other States do. We may have a higher corporate tax \nthan other States. States have these differences all the time, and if \none State gets out of line, people leave, businesses leave, elections \nare held and people are\n\n[[Page S14253]]\n\nthrown out of office. That is the way we have operated the government \nfor a long time.\n  This is a nation that from its beginning operated community by \ncommunity and State by State and has had a great aversion to central \ndirection of too many of these decisions.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I say in response, that is the way States \nand competition--friendly competition--have worked over the years, and \nif it worked in the last century, it is going to work out that way in \nthis century as well.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the \nRecord two editorials from Tennessee newspapers: One from the \nTennessean and one from the Chattanooga Times Free Press. They just \ncame today.\n  The last sentence in the Chattanooga Times Free Press article says:\n\n       If the federal tax ban becomes permanent, state and local \n     governments may have to come up with great amounts of tax \n     money in other burdensome and permanent ways that taxpayers \n     will not like.\n\n  The Tennessean says:\n\n       Sen. Lamar Alexander is not voting to raise taxes. He is \n     not trying to increase the cost of Internet access, nor is he \n     advocating a new tax on e-mail.\n       Instead, Alexander is trying to protect states from \n     excessive control by the federal government. Yet the \n     conservative states-rights position the senator has taken on \n     Internet access has been turned on its ear by some of his \n     critics. . . .\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Tennessean, Nov. 7, 2003]\n\n             Alexander's Principled Stand for State Control\n\n       Senator Lamar Alexander is not voting to raise taxes. He is \n     not trying to increase the cost of Internet access, nor is he \n     advocating a new tax on e-mail.\n       Instead, Alexander is trying to protect States from \n     excessive control by the federal government. Yet the \n     conservative, States-rights position the senator has taken on \n     Internet access taxes has been turned on its ear by his \n     critics, many of whom are Republicans.\n       Congress placed a moratorium on Internet access taxes in \n     1998. The few states, including Tennessee, that had taxed \n     Internet access before the moratorium were allowed to keep \n     their tax. The moratorium officially ended last week.\n       Now the House has passed legislation co-sponsored by \n     Representative Marsha Blackburn that would make the \n     moratorium permanent and would eliminate all exemptions. In \n     the Senate, Alexander opposes a permanent moratorium. He \n     points out that Congress shouldn't micromanage the financial \n     affairs of cities and States. And he points out that the few \n     States that are exempt from the moratorium would lose between \n     $80 million and $120 million in revenue if their exemptions \n     end. That loss of revenue would force the States to increase \n     taxes elsewhere.\n       Up until last week, Alexander was one of several senators \n     who had placed a hold on the moratorium legislation, but he \n     agreed to lift his hold on the bill last week in exchange for \n     a Senate debate on the issue this week.\n       No one wants to pay more taxes. No doubt, Tennesseans, who \n     are already paying tax on Internet access, would love to pay \n     less for Internet connections.\n       But the question in the Senate isn't whether the Internet \n     taxes should go up or down, or whether they should exist at \n     all. The question is whether the Federal government should \n     tell States what they can and cannot tax. Alexander says it \n     should not, and he is right. Tennesseans who want to \n     eliminate Internet access taxes should contact Governor Phil \n     Bredesen and members of the General Assembly.\n       Tennesseans elected Lamar Alexander to the Senate because \n     they believed he would exercise his own good judgment and act \n     in the best interest of Tennessee. On this bill, he is.\n                                  ____\n\n\n         [From the Chattanooga Times Free Press, Nov. 7, 2003]\n\n                        It's About Taxes--Yours\n\n       It's not the kind of issue that generates lots of public \n     attention or quick understanding. But when Senator Lamar \n     Alexander, R-Tenn., took the Senate floor this week to \n     discuss it, he wanted to make sure everyone understood that \n     the proposed Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act involves ``an \n     unfunded Federal mandate''--which could result in State and \n     local tax losses of $80 million to $120 million a year, that \n     local taxpayers might have to make up.\n       Some time ago, to promote development of the Internet and \n     other electronic communications, Congress banned taxes on \n     Internet access until November 1, 2003, with some exceptions \n     to expire October 1, 2006. The bill now before Congress would \n     make those taxing bans permanent. Since most people don't \n     like any kind of taxes, why shouldn't the ban be permanent?\n       Senator Alexander explained: ``We are not talking about the \n     issue of whether to authorize States to require out-of-State \n     companies, such as L.L. Bean, that sell by catalog or \n     Internet, to collect the same Tennessee sales tax'' that \n     local stores must collect. . . . ``That is an entirely \n     different piece of legislation.'' (We believe such \n     legislation should be passed to provide more State revenue \n     and thus avoid the necessity of imposing other taxes on \n     Tennesseans.) Senator Alexander continued: ``What we're \n     talking about is whether Tennessee and other States can \n     collect a sales tax from an Internet service provider when it \n     connects my computer to the Internet, just as it collects a \n     sales tax from the telephone company when it connects my \n     telephone or from the cable TV company when it connects my \n     cable.''\n       He said some senator seemed surprised when he suggested the \n     proposed permanent ban on State and local taxation is ``an \n     unfunded Federal mandate.'' But, Senator Alexander insisted, \n     it ``is an unfunded mandate, plainly in violation of the \n     Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 . . .''\n       Senator Alexander said the Tennessee Department of Revenue \n     estimates that making the tax ban permanent would cost \n     Tennessee many millions of dollars a year. With Tennessee \n     finances already pinched, how would that amount be made up \n     without new State taxes?\n       So, said Senator Alexander, ``I am filing tonight an \n     amendment I call the Unfunded Federal Mandate Reimbursement \n     Act. If a majority of the Senate should decide that banning \n     State and local taxation of the Internet is important enough \n     to create an unfunded Federal mandate--that is, claim the \n     credit up here (in Washington), but make it be done down \n     there (in Tennessee and other States)--then my amendment \n     would provide a way for Congress to pay the bill for that by \n     authorizing our Department of the Treasury to reimburse \n     Tennessee and Minnesota and other State and local governments \n     each year for the cost of this new mandate.''\n       Don't expect Congress to rush to embrace Senator \n     Alexander's amendment. But he has made a point that deserves \n     serious consideration.\n       If the Federal tax ban becomes permanent, State and local \n     governments may have to come up with great amounts of tax \n     money in other burdensome and permanent ways that taxpayers \n     will not like.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I believe the more Senator Carper, \nSenator Voinovich, Senator Enzi, Senator Graham, and I talk about this \nissue, the more people are coming our way. I look forward to continuing \nto work with other Senators who have different views, and I hope we can \ncome up with a good conclusion to this that respects both principles: \nbanning taxation of Internet access and not imposing large unfunded \nFederal mandates on State and local governments.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to support the amendment \nto be offered by my friends and fellow former Governors, Senators \nGraham, Alexander, Carper, and Voinovich.\n  The amendment is a very simple one. Every Senator who is aware of the \nfiscal crisis faced by States across the Nation, which I think at this \npoint is virtually all States, ought to support this amendment, in my \njudgment.\n  The amendment simply says we ought to continue the current moratorium \non Internet taxes for another 2 years, giving the industry additional \ntime to reach out to new customers and ensuring that we do not undercut \nStates' long-term ability to balance their budgets, because there is an \nenormous relationship between Internet taxes and State budgets. In \nfact, this amendment improves on the previous moratorium by ensuring \nthat consumers' access to the Internet is tax-free. Regardless of the \ntechnology they prefer, be that DSL, cable modem, wireless phone, \ntraditional dial-up access, they would all be treated the same under \nthis amendment.\n  I know many of my colleagues are interested in providing a permanent \nmoratorium on the taxation of Internet access, but I ask them to take a \nmoment to consider the potential harm of the bill we are debating \ntoday.\n  Governors, State legislators, and mayors from across this country \nhave called my office, and I would think the offices of most Senators, \nto implore us not to pass the legislation. I understand the moratorium \nenvisioned in this other amendment applies only to taxes imposed on \naccess to the Internet. However, our good intentions are\n\n[[Page S14254]]\n\nnot enough to ensure that this legislation is properly applied and that \nthe States are able to collect taxes on other telecommunications \nservices.\n  Technology, as you well know, is still developing. In the near \nfuture, the providers of Internet services may offer telecommunications \nservices as part of a premium package of technology products. Digital \ncontent presents additional challenges. I believe somebody purchasing a \nnew movie should be taxed on that, whether they download the movie from \nthe Internet provider or they purchase it from Amazon.com or they walk \nover to Blockbuster and buy it off the shelf. As technology develops \nand more and more options are available to consumers, Congress will \nobviously need to revisit this issue of what exactly falls within this \nmoratorium since the technology changes so often.\n  This amendment would protect States' rights to impose fair and \nequitable taxes on products other than Internet access. As a former \nGovernor, I remember very well the difficulty of financing critical \nState services. I was Governor some 20 years ago, but we were having \nthose troubles then. They are much worse now.\n  I worked hard with the State legislature to achieve the right balance \nof taxes and spending. That was hard. I needed the maximum flexibility. \nIt has been some time now, as I indicated, since I was Governor, but \nover the last few years we have witnessed again how States often \nstruggle to balance their budgets and how, in fact, virtually every \nsingle State is going through that process.\n  It seems somewhat arrogant and unfair for us as Federal legislators \nto permanently limit the options available to States. I feel very \nstrongly about that. I in no way want to disadvantage development of \nthe Internet, but I want to respect the rights of other elected \nofficials in West Virginia and in other States, and I believe in that \nstrongly.\n\n  I believe a 2-year extension of the moratorium is the best of all \nsolutions. It protects Internet access from State and local taxes for a \nwhile longer, as more Americans get access to the benefits of the \nInternet. It preserves for the future the flexibility that State and \nlocal governments need as they try to balance their budgets while \nproviding for good education, improved infrastructure, adequate police \nand firefighting forces--all these things in this new age of terrorism. \nAnd it gives Congress the responsibility and the opportunity to revisit \nthe issue, which is absolutely key, in 2 years, as the technology \nevolves.\n  Let me be clear. I strongly supported the previous moratorium on \nInternet access taxes because I recognized the value of expanding \nInternet use to more Americans. I believe Congress ought to do what it \ncan to ensure the Internet becomes like the radio and the telephone and \nthe television before it--technology that connects with all Americans \nand connects all Americans to each other.\n  In my home State of West Virginia, we are still working hard to \nensure that all our citizens will have access to the latest broadband \ntechnology, so I am eager to support efforts that can make the Internet \nmore affordable and more available, including extending the current \nmoratorium for 2 years. However, I cannot ignore my concerns with the \npermanent moratorium we are asked to consider today.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment which a \nnumber of other former Governors and I have put forward.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/07/senate-section/article/S14254-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14254-S14261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             POLITICIZING THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I want to spend the next several minutes \ncommenting on a matter that I regard, as majority leader of this body, \nto be one that is very serious. As is the case with a number of my \ncolleagues, in fact, most of the U.S. Senators, we have been given the \nopportunity to reflect on the publication of a very disturbing internal \nmemorandum, a memorandum that lays out a blatant, partisan strategy to \nuse the Senate Intelligence Committee to politically wound the \nPresident of the United States.\n  That is unacceptable. There is really no other way to read this memo. \nI am deeply disappointed that anyone--that anyone--would have a plan to \nso politicize the Intelligence Committee of the U.S. Senate, to render \nit incapable of meeting its responsibilities to this institution, to \nthe U.S. Senate, and, indeed, to the American people.\n  Moreover--I had hesitated to come to the floor to address this \ndirectly, but now is the time to do that--the response by those behind \nthis memo has been miserably inadequate, has been disappointing, and \nhas been disturbing.\n  We are at a time of peril in our Nation's history. As our \nintelligence agencies and our Armed Forces in the Middle East are at \nwar against our mortal enemies, those responsible for this memo appear \nto be--and anybody can read this memo. It is available now. The copy I \nhave here is actually on the FOXNews Web site. But if you read it, \nthose responsible for this memo appear to be more focused on winning \nthe White House for their party than on winning the war against terror.\n  Those priorities are wrong. They are dead wrong.\n  As majority leader of the U.S. Senate, as one responsible for \npreserving the integrity of this institution and the direction of this \ninstitution, it is incumbent upon me to make sure we address this \nmatter properly, appropriately, and adequately.\n  In the aftermath of the war in Iraq, the failure thus far to find \ndeployed weapons of mass destruction is a legitimate matter for inquiry \nby this body, this institution, for our colleagues. After all, for \nnearly 10 years--throughout the 8-year tenure of President Clinton and \nthe first 2 years of President Bush--the U.S. Congress and the White \nHouse were given a steady flow of information by the intelligence \ncommunity that suggested such weapons did exist.\n  In fact, it was this information that precipitated, in 1998, the U.S. \nmilitary attack Operation Desert Fox, ordered by President Clinton at \nthat time, and, in part, Operation Iraqi Freedom, ordered by President \nBush in 2003.\n  Thus, if there is incomplete or imprecise information that had been \nprovided to President Clinton or President Bush and the U.S. Congress \nover a 10-year period, the intelligence community should be asked to \nexplain. That is what the Intelligence Committee is expected to do; it \nis really charged by this body to do; and that is exactly--that is \nexactly--what Senator Roberts, chairman of the Intelligence Committee, \nset out to do.\n  Last spring, Senator Roberts, as chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee, made a commitment, jointly with Senator Rockefeller, to \nconduct a thorough review of U.S. intelligence on the existence of and \nthe threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs.\n\n  The review was also intended to cover Iraq's ties to terrorist \ngroups, Saddam Hussein's threat to stability and security in the \nregion, and his violations of human rights, including the demonstrated \nactual use of weapons of mass destruction; namely, chemical weapons \nagainst his own people.\n  The review was intended to examine the quantity of information, the \nquality of U.S. intelligence, the objectivity, the independence, the \naccuracy of the judgments reached by the intelligence community, \nwhether or not those judgments were properly disseminated to \npolicymakers in the executive branch, as well as to this body and the \nCongress, and whether any influence was brought to bear on anyone to \nshape the analysis to support policy objectives.\n  Thus, that was the initial charge and what, in fact, has occurred \nover the past 5 months. The Intelligence Committee staff has reviewed \nthousands of documents. It has interviewed over 100 individuals, \nincluding private citizens and analysts and senior officials with the \nCentral Intelligence Agency, with the National Security Council, with \nthe Defense Intelligence Agency, with the State Department's Bureau of \nIntelligence and Research, and even the United Nations.\n\n[[Page S14255]]\n\n  It is indisputable the chairman of that Intelligence Committee, \nSenator Roberts, has complied in good faith with the nonpartisan--the \nnonpartisan--commitment which he made to his Democratic colleagues. \nMost recently, this nonpartisan commitment was manifest, once again, in \na series of very direct, no-nonsense letters directed to the \nadministration, demanding the immediate production of documents and \ninterviews necessary to move the Iraq review forward.\n  Senator Rockefeller, himself, formally recognized, on the floor of \nthe Senate, the fundamental good work performed thus far when, on \nNovember 5, he stated on this floor, and I quote:\n\n       I have been vocal in my appreciation of the absolutely \n     excellent job done to date by the staff on the aspects of the \n     investigation they have been asked to perform, which is \n     reviewing the prewar Iraqi intelligence. They have done a \n     superb job, absolutely superb job.\n\n  The words of Senator Rockefeller.\n  The chairman of the committee, Senator Roberts, has acted with the \nutmost attention to that nonpartisan tradition of this critically \nimportant Intelligence Committee. That nonpartisan tradition--and it is \nunusual to have nonpartisan traditions in this body--but it has always \nbeen preserved, for good reason, in that Intelligence Committee.\n  The tradition is reflected in the committee's founding resolution, S. \nRes. 400, enacted in 1976, as a result of nationwide concerns at that \ntime about intelligence activities in earlier years.\n  The committee's nonpartisan tradition has been carefully cultivated \nand respected over time, over all these years, by its members. The \ntradition is part and parcel of the committee's rules, which extend the \nprerogatives of the minority, that are not found in any other committee \nin this body.\n  For a quarter century there has been a consensus in the Senate that \nthe committee's nonpartisan tradition must be carefully safeguarded. \nNothing less is acceptable. Why? Because this committee deals with \ninformation that is unique, that is privileged information, because of \nthe dangerous and sensitive nature of the subject matter for which the \nIntelligence Committee, this committee, has unique oversight.\n  I come to the floor because that critical tradition has now been \nwillfully attacked.\n  How can I say that? By this memo. You read the memo. The Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence has been harmed by a blatant partisan \nattack. I have no earthly idea who wrote this memo. I do know why. I \ndon't know who it was intended for, but I do know why. If you read the \nmemo, you can look. It is a sequence of steps spelled out. The sequence \nof steps proposed in this partisan battle plan for the committee itself \nis without question intended to sow doubt, to abuse the fairness of the \ncommittee chairman, Senator Pat Roberts, to undermine the standing of \nthe Commander in Chief at a time of war, and to launch a partisan \ninvestigation through next year to continue into the elections.\n  The memo lays clear that over the past several months there has been \na partisan design at work ``to pull along the majority.'' According to \nthe memo, the good will, the sense of fairness, the nonpartisan \napproach of the chairman of the committee, Senator Roberts, is still \nseen as providing ample ``opportunity to usefully collaborate'' in \nattacking the President of the United States. That is an abuse of the \nchairman of that very committee. This whole idea of leading that \nchairman or the committee along is simply unacceptable and out of the \nspirit of this committee. Again, it is something we simply cannot \ntolerate.\n  Finally, in the memo the author proposes that once the committee can \nbe duped no longer, a partisan core of Senators can ``pull the \ntrigger'' on another investigation.\n  The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence simply cannot function. \nWorse than that, it cannot fulfill its purpose for us without a \ncomplete understanding of what is at work in this matter. I thought it \nwould come forward over the last 48 hours, but it simply has not. That \nis unacceptable.\n  Thus I suggest we take the following three steps. First, I don't know \nwho wrote this memo, but as majority leader of the Senate, I do ask the \nauthor or authors to step forward, to identify himself or herself or, \nif there are several people, to stand up with that information for the \nfull Senate. We would be much better equipped to understand the level \nof intent behind this partisan strategy as well as the depth of the \nproblem within the committee itself.\n  It is necessary to know who the memo was intended to go to, who was \nto receive that memo. It was obviously written as a strategy. Who was \nthat memo to be delivered to? Was it intended for political purposes \nbeyond what is permitted in the Senate rules?\n  Second, it is reasonable to expect, I think--in fact, I know--that \nthe author or authors and the designated recipient or recipients \ndisavow once and for all this partisan attack in its entirety. It is \nhard to believe this disavowal has not come forward given what is at \nstake. The Senate cannot permit a committee chairman with the integrity \nof Senator Pat Roberts to be subjected to such abuse. The Senate as an \ninstitution should not permit a committee upon which all of us are so \ndependent--because of its privileged status with access to information, \nwe are dependent on that committee to make decisions--to be so misused \nor potentially misused for partisan purposes.\n  Third, I expect there to be a personal apology to the chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee, Senator Roberts, for the manipulative tone and \nthe injurious content of this document. Senator Roberts is one of this \nbody's most distinguished Members. He is a friend. He is a \ntrusted colleague. He served in this body for 7 years, rising to that \nposition of trust as chairman of one of the Senate's most respected, \nmost important, most critical committees, especially at this time of \nwar. Senator Roberts, with his straight-talking manner, has the \ncomplete trust of colleagues on both sides of the aisle. He served this \nNation in uniform, in the Marine Corps, in the House of \nRepresentatives. His integrity is unimpeachable. He is doing an \noutstanding job as chairman of the Intelligence Committee.\n\n  But only with the fulfillment of the three steps I outlined--No. 1, \nwho wrote it and who was the intended recipient; No. 2, a total \ndisavowal of the writing of this and, more importantly, the intent of \nthis memo; and No. 3, an apology to the chairman--will it be possible \nfor this important committee to resume its work in an effective manner, \nin a bipartisan manner, a manner that is deserving of the confidence of \n100 Members in the Senate as well as the confidence of the executive \nbranch.\n  In light of this partisan attack, Chairman Roberts and I have taken \nthe opportunity to discuss the scope of the unfinished work on the \nreview of the prewar intelligence in Iraq. It is our view that the \ncommittee's review is nearly complete. Together we have called upon the \nadministration to provide the remaining requested materials. We have \njointly determined that the committee can and will complete its review \nthis year.\n  To the authors of this memo, there will be no more pulling along and \nno more useful collaboration on partisan schemes, borrowing from the \nmalicious intent of this memo.\n  This must be addressed forthrightly. I call upon my colleagues to pay \nattention to this memo. It is something we can resolve and we must \nresolve over the coming days.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend our distinguished leader for \naddressing this matter which is of extraordinary importance to the \ninstitution and indeed the United States.\n  I humbly say I have been privileged to serve in this body for 25 \nyears. I have been a member of the Intelligence Committee in years \npast, 8 years; the last 2 of those years serving as the ranking member \nwith Senator DeConcini, who is now retired from the Senate. I speak now \nas a former member of the committee and draw on those 25 years of my \nown experience.\n  I have never seen an incident of the level of seriousness to our very \nvital security interests in this country as this particular memo \npresents. I think our leader, in a very fair and balanced way, has \naddressed the challenges. I commend the distinguished chairman, Senator \nRoberts, with whom I have served these many years in the Congress and \nthe Senate.\n  I conclude by saying, speaking for myself and I think many Senators,\n\n[[Page S14256]]\n\nwith everything we do in this body today, I keep in mind the young men \nand women of the Armed Forces, wherever they are in the world today, \nserving valiantly, most particularly in Afghanistan and Iraq, and how \nthe actions we as an institution take hopefully are in their best \ninterest.\n  I thank the Chair and the distinguished leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank our leader for bringing this matter \nto the floor. I join with the very distinguished chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee because that is what we really ought to be about. We \nought to be focused on winning the war against terrorism, not allowing \none of our primary, sensitive committees, the Intelligence Committee, \nto be focused on winning the White House. I can't say it any better \nthan the Senator from Virginia. We have heroic young men and woman in \nharm's way fighting to bring order to a region of the world where we \nhave had many threats to our security. The least these brave men and \nwomen could expect would be that our country and our Congress would be \nbehind them.\n  Frankly, one of the reasons I sought membership on the Senate \nIntelligence Committee as a new member was I realized that in this \ncritical battle against terrorism worldwide, we cannot win unless we \nhave the best possible intelligence.\n  As I understand it, the job of the Intelligence Committee is not only \none of oversight but of taking a look and seeing what has happened in \nthe intelligence-gathering analysis and sharing in the past, how we can \ndo a better job. Our staffs have been deeply engaged in this exercise \nfor many months. We have followed it. We have had numerous hearings. We \nhave read some, but not all, of the tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds \nof thousands, of pages that have come before us. We need, on a \nbipartisan basis, to be able to find out how we can improve that \nintelligence.\n  One of the reasons the Intelligence Committee is so special is the \ntradition it has. The intelligence community members, whose lives are \nat risk because of what they are doing--often undercover work, dealing \nwith classified, sensitive subjects--have been able to come before the \ncommittee in the past, knowing they could count on confidentiality, \nprofessionalism, and on a body that was not going to be using their \nwords or their actions for partisan political gain.\n  Unfortunately, when we first saw this memo, it looked as if there was \nsomebody, or ``somebodies,'' in the Intelligence Committee who wanted \nto use it to win the White House. That is just unacceptable. Some \npeople on the other side have said this is just an options memo tossed \nup for review. I have been around here for a few years, and a staff \nperson on his or her own doesn't write a memo saying: We have carefully \nreviewed our options under the rules and we believe we have identified \nthe best approach. Our plan is as follows.\n  I say that the occupant of the chair, and probably everybody else \nhere, would be totally stupefied if they got a memo from the staff that \nwas supposed to be an option memo and said: This is our plan. This is \nnot an accident. Days have passed and there have been no consequences. \nIf somebody was really off base, there would have been something that \nwould have happened. Some steps would have been taken. As the \ndistinguished majority leader has pointed out, nothing has happened. \nUnfortunately, too many of the actions we have seen seem to fit right \nin with this plan. Not only are they not disavowing it, they appear to \nbe preparing to implement it, or are in the process of implementing it.\n  What is this plan? Is it to find out how the intelligence gathering \ncould be better? Not likely. In addition to the President's State of \nthe Union speech, they say, they want to look at the activities of the \nOffice of the Secretary of Defense, as well as Secretary Bolton's \noffice at the State Department. They want to go after political \nfigures.\n  Somebody in my office said, ``This looks like a political witch \nhunt.'' I said maybe that is not a bad way to characterize it.\n  They are going after political scalps, not trying to find out whether \nthe intelligence that we received, the White House received, the \nDepartment of Defense received, and the State Department received was \ngood, but how they can use the process of the Intelligence Committee to \nwin political points.\n  By the way, when they talk about ``when we can pull the trigger''--\npull the trigger on an investigation--they say the best time to do so \nwill probably be next year.\n\n  If I remember correctly, that happens to be a general election year. \nThat would seem to square with some of the statements made by the many \nDemocratic Presidential candidates who want to raise questions, who \nwant to attack the President, using the process of the Intelligence \nCommittee.\n  One of the things that is really bothersome is that they are not just \nspeaking to an audience in the Senate. When they launch these attacks, \nthese attacks get carried across the Nation and across the world. They \nget back to the people we are trying to fight. Do you know something? \nThere is nothing a terrorist likes better than seeing discord, \ndisharmony, and political infighting among the people they are trying \nto terrorize. That is one of the victories of terrorists. If they can \ntie up the intelligence-gathering operation, which is so critical for \nthe protection, first and foremost, of our soldiers on the front line, \nbut ultimately our allies and ourselves--if they can see that tied up \nin a political Gordian knot, then they know they are winning.\n  I strongly support what the majority leader has said. I strongly \nbelieve that our fine chairman has not only gone the extra mile, he has \ngone the extra mile and a half.\n  Some on the other side said we have not been able to get the \ninformation we want. When we have found we could not get information, \nthe chairman has demanded it and we are going to get it. When they want \nto ask questions, they can do so. When they want to call witnesses, \nthey can call witnesses.\n  There has been a suggestion that there was pressure on intelligence \ncommunity members. The chairman has gone out and asked publicly of the \nintelligence community, if anybody has any information or concerns that \nthey have been pressured, to come forward and talk to staff. We have \nset up elaborate procedures so they can come forward. We are still \nwaiting. If we find any of that, we will certainly let it out.\n  In the meantime, it is time for us to get back to the job of the \nIntelligence Committee--how we can support, rather than tear apart, our \nintelligence-gathering system. It is with great regret we note that we \nhave gone down this path and there doesn't seem to be any remorse or \ndisavowal from the other side.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today, first of all, to ask that \nI be associated with the remarks of the majority leader, as well as the \nSenator from Virginia and my colleague from Missouri, and to also pay a \ngreat compliment to the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, \nChairman Roberts, who throughout the past 10 months has led the Senate \nIntelligence Committee through one of the most difficult, if not the \nmost difficult, times in the history of the United States of America \nfrom an intelligence community standpoint.\n  Today, our men and women are fighting a war that is unlike any war \nAmerica has ever been involved in before. The intelligence community is \nplaying a more high profile and much more public role than ever before \nin the history of our great country. Chairman Roberts has been at the \ntip of the spear when it has come to providing oversight in a \nbipartisan manner with respect to the activities of our intelligence \ncommunity.\n  Over the past week, he has provided great leadership with respect to \nthe most sensitive issue that has taken place in the short time I have \nbeen a Member of the Senate. We have seen a security breach unlike any \nother security breach I have ever experienced.\n  As my colleagues have noted, the memo that has been referred to that \nwas prepared by someone on the other side of the aisle--we have yet to \nfind out who--was a blatant political attempt to impede what I consider \nto be an independent, nonpartisan review of prewar Iraq intelligence. \nAmerica\n\n[[Page S14257]]\n\nshould expect more from this Congress. The Democrats in this body \nshould expect more from themselves as well as their staffs.\n  The Select Committee on Intelligence was established to be \nnonpartisan in nature, in which Congress could perform critical \noversight of the intelligence activities of the United States. This \nnonpartisan environment was, and is, a crucial feature. This \nnonpartisan environment creates a crucial level of trust between the \nexecutive branch and the Senate, permitting the President to share \nsensitive national security information, with the confidence that the \ncommittee will protect the information and not use it to engage in rank \npolitical misconduct.\n  We have seen just the opposite take place with this blatant political \nattack that comes from the other side in the form of this memo.\n  We can have our differences over issues involving Iraq, and we have \nhad those differences, and we will continue to debate issues such as \nweapons of mass destruction. But no one in this body and no one in the \nintelligence community ever expected a weapon of mass destruction to be \ndropped on the Senate Intelligence Committee, as was done this week.\n  I implore the leadership on the other side of the aisle to follow the \ninitiative of the majority leader: examine what he has said with \nrespect to what needs to be done from this point forward. I certainly \nhope the leadership on the other side of the aisle will do just what \nthey are charged to do, and that is to provide leadership and come \nforward to explain the purpose of this memorandum, its intended use, \nand where they expect us to go from here because otherwise, that weapon \nof mass destruction that has been dropped on the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee is going to impede our ability to function in the bipartisan \nway that is absolutely crucial if we are going to exercise our \noversight role in the intelligence community.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise to reinforce the very serious \nconcerns just raised by the distinguished leader and my colleagues, and \nI thank them for that. The Senator from Tennessee is an ex officio \nmember of the Intelligence Committee. He has also been a member of the \nForeign Relations Committee. He thoroughly understands the complex and \nimportant foreign policy issues which depend on reliable intelligence \nfor their proper resolution.\n  I associate myself completely with his comments and agree with him \nthat neither the Intelligence Committee nor the Senate, let alone the \nAmerican people, are well served in the current atmosphere of raw \npartisanship that was created by a minority attack strategy that was \nrevealed this week.\n  I have come before the Senate many times to report on the progress \nand good work that has been done by the committee staff in a bipartisan \nway on the Iraq intelligence review. That has been under review since \nthe spring of this year. Two days ago, I expressed an interest in \ngetting back to work in the Intelligence Committee. Some Senators \nacross the aisle have taken this sentiment as an expression of \nreadiness to simply close the book on this episode and pretend like it \nnever happened. They are mistaken.\n  What has occurred in the Intelligence Committee was not a simple \nmisunderstanding over policy or a mild disagreement about philosophy or \noversight responsibilities. Far from it. What occurred was a direct \nassault on the heart of what makes the Intelligence Committee a unique \nand credible and respected entity in behalf of our national security. \nIt was a direct assault on our concept of oversight that is the product \nof some of our country's most trying days. It has functioned well, \nalthough imperfectly, for nearly 30 years. And now we find ourselves at \na crossroads, and, boy, is this a road we didn't have to take.\n\n  Unless and until this reprehensible attack plan and strategy to \nderail the committee's important work is properly addressed, I am \nafraid it will be impossible to return to business as usual in the \ncommittee.\n  I remain absolutely stunned that just one Member of the minority of \nthe Senate has disavowed this destructive strategy and said we are on \nthe wrong trail, said it would lead to a box canyon. That courageous \nMember saw it for what it is: ``A highly partisan and perhaps \ntreasonous memo.'' Those are his words, Mr. President.\n  What really disturbs me the most is that most Democratic Members just \nhaven't remained silent about this outrage; some of them have openly \nembraced it. They have actually tried to make a silk purse out of this \nsow's ear by dressing up their planned attack on the Intelligence \nCommittee as some kind of frustrated cry for help from their committee \nstaff. That is not going to wash.\n  Democratic reaction to the attack memorandum is as destructive as the \nstrategy itself. We face mounting intelligence challenges in places \nsuch as North Korea, Iran, and, of course, Iraq, and Afghanistan. \nMembers across the aisle should carefully reflect and decide whether \ntheir caucus should repudiate or disavow--pick any word you want--this \nplan and embrace our Nation's security instead of self-interest. \nCritically important work lies ahead for the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, and an atmosphere of mutual trust and professionalism must \nbe restored.\n  According to Senator Bob Kerrey, a former Senator and a former vice \nchairman of the committee said:\n\n       Rank partisanship like this destroys the comity needed for \n     compromise.\n\n  There is a way to restore that comity quickly and completely. It \nseems to me that Democratic Senators must clearly repudiate or disavow \nthe blatantly partisan strategy laid out in the attack memo. If they \nrefuse, it seems to me, then, that the Democratic caucus must be \nprepared to accept responsibility for destroying the Intelligence \nCommittee's 25-year, almost 30-year tradition of effective \nnonpartisanship when the country needed it most.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I first compliment the distinguished chairman \nof the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the Senator from \nKansas, not only for the remarks he just made, but for the way he led \nthis committee during very difficult times, as has been mentioned \nbefore.\n  I regret he has been criticized for the very acts of comity which are \nrequired of a chairman in a position such as this for trying his best \nto accommodate the members of the minority, trying his best to be as \nopen and as broad as he could possibly be in approaching the issues \nthat have been brought to his attention by members of the minority, \neven criticized, I have seen, in his own hometown press, his own press \nin Kansas for being too soft in dealing with the members of the \nDemocratic Party in this matter.\n  It is his job to bend over backwards, to make the Intelligence \nCommittee work in a nonpartisan fashion. I didn't say ``bipartisan,'' I \nsaid ``nonpartisan'' because that is the way this committee was set up \n25 years ago: to be a place where politics could not intrude.\n  I don't know how many people are aware of where the Intelligence \nCommittee works. It works in an area that is secure. That is the \nphrase. There are special physical arrangements in the construction of \nthis area in which the committee works. It is literally a vault that \nyou walk into, totally closed off from the rest of the world, obviously \nbecause we don't want any electronic surveillance or other means of \nintercepting what is said within the confines of this secure area.\n  It could also be a metaphor for its location in this very political \ncity because there is a lot of politics in Washington, DC. We all \nunderstand that.\n  This is a special place where politics is not to intrude. It is \nliterally an island in this political sea that is supposed to be out of \nbounds for politics.\n  The chairman has done a great job of trying his best to get all of \nthe information he can from the intelligence community, from the \nadministration, from any other source that would be useful to the \ncommittee's work, and to bend over backwards, as the memorandum itself \nnotes, for the members of the minority. I take my hat off to him for \nthat and suggest that he should not be criticized for it; he should be \npraised for it.\n  He, too, has made the point that there is a point beyond which one \njust cannot go. When it appears that the\n\n[[Page S14258]]\n\nother side has attempted to take advantage of your goodwill, as the \nchairman has done, he has got to say that is it; no more; this \ncommittee is not going to be used for partisan political purposes. That \nis what he should do, and I applaud him for that effort.\n  I also appreciate the comments of the distinguished majority leader \nin bringing this to the full body as he has done, to raise the critical \nquestions and to simply ask for those responsible to step forward and \nacknowledge their responsibility and identify for whom this memorandum \nwas written; for the responsible people, including the leadership of \nthe Democratic minority, and certainly the leadership of the committee, \nto disavow the contents of the memo, the plan that has been written, \nand to make a public apology to the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee.\n  I think those are very reasonable requests and, frankly, too many \nhours have passed since the first calls for disavowal. Yet the \nmemorandum remains not disavowed.\n  I would like to take just a moment to try and explain why some of us \nfeel so strongly about this. I served on this committee for 8 years. \nThere is a rule that a Senator can only serve for 8 years because we \nnever want this to become a politicized committee. We never want it to \nbe a source where power is gathered around people who maintain their \nposition. This is supposed to be a place where a Senator comes in, gets \nexpertise, serves time, and then moves on. I had the honor and \nprivilege of serving for 8 years.\n  One of the things that always stuck with me was the fact that it was \nnot bipartisan, it was nonpartisan. The staff was selected primarily \nfrom the intelligence community, people who were experts in matters of \nintelligence. When I first came in, I said I had a member of my staff \nwho used to be with the Intelligence Committee. He has the top \nclearances, and I would like to have him on staff to help me on this \ncommittee. Bob Kerrey, the former Senator from Nebraska and \ndistinguished former chairman referred to by Senator Roberts, made the \npoint at the time: No, we cannot do that because we do not want there \nto be any suggestion that there is influence in the committee from the \nprivate staff of individual Senators. This is professional intelligence \ncommunity staff, and if it ever were thought to be otherwise, we would \nnever get the cooperation of the intelligence community providing us \nwith secrets that are the most significant, important secrets of our \nNation.\n  Our committee staff of the Select Committee on Intelligence has the \ncomplete knowledge of the most significant, serious secrets of this \ncountry. They have to be above reproach. Think for a moment what would \nhappen if it were perceived that they were political staff just \nlike all the other committees. There is nothing wrong with political \nstaff, but we all understand they have a substantive and a political \ndimension to the work that they do. We all operate within that \nunderstanding. But here, think about what a Senator could do knowing \nall of these secrets if they decided to use them for partisan political \nadvantage.\n\n  I can state unequivocally that I could have gone out and criticized \nthe Clinton administration with things I knew, and people on the \ncommittee today could probably go out and criticize the current \nadministration for things that they know. It would be very hard to \nrespond to that because the only response is to use similarly \nclassified information to respond.\n  We cannot get into that game. No one would share information with the \nintelligence committee if they felt that it could be used for political \npurposes. Indeed, what foreign country or other sources would be \nwilling to provide information to our intelligence community with the \nunderstanding that it might go right to a partisan political committee \nof the Congress? It could not be done.\n  I was interested to go to Great Britain and visit with \nParliamentarians who only recently obtained oversight, like the \nIntelligence Committee oversight of the United States, over \nintelligence activities of the executive branch of their government. \nNow, understand they are a parliamentary form of government so the \ndistinction is not nearly as bright as it is in the United States, but \nthey sought advice from us as to how they could best do oversight of \nthis important intelligence function.\n  They were interested in how we were able to get these deep dark \nsecrets of our country into the legislative branch of government when \nin the past they had always been the sole province of the intelligence \ncommunity and the executive branch. One of the explanations was because \nwe were trusted. We were not a partisan committee like the other \ncommittees.\n  Well, this memorandum and the conduct of the staff in this particular \ncase begins the process of destroying that credibility and that trust \nand thus eliminating any prospect that this committee can operate in a \nsuccessful way in its oversight function. That is why this is such a \nbig deal.\n  I mentioned former Senator Kerrey. I would also mention former \nchairmen of the committee, Senators Specter and Shelby, both of whom \nspoke to this issue a couple of days ago and recounted how in their \nexperience they had never seen anything like this during their time as \nchairman and noted that they could not possibly function as a committee \nif there were a perception that the committee was being used for \npolitical purposes.\n  I might note one other thing just as an aside. I wrote additional \nviews, along with the distinguished chairman of the committee, today to \nthe report that the Intelligence Committee issued at the end of last \nyear about the events leading up to September 11, 2001. One of the \nreasons that those other views are not as eloquent as I would have \nliked them to have been is that we had to draft them very quickly, \nafter the report was done, after we knew what its conclusions were. We \nwere able to read through it, and the Senator from Kansas and I noted \nthat we did not totally agree with everything--more precisely, there \nwere other things that we thought should have been said in that report, \nand we hastily put together our additional views and got them attached \nto the report. I hope they are helpful for people who read that report \nand our additional views.\n\n  We did not come to a conclusion before that report was done, before \nthe committee's work was done, that no matter what that report said, we \nwere going to attach additional views and be critical of the report. We \ncould not have done that because we did not know what it was going to \nsay.\n  That is what this memorandum suggests is the plan of these Democrat \nstaffers, that irrespective of what the report says the Senator from \nKansas will oversee the issuance of in the next few weeks, they plan to \nattach additional views castigating the majority. I will quote that in \njust a second. That is a misuse of the process and that is the kind of \nthing that we are talking about.\n  I would just finally note in this regard, the report that the \ncommittee is working on now is the second of three major reports. \nFirst, the committee put out the report at the end of last year. Then \nthere is the followup report that is being done right now on the \nintelligence leading up to September 11 and leading up to the conflict \nin Iraq, and finally the Kean commission, which is also going to be \nissuing a report on the same subject. So all three investigations \noverlap in one way or another to ask the question about the adequacy of \nour intelligence pre-September 11 and pre-Iraqi war. It is not as if \nthis subject has not gotten a lot of attention.\n  The public might be a little confused about what this memorandum \nactually says. I just wanted to note finally what this memorandum says. \nIt begins by saying:\n\n       We have carefully reviewed our options under the rules and \n     believe we have identified the best approach. Our plan is as \n     follows.\n\n  So this is not a recitation of options. This is a statement that they \nreviewed the options and this is what they came up with: The plan, \n``our plan is as follows.'' It clearly is written for someone who \nunderstands fully what the idea was.\n  Our options for what? It would have to be options for something that \nthe recipient of the memo already understood. It says:\n\n       First, pull the majority along as far as we can.\n\n  That is the distinguished chairman of the committee.\n\n\n[[Page S14259]]\n\n\n       Pull the majority along as far as we can on issues that may \n     lead to major new disclosures regarding improper or \n     questionable conduct by administration officials.\n\n  In other words, a fishing expedition. Let us see how long we can \nstring this out and maybe we will get lucky and come up with something. \nIn fact, they say it right here: `` . . . We don't know what we will \nfind,'' and then there is a parenthesis at the end of this paragraph \nthat I find very interesting. ``Note: we can verbally mention some of \nthe intriguing leads we are pursuing.''\n  No, you cannot, not under the committee rules. It is absolutely \nforbidden.\n\n  What is in that committee is confidential. You cannot verbally \nmention some of the intriguing leads that ``we are pursuing.''\n  Second:\n\n       Assiduously prepare Democratic ``additional views . . .''\n\n  That would be appropriate if the report is already done, but what \ndoes it say?\n\n     . . . to attach to any interim or final reports the committee \n     may release.\n\n  In other words, it doesn't matter what the committee says. We'll \nwrite these views ahead of time and attach them.\n\n     . . . we intend to take full advantage of it,\n\nit said.\n\n       Our additional views will also, among other things, \n     castigate the majority for seeking to limit the scope of the \n     inquiry.\n\n  The majority has not done anything yet but, by golly they are going \nto be castigated for this.\n  Third:\n\n       Prepare to launch an independent investigation when it \n     becomes clear we have exhausted the opportunity to usefully \n     collaborate with the majority.\n\n  I like that phrase. I think that reveals a malevolent intent here. \nThen:\n\n     . . . we can pull the trigger on an independent \n     investigation. . . . The best time to do so will probably be \n     next year. . . .\n\n  They then talk about the advantages or disadvantages of doing it at \nthat time. They note that:\n\n       We could [under the second view here] attract more coverage \n     and have greater credibility in that context than one in \n     which we simply launch an independent investigation based on \n     principled but vague notions regarding the ``use'' of \n     intelligence.\n\n  It concludes:\n\n       . . . we have an important role to play in revealing the \n     misleading--if not flagrantly dishonest methods and motives--\n     of the senior administration officials who made the case for \n     a unilateral, preemptive war. The approach outlined above \n     seems to offer the best prospect for exposing the \n     administration's dubious motives and methods.\n\n  This is political. This is staffers who have already prejudged. They \ncannot believe President Bush. There must be bad, dishonest motives. It \nis their mantra, and I think they think it is their duty to expose and \nblame the Bush administration. Yes, it is political, but in their view \nit is a higher calling. Bush must be exposed, so any method is \nacceptable, so the end justifies the means even if it risks destroying \nthe intelligence committee.\n  These staffers should know better because they are senior staffers, \npresumably. That is the kind of people who get hired on this committee. \nBut it is wrong to put partisan politics above national security and \ncertainly the members of the committee know better. That is why the \nmajority leader is absolutely correct in calling upon them to disavow \nthis memorandum, which puts partisan politics ahead of national \nsecurity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me initially state I have the highest \nrespect for Pat Roberts, with whom I served for a number of years on \nthe Ethics Committee. I served with him in the House of \nRepresentatives. I also have the highest respect and the deepest \nadmiration for Jay Rockefeller, a man who has devoted his life to \ngovernment and who, as I have indicated, I admire greatly.\n\n  But the American people must understand this memo that has been \ntalked about was somehow stolen from the offices of Senator Rockefeller \nand his people who work in the Intelligence Committee. It was \npurloined--I used the word stolen--and then made public by the \nmajority. I think one of the things we should consider here, in \naddition to what is in the memo, is how this information was taken. How \nit was obtained and how that came to be is something the Intelligence \nCommittee should really be concerned about because, as a number of \nSenators have spoken about this afternoon, the information that is \nspoken of in the Intelligence Committee, the memos, letters, and other \ninformation that is in the Intelligence Committee, has to remain \nsecret. It has to be something that is within the confines of that \noffice.\n  That wasn't done in this instance. All you need to do is compare the \nsituation where, just a few weeks ago now, information was leaked from \nsomewhere within the confines of the White House to Robert Novak, a \ndistinguished columnist in the Washington area, and that information \nwas obviously leaked in an effort to get even with Ambassador Wilson. \nHow did they intend to get even with Ambassador Wilson for questioning \nhow the war came to be in Iraq? How were they going to get even with \nhim? They were going to disclose the name of his wife who was a CIA \nagent. By her name being made public, not only could it lead to her \nphysical harm but harm to the people with whom she had intelligence \ncontacts all over the world. Where is the hue and cry about this?\n  I have been terribly disappointed over the last several days about \nwhat is happening in the Senate. There were speeches this afternoon \naccusing Senators who are not here to defend themselves and who are \nonly trying to do what they think is right for national security--it \nmay not be right, but they think it is--of being unpatriotic. That \nmakes me feel even sadder.\n  The American people should understand, what we have here is an \ninvestigation being conducted by the Intelligence Committee. It is a \nvery important committee. I acknowledge everything that has been said \nby the Senators here this afternoon. It is very important. But the \nminority believes the investigation should be more than looking at what \nthe civil servants did; that is, the CIA itself, and should be looking \nat not only what the civil servants did but what the policymakers did.\n  I voted for the first gulf war. I voted for the second gulf war. I \nhave no regrets about having done either. But I am very interested in \nhow we got to the situation we are in.\n  I said we can win the war, but can we win the peace? I want to know \nabout how the policymakers made the statements they did.\n  I think it is also of note, as my friend, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Arizona, indicated, he did file the same views--he and Chairman \nRoberts. In this report, on page 4 in their views I quote:\n\n       Because the fundamental problems that led to 9/11 are \n     almost certainly rooted in poor policy and inadequate \n     leadership, the investigation should have delved more deeply \n     into conflicting interpretations of legal authorities, \n     including presidential directives, budget allocations, \n     institutional attitudes, and other key areas. Only \n     penetrating these areas will tell us how policymakers, \n     including Congress, contributed to the failures the Report \n     identifies.\n\n  So as I understand this memo, which was stolen from the Intelligence \nCommittee--I don't see anything wrong with their asking for more \ninformation and how we should start looking at the policymakers, not \njust the bureaucrats.\n  On page 17 of the report, Senators Roberts and Kyl said:\n\n       The failures that led to 9/11 occurred not only in the \n     intelligence community. The [Joint Inquiry] was selective \n     about what threads of inquiry it was willing to follow beyond \n     the intelligence community.\n\n  So they were asking for what I understand the memo asked for.\n  Rather than talking about the Intelligence Committee being \nlandlocked, blocked, I think they should just go ahead and do their \nreport, enlarge it, and include this information.\n  Last night on this floor and earlier today I tried to get permission \nfrom the majority to pass military construction. The conference report \nshould have been passed. We are not doing that. We could do it right \nnow. I also tried to pass the Syria Accountability Act. I understand \nprocedurally why on the Syria Accountability Act the majority may want \nto hold it over. An hour and a half is plenty of time, but the \nappropriations bill has no time on it. I can't understand why we will \nnot do that.\n  Talk about political grandstanding, we now learn that starting next\n\n[[Page S14260]]\n\nWednesday at 6 o'clock we will spend 30 hours talking about judges.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the debate time for discussion on \njudges, which we have all learned is going to be 60 hours, be divided \nand controlled equally between the two leaders or their designees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FRIST. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, it is \ninteresting to me; comments have been made over the course of the day \nthat there was some attempt to figure out how time would be divided, \nand I believe the allegation has been made that had been discussed with \nme before. We have not gotten to that point yet. So I am a little bit \nsurprised about some of the statements which were made earlier.\n  As we discussed the judicial issue and the filibusters that are \nongoing, which are unprecedented--partisan filibusters in this country \non the judicial nominees--I do think it is critically important that we \nhave the opportunity on both sides to be heard. The plans will be, \nafter we finish the appropriations process over the next several days, \nthat at that point in time we will turn to the judicial nominees. We \nwill be debating two nominees who haven't yet been considered on the \nfloor of the Senate. The intention has been made very clear that the \nMembers on the other side of the aisle will filibuster. Therefore, I \nlook forward to an active debate between both sides of the aisle. We \nwould be happy to talk to the Democratic leadership about how the time \nwill be divided.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I withdraw the unanimous consent request and \nexpress my appreciation for hearing that at a later time the leader \nwill determine how he feels the time should be allotted. I am glad he \nis thinking about some allocation of time to the minority.\n\n  I also say that my friend from Arizona raised questions and made \nstatements about the 9/11 Commission of which Governor Kean is \nchairman. Of course, that has a number of people on it, such as Senator \nMax Cleland. But as we have read from the press accounts, even Governor \nKean, a Republican, is concerned about the lack of information.\n  From the 9/11 Commission, Governor Kean has indicated publicly that \nhe may go to as far as issuing subpoenas to the White House to get the \ninformation he hasn't gotten yet.\n  If we are talking about divulging information, one of the things that \nwe need to talk about is what has gone on in preparing this \nintelligence report between the White House and the Intelligence \nCommittee which is supposed to be sacrosanct in itself.\n  Numerous questions have been raised about what the intelligence \ncommunity told the Bush administration about the threat posed by Saddam \nHussein and how administration officials used this information in the \ndays leading up to the war with Iraq.\n  What was the factual basis for the administration's assertion that \nIraq attempted to acquire uranium in Niger?\n  What was the factual basis for the administration's assertion that \nthere were concrete ties between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida?\n  What was the factual basis for the administration's assertion that \nIraq posed an imminent danger to the United States?\n  What was the factual basis for the administration's assertion that if \nwe did not act in Iraq, the so-called smoking gun would be a mushroom \ncloud?\n  In all the speeches, not one of my colleagues has suggested that \nthese are not legitimate questions for congressional inquiry. That is \nbecause each of us recognizes that we need a strong, independent \nintelligence community to win the war on terrorism.\n  In order to answer these questions, we need to understand both what \nintelligence told the administration about these issues and how the \nadministration used that information.\n  Both issues have important implications for national security, and \nboth issues should be thoroughly examined by Congress.\n  Nevertheless, the Intelligence Committee chairman rejected the Armed \nServices Committee chairman's proposal to conduct a joint \ninvestigation.\n  My friend, the senior Senator from Virginia, asked for a joint \ninquiry by the Armed Services Committee and Intelligence. But that \ndidn't come to be, even though we all know it was a good idea.\n  At the same time that he was rejecting these entreaties from members \nof both parties, press reports indicate that the majority was meeting \nwith the White House, as I have already indicated, to discuss how to \nproceed on matters that affect the intelligence community.\n  I don't think it should come as a surprise to anyone who knows these \nissues that some in this body who are concerned about our national \nsecurity have seen their pleas ignored by the majority. They have been \nfrustrated.\n  It is difficult for Members in this position to understand why the \nmajority would refuse to explore the questions that I have outlined \nonly briefly--questions which we all agree need to be answered if we \nare to succeed in this war on terrorism. We all agree that these are \nimportant questions. We all agree the committee has authority to look \ninto these issues.\n\n  While we are posing questions for each other here, my question is \nthis: Why isn't the Intelligence Committee looking at both what the \nintelligence community knew and how the administration used that \ninformation?\n  Again, the memo that is the subject matter of the discussion here \ntoday was not leaked by anyone we know. In fact, we believe--and I \nthink there is credible evidence to indicate--that it was stolen, \npurloined, and then made public. It wouldn't have been made public but \nfor the majority.\n  Doesn't the minority have a right, in the secret confines of the \nIntelligence Committee room, to have pieces of paper there that aren't \ngoing to be pilfered by the majority? The staff allocation is very \nunfair. Some say it is about 30 to 3. But in spite of that, those 30 \nshould have better things to do than to pilfer through the records of \nthe minority.\n  I have the greatest confidence in Senator Roberts and Senator \nRockefeller. I think we should get back to the business of this \nIntelligence Committee. We should get back to it, and I hope they will \nbroaden the investigation. If they decide not to broaden the \ninvestigation, as the memo indicated--and I have only read little bits \nand pieces of it; I haven't studied the memo--then there are things the \nminority can do to bring this out because the issues that I have raised \nshould be made public.\n  I hope these two fine Senators--the Senator from Kansas and the \nSenator from West Virginia--will work together as they have so well and \nnot let this stolen memo hurt the deliberations of this most important \ncommittee, the Intelligence Committee.\n  I apologize to the majority leader. I know he is a busy man. I am \nsorry I took so long to respond to the remarks made by others here \ntoday.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we are about to wrap up here in just a \ncouple of minutes.\n  But just from my standpoint, based on the comments that have been \nmade, we still have no one disavowing the contents of the memo or the \nintent of the memo. All I ask at this juncture is, Who wrote it? Who \nwas it intended for? Who was the recipient?\n  Second, I ask for someone to stand up and disavow either the intent \nor the content of the memo.\n  Third, an apology to the chairman, who it certainly seems to me there \nis an intent to in some ways embarrass and subtract from the integrity \nhe has brought to that committee.\n  Those three things.\n  Just to respond very briefly about some other business, we share the \nminority whip's concern about getting our business done. I have \nmentioned that November 21 is the target date for us to adjourn.\n  I am pleased that we have been able--speaking to the legislation that \nwe mentioned--to lock in a time agreement on Syria accountability. It \nwas a priority of mine. It is a priority on my side of the aisle, and \non the other side of the aisle. And I can assure our colleagues that it \nwill be done early next week. I am not sure exactly what that date \nwould be but sometime early next week. There are Members on both sides \nof the aisle who desire to speak on the Syria Accountability Act. I \nurge them to be available early next week, Monday or Tuesday, or they \nmight not get that opportunity. I understand both sides of the aisle \nwant to progress quickly to this important piece of legislation, the \nSyria Accountability Act.\n\n[[Page S14261]]\n\n  On MILCON, I am prepared to move on that conference report. If the \nminority whip is willing, I am prepared to lock in a 20-minute time \nagreement to allow the managers to make short statements and then to \nallow us to finish that measure. I ask the Democratic whip if he would \nallow us to proceed to that when we proceed to the conference report, \nthat it be considered, and that a short time agreement be part of that \nagreement.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I ask that the consent be \nmodified to allow the statements to be made after the bill passes \ntoday. We would pass it today, and people could have more than 20 \nminutes next week to speak on it all they want. This matter should be \npassed immediately.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as I said earlier, I renew my request as \nmade because it is very important that people who have worked very hard \non MILCON, out of respect for them and those managers, be here and they \nmake the appropriate speeches and response in support of this bill.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, does the leader have the \ntime in mind when he would bring this up?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we would bring it up the early part of next \nweek.\n  Mr. REID. As I have indicated, I want it passed tonight. People in \nNellis Air Force Base and Fallon can do without speeches. It should be \npassed now. If it will not be passed now, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as you can tell, we have a very busy week \nnext week. I will comment a little bit more on the schedule shortly and \nwe will be doing MILCON and Syria as well as many other things over the \nnext several days.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/07/senate-section/article/S14261-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to discuss something that \nstruck me as downright chilling when I saw it yesterday in the paper. \nIt was the signing of the so-called partial-birth abortion bill. I want \nto show a picture as it appeared--as I first saw it in the Washington \nPost. I challenge anybody: Find a woman in that picture. We even \nbroadened it to a larger picture, and once again I issue the challenge: \nFind a woman in this picture. There are 10 men, not 1 woman in that \npicture.\n  This picture represents the most sweeping attack on women's rights in \n30 years. What do we see? We see a group of gleeful men, smiles across \ntheir faces. We don't see the picture of the women who are frightened \nto death about what can happen if they need to make a decision to \nprotect their health, in the company of their doctor.\n  This gleeful group is watching President Bush sign away women's \nrights. Look at the image--not a woman on the stage. Does anybody doubt \nabout how the population splits 50-50 between the two genders? But \nhere, in these two pictures, it is all men, and it is downright \nfrightening.\n  It has been said that a picture is worth a thousand words. When women \nacross America picked up the paper or watched the news and saw this \nimage, it spoke volumes. This photo says to women: Your right to make \nchoices about your health and your body is being taken back from you.\n  I am the proud father of three daughters and five granddaughters. I \ndon't want the men in these pictures making decisions for my daughters \nor my granddaughters when it comes to their health and their well being \nand their families' well-being. Thank goodness, all of my children have \nchildren. They have wonderful families. But they have to take care of \nthose families. If their health is jeopardized by a pregnancy or a \ndisease, I want them to be able to take care of it.\n  Not here. These men will make your choices for you.\n  I am old enough to remember a time when women were not permitted to \nmake choices, when women couldn't hold certain positions in society. \nThere was a time when women couldn't vote. We have made great strides \nforward to advance women's rights, and one of those rights is the right \nto choose. But look at this picture. These fellows are eager to snatch \nthose rights away from women.\n  The absence of women on the stage says something. Make no mistake. We \nhave more than a dozen women in the Senate. I don't know what the count \nis in the House. Not one of them stood on this floor during the debate \nand defended that law that was passed and signed so smugly at the White \nHouse. I call this a ``malegarchy'' and this photo captures the essence \nof the ``malegarchy'' women live under today.\n  If we keep going backwards, maybe it will be possible our women will \nlive like they do in parts of the Middle East and have to wear burqas. \nThe men will decide.\n  I think it is shameful. It is embarrassing to see this image in the \n21st century in the United States of America. Have we entered a time \nwarp? In some ways we have. Ultra right-wing conservatives who control \nthis Congress and control the White House are more in line with the \nthinking of the 19th century than the 21st century.\n  The conservatives today speak of ``traditional family values'' and \nprotecting marriage. Those are their buzz phrases, but you look back in \nhistory and what you see here is a repeat of the same themes constantly \nused to keep women subservient. I couldn't get away with that in my \nhousehold.\n  In 1914, during the battle over the women's right to vote, there was \na group called the Nebraska Men's Association Opposed to Women's \nSuffrage--that was the title of the organization. It was organized in \n1914. The group published a document expressing its reasons for \nopposing women's suffrage. The association claimed if we give women the \nability to vote, to make electoral choices, then that would lead to \n``attempts to change home and marriage.'' Does that sound familiar? It \nis the same rhetoric we hear today. In this picture, it is the same \nrhetoric being used at this bill signing.\n  We also hear about the ``culture of life.'' What about the woman's \nlife? What about her health? This law does not include a health \nexception. What if a woman's health is in danger? What if her life is \nultimately threatened by complications stemming from the pregnancy? And \nwhere is the culture of life when that fetus is born? Where is the \nculture of life for children who have been born?\n\n  Earlier in this Congress, the anti-choice conservatives led the fight \nagainst the child tax credit for low-income working families. Where are \nthe family values in that? Where is the culture of life in that?\n  How about nutrition for those children? How about education for those \nchildren? How about health care for those children?\n  We have seen ``no'' vote after ``no'' vote on funding these programs \nfor making our children healthier and brighter and more productive.\n  I was pleased to see the Federal courts in Nebraska and New York \nissue injunctions against this unconstitutional abortion law. The vast \nmajority of legal scholars predict this law will be easily overturned, \nbased on Roe v. Wade, and it should.\n  The famed American suffragette Elizabeth Cady Stanton said ``men want \ntheir rights and nothing more, but women want their rights and nothing \nless.'' As we can see with the signing of this bill, women's rights are \nstill under attack. We must not settle for anything less than full \nreproductive rights for women in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/07/senate-section/article/S14261-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14261-S14263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CONGRESSIONAL PORK\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to address an article that \nappeared on the front page of Roll Call on Thursday, November 8. The \ntitle of the article was ``McCain Breaks Own Pork Rule,'' and it \naddressed my efforts, as a member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, to secure authorized funding--I emphasize authorized--for \nland acquisition at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona. Sadly, the headline \nwas misleading and the article itself was simply inaccurate.\n  As my colleagues know--and I see my colleague from West Virginia in \nthe Chamber--for many years I have made it a point to carefully \nscrutinize the annual appropriations bills which are, in my view, \nwasteful porkbarrel spending. I have specific criteria for identifying \nthese projects which are very clear. Simply put: If an item is \nrequested by the administration or properly authorized, I do not object \nto it and I do not consider it a porkbarrel project. Having said that, \nlet me address the situation discussed in the Roll Call article.\n\n[[Page S14262]]\n\n  The authorization for funds for the land acquisition at Luke Air \nForce Base was included in both the House Armed Services Committee \nmarkup of the fiscal year 2003 Defense authorization bill and the \nfiscal year 2003 authorization conference report, and in the Senate \nArmed Services Committee markup of the fiscal year 2004 authorization \nbill. As a member of the authorizing committee, I readily admit I \nworked hard to procure the authorized funds necessary for the land \nacquisition. As all of my colleagues are aware, authorizing the \nexpenditure of Federal funds before appropriating them is the proper \nprocess. It is the way we are supposed to do things in this body.\n  As no one disputes, the authorization bill includes a provision for \nthe Luke land acquisition. It will be adopted by both Chambers and \nsigned into law by the President. I cannot recall a Defense \nappropriations or Military Construction appropriations markup occurring \nafter the Defense authorization bill conference report was signed into \nlaw. As my colleagues know, appropriators have only the Senate-passed \nauthorization bill to use in determining whether projects proposed for \ninclusion in their markup are authorized.\n  Simple fact and not my opinion--I emphasize, it is a fact, not my \nopinion--rule XVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate expressly \nacknowledges that Senate bills that were previously passed in the \ncurrent session authorize appropriations. The rule states in part that:\n\n       The term unauthorized appropriation means an appropriation \n     (i) not specifically authorized by law or Treaty stipulation \n     unless the appropriation has been specifically authorized by \n     an Act or resolution previously passed by the Senate during \n     the same session. . . .\n\n  That is exactly what happened with the authorization bill. Therefore, \nthe Senate considers it authorized when the authorization bill passes \nthe Senate, not when the conference report is signed into law. Again, \nthis is a standing rule of the Senate, not an arbitrary decree of my \nown. I have never objected to an appropriation on the grounds that \nwhile it was authorized in the Senate-passed bill and was accepted by \nHouse and Senate conferees, the conference had yet to finish its work. \nI consider such an appropriation to be authorized while consistent with \nSenate rules and the fact that the report had yet to be voted only a \ntechnical formality.\n\n  The article also suggested that I requested from the Military \nConstruction Appropriations Subcommittee an unauthorized earmark for \nLuke Air Force Base. That suggestion is simply not true. I \ncategorically deny ever approaching any member of the Appropriations \nCommittee in order to request funding for this project, or any other \nproject for that matter. It just simply didn't happen.\n  If there is any member of the Appropriations Committee who will come \nforward and say that I did, I would be very interested, because it \ndidn't happen.\n  The fact is, when I was approached by the chairman of the Senate \nMilitary Construction Appropriations Subcommittee, who informed me that \nif I wanted the money authorized for Luke included in her \nsubcommittee's markup, I would have to send her a letter requesting it, \nI firmly refused to do so, noting only in conversation with the \nchairman that the money had been authorized and that the appropriators \nshould follow that instruction.\n  I believe strongly, as every Member of the Senate knows, that \nappropriators should follow the instructions of the authorizing \ncommittees. And no one should have to write a letter requesting it. I \nnever have.\n  It has come to my attention that three different members of the \nAppropriations Committee told the Roll Call reporter responsible for \nthis article that I approached them and requested this funding. Again, \nthis is not true. I challenge any member of the House or Senate \nAppropriations Committee to come forward and prove I made any such \nrequest.\n  I have with me a letter to the editor of Roll Call from Tom Schatz, \npresident of Citizens Against Government Waste. As my colleagues know, \nCitizens Against Government Waste is a very well respected and \nnonpartisan government watchdog organization. I have worked with them \nfor many years, and I am proud of our joint efforts to combat wasteful \nspending. In the letter Mr. Schatz says:\n\n       Citizens Against Government Waste (CAGW) is concerned about \n     the accuracy of the article, ``McCain Breaks Own Pork Rule,'' \n     that Roll Call published on November 6. [Citizens Against \n     Government Waste] is dedicated to hunting down pork-barrel \n     projects in every appropriations bill. In fact, CAGW's fiscal \n     Congressional Pig Book contained 9,362 pork-barrel projects. \n     Senator John McCain has been the leading voice in the Senate \n     trying to stop this egregious practice. As for the $14.3 \n     million for Luke Air Force Base mentioned in your article, \n     Sen. McCain has assured us he did not request any \n     unauthorized fund from any member of the appropriations \n     committee.\n       We have worked closely for many years with Senator McCain \n     in our joint effort to combat wasteful government spending. \n     He believes that spending provisions, particularly defense-\n     related projects, be contained in the Department of Defense \n     authorization bill. Senator McCain serves on the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee, and he readily admits that he worked hard \n     to ensure that funding for Luke AFB was included in the \n     Senate DOD authorization bill. The timing of the \n     authorization versus appropriations bills is a red herring in \n     this story, designed to make it appear that Senator McCain \n     has violated his own rules on pork barrel spending.\n       Sincerely,\n       Tom Schatz, President, Citizens Against Government Waste.\n\n  Mr. President, I regret I had to take the time of the Senate to \naddress this issue. I feel it is important for my colleagues to know \nthe truth. I know very well if I violated my own rules, it would get a \nlot of publicity and longevity. I have not done that in 17 years, and I \nwill not. That is why I come to the floor today to correct what was \nwritten in that article.\n  I have been very diligent in ensuring my office never violates the \nsame standards for appropriations to which I have long insisted my \ncolleagues adhere. I did not do so in this case and I will not do so in \nthe future. I appreciate the indulgence of my colleague from North \nDakota.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                                Tankers\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I commend the Chairman of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, the senior Senator from Virginia, Senator John \nWarner for putting the Committee on Armed Services back on the map of \nrelevancy and like any sea captain with a steady hand decisively \nchanging the course of the committee from just a debating society. I \nbelieve that the Appropriations Committee will think twice before they \ntry to pull this off again. This began in September 2001 when Secretary \nRoche, the Boeing Company and the Appropriations Committee decided to \nlease 100 Boeing 767 tankers and go around the traditional budget \nprocess at the Pentagon, go around the Secretary of Defense, go around \nthe Office of Management and Budget, go around the authorizing \ncommittee--(SASC)--and insert a $30 billion new start lease of 100 \nBoeing 767 aerial refueling tankers into the Department of Defense \nAppropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2002--without a single hearing, \ndebate, or vote.\n  However, late yesterday afternoon Secretary Wolfowitz sent a letter \nto the defense committees which would enable the SECAF to sign a \ncontract for the requisition of 100 tankers now, and to buy 80 of them \non delivery.\n  This language has negative financial and budgetary implications. \nImportantly, it will provide that lease-unique disbursements, such as \nconstruction financing--$7.5 million per plane--lease administration \ncosts--costing up to $5.5 million per plane; FAA certification--which \nwould be considerable and yet unnecessary when the Air Force owns the \nplanes; and other costs such as operating expenses for any special-\npurpose entity extend to the order of 80 tankers--which the SECAF will \nbuy.\n  In addition, the USAF will not be required to set aside money now for \nthe purchase of these tankers. So, when the tankers are built, the USAF \nwill have to come up with the cash to pay for them. But, at that point, \nthe temptation will be simply to extend the lease and not convert to a \nbuy when the time comes to do so. So, this proposal puts no pressure on \nthe USAF to make choices before starting to build planes number 21-100. \nInstead, it will have Congress over a barrel to pay for planes already \nbuilt under the tanker lease regime. Thus, as is the case under\n\n[[Page S14263]]\n\nthe original lease proposal, the USAF will get its tankers in a way \nthat defers the payment burden to someone else at some unspecified \npoint in the future.\n  This is what we were trying to originally avoid.\n  The language we agreed to late last night is clear and would \nunequivocally prevent the USAF from leasing more than the 20 tankers.\n  And more importantly will prevent ``costs that are unique to this \nlease arrangement . . . costs for issuing the bonds required to finance \nthe lease or the construction of the tankers, operating expenses for \nthe special-purpose entity, lease administration fees, FAA \ncertification costs, etc.'' apply to the subsequent 80 aircraft.\n  The Air Force will be forced to, just like the other military \nservices do, obtain budget authority before placing an order for the \npurchase of tankers or before Boeing spends any money for the \nconstruction of those planes. Because this will require the USAF to pay \nat the time of order, make progress payments and acquire the tankers \nunder two separate contracts, as it should, potential savings could be \nas much as $5.2 billion according to unofficial CBO estimates.\n  Remarkably, the key threshold issue of corrosion remains an open \nissue. CRS still believes that, to date, the DOD has not provided a \nthorough corrosion assessment as the SASC asked for. And, the two \nreports that Secretary Roche cited as updating the Economic Service \nLife Study, ESLS, which concluded that the current fleet is viable to \n2040, are in no way comparable in sophistication, depth or scope. So, \nto date, the DOD has produced, despite numerous requests, any data or \nanalysis that invalidates the conclusions of the ESLS.\n  The November 5, 2003, letter from the Deputy Secretary of Defense to \nChairman Warner is disturbing. In this letter, the DOD describes how it \nintends to proceed acquiring tankers under the legislative language \nagreed upon by the conferees 2 days ago. In particular, it indicates \nthat the DOD intends to sign the current contract for the acquisition \nof all the tankers now and not obtain requisite budget authority until \nthe out-years to fund the purchase of the tankers.\n  According to the letter, the DOD will fund its purchase of the 80 \ntankers by adding $3.8 billion in the out-years to ``achieve[ ] an \nimmediate start to the program and allow [for the] purchase [of] the \nlast 80 aircraft at time of delivery.''\n  There are several problems with this:\n  It seems inconsistent with the plain language of the bill that the \nconference has agreed upon--that the USAF buy up to 80 aircraft under a \nmulti-year procurement/incremental funding methodology.\n  It will likely result in the proposals being scored as a $18 billion \n``direct purchase.''\n  It suggests that taxpayers will be stuck with unnecessarily having to \npay for construction financing costs at a premium open-market rate and \nother lease-unique disbursements.\n  It is unabashedly similar to what the USAF intended to do under the \noriginal contract to lease 100 tankers, and I appreciate that we now \nhave a commitment, as Senator Warner said on the floor of the Senate, \nthat would put this program back into the traditional procurement \nprocess, this program back into the traditional budget process, and \nthis program back into the traditional authorization process.\n  I yield.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/07/senate-section/article/S14263-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR.

I hope my colleagues will join me in \nexpressing condolences to his family in this great loss.\n  King Sanders left a worthy and memorable legacy for his wife, Rose; \nhis children, Courtney and Michael, and other family members and \nfriends to remember him by. He was a vocational Christian minister for \n30 years, working as a director of missions and then a pastor in New \nMexico for 20 of those years. During the last 14 years of his life, \nKing also worked in the public policy arena. He served as liaison to \nthe New Mexico legislature on behalf of that State's Baptist convention \nfor eight years. Beginning in 1997, he worked here in Washington for \nthe Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist \nConvention.\n  His behind-the-scenes work in our Nation's Capital supported the \nefforts of the ERLC and others to make this country all it should be. \nHe used his abilities and position in the effort to protect all human \nlife, from conception to natural death. King worked to help expand \nreligious freedom to all people in this country and around the world. \nHe was concerned about marriages and families, and sought to strengthen \nthem and protect them from the ravages of harmful forces in our \nculture. He also worked earnestly to motivate citizens to become more \ninvolved in the political process.\n  For King, relationships were foremost. He loved people and served \nthem in many ways. He constantly expressed concern for others, even in \nthe midst of the health problems that plagued him near the end of his \nlife. His love for others and his concern for their welfare were based \non his relationship with God by faith in Jesus Christ.\n  King Sanders was the best of what this country is all about. He \nwanted America to be a great force for good in the world, and he wanted \nthe lives of Americans to be blessed. All who knew him will miss him, \nand we pay tribute to his influential life and legacy.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/07/senate-section/article/S14263-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14263-S14264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               NEW TERMINAL AT ABERDEEN REGIONAL AIRPORT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to speak about an important \nceremony occurring this Veterans Day in my home town: the dedication of \na new terminal at Aberdeen Regional Airport.\n  Community leaders have chosen Veterans Day for this event because the \nterminal will be called the War Memorial Building. It will be located \non the grounds of Saunders Field, named for General LaVerne Saunders, a \nWorld War II hero from Aberdeen.\n  A plaque inside the new building proclaims:\n\n       The City of Aberdeen dedicates this building and sculpture \n     to the brave men and women who served and continue to serve \n     to protect the values we all cherish: freedom, justice and \n     democracy.\n       The War Memorial sculpture recognizes the courage they have \n     shown and continue to show in the service of our great \n     nation. They will never be forgotten.\n       Let us reflect on the past and hope that we might learn as \n     a world to live in peace.\n\n  Those words are a fitting tribute to our nation's heroes, past and \npresent, and are especially fitting in a year that has seen a new \ngeneration take up arms in defense of the homeland. Aberdeen is one of \nthe communities that has been touched by the largest call-up of South \nDakota Guard and Reserve troops since World War II.\n  This terminal was constructed with funds from the Federal Aviation \nAdministration, State and local government, and a Senate amendment to \nthe fiscal year 2001 transportation appropriations act. I remain \ngrateful to Senator Frank Lautenberg, former ranking member of the \nTransportation Appropriations Subcommittee, for helping me secure $2.5 \nmillion in that legislation. The Senate funds completed the financing \nfor this project and allowed it to move ahead without further delay.\n  The project is a step into the future for one of the busiest airports \nin South Dakota. It replaces a 50-year-old facility, providing improved \nsecurity measures, additional ticket counter space, and expanded \nbaggage claim areas. It will improve access for disabled passengers. It \nwill shorten the time that planes spend taxiing, thus resolving a long-\nstanding problem of flight cancellations due to wing icing. Given the \ncritical role that airports play in economic development, I also see \nthis new terminal as a long-term investment in Aberdeen's prosperity.\n  This project required a great deal of hard work and dedication, and I \nwould like to thank some people who made it possible: Mayor Tom Hopper, \nthe airport board and staff, the Aberdeen City Commission, the Brown \nCounty Commission, the Aberdeen Chamber of Commerce, architects Herges \nKirchgasler Geisler & Associates, engineers Helms and Associates, \nTransportation Director Dave Osborn, and former airport managers Tom \nWylam and Rebecca Hupp.\n\n[[Page S14264]]\n\n  This facility is a wonderful tribute to America's veterans, and a \nvaluable asset for the people of northeastern South Dakota. \nCongratulations, Aberdeen, on another job well done.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to express my congratulations \nand warm wishes to Bjorn Selinder as he retires from his position as \nChurchill County Manager in the State of Nevada.\n  Bjorn, affectionately known as ``BJ'', has led a selfless life as a \npublic servant, friend, husband and father. Born in Goteborg, Sweden, \nBjorn, his brother and his parents immigrated to the United States in \nthe early 1950s and moved to Minneapolis, MN.\n  After Bjorn graduated from Southwest High School, he ended up in \nCalifornia where he met the love of his life, Judy Moffatt. Soon after \nhe met her, they married in 1996 and later moved to Nevada in 1973 to \nraise their children and start a family business.\n  Bjorn originally went to Churchill County looking for a short-term \njob. Twenty-seven years later, he is one of the longest serving county \nmanagers in the State of Nevada.\n  When he first joined Churchill County in August of 1974, his duties \nwere coordination and planning activities and acting as assistant to \nthe county manager. A short 2 years later, BJ became the Churchill \nCounty manager.\n  Prior to moving to Fallon, Nevada, Bjorn received his bachelors \ndegree in management science from Sierra Nevada College and did post \ngraduate work at the University of Nevada Reno.\n  He worked in the aerospace and ordinance industries when he lived in \nsouthern California and Minneapolis. He also came to Churchill County \nwith an understanding about how to run a small business.\n  Throughout Bjorn's life as a public servant, his wife Judy has been \nthe rock on which he leans. With the road of retirement stretching \nbefore them, they plan to spend time with their three grandchildren and \ntheir two daughters, Kristen and Majken. I am sure BJ will also put in \na few hours on the lovely Fallon golf course.\n  Bjorn Selinder is leaving his job, but he's not leaving the \ncommunity. As he goes about his new life, I hope he will take time \nevery day to look around at the county he helped create, and know that \nhis work is appreciated.\n  I congratulate Bjorn on a job well done and wish him an enjoyable \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/07/senate-section/article/S14264-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  In pronouncing sentence on 21-year-old Yitzak Abba Marta, Circuit \nJudge William Storey told the court, ``this was nothing more than a \nhate crime . . . this person was killed because he was gay.'' Marta was \nconvicted for the 1996 beating and strangling death of Alan Fitzgerald \nWalker, a transvestite. Marta and an accomplice picked up Walker \noutside of a gay nightclub while he was dressed as a woman. Police were \ncalled to Walker's home 3 days later when neighbors became suspicious \nof his disappearance. Not only had he been absent, but the tires on his \ncar had been slashed, and there were notes on his door. Police found \nWalker's body in his bedroom with ``KKK'' scrawled in blood on an \nadjacent wall.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/07/senate-section/article/S14264-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           UNIVERSAL SERVICE\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, the Senate Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation held a hearing last week on the Universal \nService Fund, USF, and I would like to take a few moments to share with \nmy colleagues some thoughts on this topic. As many of my colleagues \nknow, the survival and strength of this fund is critically important to \nproviding affordable, state-of-the-art telecommunications services to \nrural and high-cost areas. Without universal service support, many \nresidents in South Dakota and other rural areas would not have the \nopportunity to share in the benefits of quality telephone and data \nservices.\n  I have recently cosponsored S. 1380, the Rural Universal Service \nEquity Act of 2003, which would change the formulas that determine the \ndistribution of universal service high-cost funds among nonrural \ntelephone companies. I believe this legislation is necessary to address \nan inequity in the current formulas limiting the amount of high-cost \nsupport so called nonrural companies such as Qwest receive from the \nUSF. While I am pleased that under this legislation, South Dakota would \nreceive more support than it currently does, I am mindful that it does \nso at the expense of other States and Puerto Rico.\n  Under the current USF system, although Qwest provides telephone \nservice to many South Dakota residents, including some in very rural \nand high cost areas, it receives no universal service support from the \nhigh-cost model for operations in South Dakota. This has the practical \neffect of forcing Qwest to keep rates in other areas of my State higher \nthan they otherwise would be in order to subsidize service in the high \ncost areas.\n  Although I support this legislation, I recognize that it does not \naddress the more fundamental issues threatening the sustainability of \nthe universal service fund. The entire universal service system is \njeopardized because of a shrinking contribution base and increased \ndemands. Without addressing these fundamental problems related to the \nviability of the system as a whole, the change in the formulas as \nproposed in S. 1380 will have limited value.\n  I urge my colleagues to work in a bipartisan manner to help assess \nand develop comprehensive solutions to the many outstanding and \nemerging issues that confront the universal service program. We can do \nno less if we truly believe in the underlying principles of this \nlongtime national policy that has proven so vital to both our economic \nand national security.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/07/senate-section/article/S14265-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S14265]]\n                  FDA CBER RESEARCH ACTIVITIES FUNDING\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, the fiscal year 2004 Agriculture, Rural \nDevelopment and Related Agencies Appropriations Act includes \nappropriations for the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Review of \nthe Food and Drug Administration to continue important vaccine and \nbiological product research activities. Support of these research \nactivities is essential for keeping CBER scientists and medical \nreviewers up-to-date and knowledgeable of the breakthrough science of \nvaccine and biological product research and development. Being involved \nin this cutting edge research better equips CBER scientists and \nreviewers with the best scientific-based tools for reviewing and \nregulating the safety and efficacy of live-saving vaccines and other \nbiological products.\n  During our subcommittee and Committee deliberations, many colleagues \nshared my concerns about the emergence of SARS, West Nile Virus, monkey \npox, antibiotic resistant staphylococcal infections in hospitals, and \nother naturally-occurring infectious diseases in the U.S. I believe \nthere is a need to expedite the development and licensing of new \nvaccines and biologicals to protect our citizens from these naturally-\noccurring infectious diseases. As with recent efforts and increased \nappropriations to augment research, regulatory testing and scientific \ncapabilities of the FDA to assist in combating bioterrorism threats, I \nendorse FDA's continued support of those capabilities at the Center for \nBiologics Evaluation and Research to combat the public health threats \nfrom naturally-occurring diseases. It is my view that continued support \nof these capabilities will better enable the Center to recruit and \nretain highly-qualified, motivated scientists and medical reviewers for \nvaccines and other biological products.\n  In past years, CBER scientists engaged in laboratory and clinical \nresearch, which greatly improved their understanding of the science, \ntheir mission of assuring the safety and efficacy of the products under \nreview by FDA, the medical needs of patients, and alternative products \navailable. This understanding resulted in a more efficient and rapid \nagency licensing processes for many new products, which presented \ncomplex scientific, medical and public health issues. For example, CBER \nreviewers deeply involved in relevant laboratory research were \nresponsible for the complex yet expeditious regulatory review and \nlicensing of the four combination diphtheria-tetanus-acellular \npertussis (DTaP) vaccines and the four Hib (meningitis) conjugate \nvaccines during the last decade.\n  Past CBER research has significantly contributed to technology \ntransfer and benefited the public through the development of assays and \nreagents, which would otherwise be too costly and time-intensive for \nindustry to duplicate. This research has facilitated the expedited \ntesting, development, and availability of several important licensed \nvaccines for the prevention of life-threatening pediatric diseases and \nis critical for others currently under development for licensing in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Administration to provide sufficient \nfunding in fiscal year 2005 for continued CBER research. These \nappropriations are essential for expediting not only the development \nand availability of licensed counter-bioterrorism vaccines and \nbiological products, but also for those intended for the prevention and \ntreatment of naturally-occurring infectious diseases, such as SARS, \nWest Nile Virus and HIV-AIDS.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/07/senate-section/article/S14265-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14265-S14266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PROTECTION OF LAWFUL COMMERCE IN ARMS ACT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, the majority leader indicated \nthat before this session of Congress comes to an end, the Senate may \nconsider the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, a bill the New \nYork Times has said ``would give gun manufacturers and dealers a \ncourthouse shield that tobacco and asbestos companies never had in \nbeing forced to come to terms with some of the damage their products \ninflict.'' While it now appears unlikely that the bill will be \nconsidered in the Senate this year, I would nevertheless like to \nexpress my concerns about it.\n  The bill would rewrite well-accepted principles of liability law, \nproviding the gun industry legal protections enjoyed by no other \nindustry. Some claim that this bill would prevent frivolous lawsuits \nand protect firearm manufacturers, dealers, and distributors from being \nheld responsible for the actions of criminals. While most gun dealers \nand manufacturers may conduct their business responsibly, this bill \nwould shield negligent and reckless gun dealers and manufacturers from \nlegitimate civil lawsuits.\n  In fact, according to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and \nthe Violence Policy Center, many meritorious cases could be dismissed \nunder the bill. And according to a letter from University of Michigan \nLaw Professor Sherman Clark, the case filed by the Washington, D.C. \narea sniper victims is among those that would not survive if the \nlegislation were enacted. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of \nProfessor Clark's letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        The University of Michigan\n\n\n                                                   Law School,\n\n                                  Ann Arbor, MI, November 6, 2003.\n       Dear Members of the United States Senate: As a professor of \n     law at the University of Michigan Law School, I write to make \n     two points regarding the legal implications of S. 1805, the \n     ``Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.''\n       First, S. 1805 would represent a substantial and radical \n     departure from traditional principles of American tort law. \n     Though described as an effort to limit the unwarranted \n     expansion of tort liability, the bill would in fact represent \n     a dramatic narrowing of traditional tort principles by \n     providing one industry with a literally unprecedented \n     immunity from liability for the foreseeable consequences of \n     negligent conduct.\n       Second, more specifically, and by way of illustration, S. \n     1805, as currently drafted, would mandate the dismissal of \n     litigation currently pending against the dealer and \n     manufacturer who are alleged to have negligently enabled John \n     Allen Muhammed and Le Boyd Malvo to obtain the assault rifle \n     used in the recent D.C. sniper killings.\n\n\n     S.1805 IS INCONSISTENT WITH TRADITIONAL PRINCIPLES OF TORT LAW\n\n       S. 1805, described as ``a bill to prohibit civil liability \n     actions from being brought or continued against \n     manufacturers, distributors, dealers, or importers of \n     firearms or ammunition for damages resulting from the misuse \n     of their products by others,'' would largely immunize those \n     in the firearms industry from liability for negligence. This \n     would represent a sharp break with traditional principles of \n     tort liability. No other industry enjoys or has ever enjoyed \n     such a blanket freedom from responsibility for the \n     foreseeable and preventable consequences of negligent \n     conduct.\n       It might be suggested that the bill would merely preclude \n     what traditional tort law ought to be understood to preclude \n     in any event--lawsuits for damages resulting from third party \n     misconduct, and in particular from the criminal misuse of \n     firearms. This argument, however, rests on a fundamental \n     misunderstanding of American tort law. American law has never \n     embraced a rule freeing defendants from liability for the \n     foreseeable consequences of their negligence merely because \n     those consequences may include the criminal conduct of third \n     parties. Numerous cases from every American jurisdiction \n     could be cited here, but let the Restatement (Second) of \n     Torts suffice:\n\n\n  Sec. 449. TORTIOUS OR CRIMINAL ACTS THE PROBABILITY OF WHICH MAKES \n                       ACTOR'S CONDUCT NEGLIGENT\n\n       If the likelihood that a third person may act in a \n     particular manner is the hazard or one of the hazards which \n     makes the actor negligent, such an act whether innocent, \n     negligent, intentionally tortious, or criminal does not \n     prevent the actor from being liable for harm caused thereby. \n     (emphasis supplied)\n       Thus, car dealers who negligently leave vehicles \n     unattended, railroads who negligently manage trains, hotel \n     operators who negligently fail to secure rooms, and \n     contractors who negligently leave dangerous equipment \n     unguarded are all potentially liable if their conduct creates \n     an unreasonable and foreseeable risk of third party \n     misconduct, including illegal behavior, leading to harm. In \n     other words, if the very reason one's conduct is negligent is \n     because it creates a foreseeable risk of illegal third party \n     conduct, that illegal conduct does not sever the casual \n     connection between the negligence and the consequent harm. Of \n     course, defendants are not automatically liable for illegal \n     third party conduct, but are liable only if--given the \n     foreseeable risk and the available precautions--they were \n     unreasonable (negligent) in failing to guard against the \n     danger. In most cases, moreover, the third party wrongdoer \n     will also be liable. But, again, the bottom line is that \n     under traditional tort\n\n[[Page S14266]]\n\n     principles a failure to take reasonable precautions against \n     foreseeable dangerous illegal conduct by others is treated no \n     differently from a failure to guard against any other risk.\n       S. 1805 would abrogate this firmly established principle of \n     tort law. Under this bill, the firearms industry would be the \n     one and only business in which actors would be free utterly \n     to disregard the possibility that their conduct might be \n     creating or exacerbating a potentially preventable risk of \n     third party misconduct. Gun and ammunition makers, \n     distributors, importers, and sellers would, unlike any other \n     business or individual, be free to take no precautions \n     against even the most foreseeable and easily preventable \n     harms resulting from the illegal actions of third parties. \n     Under S. 1805, a firearms distributor could park an unguarded \n     open pickup truck full of loaded assault rifles on a city \n     street corner, leave it there for a week, and yet be free \n     from any negligence liability if and when the guns were \n     stolen and used to do harm.\n       It might appear from the face of the bill that S. 1805 \n     would leave open the possibility of tort liability for truly \n     egregious misconduct, by virtue of several exceptions set \n     forth in Section 4(5)(i). Those exceptions, however, are in \n     fact quite narrow, and would give those in the firearm \n     industry little incentive to attend to the risks of \n     foreseeable third party misconduct.\n       One exception, for example would purport to permit certain \n     actions for ``negligent entrustment.'' The bill goes on, \n     however, to define ``negligent entrustment'' extremely \n     narrowly. The exception applies only to sellers, for example, \n     and would not apply to distributors or manufacturers, no \n     matter how egregious their conduct. Even as to sellers, the \n     exception would apply only where the particular person to \n     whom a seller supplies a firearm is one whom the seller knows \n     or ought to know will use it to cause harm. The ``negligent \n     entrustment'' exception would, therefore, not permit any \n     action based on reckless distribution practices, careless \n     handling of firearms, lack of security, or any of a myriad \n     potentially negligent acts.\n       Anotehr exception would leave open the possibility of \n     liability for certain statutory violations, variously \n     defined, including those described under the heading of \n     negligence per se. Statutory violations, however, represent \n     just a narrow special case of negligence liability. No \n     jurisdiction attempts to legislate standards of care as to \n     every detail of life, even in a regulated industry; and there \n     is no need. Why is there no need? Because general principles \n     of tort law make clear that the mere absence of a specific \n     statutory prohibition is not carte blanche for unreasonable \n     or dangerous behavior. S. 1805 would turn this traditional \n     framework on its head; and free those in the firearms \n     industry to behave as carelessly as they would like, so long \n     as the conduct has not been specifically prohibited. If there \n     is no statute against leaving an open truckload of assault \n     rifles on a street corner, under S. 1805 there could be no \n     tort liability. Again, this represents radical departure \n     from traditional tort principles.\n\n\n S. 1805 WOULD REQUIRE THE DISMISSAL OF PENDING D.C. SNIPER LITIGATION\n\n       Litigation is currently pending in Washington State against \n     the manufacturer and dealer from whom John Allen Muhammed and \n     Leo Boyd Malvo obtained the assault rifle used in the D.C. \n     area sniper killings. The lawsuit, brought on behalf of \n     victims' families, alleges in essence that the defendants' \n     negligent practices and inadequate security made this weapon \n     available to Muhammed and Malvo. There is nothing innovative \n     or cutting edge about this litigation; and it is certainly \n     not based on any new or liability-expanding theory. Rather, \n     it alleges straightforward negligence, and is analogous to \n     the sort of case that might be brought against a contractor \n     who leaves explosives unguarded at a construction site. \n     Allegedly, the firearm in question was so poorly secured that \n     17-year-old Lee Boyd Malvo was able simply to pick it up and \n     walk out of the store.\n       S. 1805, as currently drafted, would require the dismissal \n     of this litigation. The lawsuit pending is a ``qualified \n     civil action'' under the bill, because the harm came about \n     through the ``criminal or unlawful misuse of a firearm;'' and \n     the bill clearly provides that any such action ``pending on \n     the date of enactment of this Act shall be immediately \n     dismissed.''\n       None of the exceptions enumerated in the bill would operate \n     to save the litigation currently pending in Washington State. \n     It is not based on an alleged statutory violation, but on the \n     alleged failure of the defendants to take due care to secure \n     firearms. Nor does the litigation fit the bill's narrow \n     statutory definition of ``negligent entrustment.'' As noted, \n     that theory would not apply in any event to the manufacturer \n     or distributor, and would not apply to a seller in this case, \n     whose alleged negligence consists not of supplying the rifle \n     to a particular person, but in so failing to secure it that \n     it was literally available to anyone who walked in the door.\n       My aim here is not to make a claim about the merits of the \n     pending D.C. sniper litigation, but rather to illustrate the \n     scope of S. 1805. Whether or not the defendants in that case \n     were in fact so negligent in their keeping of firearms that \n     they should be found liable for negligence under Washington \n     State law is a question for the courts of that State. The \n     important point here is that under S. 1805, those defendants \n     would be free of liability no matter how careless they had \n     been. It is for this reason that the bill would require the \n     dismissal of that case. And it is this light that one can see \n     the true scope and import of S. 1805. The bill, as currently \n     drafted, would not simply protect against the expansion of \n     tort liability, but would in fact dramatically limit the \n     application of longstanding and otherwise universally \n     applicable tort principles by precluding, or requiring the \n     dismissal of, cases alleging traditional negligence \n     liability.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Sherman J. Clark.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The two alleged snipers were both legally prohibited from \nbuying guns, but through the apparent negligence of a gun dealer, they \nwere able to obtain the military-style Bushmaster assault rifle. \nReportedly, the gun dealer operated in such a grossly negligent manner \nthat 238 guns inexplicably disappeared from its store. Among the \nmissing guns were the alleged snipers' Bushmaster rifle. Several of the \nsnipers' victims have filed a lawsuit against the dealer and others. \nTheir case might not survive if this bill became law.\n  This bill would set a dangerous precedent by giving a single industry \nbroad immunity from civil liability and depriving many victims with \nlegitimate cases of their day in court. If it is enacted, other \nindustries will almost certainly line up for similar protections.\n  Every single gun safety organization has expressed its opposition to \nthis bill. This is special interest legislation. It should not be \nadopted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/07/senate-section/article/S14266-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14266-S14268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE LONG REACH OF THE HEAVY BOMBERS\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to draw my colleague's \nattention to an article published in the November 2003 edition of Air \nForce Magazine entitled ``The Long Reach of the Heavy Bombers.''\n  The article outlines the importance of our Nation's long-range bomber \nfleet, and in particular notes the increasing role the B-1 bomber is \nhaving in our national security planning.\n  I am extremely proud that Ellsworth Air Force Base in my State of \nSouth Dakota is home to the B-1 bombers and crews of the 28th Bomb \nWing. Their contributions in Operation Iraqi Freedom were critical to \nour military success. Although B-1s flew fewer than 2 percent of the \ncombat sorties in Operation Iraqi Freedom, they dropped more than half \nthe satellite guided Air Force Joint Direct Attack Munitions, JDAMs, \nand maintained a 79 percent mission capable rate. The B-1s were \nassigned against a broad range of targets in Iraq, including command \nand control facilities, bunkers, tanks, armored personnel carriers, and \nsurface-to-air missile sites. They also provided close air support for \nU.S. forces engaged in the field.\n  Given the demonstrated capabilities of the B-1 and its importance to \nour military, we need to continue to invest in the technological \nimprovements that will maintain the B-1s role as the backbone of our \nbomber fleet. I am pleased that Congress enacted legislation earlier \nthis year that will return 23 B-1s to the active inventory, and I look \nforward to working with the Air Force and my colleagues in the Senate \nto ensure that we provide the resources necessary to fully upgrade \nthese planes.\n  I close by commending the men and women stationed at Ellsworth Air \nForce Base and thanking all of the members of our Armed Forces for \ntheir sacrifices on behalf of our Nation's security.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  The Long Reach of the Heavy Bombers\n\n                          (By Adam J. Hebert)\n\n       In mid-2001, the B-1B was in trouble. Years of fiscal \n     stringencies had left the bomber with a $2 billion \n     modernization backlog, poor reliability, rising upgrade \n     costs, and some major combat deficiencies.\n       Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, reflecting the \n     prevailing view, charged the B-1 ``is not contributing to the \n     deterrent or to the warfighting capability to any great \n     extent.'' Indeed, the purported backbone of the Air Force \n     heavy bomber fleet seemed destined for the scrap heap.\n       Then, things changed, and, just two years later, the B-1B \n     became one of the star weapon systems in Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom. Just 11 aircraft deployed to the combat theater. \n     However, commanders set up and maintained B-1B ``orbits'' \n     that kept at least one of the B-1Bs in the air around the \n     clock, ready to\n\n[[Page S14267]]\n\n     engage emerging targets with huge loads of precision weapons.\n       Mission capable rates soared, and modernization programs \n     were funded and put back on track.\n       For the Air Force's long-range bombers, the wars in \n     Afghanistan and Iraq provided some of their finest hours. \n     Their performance in many ways validated the service's bomber \n     investment programs. USAF's B-1, B-2, and B-52 bombers were \n     heavily tasked and proved to be highly effective in the two \n     recent wars--and turned in several combat ``firsts.''\n       As Air Force planners describe it, the B-1Bs served as \n     ``roving linebackers,'' circling the battlespace and waiting \n     for a call instructing them to unleash deadly satellite \n     guided Joint Direct Attack Munitions. B-1Bs and B-52Hs \n     performed close air support strikes for ground forces, and \n     the venerable B-52H, the last of which was built in 1962, \n     delivered laser guided bombs using newly installed Litening \n     targeting pods. B-2s used new deployable shelters and were \n     ``turned'' at a forward location to perform additional combat \n     missions.\n       At least once, B-7B, and B-52H aircraft all were employed \n     in the same strike package.\n\n\n                              no Surprise\n\n       ``It is no surprise that those aircraft and platforms were \n     used in the way they were,'' said Maj. Gen. David A. Deptula, \n     Air Combat Command's director of plans and programs. He said \n     that the results of bomber usage over the past two years \n     have confirmed what proponents of long-range strike \n     capabilities had said for a long time: The range, payload, \n     precision capabilities, and flexibility of bombers make \n     them a superb weapon whose uses go well beyond mere \n     ``carpet bombing.''\n       Gen. John P. Jumper, the Air Force Chief of Staff, offered \n     one example of the new way of doing business. A combat \n     controller in Afghanistan sent enemy coordinates ``up to a B-\n     52 at 39,000 feet, and the B-52 put laser guided munitions \n     down'' on a target that was only 1,000 feet in front of \n     friendly forces.\n       ``That's the effect of close air support,'' Jumper said. \n     ``You [didn't] see the airplane or feel the heat from the \n     engines, but the precision was even better than we were able \n     to do in Vietnam.''\n       ``This is not a surprise,'' Deptula said, noting that USAF \n     decided years ago to push for improved bomber defensive \n     systems, data links, and the ability to deliver smart \n     weapons, all with an eye to making long-range systems \n     effective in the future.\n       In the zero-sum game of defense budgeting, however, long-\n     range strike has clearly suffered at times.\n       For example, DOD's response to the chronic underfunding of \n     the B-1 fleet was not to fully fund the program but rather \n     was to slash its numbers. USAF announced in 2001 that it \n     would retire one-third of the B-1B fleet--dropping it from 93 \n     to 60 aircraft--consolidate what remained at two bases, and \n     use the savings to eliminate the $2 billion modernization \n     backlog.\n       Some bomber partisans were up in arms, but the plan has \n     worked, so far as it goes. Within the slimmed-down fleet, 36 \n     B-1B aircraft were kept combat ready, with the other 24 in \n     training status, depot maintenance, or test. That has been \n     sufficient for the wars of recent years. Officials have long \n     maintained that they would prefer a small fleet of effective \n     aircraft to a large fleet of deficient systems.\n       The B-1B's MC rate--the percentage of aircraft ready to \n     perform their primary mission at any given time--has \n     increased steadily since the decision.\n       The Institute for Defense Analyses, a federally funded \n     research center, determined back in 1995 that B-1B MC rates \n     are heavily dependent upon sufficient spare parts, equipment, \n     and personnel. Until the retirements began, the Air Force was \n     never able to give the bomber the sustained support it \n     required.\n       The B-1B MC rate has risen from 61 percent in 2001 to 66 \n     percent in 2002 and 71 percent this year. For the bombers \n     deployed in support of Gulf War II, the rate was even \n     better--79 percent. (The B-2 and B-52 bombers supporting OIF \n     posted MC rates of 85 percent and 77 percent, respectively).\n       This marks a dramatic turnaround. In the 1990s, B-1B \n     mission capability typically slogged around 60 percent.\n\n\n                            When Lines Blur\n\n       The line between strategic and tactical systems--never as \n     distinct as it may have appeared--forever has been blurred, \n     and the bombers have proved adept at flying ``tactical'' \n     missions (while some fighters have proved equally adept at \n     the ``strategic mission''). Close air support is no longer \n     the exclusive domain of the A-10 tank-killer aircraft. F-117 \n     fighters carried out numerous strategic strikes in Baghdad \n     and elsewhere. Officials point to this jumbling of \n     operational use as a success in the shift to effects-based \n     operations.\n       At times, B-1s were able to use moving target indicator \n     radars to perform the functions normally reserved for \n     dedicated intelligence-surveillance-reconnaissance (ISR) \n     aircraft--an airpower first, according to U.S. Central \n     Command.\n       Each bomber in the Air Force fleet now is capable of \n     delivering JDAMs, which offer targeting flexibility. The JDAM \n     cannot only hit fixed targets with near-precision accuracy in \n     all weather conditions but also be quickly programmed to \n     attack a fleeting ``emerging target.'' One strike against \n     Iraq's Republican Guard Medina Division required a B-2 to \n     reprogram its JDAMs, en route to the target, to take \n     advantage of new intelligence coming in from a Global Hawk \n     unmanned aerial vehicle.\n       Toward the end of major combat, a B-1B orbiting above \n     western Iraq showed the value of the Air Force's heavy \n     bombers in a new way. Intelligence sources on the ground got \n     a tip on the location of former Iraqi dictator Saddam \n     Hussein. The information was beamed to a B-1B circling in the \n     area. Just 12 minutes later, the target lay in ruins, though \n     Saddam may have gotten out shortly before the roof fell in. \n     After dashing to Baghdad and programming in the coordinates, \n     the B-1B had precisely dropped four 2,000-pound JDAMs where \n     Saddam was thought to be.\n       In addition to deploying 11 B-1Bs, Air Force leaders \n     reported they sent to war four B-2s and 28 B-52s. These 43 \n     aircraft flew a total of 505 sorties between March 20 and \n     April 18, but, as was true in the Afghan war, the bombers' \n     impact was out of all proportion to their numbers. One \n     official noted that at third of all the aim points struck \n     in Iraq were hit by that small bomber force.\n       Jumper made special note of the bomber impact in the now \n     famous sandstorm that struck Iraq March 25. ``You couldn't \n     see your hand in front of your face,'' he said, and war \n     commentators began to ponder the significance of the \n     ``pause'' in the war.\n       ``While the commentators were rattling on,'' said Jumper, \n     USAF's bombers and other aircraft were at work. With the Air \n     Force's ISR systems able to see through the sand, and GPS-\n     guided weapons unhindered by the weather, ``B-1s and B-52s \n     were up there pounding the heck out of [the Medina \n     Division],'' Jumper said. ``I'd like to ask the commander of \n     the Medina Division when he thought the pause was.''\n\n\n                           ``amazing'' powers\n\n       Gen. T. Michael Moseley, who led the allied air war, had \n     another anecdote on the effectiveness of long-range systems. \n     From the United States, a B-2 stealth bomber for the first \n     time delivered 80 500-pound bombs in a single run.\n       Moseley said the ability to fly from Whiteman AFB, Mo., and \n     drop those 80 weapons against an Iraqi troop concentration \n     was ``an amazing capability to bring the [commander's] \n     quiver.''\n       The success of the bombers in Iraq and Afghanistan has not \n     dramatically changed the Air Force's plans for the aircraft. \n     Because the Air Force has used only a small number of bombers \n     in recent wars, USAF planners still say the existing bomber \n     inventory will be adequate until around 2038. Also helpful is \n     the fact that only one bomber was lost in the two major \n     combat operations. In December 2001, a B-1B, doomed by \n     numerous onboard failures, crashed in the Indian Ocean on its \n     way to Afghanistan.\n       The Air Force believes an inventory of 60 B-1Bs (36 combat \n     coded); 21 B-2s (16 combat coded); and 76 B-52s (44 combat \n     coded) will suffice.\n       ``About 150 bombers is the right number,'' said Brig. Gen. \n     Stephen M. Goldfein, USAF's director of operational \n     capability requirements. There has been ``no sea change in \n     the number of bombers required,'' because of recent \n     experience, Goldfein said. The Air Force's inventory plan \n     ``includes some reserve,'' he added, but the preferred number \n     remains stable.\n       In recent years, lawmakers have often disagreed and pushed \n     for larger numbers of bombers. There have been several \n     unsuccessful attempts to restart B-2 production, with \n     proponents saying the aircraft could be produced much less \n     expensively now that the research and development expenses \n     are already paid.\n       Citing the lack of any new bomber production, Congress for \n     years has been successful in forcing the Air Force to \n     maintain 18 attrition reserve B-52s that the service \n     considers surplus. A total of 94 B-52Hs remain in service, \n     although only 44 are considered primary mission aircraft.\n       Congress, led by North Dakota lawmakers, has added funds \n     needed to keep 18 BUFFs at Minot AFB, N.D., configured \n     exactly the same as the rest of the B-52 fleet. Goldfein \n     noted that, despite the service's interest in retiring the 18 \n     aircraft, doing to wouldn't save the Air Force any money. \n     Congress pays the bill, so the savings would be for the \n     taxpayers.\n       Congress also may force the Air Force to restore some or \n     all of its recently retired B-1Bs. By late summer, three of \n     the four Congressional defense oversight committees had \n     passed legislation mandating that 23 of the 32 deactivated \n     Bones be restored to service.\n       In the bills, lawmakers offered the $20.3 million needed to \n     bring the B-1s back from the boneyard--but not the much \n     larger amount required to keep the B-1Bs in service. \n     Officials say this unfunded mandate threatens to undo the \n     progress the Air Force has made improving the health of the \n     B-1B fleet.\n       It would likely cost somewhere between $1.1 billion and $2 \n     billion to keep those aircraft in service through the end of \n     the decade. That funding ``has to come from somewhere,'' \n     Goldfein noted.\n       The existing arrangement of consolidating the B-1Bs at \n     Ellsworth AFB, S.D., and Dyess AFB, Tex., has enabled the \n     increased mission capable rates through simplified \n     maintenance and parts requirements. Fully funding the smaller \n     fleet's modernization plans brought on a ``host of \n     improvements,'' Goldfein added.\n\n\n                          incremental upgrades\n\n       With no new bomber production on the books, and old debates \n     over restarting B-2\n\n[[Page S14268]]\n\n     production or pursuing an FB-22 variant of the F/A-22 Raptor \n     seemingly on the back burner, the current emphasis is on \n     incremental upgrades. Numerous programs to improve bomber \n     effectiveness are ongoing.\n       Situational awareness improvements, the Link 16 data link, \n     laser targeting pods, and computer enhancements will continue \n     to make each bomber a more efficient war machine. And \n     upcoming weapons such as the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff \n     Missile and the Small Diameter Bomb will further broaden \n     the range and number of targets bombers can precisely \n     attack.\n       ACC officials say that, at this point, almost every \n     improvement serves a dual purpose. Upgrades are expected to \n     both sustain and modernize. Sustainment doesn't just mean \n     keeping the aircraft aloft, either--the aircraft must remain \n     valuable fighting machines. ``We're looking at 2040,'' one B-\n     52 official said. ``Unless we can come to the war, they won't \n     need us.''\n       The Air Force is trying to get additional targeting pods on \n     its B-52s, Deptula said. ``We're looking at using [Fiscal \n     2003 and 2004 funds] to get as many targeting pods as we \n     can,'' by using money set aside for the war on terrorism.\n       Goldfein said the service is interested in increasing the \n     availability of the B-2's deployable shelters. Because of the \n     sensitive low observable finish on the B-2, the bomber must \n     be maintained in a climate-controlled shelter. Deployable \n     shelters, reportedly set up at the Indian Ocean atoll of \n     Diego Garcia, increased the flexibility of the B-2 for Gulf \n     War II. The Air Force is ``looking to expand'' their use, \n     Goldfein said.\n       As Air Force officials tell it, existing bombers will \n     continue to get better and there is no urgent need to field a \n     new system. Recapitalization is ``a huge piece'' of force \n     structure planning, Deptula said, but USAF has some time to \n     make proper assessments and make wise decisions.\n       The old way of procurement--planning a new system to \n     replace an old one--``isn't completely gone.'' Deptula said, \n     ``but the fact of the matter is, with respect to the long-\n     range strike platforms formerly known as bombers, their \n     lifetime is viable for many, many years into the future.''\n       The Air Force does not expect to see a dramatic \n     technological breakthrough anytime soon. However Deptula \n     believes that hypersonics research now being done at Air \n     Force Research Laboratory may hold the key to breakthrough \n     strike capabilities in the future.\n\n\n                           Transition Period\n\n       ``We are in a transition period . . . when it comes to \n     technologies for long-range strike,'' he said. Reusable \n     hypersonic propulsion has been difficult to develop, he \n     noted, but it remains worth the effort because the technology \n     offers revolutionary responsiveness, reach, and range. \n     ``We're not there yet,'' Deptula noted.\n       Improvements to existing systems are expected to bridge the \n     gap until scientists ``solve some of these technological \n     challenges that will get us to the next step in potential \n     capability,'' he said.\n       In Deptula's view, the break-through will not come until \n     sometime in the next decade. That timing seems to mesh \n     cleanly with financial realities.\n       ``Our legacy platforms are viable through 2025,'' said \n     Deptula, ``and when we enhance them with all these \n     modifications, they are going to continue to increase in \n     capability.'' It's a nice fit, he went on, because major \n     funding for future long-range systems probably won't be \n     available ``until the 2010-2020 time frame, because we have \n     such a pressing need to recapitalize our fighter force in the \n     next decade.''\n       The Air Force is holding to its November 2001 bomber \n     roadmap, which laid out a notional plan to begin a new long-\n     range strike program sometime around 2012-15. Officials say \n     there is no need to rush into a new strike program, because \n     USAF would spend billions developing a system that may not be \n     significantly better than what is available today.\n       Features such as stealth, high speed, long loiter time, \n     large payload capacity, and flexibility are well-understood \n     goals for any future strike capability. However, there is \n     great uncertainty. Officials are loath to say a follow-on \n     system will be a ``B-3'' or even a bomber.\n       Industry, think tanks, and Air Force officials are all \n     studying what is within the ``art of the possible,'' and USAF \n     wants to keep the broadest possible range of options on the \n     table. These options include traditional bombers, unmanned \n     systems, hypersonic air-space vehicles, conventionally armed \n     ballistic missiles, and even space-based weapons. Current \n     time-lines give the Air Force a decade to explore the \n     options.\n       ACC's Long-Range Global Precision Engagement Study--a look \n     at future strike requirements--noted that the US is pushing \n     for a capability to conduct high-speed strikes against \n     emerging targets anywhere in the world on short notice. \n     However, it has limited options in this area. Conventional \n     ballistic attack missiles, derived from the nation's nuclear \n     ICBM force, ``offer increased strike flexibility,'' but the \n     financial and political cost would be high, the report noted.\n       Another area for improvement concerns stealth. The B-2 \n     bomber's low peacetime MC rates stem from the high-\n     maintenance nature of its low observable coatings. The \n     aircraft is also largely relegated to nighttime use in high-\n     threat environments. Yet the B-2 remains the only stealthy \n     strike system largely unhindered by distance or basing \n     concerns.\n       In the future, the F/A-22 and F-35 fighters will offer \n     around-the-clock stealthy strike capability, noted the study, \n     but the B-2 will continue to be the only stealthy, deep \n     strike penetrator for the foreseeable future. The F/A-22 and \n     F-35 have more limited combat ranges.\n       The study did not advocate a specific course. However, it \n     did highlight the importance of speed. The advent of \n     hypersonic weapons and platforms would permit ``prompt global \n     strike from significant ranges and reduce the risks \n     associated with forward basing,'' the report noted. Compared \n     to ballistic missiles and cruise missiles, it went on, \n     reusable platforms have high utility ``in all lesser threat \n     scenarios, enhancing their cost-effectiveness across the \n     spectrum of conflict.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/07/senate-section/article/S14268-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    TRIBUTE TO MARGARET ANN HOFFMAN\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

In order for our society to continue to advance in the right \ndirection, we must have principals like Margaret Ann Hoffman in our \nschools, and communities, and lives. She is Kentucky at its \nfinest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/07/senate-section/article/S14268-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14268-S14269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IN HONOR OF MIKE ELWOOD\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge and \nhonor a very important constituent, as well as a very important program \nin my State and across the Nation--CASA for Children. ``CASA'' is short \nfor Court Appointed Special Advocate, and it is a program that is made \nup of extraordinary men and women who find it in their hearts to devote \ntheir time and energy to help some of the neediest of their community's \nchildren. CASAs come from all walks of life, all professions, and all \neducational and ethnic backgrounds, and their mission is to advocate \nfor the best interests of children who find themselves, through no \nfault of their own, under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court \nsystem.\n  As we see all too often in public service, far too many children find \nthemselves enmeshed in the juvenile court system due to abuse, neglect \nor abandonment. Once in the court system, these kids can find \nthemselves cruelly buffeted by legal battles and their parents' \ncontinuing poor choices. Some find themselves in multiple foster care \nsituations at a very young age, and many are eventually permanently \nremoved from the care of their birth parents. CASAs serve their \ncommunities by becoming an independent advocate for a child as a sworn \nofficer of the court. They spend time with health professionals, \nteachers, parents, prospective parents, and the children themselves to \nhelp the court reach the best possible conclusion for the interests of \nthe child.\n  CASA came to Oregon in 1985 under the leadership of Judge Stephen \nHerrell and citizen advocate, Susan Holloway. For Almost 20 years, CASA \nhas trained Oregon volunteers to be the eyes and ears of the court, \nmaking independent objective recommendations regarding the best \ninterests of children.\n  In Oregon, we have a CASA leader who personally exemplifies the very \nbest of my State in his legacy of commitment to the future of Oregon's \nchildren. Mike Elwood, who has been both\n\n[[Page S14269]]\n\na CASA volunteer and a CASA supervisor in Portland, has served \nvariously as a counselor, advisor, and friend to many of my State. Mike \nonce served as a caseworker in the child welfare system, but later came \nto CASA because he believed it would be the place where he could make \nthe biggest difference.\n  Today, Mike suffers from a terminal illness. The CASA organization \nand all of Oregon has been extraordinary fortunate to have him in their \nranks. Mike's co-workers describe him as compassionate, funny, \npossessing a quiet wisdom, able to interject just the right solution \nwhen it appears to elude everyone else, and an inherently decent guy. \nOne CASA represented the feelings of a great many in the organization, \nsaying, ``I for one feel blessed to have him in my life. He is the \nbest.''\n  I want to take this opportunity to honor Mike's contributions to my \nState, to the Nation, and to humanity, and to wish Mike, his wife \nNatalie, and his two children, Ryan and Andrea, peace and joy in the \ndays ahead. I have witnessed first-hand the ripples that emanate from \nsimply human acts, good and bad. These ripples can reach across \nfamilies, across borders, and across generations. Mike's ripples have \nmade this world a far better place. I honor his dedicated service and \nhis life, as well as the service rendered by CASA workers and \nvolunteers all across our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/07/senate-section/article/S14269-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/07/senate-section/article/S14269-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/07/senate-section/article/S14269-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:58 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1829.

A bill to amend the Food Security Act of 1985 to encourage \nowners and operations of privately-held farm and ranch land to \nvoluntarily make their land available for access by the public under \nprograms administered by States; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senators Roberts, \nDaschle, Dayton, Dorgan, Johnson, Baucus, Enzi, Kerry, Harkin, Coleman, \nReid, and Nelson of Nebraska in introducing the ``Voluntary Public \nAccess and Habitat Incentive Program of 2003''.\n  Newspaper headlines across North Dakota over the past year confirm \nthat one issue has emerged as among the most controversial that we have \nseen in the State in some time. That issue has to do with who can hunt \nin North Dakota, and under what conditions.\n  As one State senator said during the 2003 session of the North Dakota \nlegislature: ``In all my years in the legislature, I haven't gotten so \nmany calls as [on] this one.''\n  Some have called for stricter limits on the number of out-of-state \nsportsmen in order to provide greater hunting opportunities for North \nDakota citizens. On the other side, many of the rural businesses in \nNorth Dakota whose livelihoods have come to depend increasingly on the \ndollars spent by non-resident hunters have urged a less restrictive \npolicy.\n  An article earlier this year in a North Dakota paper began with the \ndeclaration that, ``No bill has stirred more passion in people than \nSenate Bill 2048, which deals with capping the number of out-of-state \nhunters.'' One State legislator termed the debate over the bill, \n``civil war between residents of North Dakota fighting over hunting \nground.''\n  At its core, the hunting debate is about demand exceeding supply. \nQuite simply, the public desire for hunting and other outdoor \nrecreation opportunities increasingly exceeds the amount of land \navailable for such activities. And the problem is growing worse each \nyear. Other States face a similar challenge, and they too are in a \nquandary as they seek to address it.\n  In response to this growing problem, I have been working with a \nnumber of my colleagues--as well as farm, conservation, and sportsmen's \ngroups--to develop a positive, straightforward, voluntary and \nincentive-based approach to addressing the ``supply side'' of this \nissue. And I am pleased to be introducing that initiative today.\n  Our proposal is a voluntary landowner incentive program. Its formal \ntitle is the ``Voluntary Public Access and Habitat Incentive Program of \n2003''. As the title indicates, it is strictly voluntary in nature.\n  It would work like this: Under the program--which I to refer to as \nthe\n\n[[Page S14272]]\n\n``Open Fields'' proposal, the U.S. Department of Agriculture would \nprovide $50 million per year to State programs that offer incentive \npayments to farmers and ranchers who agree to allow public access on \ntheir land, under terms established by each state.\n  The ``Open Fields'' program would be funded in the same way that \nFederal farm and conservation programs are currently financed--through \nUSDA's Commodity Credit Corporation. To receive funding under the \nprogram, interested states would describe the benefits that the state \nhopes to achieve by encouraging public access on private farm and ranch \nland--through such activities as hunting, fishing, birding, and related \noutdoor activities--and the methods that the State will use to achieve \nthose benefits.\n  In determining the distribution of funds under the program, USDA \nwould give priority to those States that propose--1. to maximize \nparticipation by offering a program whose terms are likely to meet with \nwidespread acceptance among landowners in the state; 2. to ensure that \nland enrolled under the state program has appropriate wildlife habitat; \n3. to increase public access on land enrolled in habitat improvement \nprojects under the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program; and 4. to \nuse other Federal, state or private resources, in a collaborative way, \nto carry out the program.\n\n  But participation by the States and individual land owners in each \nState would, as I have indicated, be completely voluntary.\n  In designing the ``Open Fields'' program, our aim has been to build \non what works--to grease the wheel, rather than re-invent it. For \nexample, about 13 States already have programs designed to increase the \namount of private land available to the public, but these programs are \ngenerally modest in scope and suffer from limited funding. Our \nlegislation is designed to give these struggling State programs a \nneeded shot in the arm and to encourage other States.\n  In North Dakota, for example, we have the Private Land Initiative, \nunder which revenue generated from the sale of habitat stamps is used \nto provide cost-share assistance for wildlife habitat, and to support \nthe Conservation PLOTS program--PLOTS stands for ``Private Land Open To \nSportsmen.'' Under this program, owners agree to make their land \naccessible to the public in return for cost-share and incentive \npayments. Earlier this year, State officials made an additional $1.5 \nmillion available to increase public access on private land, in an \neffort to help diffuse tensions in the debate over resident versus non-\nresident hunters.\n  Other States have similar programs. Kansas, for example, has its \n``Walk-In Hunting'' program. Montana has a ``Block Management, Public \nAccess/Private Land'' program. Nebraska sponsors a Conservation Reserve \nProgram/Management Access Program, under which landowners with CRP \nground receive a bonus payment if they take steps to improve habitat \nand allow public access on their CRP land. Colorado recently \nimplemented its ``Walk-In Access'' program, under which interested \nhunters purchase a $20 stamp that gives them access to private land \nenrolled in the program and a directory of participating landowners.\n  All of these are fine, innovative programs, but they lack the \nresources needed to meet the public's growing demand for places to hunt \nand engage in other forms of outdoor recreation.\n  Make no mistake about it, wildlife-related recreation is a major \nforce in defining our national character and in shaping our economy. \nFor example, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in 2001, \n82 million Americans age 16 years and older participated in wildlife-\nrelated recreation. During that year, over 34 million people fished, 13 \nmillion hunted, and over 66 million participated in at least one type \nof wildlife-watching activity such as observing, feeding, or \nphotographing wildlife in the United States.\n  According to the Fish & Wildlife Service, those 82 million people who \nengaged in wildlife-related activities spent an estimated $108 billion, \nincluding over $35 billion on fishing and nearly $21 billion on \nhunting. That's big business by any definition, and it is a slice of \nthe national economy that is increasingly important to our rural \ncommunities and small businesses. In 2001 alone, for example, $20 \nbillion was spent on food, lodging, and transportation by those who \nhunted and fished, while wildlife-watching participants, including \nbirders, spent another $8.2 billion on those same items.\n  In North Dakota, wildlife-related recreation generated nearly $1 \nbillion for the State's economy during the 2001-2002 season, according \nto the North Dakota Game and Fish Commission. The Commission estimates \nthat direct spending by hunters and anglers laws $469 million during \nthe season, generating nearly $545 million in additional economic \nactivity. North Dakota ranks second in the Nation in terms of the \npercentage of the State's resident's who hunt, 19 percent, and fifth \namong States in the percentage of State residents who fish, 29 percent.\n\n  To underscore the importance of non-resident hunters to my State, the \nFish and Wildlife Service estimates that North Dakota ranks third among \nStates in the percentage of hunters in the State who are non-residents. \nThe estimated 52,000 non-resident hunters in our State make up an \nestimated 37 percent of all hunters. Only South Dakota, 65 percent, and \nColorado, 43 percent, rank higher.\n  In addition, there is ample evidence, from North Dakota State \nUniversity and individual business owners, that the wildlife and \nhunting opportunities created by the Conservation Reserve Program have \nhelped to cushion the economic impact first created when the CRP \nwithdrew land from production and caused farmers to purchase fewer \ninputs and other services so important to our struggling rural \ncommunities. So it is critically important that we look for additional \nmeans to increase sporting opportunities for the public, and do so in a \nway that not only allows traditional farming operations to continue, \nbut also increases a farm's income-earning potential. Our proposal \nwould do just that.\n  All in all, this program will be good for farm income, good for \nconservation, good for our struggling rural communities, and a positive \nforce in strengthening the bond between producers and the general \npublic.\n  Finally, there are also broader policy reasons to move in this \ndirection. For example, it is likely that future world trade agreements \nare increasingly going to limit the ability of the United States and \nother major agricultural producing countries to support our farmers in \na way that is considered to be trade, or market, ``distorting.'' In \nother words, U.S. policymakers are likely to find it more and more \ndifficult to provide government farm support in a way that is tied \neither to production or prices. Instead, we will have to find so-called \n``green box'' means of supporting farm income--payments that are not \nbased on bushels produced or current commodity prices. That's clearly \nthe direction that the European Union is taking, and we had better take \nnotice. The program we are announcing today fits neatly in the current \ngreen box definition, and should be one of the many tools available to \nsupport farm income well into the future, even if new trade agreements \nconstrain our farm policy options.\n  I am pleased that our legislation has already received the support of \na number of farm, sportsmen, and conservation organizations, including \nthe North Dakota Farmers Union, the North Dakota Farm Bureau, the \nNational Farmers Union, the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation \nPartnership, the Wildlife Management Institute, the Izaak Walton League \nof America, the International Association of Fish and Wildlife \nAgencies, the Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation, the National Rifle \nAssociation, the Mule Deer Foundation, Pheasants Forever, the American \nSportfishing Association, Pure Fishing, Trout Unlimited, Bass Anglers \nSportsmen Society, the Ruffed Grouse Society, the Wildlife Society, the \nPope and Young Club, the Federal of Flyfishers, the International \nHunter Education Association, the Boone and Crocket Club, the Sporting \nGoods Manufacturers Association, the National Shooting Sports \nFoundation, the North American Grouse Partnership, the Texas Wildlife \nAssociation, and the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices \nof the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry of the United States and \nCanada.\n\n[[Page S14273]]\n\n  In closing, let me quote from one of news articles that appeared in a \nNorth Dakota paper last year.\n  Commenting on the controversy over the proposed change in the \npheasant season opening date, the Bismark Tribune editorialized that, \n``On one extreme are landowners catering to out-of-state hunters, in \npart, because of weak and declining rural economies. For them, this is \na matter of survival. On the other hand, many sportsmen feel that the \ngrowing numbers of acres dedicated to out-of-state hunters, willing to \npay big bucks to hunt, are destroying the sport for the state's \nresidents . . . The two sides are a long, long way apart.''\n  My hope is that we can find ways to bring people together, and in the \nprocess strengthen our rural economy, encourage conservation, and \npreserve our hunting traditions for generations to come. And that's \nwhat this proposal is all about.\n  I ask unanimous consent that additional material be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                 November 6, 2003.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     Hon. Pat Roberts.\n       Dear Senators: We are writing to express our support for \n     the Voluntary Public Access and Habitat Incentive Program Act \n     of 2003, your legislation to establish state-administered, \n     voluntary, incentive-based programs to expand public access \n     to private lands.\n       In an era when more and more hunters and anglers are faced \n     with ``no trespassing'' signs and more land is being \n     converted to commercial hunting and fishing operations, this \n     legislation is critically needed to expand access to places \n     to hunt and fish.\n       This summer, Field and Stream magazine published the \n     results of its 2003 National Hunting Survey. Based on that \n     survey, Field an Stream concluded that a major reason for the \n     decline of hunting in America is the lack of available \n     habitat and access to that habitat. As representatives of \n     outdoor enthusiasts that would benefit from greater access to \n     private lands, we applaud your efforts to enact this new \n     voluntary, incentive-based program. We estimate that your \n     legislation, if fully funded, would encourage landowners to \n     open up more than 10 million new acres of private land to the \n     public each year, dramatically enhancing the experiences of \n     hunters and anglers as well as bird watchers, hikers, and \n     others who enjoy the outdoors.\n       A number of states already have established programs to \n     work cooperatively with private landowners to pay for access \n     to their lands. Kansas, South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming, \n     Montana, and Nebraska all have very successful programs that \n     open millions of acres of lands to the public each year, and \n     several other states are initiating similar programs. These \n     programs are popular with hunters and anglers as well as \n     private landowners. In fact, due to a lack of financial \n     resources, many states are unable to take advantage of the \n     offers by private landowners to enroll in their access \n     programs. By supplementing state resources that currently are \n     being dedicated to this purpose, your legislation will \n     provide additional income to ranchers and farmers, while \n     expanding opportunities to hunters and anglers.\n       We look forward to working with you to enact this \n     legislation as expeditiously as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n       Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership.\n       Wildlife Management Institute.\n       Izaak Walton League of America.\n       International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies.\n       Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation.\n       National Rifle Association.\n       Mule Deer Foundation.\n       Pheasants Forever.\n       American Sportfishing Association.\n       Pure Fishing.\n       Trout Unlimited.\n       Bass Anglers Sportsmen Society.\n       Ruffed Grouse Society.\n       The Wildlife Society.\n       Trout Unlimited.\n       Pope & Young Club.\n       Federation of Flyfishers.\n       The International Hunter Education Association.\n       Boone and Crockett Club.\n       Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association.\n       National Shooting Sports Foundation.\n       North American Grouse Partnership.\n       Texas Wildlife Association.\n       United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the \n     Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry of the United States and \n     Canada.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       National Farmers Union,\n\n                                                 November 6, 2003.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Budget Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Conrad: On behalf of the 300,000 family \n     farmers and rancher members of the National Farmers Union \n     (NFU), I write in support of your legislation to establish a \n     voluntary incentive program to encourage farmers and ranchers \n     to provide public access for hunting on their property where \n     appropriate wildlife habitat is maintained.\n       We believe the ``Voluntary Public Access and Habitat \n     Incentive Program Act of 2003'' can act both as an important \n     supplement to existing state programs as well as an \n     appropriate stimulus to create new opportunities in \n     additional states. In addition, this program can help \n     alleviate the potential conflict between landowners and the \n     rapidly growing demand by hunters for increased access to \n     rural lands by expanding the availability of private land \n     where hunting is allowed.\n       Experience demonstrates that the rural impact of hunting on \n     private lands can be an important contributor to rural \n     economic development and provide a much needed boost to the \n     incomes of farmers and ranchers as well as rural businesses. \n     Your proposed legislation provides a unique opportunity to \n     enhance the potential of hunting activities in our Nation's \n     rural areas while ensuring that producer participation is \n     voluntary and that contract terms are designed to achieve a \n     high level of both local control and landowner acceptance.\n       We look forward to working with you and your colleagues to \n     achieve passage and implementation of this incentive program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            David J. Frederickson,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 1840\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Voluntary Public Access and \n     Wildlife Habitat Incentive Program Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) according to the United States Fish and Wildlife \n     Service, in 2001, 82,000,000 individuals in the United States \n     aged 16 years and older participated in wildlife-related \n     recreation, including 34,000,000 individuals who hunted, and \n     more than 66,000,000 who engaged in wildlife-related \n     recreation such as observing, feeding, or photographing \n     wildlife, in the United States;\n       (2) individuals who participated in wildlife-related \n     activities in 2001 spent an estimated $108,000,000,000, \n     including--\n       (A) more than $35,000,000,000 on fishing;\n       (B) nearly $21,000,000,000 on hunting; and\n       (C) more than $28,000,000,000 on food, lodging, and \n     transportation;\n       (3) the growing public demand for outdoor recreational \n     opportunities is increasingly constrained by the limits on \n     both public and private land resources;\n       (4) limited public access on private land has often \n     frustrated and disappointed hunters and other naturalists, \n     and undermined the relationship between land owners and the \n     general public;\n       (5) several States have established successful but modest \n     walk-in programs to encourage public access on private farm \n     and ranch land, yet the demand for such voluntary access \n     programs remains largely unfulfilled;\n       (6) traditional agricultural markets have in recent years \n     offered limited income opportunities for farm and ranch land \n     owners and operators; and\n       (7) current proposals to reform world agricultural trade \n     favor the development of new methods to support the income of \n     agricultural producers that have minimal impact on \n     agricultural production and prices.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Conrad, \nRoberts and others in introducing the Voluntary Public Access and \nWildlife Habitat Incentive Program Act of 2003. This bill offers an \nexcellent opportunity to help conserve wildlife habitat, increase the \namount of land available for outdoor recreational activities, and help \nfarmers and ranchers.\n  Hunting and other outdoor activities are very popular and are an \nimportant part of our country's heritage. Unfortunately, the shortage \nof public land in some States limits the ability of people to enjoy \nthese activities. Providing incentives to increase public access to \nprivate lands can enhance outdoor recreational opportunities and help \nrural economies.\n  In many rural areas businesses associated with wildlife recreation, \nsuch as sporting goods stores, campgrounds, and motels and hotels, are \nan important part of the economy. By increasing the lands available for \noutdoor recreation, not only will more local residents be able to enjoy \nthis activity, but we will also encourage more people to visit rural \nareas, bringing additional revenue to these rural communities. When \nhunting, bird watching or hiking on accessible lands, visitors stay in \nlocal lodging, purchase goods in stores and eat in restaurants. The \nmoney generated from these activities is good for rural economies.\n  In many States, such as Iowa, many farmers and landowners have \ntraditionally granted hunters and other outdoor recreationists \npermission to use their land when asked. This bill will help compensate \nowners and operators of farm and ranch land for their generosity and \nalso encourage more of them to provide such access to their land. And, \nof course, this bill will benefit wildlife by encouraging landowners \nand operators to maintain, increase and improve habitat for wildlife.\n  In States access programs now operating, information listing enrolled \nprivate land is often readily available to allow recreationists to \naccess the land without the need to bother the owners to ask for \npermission. Many existing programs also have the very important benefit \nof reducing the liability of landowners and operators in case of injury \nto people using their land. State programs also help ensure enforcement \nof hunting and other regulations and help landowners and operators \nposts signs and information.\n  Currently at least 13 States have public access programs that would \nbe eligible for funds from this bill. While Iowa currently does not \nhave a program, there is great interest in starting a program, and I \nbelieve this bill will enable Iowa to start one. This bill provides \nflexibility to allow States to design programs to meet the particular \nneeds and interests of landowners and recreationists in each State \nwhile at the same time ensuring that the goals of increasing wildlife \nhabitat and available lands for public recreation are met.\n  I am proud to cosponsor this bill and urge my colleagues to support \nit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/07/senate-section/article/S14274-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14274-S14275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 263--HONORING THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE DRUG \n   ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION ON THE OCCASION OF ITS 30TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, it is with great pride that I honor and \ncongratulate the Drug Enforcement Agency on its 30th Anniversary. This \nis an important milestone for the DEA and for our country. Over the \nlast thirty years the men and women of the DEA have worked in \ncommunities around the Nation to improve the quality of life for all \nAmericans.\n\n[[Page S14275]]\n\n  The Drug Enforcement Agency was established on October 4, 1973, soon \nafter John R. Bartles, Jr., was confirmed by the Senate as the DEA's \nfirst Administrator. Since then, the men and women of the DEA have \ncontinued to serve our Nation with courage and dedication in the face \nof great odds.\n  In recognition of this thirty year milestone, it is fitting that we \npay tribute to the work and sacrifices of the men and women of the DEA \nand also acknowledge the organizations many accomplishments.\n  Currently the DEA operates 173 domestic offices and 78 overseas \noffices with over 8,800 employees. The DEA continues to lead task \nforces throughout our Nation's communities in a cooperative effort to \ncontrol both the consumption and flow of illegal drugs.\n  Between 1986 and 2002, DEA agents seized over 10,000 kilograms of \nheroin, 900,000 kilograms of cocaine, 4,600,000 kilograms of marijuana, \n113,000,000 dosage units of hallucinogens, and 1,500,000,000 dosage \nunites of methamphetamine, and made over 443,000 arrests of drug \ntraffickers.\n  Let me also express my deepest thanks to the DEA for their work and \ncommitment to protecting the communities of Iowa. Although Interstates \n80 and 35 cross Iowa providing a ready smuggling route for many drug \ntrafficking organizations, their work has had a tremendous effect on \nour efforts to squeeze the flow of illegal narcotics through the state. \nDuring 2002 the DEA participated in 28 highway interdictions in Iowa, \nleading to the seizure of approximately 56 kilograms of cocaine, 40.5 \npounds of methamphetamine, 2,075 pounds of marijuana, and nearly $1.9 \nmillion in cash. Additionally they assisted in the seizure of 871 \nclandestine laboratories.\n  Throughout its history, the DEA has proven steadfast in their \ncommitment to bringing drug traffickers to justice. Their service to \nour country has indeed made a tremendous difference in our nation's \ncommunities. However, these accomplishments did not come without a \nprice. Many men and women of the DEA have given their lives and many \nothers wounded and injured in the defense of our Nation.\n  I am pleased to submit a resolution honoring the men and women of the \nDEA on their 30th anniversary for their efforts to defend the American \npeople from illegal drugs. I encourage my colleagues to join with me in \ncongratulating and honoring the men and women of the DEA for their many \naccomplishments and sacrifices throughout their first thirty years. I \nhave every confidence that these men and women will continue in that \nsame tradition of excellence. To those in the DEA both past and \npresent, I offer my sincerest gratitude for your courage, dedication, \nand service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/07/senate-section/article/S14275-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14275-S14278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 79--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \nTHE PRESIDENT SHOULD SECURE THE SOVEREIGN RIGHT OF THE UNITED STATES OF \n AMERICA AND THE STATES TO PROSECUTE AND PUNISH, ACCORDING TO THE LAWS \n OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE SEVERAL STATES, CRIMES COMMITTED IN THE \n UNITED STATES BY INDIVIDUAL WHO SUBSEQUENTLY FLEE TO MEXICO TO ESCAPE \n                              PROSECUTION\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Nelson of Florida, \nMrs. Hutchison, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Campbell, and \nMr. Hatch) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, I rise to submit S. Con. Res. 795, a \nSenate concurrent resolution calling upon the President to address \nMexico's failure to fulfill its obligations under the U.S.-Mexico \nExtradition Treaty, which entered into force in January 1980. I am \ndelighted that Senators Brownback, Bill Nelson, Hutchison, Bingaman, \nDomenici, Kyl, and Campbell join me in submitting this resolution.\n  Specifically, this resolution calls upon President Bush to \nrenegotiate the Extradition Treaty or take other actions to ensure that \nthe U.S. can extradite serious criminals back to the U.S. for \nappropriate prosecution and punishment.\n  In my view, this treaty--at least as interpreted by Mexico--is simply \nnot working as intended. While the U.S. is currently attempting to \nextradite hundreds of fugitives from Mexico, since 1996, Mexico has \nsent back only a relative handful every year. For example, in fiscal \nyears 1996 through 2002, Mexico only extradited an average of 14 \nindividuals to the U.S. each year. Even worse, Mexico's recent \ninterpretation of this treaty has effectively eliminated our ability to \nextradite persons charged with serious crimes who flee to Mexico to \navoid prosecution in the United States.\n  This interpretation has jeopardized the safety of both American and \nMexican citizens, undermined the integrity of our criminal justice \nsystem, denied basic rights and closure to crime victims, and allowed \nserious felons to escape just punishment. The result is that Mexico is \nbecoming a safe haven for hard-core criminals. If you steal a car in \nthe U.S., Mexico will return you to face prosecution and punishment. If \nyou kill the driver, Mexico will protect you.\n  The problem in a nutshell is that, since October 2001, Mexico has \nread the U.S.-Mexico Extradition Treaty as barring the extradition to \nthe United States of anyone who faces a potential life term. In other \nwords, if a person commits a serious crime in the U.S.--one that could \nsubject them to a maximum life term--and heads south, Mexico will \nrefuse to extradite that person to the U.S. to face prosecution and \npunishment in this country.\n  While it has been difficult to determine the full scope of the \nproblem, I am informed by prosecutors in California that, as a result \nof Mexico's interpretation of the Extradition Treaty, there are as many \nas 350 people who have committed murder and other serious crimes in \nCalifornia who have either not been extradited or have been effectively \nrendered non-extraditable.\n\n[[Page S14276]]\n\n  These 350 people have thus escaped appropriate prosecution and \npunishment under California law. Many of these people are living free \nand unpunished in Mexico. In some cases, we even know where they are.\n  Let me quote from a recent Santa Barbara News Press article: A half \ndozen people wanted in the slayings of Santa Barbara residents are \nbelieved to be living free in Mexico. Santa Barbara police detectives \neven know where three of them live. But there's not much they can do \nabout it. ``If I had unfettered access to the proper investigative \ntools and contacts, we could have them in custody in a matter of \ndays,'' said Detective Tim Roberts . . . ``But that's not the case.''\n  Let me give you an example of another especially heinous case.\n  On April 29, 2002, Armando Garcia, a Mexican national who had been \npreviously charged in the U.S. with two counts of attempted murder, \nallegedly shot and killed, execution-style, 33-year-old Los Angeles \nCounty Deputy Sheriff David March during a routine traffic stop in \nIrwindale, CA. Garcia then fled to Mexico, where he remains a free man.\n  Los Angeles District Attorney Steve Cooley has not formally requested \nGarcia's extradition because he says that there is no point. Mexico \nwill demand that Cooley promise that Garcia will not receive life in \nprison for his crime--a promise that cannot be made because in this \ncountry sentences are up to a judge to set, once a person has been \nconvicted of a crime. The results is that Garcia remains at large in \nMexico.\n  And earlier this year there was a horrific case in Santa Cruz \nimplicating the Extradition Treaty. Miguel Ramirez Loza, 27 years old, \nallegedly attacked his 17-year-old girlfriend in an abandoned preschool \nbuilding, slashing her throat and then spitting on her. As his \ngirlfriend lay dying, he then raped the victim's 17-year-old friend. \nLoza's girlfriend was in a coma for months after the crime and just \nrecently died.\n\n  Loza is now in Mexico and is apparently in a Mexican jail as a result \nof a stabbing in Mexico unrelated to the Santa Cruz incident. However, \naccording to Santa Cruz District Attorney Bob Lee, Loza cannot be \nextradited for the murder and rape in California because of Mexico's \ninterpretation of the Extradition Treaty.\n  It is true that Mexico does sometimes prosecute individuals in Mexico \nwho committed crimes in the U.S. under Article IV of its Criminal Code. \nBut often Mexico fails to do this. And, in any event, there is no \nsubstitute for extraditing the person to the United States.\n  There are credible reports that defendants in Mexico sometimes buy \ntheir acquittals. And, at least by U.S. standards, Mexican standards of \njustice can be quite low. Trials often take place with no testimony and \nno witnesses. Victims and their families are not invited or consulted. \nAnd sentences--often reduced on appeal--frequently bear little \nresemblance to those authorized by U.S. sentencing laws.\n  Not surprisingly, according to an article in the Las Vegas Review-\nJournal, ``More than a dozen prosecutors in Nevada, California and \nArizona who were interviewed for this story criticized Article IV as an \nineffectual alternative to extradition.'' One prosecutor, Jan Maurizi \nof the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office, stated that she ``sent \ndemands to the Mexican government asking what happened to 97 Article IV \ncases that have seemingly disappeared from the justice system. Mexico . \n. . never responded. But from others we've talked to in unofficial \nchannels, it's clear the vast majority of them are grossly inadequate \nsentences. Most of them, nothing happens.''\n  Another prosecutor, Val Jimenez, the special agent supervisor of the \nForeign Prosecution Unit at the California Attorney General's Office, \nhas mentioned one recent case where a defendant ``got 20 years for \ndoing a homicide, appealed, and he was out in 18 months.'' And even if \ndefendants were convicted, they may not serve real time. It was not \nuntil last year that Mexico finally tore down the infamous La Mesa \nState Penitentiary in Tijuana. La Mesa was a place where prisoners were \nfree to purchase $25,000 townhomes with cell phones, tiled bathrooms, \nJacuzzis, microwaves, computers, DVD players, and guard dogs such as \nRottweilers. One murder in the prison was committed with a Uzi.\n  The U.S.-Mexico Extradition Treaty provides that neither country is \nbound to deliver up its nationals for extradition. It further provides \nthat where the offense for which extradition is sought is punishable by \ndeath, a country may refuse to extradite unless the country seeking \nextradition assures that it will not impose the death penalty. Under \nthe Treaty, the death penalty is the sole punishment for which \nassurances may be required. For decades, Mexico has extradited suspects \nto California and other states without inordinate problems. Then, in \nOctober 2001, the Mexican Supreme Court ruled that life imprisonment \nviolates the Constitution of Mexico and extended this interpretation to \nthe Extradition Treaty. Specifically, the Court decided that Mexico \ncould no longer extradite a fugitive who is subject to life \nimprisonment with or without the possibility of parole, unless \nassurances are given that guarantee a determinate term of years.\n  Here is what the Mexican Supreme Court said in Opinion No. 125/2001, \nwhich is about a half-page long: [T]he punishment of life imprisonment \nis considered an unusual penalty and is prohibited by . . . article 22 \nof the [Mexican Constitution], inasmuch as it departs from the \nessential purpose of the penalty, which is the rehabilitation of the \noffender to incorporate him/her into society. It is, therefore, \nunquestionable that the requesting [i.e., extraditing] State must bind \nitself not to impose the penalty of life imprisonment, only another \nless serious punishment.\n  Article 22 of the Mexican Constitution prohibits ``[p]unishment by \nmutilation and extreme cruelty, branding, flogging, beating with \nsticks, torture of any kind, excessive fines, confiscation of property \nand any other unusual or extreme penalties. . . .''\n\n  In light of the fact that the Extradition Treaty prohibits Mexico \nfrom extraditing criminals to the U.S. unless the U.S. agrees to waive \nthe death penalty, it is interesting to note that Article 22 of the \nMexican Constitution specifically allows the death penalty for ``high \ntreason committed during a foreign war; parricide; murder that is \ntreacherous, premeditated, or committed for profit; arson; abduction; \nhighway robbery; piracy; and grave military offenses.''\n  So, in other words, according to the Mexican Supreme Court, the \nMexican Constitution allows the death penalty for highway robbery in \nMexico but, should an American criminal murder a police officer in \nCalifornia and then flee to Mexico, Mexico will refuse to turn this \nperson over to the U.S. if he would face either the death penalty or a \npossible life term.\n  In my view, this makes no sense. However, Mexico as a sovereign \nnation is free to interpret its domestic law as it sees fit. I do not \nquarrel with their interpretation of their own law. But I do question \nwhether Mexico can unilaterally rewrite the U.S.-Mexican Extradition \nTreaty. And that is exactly the effect of its interpretation of the \nTreaty as barring extradition to the U.S. of any alleged criminal who \nfaces a possible life term. In fact, Mexico's interpretation of the \nTreaty is unsupported by and inconsistent with the Treaty's language, \npurpose, structure, and history. It is also conflicts with the Vienna \nConvention on the Law of Treaties, which states that a treaty shall be \ninterpreted ``in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to \nthe terms of the treaty in their context and in light of its object and \npurpose.''\n  As the U.S. State Department has made clear in a Protest Note to the \nMexican Government after the October 2001 decision, [R]equiring \nassurances for a punishment other than the death penalty is unsupported \nby the Treaty, which provides the substantive extradition requirement. \n. . . To give [the Treaty] the reading Mexico has given it eviscerates \nthe Treaty, for such a reading would disregard the substantive \nexceptions found in Articles 5 through 9, and would permit each Party \nto refuse each other's extradition requests based on its domestic law \non sentencing, which could be changed unilaterally at any time, even if \nthat change rendered the law inconsistent with the Treaty.\n\n[[Page S14277]]\n\n  Moreover, Mexico's interpretation of the Treaty has made it \neffectively impossible to extradite from Mexico individuals who commit \nmurder or other serious crimes in California and many other States. In \nCalifornia, for example, over 40 different crimes are punishable by \npossible life sentences and neither a judge nor a prosecutor can give \nassurances of a determinate term for these crimes. As a result, \nMexico's policy encourages people committing serious crimes in \nCalifornia to flee to Mexico and escape just punishment. Indeed, \nindividuals in the United States with a criminal history have a \nperverse incentive to kill an arresting police officer and head for \nMexico rather than face possible prosecution and imprisonment in the \nUnited States.\n  Given Mexico's interpretation of the Treaty, the only way to \nextradite a Mexican national charged with a ``life'' crime is to seek \nextradition on reduced charges punishable by a determinate sentence. \nBut this would mean treating more harshly those who commit a crime and \nremain in California than those who commit the same crime and flee to \nMexico. This is not only unfair and a blow to the integrity of our \ncriminal justice system. But it also just encourages criminals to flee \nto Mexico to reduce their potential punishment.\n  Moreover, it is unclear exactly what assurances will suffice. In at \nleast one Federal major narcotics trafficking case, a Mexican court \ndetermined that a twenty-year sentence was ``cruel and unusual'' and \nthus unconstitutional. And some Mexican courts have ruled that only a \njudge can give sufficient assurances--a legal impossibility under \nCalifornia's judicial system.\n  Mexico's interpretation of the U.S.-Mexico Extradition Treaty has \nunquestionably had a particularly harmful effect on my home state of \nCalifornia. I would like to commend the Los Angeles District Attorney \nSteve Cooley and Deputy District Attorney Jan Maurizi for their work in \nidentifying cases of individuals who have committed murder and other \nserious crimes in California who have either not been extradited or \nhave been effectively rendered non-extraditable. As I noted before, \nthere are at least 350 such cases just in my home state. Many district \nattorneys do not keep adequate records of which suspects fled to \nMexico, which cases are potentially extraditable, and which cases have \nbeen or could be subject to Article IV prosecution.\n\n  In fact, when we asked the National Association of District Attorneys \nto conduct a survey of how many cases have been affected by Mexico's \ninterpretation of the Treaty, it received responses from only 17 \njurisdictions, and much of this information was anecdotal. This survey, \nthough, does demonstrate that the problem caused by Mexico's \ninterpretation of the Extradition Treaty also afflict a number of other \nstates. Based on the information we received, there are at least 60 \ncases around the country outside of California--and this number \nprobably grossly understates the problem. These cases are in Arizona, \nFlorida, Hawaii, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, and \nWashington. These numbers, though, do not tell whole story. In every \ncase, there is a horrible crime, a victim, a shattered family, and a \nhorrible injustice.\n  I have already discussed a couple of specific criminal cases \nimplicating the U.S.-Mexico Extradition Treaty. But now I would like to \ntalk about four more. In every case, the perpetrator of a heinous crime \nhas escaped appropriate punishment because of Mexico's interpretation \nof the U.S.-Mexico Extradition Treaty.\n  In August of 1999, Daniel Perez, a Mexican national, was convicted in \nabsentia in Los Angeles County by a jury for the crimes of attempted \nfirst degree murder, use of a firearm, espousal battery, kidnapping, \nfalse imprisonment and stalking his estranged wife.\n  Perez and the 21-year-old victim, Anabella Vera, were separated. They \nmet at a pizza place. After kidnapping her at gunpoint and terrorizing \nher for two hours, Anabella finally convinced Perez that she would \nreturn home with him. Perez then drove Anabella to her car. After \nAnabella tried to drive away from him, Perez chased her in his car, \nramming her vehicle and forcing her to run red lights. Ultimately, \nAnabella became stuck in traffic and, in a desperate bid to save her \nlife, abandoned her car and tried to flee. Perez then caught Anabella \nat a gas station and shot her in the head. Miraculously, she survived.\n  During the trial and while out on bail, Perez drove to Fontana, CA to \nthe home of Anabella's father, who had been a key witness against \nPerez. In front of Anabella's siblings, Perez shot and killed \nAnabella's father. Perez then allegedly fled to Mexico, where he is \nstill at large.\n  Perez was sentenced in absentia in Los Angeles County for attempted \nmurder to a term of 33 years to life, plus an additional life term. In \naddition, the San Bernardino County District Attorney's Office has \ncharged Perez with the murder of the victim's father and the special \ncircumstances of killing a witness. These charges carry a potential \npunishment of life in prison without the possibility of parole or, if \nit is not waived, the death penalty. Because Mexico does not recognize \nconvictions in absentia, my understanding is that Mexico will neither \nextradite Perez for attempted murder nor prosecute him under Article IV \nof the Mexican Federal Penal Code.\n  Alvara Luna Jara has been charged with the special circumstances \nmurder of 12-year-old Steven Morales and the attempted murder of three \nothers. On August 29, 1998, Steven was playing with several other \nchildren in front of their apartment, near three members of a local \nsheet gang. As Jara drove by, he and the three gang members exchanged \nhand gestures. Jara then extended his arm out of the car window and \nfired three rounds into the crowd, killing Steven with a gunshot to the \nhead. Jara then fled to Mexico. If convicted in the United States, Jara \ncould face life without possibility of parole or, if it is not waived, \nthe death penalty. However, while Jara is not a Mexican national, the \nMexican government has refused to deport him because his parents are \nMexican nationals. After this refusal, Los Angeles District Attorney \nCooley began formal extradition proceedings. However, because of \nMexico's interpretation of the October 2000 Mexican Supreme Court \ndecision, Cooley never submitted the formal request.\n  On May 7, 1988, Father Nicholas Aguilar Rivera, a Catholic priest, \nwas charged with 19 counts of child molestation. The day after he was \ncharged, Father Rivera fled to Mexico. Although the case was supposed \nto be prosecuted promptly under Article IV, Mexican prosecutors failed \nto submit the case for prosecution until 1995. The Mexican court \ndismissed the matter as untimely and entered an acquittal. Now, both \ncountries are barred from further prosecution.\n  On May 17, 1998, Ruben Hernandez Martinez and Luis Castanon allegedly \nbroke into the Nashville apartment of Kelly Quinn and her roommate \nafter waiting for Ms. Quinn to return home. They then attacked her, \nraping her continuously for hours. When they were done, they made Ms. \nQuinn shower to remove any DNA evidence. However, Ms. Quinn was able to \nconceal semen that was on her neck. Castanon was arrested and, on the \nbasis of fingerprint and serology evidence, convicted of aggravated \nsexual assault. He was sentenced to 60 years. Martinez, whom Nashville \npolice believe committed several other rapes as well, fled to Mexico. I \nam informed that, while Martinez has been in custody in a Mexico City \njail for over a year, Mexico has still refused to make a decision as to \nwhether they will extradite him.\n  The United States can and must retain discretion to prosecute and \npunish its most dangerous and violent offenders who commit crimes in \nthe United States according to U.S. laws. Criminals should not be \nallowed to escape justice in the U.S. for the price of a bus ticket to \nMexico.\n  I would now like read a letter I received from a youngster in \nCalifornia about this problem. Here is what he says:\n\n       My mom is a deputy sheriff for Los Angeles. Every night she \n     goes to work. I say a prayer for her she will come home \n     safely. So far she has. Deputy March was not so lucky. I \n     wonder how his kids must feel not having a dad any longer. \n     Could you please help catch the man that killed Deputy March. \n     I listen to the radio a lot and they said the bad man that \n     did this is in Mexico and he is not in jail. Could you please \n     get him back here so my mom will be safer when she goes to \n     work.\n\n[[Page S14278]]\n\n       Thank you.\n\n  It is unfortunate that we live in a country where we cannot assure a \nyoungster that the man who killed his mom's colleague won't come back \nand hurt her too. That is why we need to pass this resolution now. That \nis why we need the President to act.\n  I ask my colleagues for their support.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that an October 24, 2003 Resolution of \nthe International Association of Chiefs of Police be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the resolution was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  [Resolution From the International Association of Chiefs of Police, \n                         Adopted Oct. 24, 2003]\n\n                    Extradition of Criminal Suspects\n\n                 (Submitted by the Executive Committee)\n\n       Whereas, the law enforcement profession has a compelling \n     interest in ensuring that individuals suspected of committing \n     crimes are not able to evade justice by leaving the country \n     in which the crime was committed; and\n       Whereas, in response to this problem, many nations have \n     established extradition treaties that allow for the return of \n     criminal fugitives to the country in which they are suspected \n     of committing crimes; and\n       Whereas, extradition treaties are political agreements \n     between nations; and,\n       Whereas, the International Association of Chiefs of Police \n     refrains from entering into political disputes between \n     nations unless an issue which clearly impacts the law \n     enforcement profession is involved; and\n       Whereas, these treaties form the backbone of international \n     law enforcement efforts and have allowed for the successful \n     apprehension and conviction of many fugitives over the years, \n     and\n       Whereas, the effectiveness of these treaties relies upon \n     the timely return of criminal suspects; and\n       Whereas, the terms of some extradition treaties have proven \n     to be too restrictive and have significantly limited the \n     ability of law enforcement agencies to bring a criminal \n     suspect to trial and have, in effect, allowed for the \n     creation of safe havens for criminal fugitives; and\n       Whereas, for example, the Extradition Treaty between the \n     United States of America and the United Mexican States allows \n     the United Mexican States to refuse to extradite criminal \n     suspects who face capital punishment for crimes committed \n     within the United States, and a recent decision of the \n     Mexican Supreme Court has unilaterally and mandatorily \n     extended that prohibition on life sentences, and\n       Whereas, it is clear that extradition treaties and \n     agreements that do not allow for the timely return of \n     criminal suspects or that condition their return on the \n     domestic sentencing laws of the requested state are an issue \n     that clearly impacts the law enforcement profession and it is \n     appropriate for the International Association of Chiefs of \n     Police to express the concern of the law enforcement \n     community in this matter and work to resolve this situation; \n     Now, therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the International Association of Chief of \n     Police calls on all nations to ensure that extradition \n     treaties serve only to guarantee that accused individuals are \n     provided with due process of law and not to provide criminal \n     suspects with a means of evading justice; and be it\n       Further resolved, That the International Association of \n     Chiefs of Police calls on the governments of the United \n     States of America and the United Mexican States to \n     renegotiate the extradition treaty so that the possibility of \n     capital punishment or life imprisonment shall not interfere \n     with the timely and unconditional extradition of criminal \n     suspects.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/07/senate-section/article/S14278-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2141.

Mr. President, I support the Animal Drug User Fee Act, \nand I urge my colleagues to support it. The bill is based on the \ncurrent user fee programs for prescription drugs and medical devices, \nwhich are an effective way to enable the Food and Drug Administration \nto reduce its backlog and expedite its review of needed new products \nand make them available more quickly, especially in this time of \naccelerated discoveries of new drugs and other medical products with \ngreat potential to improve all aspects of health care. The same basic \nprinciple of user fees should be available to assist FDA's review of \napplications for approval of animal drugs.\n  In 5 years, the time it takes for FDA to review new animal drugs \nshould be cut in half under this legislation. By increasing the \nresources available for these reviews, the user fees will speed new \ntreatments to market for pets and farm animals alike. FDA will provide \ndetailed reports on the program and its results in helping the agency \nto meet it performance goals, so that Congress can evaluate how it has \nworked and whether improvements are necessary when we reauthorize the \nprogram in the future.\n  We will also be able to work closely with the agency in implementing \nits important new plan for evaluating the increasingly urgent concern \nthat the use or overuse of certain drugs in animals can lead to \ndangerous drug-resistant strains of organism in humans.\n  I commend Chairman Gregg, Senator Ensign, and Senator Harkin for \ntheir leadership on this legislation, and I look forward to working \nwith them on these issues in the months ahead.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate concur in the \nHouse amendment, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and \nany statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, although we did not have any rollcall votes \ntoday, I do want to assure my colleagues we made progress on the \nInternet tax moratorium bill. I understand there are serious \nnegotiations that are continuing and that we hope we can get an \nagreement on that legislation and finish it at the earliest time.\n  Earlier this week, we passed H.R. 3289, the Iraq-Afghanistan \nappropriations conference report, and that measure has now been signed \ninto law by the President of the United States.\n  We also adopted the Agriculture appropriations bill, as well as the \nInterior appropriations conference report this week. The Interior \nappropriations bill will now be sent to the President for his \nsignature.\n  Chairman Shelby, working with many Members on both sides of the \naisle, finished work on the fair credit reporting bill. The bill had \noverwhelming support, and it is expected that a conference report will \nreturn in short order.\n  This week the Senate also passed H.R. 3365, the military tax fairness \nbill. This bill, which is also called the Fallen Patriots Tax Relief \nAct, will assist members of our Armed Forces in providing some much \nneeded clarity and fairness with respect to tax policy.\n  We also reauthorized, this week, the School Lunch and Child Nutrition \nProgram. Chairman Cochran brought this bill to our attention, and we \nwere able to act quickly. I mention it today to show that we continue \nto try to do our work efficiently and to make progress on a number of \nimportant issues. This bill cleared both sides and will become law. \nSenator Collins, as chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, \ncleared S. 589, the Homeland Security Federal Workforce Act. This bill \nwill promote job retention in areas of national security by providing \nstudent loan payments.\n  These are just a few of the areas, and I think very good examples, \nwhere we can continue to work together in a collaborative way.\n  The remaining weeks of business will be difficult. There will be many \ncontentious issues to address as we go forward. The American people \nclearly want us to get our work done. They expect us to get our work \ndone.\n  As I mentioned earlier, we are aiming for this target date of \nNovember 21.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/07/senate-section/article/S14282-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR MONDAY, NOVEMBER 10, 2003\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

But for our cooperation and hard work, we would not have \naccomplished as much as we have. Earlier in this week we did some very \ngood things and we produced a lot of work.\n  We cannot undue what has been done--feelings hurt, feelings of \nconcern--as to why we are in the present position, but it has happened. \nWe cannot undue that, I guess.\n  But I say to the distinguished majority leader, it is too bad we are \nin this position because I really could see the light at the end of \nthat tunnel. It is very blurred today.\n  I hope we can finish our work. There is so much we all have to do in \nour respective States. But I just want to tell the leader that the long \nlist of work that we did was a joint accomplishment. I know the leader \nacknowledges that. I just hope, somehow, next week, with the 30 hours \nthat have been placed in our path, we could still work our way through \nall this and be more productive than I see the time ahead of us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the request is agreed to.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, before we close I need just a couple \nminutes in case we can do one more brief piece of business, and then we \nwill close very shortly.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
