Then beginning as early as noon--\nis it on Wednesday?--we will not anticipate any session. Then at 7 \no'clock Wednesday night, it is my understanding the memorial service \nhere in the Capitol be will held for Members only.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, we can talk about earlier than 3 o'clock, \nbut right now it is until 3 o'clock tomorrow. At 3 o'clock, we will \nrecess.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Is it the majority leader's intention to be in session \non Thursday?\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, we will not be in session on Thursday or \nFriday.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, then we have the official memorial \nservice in the National Cathedral at 11:30 on Friday morning. Is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. FRIST. That is correct. That is by invitation. Of course, our \ncolleagues and spouses are invited.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Senators should be aware they have all day today and up \nuntil 3 o'clock tentatively tomorrow to come to the floor to make \npresentations. Obviously, Senators are welcome to speak about any \nissue.\n  My hope is we would want to accommodate Senators who wish to speak in \nmemory of President Reagan and perhaps defer other remarks unrelated to \nthese tributes to next week. Obviously, as I say, it is every Senator's \nprerogative to make that decision.\n  I appreciate the majority leader's clarification on the schedule.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/08/senate-section/article/S6596-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

PRENTICE MEADOR\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, it is my pleasure to introduce our \nguest chaplain, Dr. Prentice Meador, from Dallas, TX, the minister at \nPrestoncrest Church of Christ. Dr. Meador hails from Nashville, TN. Our \nmajority leader and Dr. Meador have known each other for a long time.\n  He is a graduate of David Lipscomb College and holds a Ph.D from the \nUniversity of Illinois. He and his wife Barbara, a registered nurse, \nhave three married children and 10 grandchildren.\n  Dr. Meador served at the South National Church of Christ in \nSpringfield, MO for 14 years before moving to Dallas in 1988. There he \nstarted serving as a pulpit minister for the Prestoncrest Church of \nChrist.\n  Not only did our distinguished leader come over to say hello to our \nchaplain this morning, but also Senator Bond from Missouri, who when he \nwas Governor worked with Dr. Meador on a summit for children. Dr. \nMeador has been very active in that regard as well.\n  So we came in today, and not only was he there with me as his \nhometown Senator but also the Senator from Tennessee and the Senator \nfrom Missouri came to greet him, which I think shows what a great \nimpact he has wherever he goes.\n  Dr. Meador has in fact adopted a wonderful philosophy of the modern \nchurch. He offers grace to imperfect people. He doesn't want to save \nthe world and lose our own families. He offers God to people entangled \nin the web of today's culture.\n  That take on the urban church has attracted large audiences of young \nadults. In fact, the average age in his church in Dallas is 28. Dr. \nMeador has done an excellent job of cultivating their interest by \nemphasizing relationship building, mentoring, and accountability \ngroups.\n\n  He is a member of the board of trustees of a great university, \nAbilene Christian University in Abilene, TX, and he is on the \nchancellor's council of another great university, Pepperdine University \nin California. Dr. Meador is listed in ``Who's Who in Religion'' as \nwell as ``Who's Who in the Southwest.'' He has spoken throughout the \nworld and has given frequent lectures throughout the United States.\n  He is an accomplished author who has written several books, and has \nbeen the managing editor of 21st Century Christian magazine starting in \n1992. He is a regular television contributor, including as a weekly \npanelist on the American Religion Town Hall, which is a national \nprogram.\n  Dr. Meador has received numerous awards for his leadership and \ncitizenship. It is an honor to have him with us today.\n  I was so pleased to be able to be with him this morning. We had a \ngood visit at our prayer breakfast about what we do in the Senate. I \nthank Dr. Meador for sharing his blessing on us at a very important \ntime in our country.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Thank you, Madam President.\n  I rise today, as many Americans, to pay my respect and thanks, and \nalso to celebrate the life of Ronald Reagan, an extraordinary man who \nhas had such a huge impact on our generation and the generations to \ncome in the world--especially Americans' place in the world.\n  I have a lot of fond and personal memories about Governor and \nPresident Reagan. First, I had the opportunity to meet him with my wife \nKathy when he and Nancy Reagan came to New Hampshire to campaign in \n1976. He was running against a sitting Republican President, Gerald \nFord, appointed, of course, coming out of the Watergate era. Some in \nour party thought maybe it was time to move on, put a new face on our \nparty, and put someone forward who had a certain charisma and attitude \nwhich was a little different. Certainly Reagan met that test.\n  As we traveled around New Hampshire, he was not the national figure \nhe is today, although he was a significant figure. In fact, he was a \nmovie star. People were flocking to meet him and see him. They wanted \nto hear what he had to say. But as we traveled around, a fairly small \ncontingent in a bus and a few cars, we had a chance to get to know him \na little bit. What came through most apparently to myself and Kathy was \nhe was a genuine person who had a real sense of self and who had a way \nof making people feel at ease around him. He had a charisma, to say the \nleast.\n  Then I had the great fortune of being elected to Congress in 1980. \nPrior to that, ironically I had been at the famous national debate in \nJanuary of 1980 where President Reagan actually set the course for \ngetting the nomination and moving on to become the\n\n[[Page S6597]]\n\nPresident with the famous comment, ``I paid for this microphone, Mr. \nGreen.'' Ironically, I was at the site and in charge of the site in \nadvance of the nomination. So I had a chance to see a bit of history \nthere.\n  But in 1990, along with 54 other Republicans, I was elected to the \nHouse of Representatives, and we came here with President Reagan. We \nhad a purpose. We had a definite purpose. People will recall at that \ntime coming out of the 1970s the inflation rate was 12 percent, \ninterest rates were 22 percent, and we had American citizens being held \ncaptive in Iran. The President--then-President Jimmy Carter--said we \nwere in a period of national malaise. We didn't feel that way. We felt \nAmerica was a great and wonderful Nation. Ronald Reagan epitomized that \nview of the future being bright rather than dark--the future being one \nof unlimited opportunities rather than one of a decreasing pie. So 54 \nof us arrived in the House of Representatives.\n\n  It was a unique situation because the House of Representatives was \nbeing controlled at that time--and people do not appreciate it today, \nbut it had been controlled by the Democratic Party for 26 years; \ncontinuously controlled by the same party, and it produced a lot of \nvery interesting and very aggressive and strong individuals to manage \nthe House. The strongest, of course, was ``Tip'' O'Neill, who was then \nthe Speaker. He was not going to tolerate those 54 new Republican \nMembers who arrived in the House of Representatives and were carrying \nthe water for President Reagan. We were treated with an experience in \neducation on how politics really works by ``Tip'' O'Neill, as we were \nexposed to what real power can do and how it can be managed in a \ncongressional body.\n  We continued to charge the Hill, however, for the President, because \nPresident Reagan had a clear and defined agenda. He intended to \nfundamentally shift this country. The shift was going to be toward \nstrengthening our national defense capabilities, toward reducing the \nburden of Government, toward reducing the burden of taxation, and \ntoward reestablishing our confidence as a nation. There was a lot of \nlegislation brought forward, with very difficult battles over the \nbudget, very difficult battles over issues of making our defense \ncapability stronger once again.\n  We became known as ``Reagan's robots.'' That was a derisive term used \nby some of our friends in the media and it was thrown at us. As \nReagan's economics were called Reaganomics, a derisive term put out in \nthe intellegentsia community by our friends who saw it as inappropriate \neconomics and saw it as water bearers for a President who they \nconsidered to be superficial, and in some cases a caricature, but we \ntook that as sort of a red badge of courage, those who came in that \nclass. We enjoyed the fact we were tweaking the institution of the \nHouse at the time led by Speaker O'Neill, who I happened, over the \nyears, to come to like as an individual very much. He obviously had a \nvery strong personality and led the House very aggressively in a very \npartisan way. It was a unique and special time to have a chance to \nserve under a President such as President Reagan.\n  Going to the White House with Kathy and our two oldest children, I \nremember a lot of fond personal memories of how kind he was. Our \ndaughters were then quite young. I think they were 4 and 5 or maybe 5 \nand 6. He took them aside and got hotdogs for them; he got popcorn for \nthem.\n  He was just a wonderful, inclusive individual and had a naturalness \nabout him that was extraordinary and made everybody who was around him, \nwhen they had the chance, feel good. It was that personality that I \nthink caused him to be able to be President during a time when there \nwas a fair amount of strident partisanship. At the same time, there was \nless of a personal vindictiveness in the atmosphere, which was nice at \nthat time, to have at least that sort of atmosphere where people were \nnot into the personal assassination level that we sometimes see occur \nin politics, although it did happen to some degree.\n  The fond memories are there from an individual standpoint, but the \nreal memory, the real force of President Reagan goes beyond the \npersonal contact. It goes to what his mission was, what he accomplished \nfor our Nation, which was so extraordinary, and what he accomplished \nfor the world. It has been discussed. There is nothing unique about the \ndiscussion because it is so broadly accepted now what he did \naccomplish.\n\n  That was, essentially, this: He took a nation which was, as I said by \nits own definition, by its then leader, Jimmy Carter, in a period of \nnational malaise and he turned us and reawakened our natural optimism. \nWe are a nation of optimists. We are a nation that believes we can \naccomplish whatever we seek to pursue, whatever goal we set. He made us \nbelieve in that again. His ``city on the hill'' belief in our Nation \nwas deep in him, but, more importantly, he was able to project it \nacross our country and give people a sense of self and a sense of \npurpose that was optimistic and upbeat, that was essential to our \ncountry at that time.\n  Probably equally important to the world, he set America back on a \ncourse of leading us in what was then the true great confrontation of \nthe 20th century, which was the question of whether Communist, \nSocialist economics, and a totalitarian state would dominate or whether \ndemocracy and market-oriented economies would dominate.\n  There were three major trends of the 20th century that were tested. \nThe first, of course, was the issue of the philosophy of Communist \nversus market-oriented economies. The second, of course, was \ntotalitarianism, first presented in fascism and secondly presented in \nthe Communist states of Stalin, by Stalin and Mao versus democracy. The \nthird was the issue of relativism. On those first two issues, he led \nthe world and delivered the results which said unequivocally that \ndemocracy and market-oriented economies were the future for mankind and \nthat individual rights meant something.\n  In accomplishing that, he passed on to our generation and all the \ngenerations to come a gift of freedom and a gift of possibility in the \narea of economic well-being that was not necessarily a given. It would \nnot necessarily have occurred without him. It is possible the Soviet \nUnion and certainly the mutations of the Soviet Union could have \nproceeded for a considerable amount of time. We could still be dealing \nwith that issue today had he not been willing to stand up, because he \nhad unequivocal confidence in our Nation and in the values that drive \nour Nation, had he not been willing to stand up and say essentially \nthat we were going to compete in that race at a level that would \nessentially make it impossible for the Soviet Union and Communist-style \nregimes to compete with us. That is what he did.\n  He did it first in the military where he essentially said to the \nSoviet Union, we are just simply going to outbuild you and we are going \nto exceed your ability to compete, so they crumbled from within. \nSecond, he did it by establishing, once again, that the basic values of \ndemocracy far exceeded any values that were being put forward, and \nclearly our much better lifestyle than anything being put forward by a \nSoviet Communist state.\n  So we owe him a great debt of thanks and we certainly owe his family \na great debt of thanks. We thank Nancy Reagan for her wonderful service \nto this Nation. We thank his family for the gift of this great man to \nour country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the unanimous consent, the Senator from \nMaine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Our Nation mourns the passage of a man who called \nAmericans to their economic purpose and renewed our age-old faith in \nthe limitless possibilities of freedom.\n  With heavy but immensely grateful hearts, our country grieves the \npassing of President Ronald Reagan and extends our collective thoughts \nand prayers to his extraordinary wife Nancy and the entire Reagan \nfamily.\n  Reflecting today on the hope that President Reagan inspired in \nAmerica, I am reminded of the story of Benjamin Franklin near the close \nof the Constitutional Convention. Franklin pointed to the painting \nbehind Washington's chair, a landscape of the Sun just on the horizon \nand remarked:\n\n       I have often . . . looked at that sun behind the President \n     without being able to tell whether it was rising or setting. \n     But now\n\n[[Page S6598]]\n\n     . . . I have the happiness to know it is a rising and not a \n     setting sun.\n\n  Let the record forever show that in a time of great consequence, \nPresident Reagan assured an uncertain nation that ours remains always a \nrising Sun. He brought a passionate belief in American ideas to bear in \nadvancing freedom as a force for good in the world and heralded a new \ndawn of confidence at home.\n  Like so many Americans, I remember well the steep challenges facing \nthe Nation in 1980. At that time, having already served 2 years in the \nHouse of Representatives, we could look back to the late 1970s as an \nincubator of change.\n  Before President Reagan, we had become conditioned to accept \nlimitations on what we might aspire to as individuals and as a nation. \nBut out of those days of national disillusionment and political drift \ncame a bold leader to inspire confidence.\n  As I said, I had just completed my freshman term as a Member of \nCongress, and this was a period of self-doubt for America. \nInternationally, our country was mired in the cold war and reeling from \nthe Iranian hostage crisis. On the domestic front, our economy had been \nsapped by double-digit inflation, double-digit prime interest rates, \nand stifled by massive tax burdens, including a top tax rate of 70 \npercent. We also had been undercut by a serious energy crisis at that \npoint in time. In fact, we had gasoline lines here in Washington and \nall through the country at that point. So suffice it to say, these were \nnot bright days in Washington or America. As I said at the time, \nwhoever won the White House would bear the responsibility for making \nAmerica productive once again, and President Reagan did. With his \nconviction that the greatest untapped potential lie in the American \npeople themselves--by embracing hope, not resignation, and by \nprojecting an optimism in our Nation and her people that was as genuine \nas the man himself--he charted a course for America for greater \nprosperity and security.\n  As President, as we know, he confronted the world's only other \nsuperpower, laying the foundation for victory in the cold war. He \ncampaigned to reduce the size of the Federal bureaucracy, to return tax \ndollars to the families that had earned them, and to devolve out of \nWashington and back to local governments--all ideas whose time had \ncome, just as President Reagan's had. Not only that, but he \nreinvigorated America with his unabashed faith in her essential \ngoodness.\n  The other night, I had the opportunity to recount the Reagan era with \nmy husband, Jock McKernan, who also served 4 years in Congress. He \nserved the other congressional district in the State of Maine. He was \nthere for 4 years as well under the Reagan Presidency. We were \nrecalling a time in which we visited the White House, regarding the \nshaping of defense policy. As Senator Gregg was recounting, we were \nbuilding up our national defense.\n  We recalled the statement the President made at the time, which I \nthink summed up his belief in trying to make a distinction between the \nUnited States of America and the Soviet Union. He said: You know, it \ntells something about a country when more people want to leave the \ncountry than want to come in. His simple logic was indeed compelling.\n  President Reagan was a conservative Republican from California, and \nI, of course, was a moderate Republican from New England. Obviously, \nthere were times--and many times, in fact--when we might differ on \npolicy. Yet I can also recall meeting with him and other members of the \nRepublican caucus, as well as Democrats. We had numerous meetings at \nthe White House either in the Cabinet room or within the Oval Office \nitself. We were able to negotiate our differences, whether it was \nwithin our party or across party lines. The issues ranged from defense \npolicy, to the MX missile, to Central America, to the budget. We had \nnumerous budget discussions where we negotiated the actual budget \nresolutions and the budget numbers themselves.\n  And I spearheaded an effort to meet with the President to talk about \nwomen's issues, to close the gender gap which at that time was \naffecting the Republican party. In fact, it led to ultimately passing \nthe landmark child support enforcement legislation, that heretofore had \nnot been part of the Federal lexicon, much less part of Federal policy.\n\n  And to this day I have on my wall a letter of appreciation from \nPresident Reagan for my efforts to help develop and pass the 1986 \nOmnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act, which he signed and \nwhich contained a provision I authored to create an accountability \nreview board within the State Department to investigate all incidents \ninvolving serious security failures.\n  With regard to trade policies, we had a number of meetings. In fact, \nmy husband and I met in the Oval Office with the President to discuss \nthe impact of international trade policies, particularly as they \naffected Maine's industries, whether it was the potato industry, shoe \nindustry, or the lumber industry.\n  He was always respectful of divergent views and willing to keep his \nOval Office door open, even as he always knew what he believed. In \nterms of his principles, his compass was steady. At the same time, he \nwas certainly committed to the fine and, in Washington, rare art of \nlistening. He was also willing to seek consensus, even though we surely \nhad a partisan environment at that time.\n  We had a divided Government, with the Democrats controlling the House \nand the Republicans controlling the Senate, and obviously a Republican \nPresidency. But again, he was willing to forge consensus because he \nbelieved that was the only way you could get things done. Rather than \nby controversy and division, in the final analysis you had to do it by \npersuasion and openness. So he was willing to develop pragmatic \napproaches in the final analysis because he was a problem solver. \nActually, he gave life to what he once said: ``If I can get 70 or 80 \npercent of what it is I'm trying to get . . . I'll take that and then \ncontinue to try to get the rest in the future.''\n  He certainly did live by that axiom throughout his tenure of 8 years, \nirrespective of the differences. Ultimately, he wanted to achieve the \ngreat things he set out to do when he became President and also to make \nsure he could be resolute in implementing his vision for this country.\n  He was entirely comfortable with stepping outside of others' \nconventional perception of himself and his politics. He was also \nextremely credible as Commander in Chief, as leader of this country \nwhen he set about to build up our military and to defy the Soviet Union \nand to ultimately bring down the Wall. The fact is, he also, on the \nother side of the coin, ultimately negotiated the first pact to reduce \nthe United States and Soviet nuclear arsenals--he negotiated that with \nMikhail Gorbachev--because, again, he understood what needed to be \naccomplished in the end.\n  His legacy will forever be his vision that brought about the end of \nthe cold war because, again, he saw the difference between \ndictatorships and democracy and our ability to foster liberty in the \ndark corners of the world.\n  Some thought his bold descriptions and his plans to bridge the wide \nchasms that separated democracy from despotism were ill-considered. Yet \nhe viewed the world through that crystal clear prism of, in the words \nof Shakespeare, ``simple truth miscalled simplicity.'' I believe that \nsays it all because I think President Reagan understood that in order \nto be an effective leader, to be a strong President, to be the leader \nof this country who was a force for good and to project that force for \ngood, you ultimately had to move the process, and you had to work \nwithin the system and with the other branch of Government to make that \nhappen.\n\n  Another great of the 20th century refused praise for having lent his \nlion-hearted strength to an entire nation. Instead, Winston Churchill \nremarked, it was his nation that had the ``lion's heart'' all along, \nand it fell to him only to ``give the roar.''\n  So it was with President Ronald Reagan. His words summoned our \nresolve and our goodness, and his steady hand guided America to a \ntriumph for all free people. As providence would have it, President \nReagan gave America's roar during what would become--in no small part, \nthanks to him--the last decade of the cold war. With peace through \nstrength, Ronald Reagan called America to a purpose he described in his \nown hand in 1980 when he wrote:\n\n\n[[Page S6599]]\n\n\n       I believe it is our pre-ordained destiny to show all \n     mankind that they too can be free without having to leave \n     their native shore.\n\n  For this legacy, the American people and free people everywhere are \nin his debt, just as he is in our hearts and his family, as well, in \nour prayers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nCalifornia is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay my respects to one of \nCalifornia's own, President Ronald Reagan.\n  I first met President Reagan right after I was elected to Congress in \n1982. We were a large Democratic freshman class, and when I was invited \nto the White House, I wondered how President Reagan would greet us. \nAfter all, he had campaigned hard for a Republican Congress, and having \nlost an election myself I knew the feeling of disappointment. When we \narrived at the White House, President Reagan could not have been more \ngracious to us; the same for Mrs. Reagan. I still have the photo from \nthat evening hanging in my home office.\n  Twenty-two years ago, Ronald Reagan taught me that you can disagree \nwithout being disagreeable, that you could set aside those \ndisagreements even though they were deep.\n  President Reagan once said:\n\n       A lot of trouble in the world would disappear if we were \n     talking to each other instead of about each other.\n\n  He believed if we were all respectful and pleasant to one another, we \ncould find those areas of common ground. We can reach across the aisle. \nWe can get things done. Believe me, that was a good lesson for me and \nfor all of us that evening because clearly, in the Senate, with the \nrules of the Senate, the only way to get things done is by working \ntogether. I look at the occupant of the Chair, and I know that with our \ndisagreements on many issues, we have come together on a few occasions, \nand we have won for our constituents and for this country.\n  When I look back to President Reagan's record, I realize that not \nonly did he bring this kind of an attitude of working together to \nWashington, but that had been his hallmark in California as well. As a \nRepublican Governor, he was working with a Democratic State \nlegislature. So it seems President Reagan had to learn how to do this \nboth in the State and in the Nation's Capital.\n  In those years as Governor, in keeping with the values and wishes of \nmost Californians, he helped to establish the Redwood National Park. He \nregulated auto emissions to reduce pollution. He signed a bill that \nliberalized a woman's right to choose. He opposed the State proposition \nthat discriminated against teachers based on sexual orientation. You \ncan see Governor Reagan was willing to reach across and find consensus.\n  Ronald Reagan, of course, did continue to reach across the aisle when \nhe became President. Although there were serious disagreements, he \nworked closely with a Democratic House to ratify and sign important \narms control agreements, increasing funds for math and science \neducation, reauthorizing the Superfund hazardous waste cleanup program, \nwhich is so important. The basis of the program is the polluter should \npay. Interestingly, we don't seem to have that kind of support today.\n  President Reagan once said: ``There is no limit to what a man can do \nor where he can go, if he doesn't mind who gets the credit.'' And how \nimportant that quote is when it comes to politics. President Reagan was \na conservative. He was not an ideologue. He fulfilled a campaign \npromise to appoint the first woman to the Supreme Court. He chose \nSandra Day O'Connor as the first woman Justice of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, even though she was considered too moderate by many \nconservatives. He tried to abolish the National Endowment for the Arts \nbut, after losing that fight, he moved on. I remember that. He moved on \nwithout trying to force the issue through the backdoor. I respect that.\n  I remember the fight to keep the National Endowment for the Arts. \nMany Republicans in my State didn't agree with President Reagan. They \nmobilized with the Democrats. President Reagan said, Well, this is what \nI think. He went forward, and when he lost, that was it.\n  Of course, there are other issues of disagreement--from offshore oil \ndrilling to the role of the national Government, to the fight against \nAIDS, to policies in Central America. Those disagreements were deep, \nbut they were never taken personally by President Reagan. He and House \nSpeaker Tip O'Neill were genuinely fond of each other. They often \nshared a drink after work, and they laughed after a day of locking \nhorns. Their good nature was infectious. It raised the level of comity \nthroughout the Nation's Capital. How I long for those days. It is time \nthat in the spirit of Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill, we see more \nbipartisan spirit in our work.\n\n  In California, there are tributes to Ronald Reagan running around the \nclock. I know it is true nationally, but because he was our Governor \nand we are so proud he is part of our legacy, we are seeing and \nlistening to Ronald Reagan's stories and Ronald Reagan quotes. I found \none of these very interesting.\n  There was a question asked to President Reagan after he had completed \nhis 8 years in office. The question was: What do you most want to be \nremembered for? His answer was this: The millions of jobs that were \ncreated while he was President and America regaining respect in the \nworld. Millions of jobs created and America regaining respect in the \nworld. You think about how universal those two achievements are because \nright now that is a lot of the focus of attention--job creation and \nrespect in the world. It is interesting how prophetic those words are.\n  I personally believe that 50 years from now, if not now, President \nReagan will be remembered for his focus on freedom for the people \nbehind the Iron Curtain. He saw in Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev a \nman he could successfully challenge to step to the plate. And when \nPresident Reagan said, tear down this wall, he said it directly to Mr. \nGorbachev. He touched Mr. Gorbachev, and he touched America. He touched \npeople around the world.\n  In a moving eulogy in yesterday's New York Times Mr. Gorbachev wrote:\n\n       Reagan was a man of the right but while adhering to his \n     convictions, with which one could agree or disagree, he was \n     not dogmatic. He was looking for negotiations and for \n     cooperation.\n\n  In that, you have to understand that respect for other people and \ntheir ideas, the ability to step into their shoes is very important.\n  We name buildings and rooms and public places after leaders, and we \nhave named many public places after Ronald Reagan. But I truly believe \nthat now the greatest thing we can do in Ronald Reagan's memory is to \nfind a cure for the disease that took his life and took him away from \nhis loved ones and the world stage long before his physical life ended.\n  Alzheimer's disease is a plague that ravages millions of Americans \nand those who love them. Caused by abnormal plaques and tangled nerve \nfibers in the brain, the disease attacks the cells that control \nthought, memory, and language. The brain, if you look at it, becomes \nmore and more like a child's brain. It kills nerve cells that are vital \nto memory. If you think about it, when you lose your memory, you lose \nwho you are. And to see someone like Ronald Reagan, who held all the \npower for 8 years that anyone could ever dream to hold, and to have him \nnot be able to remember that is a tragedy.\n  Alzheimer's lowers the level of chemicals that carry messages between \nnerve cells and the brain. The progress of Alzheimer's is usually slow, \nbut it is inexorable. Beginning with mild symptoms, such as \nforgetfulness, Alzheimer's gradually robs its victims of the ability to \nthink clearly, speak clearly, understand others, or care for themselves \nin any way.\n  Ten years ago Ronald Reagan knew he was battling Alzheimer's. He knew \nhe was losing the battle. In an act of tremendous courage and in a \nhandwritten open letter, he told the American people he was suffering \nfrom the illness. He wrote:\n\n       I now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset \n     of my life.\n\n  And he movingly wrote:\n\n       I know that for America there will always be a bright dawn \n     ahead.\n\n  So even in his darkest hour, President Reagan's eternal optimism \nshone through.\n  Nancy Reagan stood by her husband throughout this long ordeal, \nprotecting\n\n[[Page S6600]]\n\nhim in his most vulnerable time. In recent years, she has become a \nleading advocate of increased funding for medical research to fight \nAlzheimer's and other diseases. She has been brave and courageous in \nher advocacy.\n  Ironically, just a few weeks ago, I wrote an open letter to her \npraising her for her strength and moving forward to use her \nconsiderable influence to push forward stem cell research.\n  To honor Ronald Reagan and relieve the suffering of millions of \nAmerican families, we must pursue every avenue of research and \ntreatment for Alzheimer's and other diseases.\n  In memory of Ronald Reagan and all of the families who have lost \nloved ones to Alzheimer's, let us seek a brighter dawn for Alzheimer's \nvictims and their families.\n  So, Mr. President, Californians are speaking across party lines for a \nman who was able to set aside ideology to make progress, to work with \nthose who might not have agreed with him on every point. I think it is \na terrific lesson to all of us in this time and in this place in our \nNation's history.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Ronald Reagan is seen by the State of \nIllinois as being his birthplace, as well it should. They feel very \nstrongly about the legacy of Ronald Reagan in Illinois. California, of \ncourse, is where Ronald Reagan became famous. They have tremendous ties \nto Ronald Reagan. The State of Nevada has lots and lots of ties to \nRonald Reagan. Not only are we a neighbor to the State of California, \nbut the history of Ronald Reagan and the State of Nevada are \nintertwined. I come to the Senate today to join a procession to praise \nRonald Reagan as a great leader and a fine man.\n  My first trip to the Oval Office was to meet with Ronald Reagan. I \nwas a young Congressman and I was called to the Oval Office to discuss \nwith the President the situation in Nicaragua, aid to the contras. I \nwas joined there by three other Members of Congress. Vice President \nBush, at the time, was there. It is the first time I had the \nopportunity to visit with, in any depth, Ronald Reagan as President of \nthe United States.\n  There was a time when I was Lieutenant Governor of Nevada, and \nGovernor O'Callaghan was unable to go to an event at Lake Tahoe. I \nrepresented the State. Governor Reagan, at the time, and I spent time \ntogether, but it was in a public setting and really not a time where \nyou got to know anyone well.\n  My first trip to the Oval Office was one that I will always remember. \nNot only was it my first trip to the Oval Office, it was my first \nexperience in sitting down and talking with Ronald Reagan, President of \nthe United States. His personality came through in that meeting. I have \noften repeated the story of my visit there.\n  A Congressman asked Ronald Reagan at the time: Mr. President, I'm \nafraid you are going to invade Nicaragua. President Reagan did not wait \na second. He came back so quickly, with that smile on his face, and \nsaid: I'm not going to invade Nicaragua, but I want those SOBs going to \nbed every night thinking I'm going to.\n  That was Ronald Reagan. His views of the world were views that all of \nus could understand. He made it very clear to us that he was not going \nto invade Nicaragua but he was not about to show any weakness to the \nNicaraguans. That is exactly how he said it. From where I come, that \nwas talk that I understood.\n  I have fond memories of Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan, of course, is \nsomeone we all watched on TV, ``Death Valley Days.'' But those in \nNevada remember him also, and the papers in Nevada have been full the \nlast few days about his entertainment qualities in Las Vegas.\n  He came to Las Vegas as an entertainer. He appeared on the Las Vegas \nstrip as an entertainer. We were discussing what he did. I don't know \nwhat he did, but he came all the time. He was a headliner. I don't know \nif he sang or danced. I don't know what he did. He made money and they \nkept bringing him back.\n  He was born in the Midwest but he was really a son of the West. He \nstood for a lot of what we now identify with Ronald Reagan. He believed \nin freedom, independence, and opportunity. These are the values that \nall Americans share. We probably understand them a little better in the \nWest.\n\n  He handled the Soviet Union much as he handled the situation in my \nfirst meeting in the Oval Office. He was direct and to the point with \nus about how he felt about Nicaragua. In the situation with the Soviet \nUnion, he was direct and to the point.\n  The first breakthrough in peace for Israel in the Middle East came as \na result of a hawk by the name of Menachem Begin. Menachem Begin was \nthe leader of the underground against the British. He was someone who \nfought the British as no one else did. He did it in secret. But he was \nthe leader. And Menachem Begin's own family did not know that he was \nthe leader of the underground until after the British announced that he \nwas. It took Menachem Begin, somebody who was very hawkish, to make a \ndeal with Egypt. None of the other Israeli leaders could have done it \nbecause they would have been seen as capitulating to the Egyptians.\n  The same with President Reagan. No one could take away his Communist-\nfighting credentials. He had them from the time he was an actor, with \nthe Screen Actors Guild, Governor, and President.\n  I watched a TV program, and the same speech that Ronald Reagan gave \nas head of the Screen Actors Guild, he gave as Governor, he give as \nPresident. He was a certified anti-Communist. So who could better make \na deal with the Communists than Ronald Reagan?\n  No one could question his credentials, no more than they could \nquestion the credentials of Menachem Begin. Had it been Jimmy Carter or \nBill Clinton, it would not have happened. But no one could question his \nCommunist-fighting credentials, and, therefore, people accepted the \ndeal we made with the Soviet Union, which was good for the world and \ngood for our country.\n  Ronald Reagan has been a good neighbor to the State of Nevada. The \nState of Nevada shares a national treasure. It is called Lake Tahoe. \nThere is only one other lake like it in the whole world, and that is in \nRussia, Lake Baikal. I acknowledge that Lake Tahoe is smaller than Lake \nBaikal, but so is every other lake in the world. But it is an alpine \nglacial lake that is a wonder of beauty. Ronald Reagan identified that \nsomething needed to be done about this beautiful lake.\n  I spoke yesterday to Paul Laxalt. Paul Laxalt and I have been \npolitical adversaries all of my adult life and a lot of his life. But I \ndo not have a better friend than Paul Laxalt. We are friends. We call \neach other all the time. We have done that for many years. Even though \nwe have been political adversaries, we are friends.\n  Anyway, I called Paul Laxalt yesterday and said: Talk to me about \nyour relationship with Ronald Reagan. Everyone in Nevada knows and most \neveryone knows in Washington--my distinguished friend from New Mexico \nis in the Chamber who served with Senator Laxalt in the Senate--Ronald \nReagan's No. 1 guy in the Senate was Paul Laxalt, period. I do not say \nthat saying, oh, somebody may question that. That is a fact of life. \nRonald Reagan said it. That is the way it was.\n  Paul Laxalt said Ronald Reagan should be remembered for two things by \nNevadans. No. 1 is the bi-State compact to which the two Republican \nGovernors, Laxalt and Reagan, agreed. They sent it to the California \nand Nevada State legislatures, and it was ratified eventually by both \nlegislatures. They recognized that something had to be done to preserve \nLake Tahoe.\n  No. 2 is what he did to stop the MX missile from coming to the State \nof Nevada. The MX missile--most people don't know what that means--but \nit was a missile, the MX, with 10 warheads on each missile. It was to \ncover hundreds and hundreds of square miles through Nevada and parts of \nUtah. That would have been a blight to the environment there, but it \nwas also deemed to be wasteful moneywise. So Ronald Reagan personally \nintervened, and that never came to be.\n\n[[Page S6601]]\n\n  That is what Paul Laxalt wanted the people of Nevada to remember \nabout his best friend, Ronald Reagan--what he did for the State of \nNevada. Of course, there were many other things.\n  Paul told a story that they were campaigning together. Paul Laxalt \ngave every one of his nominating speeches, the time he did not win and \nthe two times he won. Paul Laxalt gave his nominating speeches. He said \nRonald Reagan was such a forgiving man that he never held a grudge. \nThey were campaigning in some northeastern State, and somebody had \ngiven a speech--somebody Ronald Reagan had helped a lot--and he gave a \nspeech blasting Ronald Reagan's economic program. He was a Republican, \nand everybody around Reagan was mad at him. So he was getting ready to \ngive this speech, and he says to Paul: I can't remember, why am I mad \nat this guy? It was because he did not hold grudges. It was not in his \nnature.\n\n  So it is wonderful we had someone like Paul Laxalt who had such close \ncontact with the President of the United States. But not only did he \nhave contact with Paul Laxalt, President Reagan did many other things \nfor the people in Nevada.\n  Sig Rogich was a special assistant to the President. Because of \nRonald Reagan, Sig Rogich developed a great personal friendship with \nthe first President Bush. They are friends. People wonder why President \nBush always comes back to Nevada. It is to see his friend Sig Rogich. \nHe, of course, made Sig Rogich an Ambassador to Iceland, where Sig \nRogich was born.\n  Sig Rogich is an extremely successful businessman. But people should \nalso understand Sig Rogich was head of the Tuesday Team that developed \nthat great campaign slogan for President Reagan: ``It's morning in \nAmerica.''\n  Rogich wrote and directed most of those pieces. He was heavily \ninvolved in the life of President Reagan. He came and moved back here. \nBut, as a result, not only do we have Rogich back here, but Frank \nFahrenkopf became chairman of the National Republican Committee. I \ntalked to Frank Fahrenkopf today. He said Reagan did this in typical \nfashion. He had been offered the job in 1980. He had a great law \npractice in Nevada and did not want to come to Washington.\n  Jim Baker called him and said: The President wants you to give a \nreport about what happened in the 1982 elections--where the Democrats \ndid very well; the Republicans did very poorly. He was asked to come \nback and give a report.\n  Frank said: Well, I have to fly all night because I'm going with 10 \nState chairs. We are going to China.\n  And Baker said: I think it would be a good idea if you came. The \nPresident wants you to come back here.\n  So he got back here. And Senator Laxalt said to Frank Fahrenkopf: \nWould you reconsider being the national chairman of the Republican \nParty?\n  And Frank said: Well, Paul, I have the same problem. I have this law \npractice.\n  He said: Well, think about it. He said he knew he was in trouble when \nhe went to breakfast at the White House and they seated him right \nacross from the President, and the President said: Dick Richards is \nretiring as chairman of the National Republican Party. He said: We have \nhere Frank Fahrenkopf who has said he is going to think about it.\n  So he knew right then he was going to be the national chairman \nbecause the President asked him to do it. So Frank Fahrenkopf became \nthe national chairman of the Republican Party.\n  But my favorite Ronald Reagan memento--I have always been opposed to \nterm limits. I have opposed term limits for the House and Senate. I \nhave always spoken forcefully against that. I think it is wrong. It is \nwrong that we have the 22nd amendment to limit the Presidents to two \nterms.\n  Ronald Reagan agreed with me. He did not like term limits. He thought \nthe 22nd amendment was bad. I offered a resolution to do away with the \n22nd amendment. I spoke out against term limits. President Reagan, \nafter he had retired as President of the United States, wrote me a \nhandwritten note. Here is what he said: ``Dear Harry, I'm glad . . \n.''--it is in Ronald Reagan's handwriting, and I have that in my \nscrapbook. I love my scrapbook and have this in it. I had announced \nthat I supported repeal of the 22nd amendment. Here is what he wrote:\n\n       I'm glad you are moving on repeal of the 22nd Amendment. \n     I've made a number of speeches to national business groups. . \n     . . In every speech I've announced my support for repeal and \n     have received an ovation from every audience. I charge that \n     the 22nd is a violation of the people's right to vote for \n     whomever they want.\n\n  Signed: ``Ronald Reagan.''\n  Here is the guy. He believed in States rights. He believed in people \nbeing able to make their determination, not some arbitrary law that we \npassed saying: You can't serve in the Senate because you have been \nthere two terms. He believed the people have the right to choose their \nrepresentatives.\n  I have a number of pictures with Ronald Reagan. I liked him as a \nperson. I did not agree with everything he did politically, as we all \nknow, but I liked him as a person.\n  So I stand here today honored that I had a chance to work with \nPresident Ronald Reagan, someone with whom I knew and felt comfortable. \nHe surrounded himself with good people. They were not mean-spirited. \nThey were good people. They were pragmatists. I liked the people with \nwhom he surrounded himself.\n  He is going to be remembered in history, of course, as one of our \ngreat Presidents. This is a time to mourn his death, but it is more \nimportant to appreciate his life.\n  I can remember a person with whom I practiced law when Ronald Reagan \nwas President. He said: He has no chance of winning. He is an actor. \nLook how old he is.\n  Well, people liked him for who he was, not how old he was or what he \nhad done before he was elected Governor of the State of California. His \namazing journey was the American dream come true. He helped bring the \ndream a little closer to all of us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I was privileged to become chairman of \nthe Senate Budget Committee at the same time Ronald Reagan was sworn in \nas President. I never thought I was going to have that job, but with \nhis victory, we took over the Senate. I recall Senator Howard Baker \ncalled me at home, and his greeting was ``Mr. Chairman.'' I kind of \nwondered what he was talking about, and then he told me. That was quite \nstartling because I knew I was going to be chairman when Ronald Reagan \nwould be asking that we carry out his program.\n  From January of 1981 until President Reagan left office in January of \n1989, it was my privilege to work closely with him and his senior \nadvisers, as with any President before or since. I suspect I saw \nPresident Reagan exhibit all his legendary traits: the man of \nprinciple, the man of strength, the man of strong convictions, the man \nof humor, and, in one famous case, a man with an Irish temper on \noccasion.\n  Even before he was sworn in, Mr. Reagan asked Cap Weinberger to head \nup his transition team for the Reagan budget and fiscal policy. I \nworked closely with Cap and then Dave Stockman, whom I knew when he was \na Member of the House. He was announced to be the incoming OMB \nDirector.\n  I was impressed by the three principles that Ronald Reagan insisted \non in my budget that I would prepare: Restraint of domestic spending, \nlong overdue increases in defense spending, and tax cuts to stimulate \nthe economy. The economy was a dormant economy. Those three principles \nguided every decision that I had with the President and his senior \nstaff. He was not going to compromise on these three principles.\n  I saw his strength on many occasions, most notably, of course, after \nthe assassination attempt. But I also saw his strength when he insisted \nthat the air traffic controllers either go to work or lose their jobs. \nThat signal, clear and strong, persuaded me this man was, in fact, a \nman who would risk political standing in order to stand for the good of \nthe public.\n  I saw his humor time and time again. Once when I showed up late for a \nmeeting with him, there were other Senators present. It was very \nembarrassing. He was amused. And when my good friend, Senator Howard \nBaker, became Chief of Staff to the President, he told me one of his \njobs was to try to come up with a good joke to tell the\n\n[[Page S6602]]\n\nPresident, that Reagan's humor came from the same sense of perspective \nthat produced his strength and commitment to the American people.\n  I learned firsthand that the Irish in President Reagan also included \na bit of an Irish temper. In 1993, I had the delicate task of telling \nthe President that I would not put off my budget for the upcoming \nfiscal year, and that I would not be able to supply him with the entire \nincrease in defense spending for the upcoming fiscal year. Cap \nWeinberger had made that request on behalf of the President. I would \nnot put in my budget in the upcoming year that entire defense request. \nCap Weinberger and I discussed this for weeks, and we put off this \naction over the Easter holiday and for weeks to give them a chance to \nwork on their defense budget.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee chairman, Senator John Tower, and \nI discussed it, and Senator Tower knew we couldn't get the entire \nrequest. Finally, just as the markup of the budget was to occur, at \nabout 10 minutes until 10 in the morning, the President called me on \nthe telephone in the back room of the Budget Committee's hearing.\n\n  ``Hello,'' I said to the President.\n  ``Hello, Pete,'' he said pleasantly. ``You know, I really need you to \nput off the markup of the budget until we can get an agreement on the \ndefense spending.''\n  ``Mr. President, I really appreciate and am honored by your call, but \nI have delayed this for too long and just cannot get the full number \nthat you have requested for defense.''\n  ``Well, will you postpone the markup?'' he asked with little \namiability in his voice.\n  ``No, sir; I cannot do that,'' I replied.\n  At that point, the President said goodbye. At least I think that is \nwhat he said. I was told later by someone who was present in his office \nduring the call that the President turned a little red in his face and \nthrew the phone on the floor. Yet he was absolutely wonderful to me \nafter that. He campaigned for me. He turned his budget over to me for \nimplementation. And I had a great relationship not only with him but \nwith those who served him, in particular Dave Stockman.\n  Let me note something about the first budget exercise. The President \nand his staff had some thoughts about the proper legislative approach. \nI disagreed and argued for something we now know and have learned to \nuse, and we understand it well. But it was truly historic, the use of a \nprocess called reconciliation. That was the first time we ever did it. \nNobody understood it. The President, with the guidance of Leader Howard \nBaker, went along with our recommendation. Senator Fritz Hollings \njoined me in this historic reconciliation effort. We had all the \nPresident's budget restraints in it. We had his tax cuts in that \nextraordinary document. And in the budget resolution for fiscal year \n1992, we had room for all the President's defense spending increases to \nwhich he ended up agreeing.\n  Some Members of the Senate expressed dismay and even anger over the \nuse of this process called reconciliation. Even some Republicans were \nperplexed by its complications and wondered how it would really work. I \nknow the President and his staff relied on us in the Senate and on the \ncommittee to carry out what we promised.\n  It is to President Reagan's credit that he supported us every step of \nthe way. Perhaps that was one of the things I admired most of this man. \nHe made a decision, entrusted it to those on whom he relied, and used \nall of his power to make a plan succeed.\n  I cannot tell you how complimented I felt when Howard Baker came to \nme and said: The President says if you and I think we can do this, then \nhe will back us all the way. And he did.\n  What a great President. What a great American. What a great man. It \nwas truly my privilege to work with him. I think history will record \nthat our work was of historic importance as the President moved toward \nmaking this economy stronger than ever, this Nation more secure than \never, and the world safer than ever.\n\n  In closing, let me say I honestly wish I had had occasion to know him \neven better. I didn't have the opportunity to get to know him on a \npersonal basis. Most of what I learned of him is expressed and \nexplained in the remarks I have made. But the wonderful stories I have \nheard about him are clearly believable, because what I saw of him was \nremarkable. What I saw of him in the numerous meetings was truly \nincredible.\n  Some spoke ill of him during those days. It is wonderful to note that \nmost of those have forgotten those days and are now part of this great \nchorus in our country that is praising him as one of our greatest.\n  I knew most about the economic situation because of the Budget \nCommittee, but it is easy for me to see how he succeeded in foreign \naffairs. It is clear no one could have accomplished with the Soviet \nUnion what he did, because most Presidents would not be believed, and \nmost Presidents would not be permitted to propose and make the kind of \nagreements with the Soviet Union that he did.\n  To sum it up, he made a stronger America. Our economy grew somewhere \nbetween 18 million and 20 million jobs. Think of that. We are now \ntalking about 2.2 million jobs. He took an economy that was in terrible \nshape. Does anybody remember 21-percent interest? We have grown so \naccustomed to low inflation and low interest rates in the last few \nyears that most of us don't understand inflation was so rampant and \ninterest rates so high that, in our grocery stores, those who filled \nthe shelves would also bring along a stamp and they would change the \nprice as they walked down the aisles, because the foodstuff had to go \nup day by day, week by week. Can you imagine what Americans would think \nabout that today? But we had to take it back then and we had to wait \nfor something else to work. That something else was Ronald Reagan's \npolicy, his approach to lower taxes, which stimulated this economy.\n  So it is with deep regret that I join with many others and many in \nthe Senate who will have words to say about him. Again, my best to his \nwife Nancy and his family. I understand their great grief. But they had \nhim for a very long time, and I am sure with the passage of time they \nwill begin to understand that. I hope they can and I hope they will.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nabout the passing of President Ronald Reagan, and to comment about the \ngreat legacy he has left and the occasions when I had an opportunity to \nmeet and deal personally with President Reagan.\n  While I had met him prior to the 1980 election cycle, I had an \nopportunity to work with him during that Presidential election year \nwhen he was elected President of the United States and I was first \nelected to the Senate. I recollect his presence in Philadelphia on one \nAugust day, when the timing for his presentation was to coincide with \nthe beginning of the 6 o'clock news cycle, so he would be carried live \nover the broadcast stations. I recollect standing behind the curtains \nat the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel, where he was later to be the guest of \nhonor at a fundraiser on my behalf.\n  What a sense of expectation there was by then-Governor Reagan and \nMrs. Nancy Reagan, with Mrs. Reagan expressing the question: Do you \nreally think it is possible we will be successful in this Presidential \nbid? I commented that I thought the chances were excellent. Precisely \nat 6 o'clock, the curtain was pulled back, and the President-to-be \nstepped forward and made an eloquent speech.\n  He traveled to Pittsburgh where again he was the guest of honor at a \nfundraiser. I recollect attending that event, and at one appropriate \nmoment he demonstrated his insight into the drama and to the field by \ngrabbing my hand by the wrist and lifting it high in a traditional \nvictory celebration. Watching him as a campaigner was a very \ninstructive opportunity.\n  The day after the election, when he was victorious, I, along with the \nother 15 Republican Senators who were elected on that same day, 16 of \nus were\n\n[[Page S6603]]\n\nelected, and Republicans took control of the Senate in the 1980 \nelection with a 53 Senate majority, was called by President Reagan to \ncongratulate us and to hear words of congratulations. President \nReagan's sense of cheer and sense of optimism was with him at all \ntimes. I was to learn as I got to know him better that he really liked \nto make congratulatory phone calls when there was good news in the \noffing. As President, he had the practice of calling every nominee to \nthe Federal bench to personally tell the nominee that he, the \nPresident, had nominated the individual to be a Federal judge, and, of \ncourse, that is great news, but that was the sort of moment that \nPresident Reagan relished.\n  When we were sworn in, in January of 1981, Senator Howard Baker, the \nmajority leader, designated me as spokesman for the group. He did that \nbecause I was last in seniority. Seniority at that time among \nRepublican Senators was decided on the basis of alphabetical listing, \nafter the preference was given to former Members of the House and \nformer Governors.\n  As the spokesman for the class, I had the honor of sitting next to \nthe President during our frequent luncheon meetings. At one of the \nmeetings, Senator Mack Mattingly was seated across the table. This was \nafter the President had been reelected in 1984. Senator Mattingly said \nto the President: Why is it, Mr. President, that you don't age at all?\n  President Reagan was fast with one of his famous stories. He said: \nWell, Mack, it is like the two psychiatrists who came to work the same \ntime every day. Both were immaculately dressed. When they left in the \nafternoon at the same time, one psychiatrist was totally disheveled, \nand the other continued to be immaculately dressed. After day after \nday, week after week, month after month of this happening, finally one \nday when they left, the disheveled psychiatrist said: How is it that we \ncome to the office the same time every day to see our patients, and day \nafter day, week after week, month after month, you leave immaculately \ndressed and I am disheveled? The immaculately dressed psychiatrist \nlooked at his colleague and said: Who listens? This was President \nReagan's way of saying he can take all of the tough spots of the \nPresidency and still retain his composure and still retain his vigor \nand his freshness.\n  I was very much impressed with President Reagan when he was near the \nend of his first term and he was asked a question about whether he was \ngoing to run for reelection. His answer was: The people will tell me \nwhether I should run for reelection. I have been asked the same \nquestion from time to time. I have used President Reagan's answer \nbecause I believe it is a really terrific answer.\n  The first legislation which I proposed after being elected to the \nSenate involved the armed career criminal bill. I sought a meeting with \nthe President. That was a bill, which has been enacted into law, that \nprovides for mandatory sentences of 15 years to life for career \ncriminals who have three or more major felonies on their record.\n\n  When I described it and discussed it with President Reagan, he \nreferred to a James Cagney movie in which there was a three-time loser, \nimmediately relating that to his own experience, and became a supporter \nand ultimately signed that bill into law.\n  President Reagan traveled frequently to Pennsylvania and on those \noccasions would invite Senator Heinz and I to join him. One such \noccasion was extraordinarily memorable. It was on the 200th anniversary \nof the signing of the U.S. Constitution. It was a real experience to \nride with the President in Air Force One and in a limousine and to have \na chance to talk with him and discuss with him some of the major \nissues.\n  He had made a comment that when we develop the strategic defense \ninitiative, we would share it with other nations. I asked him about \nthose plans and how he could carry that forward since the strategic \ndefense initiative was not likely to be accomplished for many years and \nit would require an act of Congress to share one of our national \nassets. The President's reply was that this was a matter of leadership, \nand that in moving toward the strategic defense initiative, we wanted \nto assure other countries we would not use it only for ourselves but \nwould make it available to others.\n  At that time, the mutual assured destruction doctrine was operative \nwith the stalemate between the United States and the Soviet Union, each \nknowing that if there were to be an aggressive act, it would be \nresponded to. So the mutual assured destruction doctrine was in effect, \nand to move to a strategic defense initiative required assurances that \nthis kind of defense would be shared.\n  President Reagan leaves a phenomenal legacy. Perhaps his greatest \nachievement was presiding over the end of the Cold War, in which the \nUnited States defeated the Soviet Union. When the United States was \nrearmed, the Soviet Union could not keep up and ultimately was \nbankrupt.\n  President Reagan led the arms control talks with Soviet President \nGorbachev. With his famous words at the Berlin Wall to tear the wall \ndown, and ultimately with the demise of the Soviet Union, all of \nEastern Europe was free, and liberty and democracy has come to so much \nof Eastern Europe and to so many people in the world because of \nPresident Reagan's leadership.\n  His optimism and sense of buoyancy were just what the United States \nneeded when he came to office in 1981. His emphasis on less Government, \nhis determination to lower taxes, and his spirit of determination to \ndefeat communism were trademarks and legacies which will last forever.\n  One final note. When President Reagan came to Independence Hall on \nthe 200th anniversary of the signing of the Constitution on September \n17, 1987, we arrived at the Hall and there was an enormous wheel with \nGeorge Washington and then sequenced, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and \nthe wheel came all the way around and Ronald Reagan was situated right \nnext to President George Washington. I asked President Reagan how it \nfelt to be on that wheel right next to President Washington. He said: \nArlen, it is a humbling experience.\n  I think the humility of President Reagan in the context of his great \nachievements is another addition to a really great legacy.\n  Mr. President, in the absence of any other Senators seeking \nrecognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we have heard many remembrances of \nPresident Reagan these last 3 days. One of my own favorite stories \nabout President Reagan appeared in the Boston Globe on St. Patrick's \nDay, 1983. It begins:\n\n       In his corner office, House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. \n     has proudly hung a photograph of President Reagan. It shows \n     the two men, their faces agitated in the heat of a argument \n     over jobs and the economy, each jabbing a finger at each \n     other.\n       Underneath, a puckish inscription from `Ron Reagan' to \n     `Tip' reads, `From one Irishman to another--Top o' the \n     morning to you.' That photograph conveys the flavor of \n     perhaps the most important political relationship in \n     Washington, for it juxtaposes the sharp partisan \n     confrontations between the two men with the personal \n     cordiality that suits the current mood of bipartisanship.\n\n  The headline on that article read: ``Reagan and O'Neill: Each One \nNeeds the Other.''\n  Ronald Reagan was many things in life: An actor, a Governor, the \nPresident.\n  For countless millions throughout the world, he was the voice and the \nimage of American confidence and optimism.\n  Even those who disagreed strongly with many of his policies admired \nhis sunny disposition, his easy grace and charm, his quick wit, and his \nunshakable conviction, as he said so often, that America's best days \nare just ahead of us.\n  He was a self-made son of small-town, middle America who loved this \nNation because of the chance it gave him--and generations of Americans \nbefore and after him--to go as far in life as their talents and \nambitions could take them.\n  Historians will still be taking the measure of Ronald Reagan and his\n\n[[Page S6604]]\n\npresidency for decades to come. But even now, it is clear that \nPresident Reagan presided over, and helped bring about, enormous \nchanges in America, and in the world.\n  His unflinching opposition to communism helped bring down the wall \nand bring about the end of the Soviet Union. For that, the world owes \nRonald Reagan a great debt of gratitude.\n  Americans, and friends of America throughout the world, are saddened \nby President Reagan's death.\n  Our hearts go out to the Reagan family, especially Mrs. Reagan and \nthe Reagan children and grandchildren, as well as to President and Mrs. \nReagan's friends. Even when someone has been slipping away for a long \ntime, as President Reagan did, the final goodbye is still \nheartbreaking. We wish them comfort in this time of great sorrow.\n  In his 1987 autobiography, ``Man of the House,'' Tip O'Neill recalled \nthe time President-elect Reagan visited him in his office in early \n1981. The Speaker told the man who was soon to be President that in the \nHouse, Democrats and Republicans ``are always friends after 6 o'clock \nand on weekends.''\n  For the next 6 years, until he retired, Tip O'Neill recalled, \nPresident Reagan always began their phone conversations by asking, \n``Tip, is it after 6 o'clock?''\n  It has been nearly 10 years since President Reagan wrote his \ncourageous letter to America telling us that he had Alzheimer's \ndisease.\n  In the decade since President Reagan began his quiet withdrawal from \npublic life, the civility and personal decency that we associate with \nhim seems, at times, to have all but disappeared from much of our \npublic discourse. The elbows in politics have become sharper, the words \nhave become meaner--and the accomplishments have become scarcer.\n  Sadly, there is a tendency today to assume ill will and bad motives \nof those who belong to the other party--or even another wing of one's \nown party.\n  This decline of civility in politics and public discourse is not good \nfor America. It does not make us safer, or stronger.\n  President Reagan spoke to all that was good and decent in America. We \nwould honor him by restoring decency to our politics.\n  Ronald Reagan was a man who believed deeply in his core principles. \nHe would not want any of us to compromise our own core principles in \nhis memory. But there is such a thing as principled compromise. \nPresident Reagan understood that. He knew that accommodation was needed \nto make the system work.\n\n  Like many conservatives, President Reagan had some basic \nphilosophical qualms about Social Security. But he appointed a \nbipartisan commission to find ways to save Social Security from \nimminent insolvency--and he backed the commission's plan. That was \nprincipled compromise at work.\n  Twenty-four years ago this week, Ronald Reagan had just clinched the \ndelegates needed to win his party's 1980 Presidential nomination. It \nwas a nomination he had worked for for 12 years.\n  A newspaper reporter asked him what he thought he needed to do next.\n  He replied that he wanted to dispel the notion that he was a hard-\nnosed radical who would oppose compromise on principle. As he put it:\n\n       You know, there are some people so imbued with their \n     ideology that if they can't get everything they want, they'll \n     jump off the cliff with the flag flying. As governor, I found \n     out that if I could get half a loaf, instead of stalking off \n     angrily, I'd take it.\n\n  Perhaps because he himself was a Democrat early in his life, \nPresident Reagan never demonized his political opponents--even when he \ndisagreed profoundly with them.\n  When Tip O'Neill turned 70, President Reagan hosted a reception for \nhim at the White House. There they were: the opposing champions of \nlaissez-faire economics and New Deal liberalism. President Reagan \ntoasted Tip O'Neill by saying:\n\n       Tip, if I had a ticket to heaven and you didn't have one \n     too, I would give mine away and go to hell with you.\n\n  President Reagan and Tip O'Neill, I am convinced, are reunited in \nheaven now.\n  As we prepare here in the Capitol to say our final goodbye to \nPresident Reagan, let us remember his capacity to see the best in \neveryone, including those whose political views differed starkly from \nhis own. Let us remember that there is no dishonor in accepting a half \na loaf.\n  In the months ahead and for as long as we are given the honor of \nserving in Congress, let us search and work for principled compromises \nthat serve the interests of the vast majority of Americans. In that \nway, we can help to preserve President Reagan's great belief and hope \nthat America's best days are, indeed, just ahead.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the life \nand the legacy of former President Ronald Reagan. President Reagan \nserved our country with honor and distinction, and I feel privileged to \nhave the opportunity to reflect on the contributions he made to our \ncountry and to the world.\n  Upon hearing the news of his death, I thought back to the footprints \nhe left on my memory. He was, indeed, one of the greatest leaders, I \nbelieve, of our time, and I was honored to know him.\n  President Reagan provided our country with an enormous amount of hope \nfollowing a period of national remorse and confusion about the \ndirection of our country and about its place in the world. Let us not \nforget the context into which he emerged to seize his place in history \nand to move the United States forward with a determination and an \noptimism about the future that was so recently lacking.\n  The ghost of Vietnam haunted our foreign policy and the specter of \nWatergate informed our politics.\n   The election of Ronald Reagan, however, truly changed America. He \ninstilled hope that every American could be optimistic about his or her \nfuture; hope that communism would not endure and that freedom and \ndemocracy could ultimately vanquish the forces that sought to pull our \ncountry, and many others, into the abyss of despair and hostility that \npermeated much of the world; hope that personal freedom without the \nencumbrances of big government would revitalize the economy; hope that \nthe rejuvenated armed forces he would lead as Commander-in-Chief could \nmake the United States once again truly the leader of the Free World in \na struggle for survival against the Soviet Union.\n   President Reagan's eternal optimism gave our country a renewed sense \nof self, a belief that the American dream was possible and that every \nindividual had the opportunity to create his or her own success. Ronald \nReagan believed that each new day was filled with high purpose and \nopportunity for accomplishment. He gave America back the hope we had \nlost for many years.\n   President Reagan's leadership and courage were central to ending the \nCold War. He was certain that freedom and democracy could prevail in \nall corners of the globe if only the one country with the capacity to \ndo so would step in and show the way.\n\n[[Page S6605]]\n\n   Many Americans who were not yet born or were too young to understand \ncould not appreciate what this man accomplished. The first half of the \n20th Century was marked by warfare on a global scale. The First World \nWar--the war to end all wars--had decimated much of Europe. A \ngeneration was lost to the trenches and newly introduced technologies \nof destruction such as the machine gun and the tank.\n   The war that followed, World War II, managed to go well beyond its \npredecessor, as the failure of European diplomacy once again dragged \nthe continent into the horrors and devastation that man continued to \nwrought. The epic struggle against the forces of fascism, a struggle we \nremembered this past weekend with the anniversary of the Normandy \nlandings, was a fight against evil in every sense of the word. Its \nending, however, set the stage for a new type of conflict--a conflict \nthat would take the second half of the century to resolve, mercifully \nwithout the nuclear war that existed as the logical culmination of the \nstand-off that came to be known as the cold war.\n   The skills, strengths and enormous fortune that kept the cold war \nfrom turning hot transcended, of course, multiple presidential \nadministrations. It was brought to its successful resolution, however, \nthrough the vision and strength of exactly one man: President Reagan. \nDecades of conflict management, in which experienced diplomats and \nelected officials sought primarily to prevent nuclear war and to \ncontain the Soviet threat, had succeeded in preventing nuclear war. \nThat was an incredible feat, to be sure.\n   What set Ronald Reagan apart, however, was his vision of a world \nwithout the nuclear stand-off that had become an indelible image in the \npublic psyche of virtually the entire world. What set Ronald Reagan \napart was his visceral belief that the United States, and the freedom \nand prosperity it represented, had to, and could, not just contain the \nthreat but eliminate it without the awful specter of nuclear war coming \nto fruition.\n   Derided by his opponents both here and abroad as a dangerous cowboy, \nPresident Reagan stood firm in his beliefs and led the country to \nvictory. He believed, correctly, and at variance with the views of many \na university professor and politician, that the United States could \nforce the Soviet Union over the cliff on which it rested, buttressed on \nthe backs of the millions it held in its tyrannical grip.\n   This was a truly great man.\n   Limited government, lower taxes, and individual responsibility will \nalso be part of President Reagan's legacy. He believed that each \nAmerican and each community were the best problem-solvers. Rather than \nmaking Government bigger to address the challenges our country faced, \nReagan stood firm in his commitment to the contributions that could be \nmade through personal empowerment and a renewed sense of political and \nsocial responsibility.\n   I was just a second-term congressman when President Reagan came into \noffice. Although a Democrat at the time, I closely identified with his \ncommitment to lower taxes, limit government and rebuild the military. I \nshared President Reagan's conservative philosophies, and he helped me, \nand millions of other Americans, have a restored faith in the purpose \nof our Government.\n   I also recall a time when President Reagan asked me to breakfast at \nthe White House. I, a second-term Congressman at the time, was \ncertainly impressed. I had always been a conservative Democrat, and he \nhad hoped that I would change parties, as he had done when the \nDemocratic Party ceased to represent the values he held dear. I \ndeclined his offer to do so at the time, explaining my strong desire to \nwork to fix the Democratic Party from within. The President knew \nbetter, telling me that the party was in the midst of a transformation \nthat would not be reversed any time soon. It took me more years to \nfully appreciate the President's wisdom. But appreciate it, I did, and \nI followed his lead in abandoning the party of my youth in deference to \nanother. While I took a little longer to change than he would have \nliked, he did provide me with much of the foundation as to why I needed \nto leave the Democratic Party. I have always appreciated his guidance, \nhumility and humor.\n   I believe history will treat Ronald Reagan well. He uplifted a \nfrustrated country through his optimism and hope. He changed a troubled \nworld with his devotion to the spread of freedom. Ronald Reagan \nembodied the American spirit, and our country and the world are forever \ngrateful for his service.\n   I offer my condolences to Mrs. Reagan and the entire family. They \nhave endured much heartache with his illness, much grief with his \npassing, and much joy with his life. My thoughts and prayers are with \nthem in this difficult time.\n   May God bless Ronald Reagan and his memory.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business. The Senator is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, my colleagues and Americans, President \nRonald Reagan will be returning to Washington tomorrow for the very \nlast time. I rise to honor the memory and life of the greatest leader \nof the 20th century and to express my sympathy to his wonderful and \nloyal family--in particular, his loving wife and partner Nancy.\n  Nancy Reagan has always been an outstanding and inspirational role \nmodel for our entire Nation. And that has never been more clearly \ndisplayed than through her wonderful courage and love during the \ndifficult journey she and President Reagan traveled during the past \ndecade.\n  Like so many, I was inspired to actually answer the call of public \nservice because of then-Governor Ronald Reagan's positive, principled \nmessage. In 1976, I began as a young lieutenant in the Reagan \nrevolution when I was asked to chair Young Virginians for Reagan. \nToday, I am still motivated to work to advance his individual-\nempowering philosophy in government.\n  Ronald Reagan entered the political stage in 1964 with a speech which \nsummed up a philosophy that would guide him through his Presidency two \ndecades hence, and which turned the tide of world history.\n  Mr. Reagan said in 1964, ``You and I have a rendezvous with destiny. \nWe can preserve for our children this, the last best hope of man on \nEarth, or we can sentence them to take the first step into a thousand \nyears of darkness. If we fail, at least let our children say of us we \njustified our brief moment here. We did all that could be done.''\n  Indeed, Ronald Wilson Reagan did have a rendezvous with destiny. \nPresident Reagan rejuvenated the spirit of America. His determined, \noptimistic leadership lit the torch of liberty and allowed it to shine \nin the dark recesses of oppressed countries around the world.\n  Ronald Reagan believed in the innate goodness of mankind. He believed \nand advocated the wisdom of our country's foundational principles. He \nbelieved that given the opportunity, all men and women would seek \nfreedom and liberty and with it unleash creativity, ingenuity, hard \nwork, and economic growth.\n  He touched deeply the hearts and minds of Americans through his \ngenuinely believed, commonsense conservative words of encouragement--\nfrom his first inaugural speech in 1981, to his inspirational State of \nthe Union Addresses, to his moving memorial tribute to our lost \nChallenger explorer, to his strong demand to tear down the wall of \noppression, to his passionate tribute to the defenders of liberty at \nNormandy 20 years ago this week. Those were the words he delivered. \nThose words which he delivered are now as much a part of the fabric of \nAmerica as the threads of our flag, Old Glory. Lee Greenwood's song, \n``God Bless the U.S.A.,'' was an anthem to Ronald Reagan's renewed \nAmerica.\n  Historians will surely discuss and debate the impact of Ronald \nReagan's 8 years as President for generations to come. But there is no \ndoubt his legacy\n\n[[Page S6606]]\n\nhas already been revealed. In fact, he foresaw his legacy. He was there \nat the bicentennial in 1981 of the Battle of Yorktown. He gave a \nwonderful speech at Yorktown, VA.\n  He said as follows, ``We have come to this field to celebrate the \ntriumph of an idea--that freedom will eventually triumph over tyranny. \nIt is and always will be a warning to those who would usurp the rights \nof others. Time will find them beaten. The beacon of freedom shines \nhere for all who will see, inspiring free men and captives alike, and \nno wall, no curtain, nor totalitarian state can shut it out.''\n  To put this in context, when Ronald Reagan became our 40th President, \nAmericans had lost their faith in our leaders and in the role of \nAmerica in the world. Government at home was restraining its citizens \nwith oppressive taxation and burdensome regulations. Our national \nmalaise led to historically high unemployment, high interest rates and \ninflation, low productivity, and a stagnant stock market.\n  Our moral authority around the world had been eroding, and confidence \nin the ideals of liberty and democracy were replaced by the fear of \nexpanding tyranny, communism, and repression.\n  America yearned for a leader who could change the direction of our \nNation and make them proud of our heritage once again. Ronald Reagan \nanswered that call.\n  Many tributes this week rightfully point to President Reagan's \nunwavering optimism and belief in the inner strength of Americans, and \nindeed all human beings. He understood that they could be motivated and \ninspired to higher ideals with our competitive nature. No more hand-\nwringing. He wanted action. Indeed, he challenged us to look no further \nthan his administration and ourselves for solutions. He said, ``If not \nus, who? If not now, when?''\n\n  Beyond his unshakable faith in mankind was his consistent adherence \nto principles which were unfashionable and often scorned when he came \nto office but today which are solidly embraced and winning the minds of \npeople across our country and throughout the world. He acted on his \nbeliefs that government interference should be restrained and that free \npeople should be unrestrained, without limits. We prospered and we \nthrived with the creation of jobs and opportunities.\n  One of my very favorite principles of President Reagan was declared \nin his 1985 State of the Union address when he said, ``Every dollar the \ngovernment does not take from us, every decision it does not make for \nus, will make our economy stronger, our lives more abundant and our \nfuture more free.''\n  And so it is. Through tax cuts that return tax dollars to those whose \nhard work and ingenuity earned them, to reducing burdensome \nregulations, President Reagan presided over the beginning of the most \nrobust peace expansion of our economy in the history of our Nation.\n  But President Reagan believed the blessings of liberty must not be \nbestowed only on a few nations and only to those blessed to be born on \nfree soil; Ronald Reagan, with the strength of his convictions, \nexported and advanced democracy to continents, countries, and people \nyearning to taste the sweet nectar of liberty.\n  He knew the evil communistic empire could not be sustained and would \ncollapse under the weight of a determined effort to challenge the \nSoviets on their failed policies, both foreign and domestic. He \nreversed decades of policy calling for containment of that oppressive \ntyrannical system, and he boldly asserted that the advancement of \nfreedom and liberty must be America's No. 1 foreign policy objective. \nIndeed, he believed that it is our solemn moral obligation to do so.\n  Now we are seeing his greatest legacy. Hundreds of millions of free \npeople, from the Baltics in Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia through Poland, \nHungary, Slovenia, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Romania, \nall people once repressed behind the Iron Curtain are now joining NATO. \nThey are true friends and allies. Yes, they are breathing that \ninvigorating wind of freedom.\n  One of the last public statements Ronald Reagan made was in 1983. He \nprovided us with a vision which will guide us now and in the future. \nRonald Reagan said, ``History comes and history goes, but principles \nendure and ensure future generations to defend liberty--not as a gift \nfrom the government, but a blessing from our Creator. Here in America \nthe lamp of individual conscience burns bright. By that I know we will \nall be guided to that dreamed of day when no one wields a sword and no \none drags a chain.''\n  It is Ronald Reagan's inspiring character, courage, unflinching \nadherence to principles, policies, and eloquence that brought forth a \nrenaissance for the United States of America, a rebirth of freedom, and \nthe world also experienced that renaissance at a crucial juncture in \nhistory. He fanned the flames of freedom and that torch of liberty will \ncontinue to burn brightly by his inspiration and example. We all thank \nGod for blessing the United States and the world with Ronald Reagan.\n  President Reagan, as you finally enter the gates of that shining city \non the hill you always talked about, rest peacefully, knowing you left \nthe world a much better place than it was when you arrived. For that, \nthe free people of your Nation are eternally grateful.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks \nSenator Kyl be recognized and then Senator Brownback.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I come to the Senate today to join others \nto remember a good friend and a great American leader.\n  In 1977, I was elected to the Senate leadership and served as \nAssistant Minority Leader until the 1980 election. I don't think anyone \nat that time could have predicted the sweeping changes that were about \nto take place. When Ronald Reagan was elected, he ushered in a new era \nof government so profound it became known as the ``Reagan Revolution.'' \nThat was an exciting time in Washington.\n  As I became assistant majority leader and began a new life--Howard \nBaker was the majority leader. The day before I was to marry my wife \nCatherine, Howard called and asked me to replace him on a trip to China \nbecause Deng Xiaoping wanted to understand what ``Reaganism'' meant. My \nwife Catherine and I were married on December 30, and we left for China \non December 31. To prepare for those talks, I reviewed all of President \nReagan's actions as Governor of California and his promises made during \nthe election. I was honored to be offered the opportunity to explain \nand defend his record.\n  When Congress convened in 1981, those of us in the Senate leadership \nwent down almost weekly for meetings at the White House. Occasionally, \nPresident Reagan came up to Howard Baker's office as Majority Leader to \nmeet with us. I don't think any other President has done that as often \nas Ronald Reagan. President Reagan always tackled very serious subjects \nin these meetings, but he kept us relaxed. He usually began our \ndiscussions in the Cabinet room with a joke or a story. His leadership \nbrought out the best of all of us.\n  During his administration we were able to accomplish a lot for the \nAmerican people and set the Nation and the world on a new course. Much \nhas been said already about the mark President Reagan left on our \nnational defense and foreign policy. Those were his greatest \ncontributions as President, and I viewed those decisions from a unique \nadvantage point.\n  I was sworn in as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Defense \nSubcommittee just days before President Reagan took the oath of office. \nHe immediately began to move toward a 600-ship Navy, new aircraft \ndevelopment, and space-based missile defense systems. President Reagan \nunderstood that the first thing we had to do was restore our military \ncapability. The Soviets were outspending us at that time and stealing \nour secrets. The President took control of that situation, and in the \nyears since President Reagan left office, either Senator Inouye or I \nhave been chairman of the Appropriations Defense Subcommittee. Each of \nus has carried forth the vision President Reagan had for our military.\n  History has overlooked President Reagan's personal commitment to arms \ncontrol, however. In 1985, the President supported the creation of the \nArms Control Observer Group in the\n\n[[Page S6607]]\n\nSenate, a group of Senators that served as official observers at any \narms control negotiations involving the United States. I co-chaired \nthat group along with Senators Lugar, Nunn, and Pell. Our goal was to \navoid the problems we faced in the 1970s when three successive arms \ncontrol treaties were unable to achieve ratification in the Senate. Our \ngroup went to Geneva 3 or 4 times a year and came back and briefed the \nPresident, Secretary Shultz, and the Senators who were involved in arms \ncontrol matters.\n  The President encouraged the Soviets to decrease the size of their \narsenals and to reduce the size of our nuclear forces. This was one of \nthe most significant parts of the Reagan agenda, the overall concern \nwith arms control.\n  The President also created a revolutionary new approach to defense \nspace research. He brought down the walls between isolated research \nprojects and advocated a more comprehensive approach. A lot of the \naspects of the missile defense system, which he called Star Wars, were \nbased upon the research he put into effect then.\n  When President Reagan passed away on Saturday, I noted that his death \ncoincided with another sad day in American history: On June 5, 36 years \nago, another great American leader, Senator and Presidential candidate \nRobert Kennedy, was struck down by an assassin's bullet in Los Angeles. \nAlthough they were from different generations and different political \nparties, Robert Kennedy and Ronald Reagan had a lot in common. Both men \nwere leaders who did more than just point the country in the right \ndirection. In the words of Bobby Kennedy, they inspired Americans to \nenvision a ``world that never was and ask `Why not?' ''\n  On June 12, 1987, President Reagan inspired all of us to envision a \nnew world when he gave his famous speech at the Brandenburg Gate. I \nwill never forget the image of President Reagan standing before that \ngate demanding that Gorbachev ``Tear down this wall!''\n  Weeks before he gave that speech, the President learned that his \nremarks would be carried in East Germany over the radio, and in one \npart of the speech he spoke directly to the people of East Germany. One \ncan only imagine the hope the people on the other side of that wall \nmust have felt when they heard the President of the United States \ndeclare in their native tongue: ``There is only one Berlin.''\n  Here at home, President Reagan built, as he called it, a ``shining \ncity upon a hill.'' He borrowed that phrase from John Winthrop, an \nearly Pilgrim who used it to describe the kind of America he \nenvisioned.\n  For Reagan, the idea of a ``shining city'' was:\n\n       A tall proud city built on rocks stronger than oceans, \n     wind-swept, God-blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds \n     living in harmony and peace, a city with free ports that \n     hummed with commerce and creativity, and if there had to be \n     city walls, the walls had doors and the doors were open to \n     anyone with the will and the heart to get there.\n\n  I will always be grateful to President Reagan for teaching us to \nbelieve in that shining city and for opening its doors so Alaska could \nfinally enjoy full citizenship.\n  Under President Ronald Reagan, the freeze on the transfer of Alaskan \nlands to our new State and to the Alaskan Native people was finally \nlifted, and we began to receive the land that rightfully belonged to us \nunder the Statehood Act that admitted Alaska into our Union. President \nReagan instructed the Department of the Interior to move quickly as \npossible on that. I do not believe it would have happened that fast had \nhe not been elected.\n  Under President Reagan, the Village Built Clinic Program began, and \nwe set out to establish Indian health service clinics in every Native \nvillage in Alaska.\n  Under President Reagan, we finally addressed the injustice of Aleut \ninternment during World War II by awarding reparations to Aleuts who \nhad been taken from their homes and sent to what were called ``duration \nvillages'' in southeastern Alaska for the duration of the war.\n  President Reagan understood Alaska's military and geopolitical \nsignificance better than any other President. The modernization of \nAlaska's military bases accelerated during his administration.\n  What most Alaskans probably remember best about President Reagan is \nhow well he understood our State and our way of life. When he came to \nFairbanks to meet Pope John Paul II, he told the crowd that every time \nhe came to Alaska he thought of the poet Robert Service and threatened \nto recite ``The Shooting of Dan McGrew.'' In fact, he did that just \nthat one night when Catherine and I were attending a dinner in Chicago. \nWe had just flown in from Fairbanks, and I told the crowd that was \npresent that the 20-degree weather in Chicago could not compete with \nthe harsh weather back home, where the temperature was 50 below. Ronald \nReagan got up to give his remarks, and he recited Robert Service's poem \n``The Shooting of Dan McGrew'' from memory.\n\n  I distinctly remember him saying this phrase from Service's poem:\n\n       When out of the night, which was fifty below, and into the \n     din and the glare, there stumbled a miner fresh from the \n     creeks, dog-dirty, and loaded for bear.\n\n  On the plane ride home, the President told my wife Catherine that his \nmother had kept a first edition of Robert Service's poetry by his \nbedside and read those poems to him as a child. Catherine later sent \nhim a first edition of Robert Service that she found in a bookstore in \nNew York, and he wrote her a nice letter back telling her he planned to \nmemorize ``The Cremation of Sam McGee'' once more.\n  I tried many times to get the President to come back to Alaska, but, \nunfortunately, he decided, as the years went by, that he wanted to go \nback to California to ride horses.\n  We understood that, and honored him for it. Alaskans took comfort in \nknowing that even if his heart belonged to California, he was raised on \nthe words of Robert Service, our favorite poet.\n  One of my fondest memories of President Reagan is, strangely enough, \na phone call I received from him as chairman of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Defense. The President called to ask me if I had placed \nfunding in the Defense bill that year to procure a new pair of Air \nForce I airplanes. I told him that I had. President Reagan told me that \nhe had not requested that funding and would veto the bill.\n  He said: ``Ted, I'm the President.''\n  I said: ``Sir, I understand that, but you won't be President by the \ntime the new planes arrive.''\n  There was silence on the other end of the line, and when he finally \nspoke, the President said: ``Ted, do you have a design for these \nplanes?''\n  I will never forget that because the first time a President flew in \nthose new planes was when one of them took the retired President and \nNancy back to California in 1989.\n  This week, President Reagan will fly back to Washington for the last \ntime. Thousands of Americans will pay tribute to him in the Capitol \nRotunda and millions more will reflect on his life. Catherine and I \nextend our deepest sympathies to Nancy and the Reagan family, as all of \nus will mourn the loss of a true American hero.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is, by unanimous consent, \nSenator Brownback will follow Senator Kyl. I ask unanimous consent that \nI be allowed to follow Senator Brownback.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, America mourns the loss of an epic-making \nleader, Ronald Wilson Reagan.\n  As the biographer Lou Cannon has said, Reagan ``possessed a special \n`something' that transcended the appeal of ordinary politicians,'' and \nhe knew it. Even so--and this is an important point--he was neither a \nvain man nor in love with power. In not misusing that special appeal \nthat he had, he showed such character and goodness. He could have been, \nbut was not, a demagog. He was trying to accomplish his exalted vision \nof this country, only that. And in large measure, he succeeded.\n  Militarily, he rebuilt America's capacity to defend itself and its \nallies. Reagan's defense buildup led to U.S. victories in the cold war, \nthe Persian Gulf war, and beyond. In fact, dealing\n\n[[Page S6608]]\n\nskillfully with a Congress controlled during most of his Presidency by \nthe other party, he secured funding for weapons systems that are still \nbeing used.\n  Diplomatically, he achieved with the Soviet Union, our adversary for \nmost of the last century, an accord that eliminated whole classes of \nnuclear weapons from the stockpiles of both countries.\n  Politically, he enabled us to regain confidence in America. His \nconfidence in his country and his goodness was utterly unshakeable, so \nhe was just the right leader to rise to the fore when the national \nspirit had been battered by our withdrawal from Vietnam, the scandal of \nWatergate, and the malaise that his predecessor identified but could \nnot seem to counteract.\n  Economically, he slew the dragon of double-digit inflation. He braved \nunpopularity to stay the course with Paul Volcker, Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve, in tightening the money supply. This steadfastness saw \nthe United States through its worst economic crisis in 50 years. The \neconomy slid deep into a recession before recovering in late 1982.\n  Along with tightening the money supply to kill inflation, Reagan was \nconvinced that marginal tax rates must be cut to stimulate growth. \nThese anti-inflation and tax policies defied the conventional wisdom of \nthat time. But they worked. They gave us what the late, great \njournalist Robert Bartley called ``the seven fat years,'' a time of \nunprecedented job creation and economic expansion in America.\n  Even as Ronald Reagan won through in domestic policy, he was a \nstatesman who left his mark on the world.\n  During his two terms in office, early 1981 to the end of 1988, he \nchampioned the cause of human rights in the Soviet Union and Central \nand Eastern Europe, standing up for freedom, democracy, and civil \nsociety. He spoke passionately of God-given rights and said self-\ngovernment and free markets were the only way to vindicate those \nrights. He wanted the people who were living under oppression to regain \ntheir dignity, and his words gave hope to millions.\n  In his 1982 Evil Empire speech before the British House of Commons, \nPresident Reagan said:\n\n       While we must be cautious about forcing the pace of change, \n     we must not hesitate to declare our ultimate objectives and \n     to take concrete actions to move toward them. We must be \n     staunch in our conviction that freedom is not the sole \n     prerogative of a lucky few but the inalienable and universal \n     right of all human beings.\n\n  The Reagan administration fostered democracy around the world in the \n1980s, in Central America, South America, Asia. The Philippines, \nTaiwan, and South Korea all liberalized their societies in ways that \nmay not have been possible without the Reagan administration's support.\n  President Reagan will go down in history for his doctrine of peace \nthrough strength. It turned this country around militarily and \ndiplomatically and turned the course of the cold war dramatically in \nour favor. It was also a negotiating strategy--just the right one, it \nturned out--for dealing with a Communist power that was ailing \neconomically but still aggressive. The Soviet Union had last invaded a \ncountry the year before he was elected, Afghanistan in 1979. The \nU.S.S.R. was engaged in the 1970s in a rapid military buildup. The \nprevailing nuclear standoff between the two superpowers when Reagan \ncame into office was frightening. They were locked in a decades-old \nequilibrium under which neither attacked the other because each could, \nat the push of a button, destroy the other's populations with nuclear \nweapons. President Reagan once commented that this nuclear standoff, \nwhich was called mutual assured destruction, was ``a sad commentary on \nthe human condition.''\n  He had the courage and the imagination to think of a way out of it: \nerecting a defense against nuclear arms. This would end the practice of \nholding civilian populations hostage to the atomic bomb. It was, he \nbelieved, both militarily and morally necessary to strike off in this \nnew direction. As he pointed the way, he endured heavy criticism and \neven ridicule, but it didn't faze him.\n  His idea was brilliant, for even if embarking on this high-tech \nshield against missiles did not lead to a deployable U.S. system right \naway, he knew the Soviets would pour their resources into matching our \nprogress toward missile defense. It was a competition they could ill \nafford. The extra burden economically and even psychologically of \nkeeping up with missile defense and the entire Reagan military buildup \nhastened the collapse of the Soviet economy and the Communist system \nitself.\n  People who didn't agree with President Reagan called him a saber \nrattler and worse. Opponents wrung their hands at this peace-through-\nstrength approach, insisting a buildup of U.S. military capabilities \ncouldn't possibly help us if the goal was a safer and more peaceful \nworld. Yet the critics were wrong. President Reagan, the saber rattler, \nsat down with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Washington in December \nof 1987 and the two men signed the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty \nwhich abolished the use of all intermediate and shorter range missiles \nby the United States and the Soviet Union.\n\n  The following year the Reagan administration created the On-Site \nInspection Agency to conduct U.S. inspections of Soviet military \nfacilities and to aid Soviet inspections at our facilities. The Reagan-\nGorbachev diplomacy set the stage for the 1990 signing between NATO and \nthe Warsaw Pact of the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty.\n  One of the well-known personal traits of Ronald Reagan was he didn't \ncare who got credit for successful policies. Goodness knows, his \ndetractors, then and even now, will deny him any credit he might \ndeserve for making the world safer. He did make the world safer, \nthough. That is the truth of it. And history will remember him that \nway.\n  We can say of Ronald Reagan what Lincoln said in praise of his, \nLincoln's, personal role model Henry Clay:\n\n       He loved his country partly because it was his own country, \n     but mostly because it was a free country.\n\n  The role model of our time is Ronald Reagan. His principles are the \nprinciples we now embrace. They will help us to keep this free country \nand to help others who want to be free.\n  As we continue in the wake of September 11 to fight the war on \nterror, we all take comfort and inspiration from the jaunty optimism \nand the seriousness of purpose of Ronald Reagan. President George W. \nBush practices Reagan's doctrine of peace through strength. He has done \nso by confronting and defeating tyranny in Afghanistan and Iraq, by \npursuing deployment of missile defenses, by leading the international \ncommunity to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction, and by \ndemonstrating to the world that the United States is willing to rally \nfree peoples in defense of our civilization and our democratic way of \nlife.\n  Thank you, Ronald Reagan, for showing the way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Ronald Reagan, \nmy political guiding light. I came to Congress on the second Reagan \nwave in the 1994 election, when Republicans took over the House of \nRepresentatives. Many of us were raised on Ronald Reagan. His was my \nfirst Presidential campaign in 1976, when I was still a student at \nKansas State University. I was riding in a tractor in Kansas when I \nheard the Evil Empire speech. I started pounding on the dashboard, \nsaying: That is right, that is right. Then all the pundits came on \nafterward and said how terrible it was. I was a bit confused but \ndecided Reagan was right and the pundits were wrong. He went on to \nprove that.\n  He was a great contributor to our time and our legacy. I only had the \npleasure of meeting Ronald Reagan once. I was a White House fellow in \nthe Bush 1 White House. We met him in southern California. People had \nalways given examples of his legendary humor. This meeting was no \nexception. We were having a meeting for a period of time, and then one \nof the people with whom I was traveling asked him a question: What one \nthing didn't you get done as President that you wish you had gotten \ndone. I think he had heard this question before and he had given this \nline before, but he tilted his head back, and you could see the glint \nin his eye and the smile comes across the face, and he said: I wished I \nhad\n\n[[Page S6609]]\n\nbrought back the cavalry. That was a line people enjoyed at the time, \nand it was the sort of humorous thing he was so known for in his \npolicies. It was part of his greatness.\n  While he was a great President, he didn't consider greatness to be \ninherent to him. In other words, he was not full of himself. He \nconsidered this country great. He considered the position of President \nto be great. But he wasn't full of the feeling of greatness for \nhimself, and he always had self-deprecating humor. That was part of \nhim.\n  Following on the previous speaker, Senator Kyl, I had a chance \nseveral years back to talk with Eduard Shevardnadze, Foreign Secretary \nunder Mikhail Gorbachev, about when Reagan and Gorbachev were \nnegotiating on missile reduction and nuclear weapons reduction. This \nwas a meeting that took place within the last 3 or 4 years with Mr. \nShevardnadze. I asked him to reflect on that time period when we were \nhaving a military defense buildup here under Ronald Reagan and what \ntook place in the Soviet Union in that time period. I wanted to get a \nmeasure from him on that.\n  He said of Reagan: Reagan saw the central weakness of the Soviet \nUnion. That was its inability to produce goods and services. They were \nspending somewhere between 60 to 80 percent of the GDP of the Soviet \nUnion on the military. Along comes Reagan and says: I am moving more \nchips on the table. You will have to match me if you want to stay in \nthis race.\n  The Soviet Union then was looking around saying, how do we stay in \nthe race when we are putting virtually every chip we have right now \ninto this military buildup for the cold war. And it was a long way from \nsecure at that point in time that the Soviet Union was going to fall \nany time soon. This was a very well-established, militarily strong \ncountry. What it forced in the Soviet Union was for them to restructure \ntheir economy and move to openness to try to get more chips on the \ntable to grow their economy.\n  They introduced the likes of glasnost and perestroika, openness and \nrestructuring of the economy. But when you looked at the totalitarian \nCommunist system, glasnost and perestroika were inherent \ninconsistencies and led to the demise of the Soviet Union, that along \nwith Ronald Reagan's words. These words are from Eduard Shevardnadze. \nMany talked about star wars and how the Soviet Union, at that time when \nReagan announced star wars--the Soviet Union's leadership sent its best \nscientists to come back and appraise it and tell the political \nleadership if the Americans could do this. The Soviet scientists came \nback after a few months of studying the American proposal--the Reagan \nproposal--for star wars and said we could not. They spent another few \nmonths looking at it and then returned to the Soviet leadership and \nsaid if the Americans are willing to stay on this path and put the \nmoney into doing it, they can do it.\n\n  It sent a shock wave through the leadership in the Soviet system that \nthe United States could get this accomplished. Clearly, the deciding \nfactor of opening that system led to the demise of the Soviet Union and \nthe end of the cold war. There was this wave of freedom for people who \nhad been in oppressed societies for their entire existence, and that \nwas Ronald Reagan. He understood the source of our national greatness \nwas not our wealth or our military power but, rather our belief in the \ndignity of the individual and in the God-given freedom of ordinary \npeople to order their lives as they wished. That was the source of his \nview of the United States being a shining city on a hill and a model to \npeople the world over, and an inspiring example of a political system \nthat put power in the hands of the people, not bureaucrats or judges. \nThat was Ronald Reagan.\n  We remember President Reagan for restoring our national confidence at \na time when our country was on the heels of the Vietnam war and the \nimpeachment of a President, uncertain about the way forward. We \nremember him for his staunch defense of innocent, unborn human life--an \nissue on which he never wavered--and for the extraordinary step he took \nin authoring a book as President, entitled ``Abortion and the \nConscience of a Nation,'' because he felt so strongly about the pro-\nlife cause. We remember his brave challenge to a new Soviet leader to \n``tear down this wall,'' because it was an affront to human dignity. We \nremember his vital role in bringing the cold war to an end--an end \nhastened by both President Reagan's military buildup and his \nrevitalization of the American economy.\n  In all of Ronald Reagan's political life was his passionate belief in \ntwo core principles: human freedom and human dignity, both inalienable \nbecause they were given by God. He believed in the unbounded \ninventiveness and ingenuity of the individual freed from the tyranny of \ngovernment but firmly rooted in our recognition of a higher moral \nauthority. He understood that, in his words, ``The city of man cannot \nsurvive without the city of God, that the visible city will perish \nwithout the invisible city.''\n  President Reagan recognized that the vitality of our society and \nculture has always been dependent on the religious faith and practice \nof the people. As he said, ``Those who created our country . . . \nunderstood that there is a divine order which transcends the human \norder. They saw the state, in fact, as a form or moral order and felt \nthat the bedrock of moral order is religion.''\n  Ronald Reagan was never reticent in speaking about his own faith and \nthe primary place it held in his life. In all of these things, \nPresident Reagan was, and continues to be, an inspiration to millions, \nand certainly to me. He transformed the world for the better, and we \nare thankful he graced this Nation with his life, his example, and his \ndivine calling.\n  Our thoughts and prayers go out to him and to his family. And for all \nof us who mourn his passing, may we continue to be inspired and \nelevated by all he was, all he achieved, and all he sought for us to \nbe.\n  God bless you, Ronald Reagan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to extend my deepest sympathy \nto the Reagan family, and to send a thank you from a grateful Nation to \nsomeone who served this country so well. And I know that the citizens I \nrepresent in North Dakota feel the same way.\n  President Reagan had a profound impact on the demise of the Soviet \nUnion and the end of the cold war. I recall in the 1980s, in the middle \nof the cold war, when the lives of two men intersected: Ronald Reagan \nand Mikhail Gorbachev. These two men were very different in many ways, \nbut they changed the course of history. Together, President Reagan and \nMikhail Gorbachev sat down together to reduce the threat of nuclear \nweapons, to reduce the stockpile of nuclear weapons in both countries.\n  The Soviet Union no longer exists. Eastern Europe and the Warsaw Pact \nno longer exist. The Communist threat and cold war that stemmed from \nthem is gone. And much of the credit, in my judgment, belongs to \nPresident Ronald Reagan.\n  We all recall the historic occasion when he stood at the wall in \nBerlin and said, ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.'' It was a \nmoment I will never forget.\n  But President Reagan was defined by more than this moment.\n  When hundreds of American troops were killed in Lebanon, it was \nRonald Reagan who went to the press room and said: I am accountable. \nYou don't see many in politics do that, but he did.\n  In 1986, I served on the House Ways and Means Committee, in which we \nprovided the most significant tax reform that had been done in many \ndecades in this country--under the leadership of a President who said \nlet's reduce tax rates for all Americans and get rid of some of the tax \nloopholes. This President led and the Congress followed. I was proud to \nbe a part of that.\n  His Presidency was not without substantial controversy and \ndifficulty. I felt his fiscal policy would produce very large budget \ndeficits, and it did. And the Iran-Contra scandal was a serious problem \nfor the administration. Yet, despite those problems and setbacks and \ncontroversies, I think President Reagan provided leadership in some \nvery important areas.\n  The charm of President Reagan was considerable. He had that cowboy \nhat kind of cocked back on his head. He had movie-star good looks. He \nhad that famous smile. He was a great storyteller with a gleam in his \neye. He told the story often about the pile of manure and the child who \ninsisted that if\n\n[[Page S6610]]\n\nthere is a pile of manure, there must be a pony somewhere. The \nPresident loved to regale people with stories.\n  I don't pretend to have known him well, but I sat behind him on the \nwest front of the Capitol in 1981, when he gave his inaugural address. \nI recall that he announced to the country that planes had just left the \ntarmac in Iran with the American hostages, now freed. It was a gray, \ncold day and the first inaugural of President Reagan. As he began to \nspeak, the clouds began to part and rays of sunshine began to come \nthrough. It was a remarkable moment.\n  And I was a freshman member of the House when, one day, I was called \nto the bank of telephones in the Democratic cloakroom. They told me it \nwas President Reagan calling.\n  The President wanted my vote for a policy he was proposing to the \nCongress. I listened to him, but in the end, I felt he was not right on \nthat particular issue, and I said I could not support him on it. He \nsaid: Well, you are a good man, and thanks for taking my call. It was \njust like him to frame it that way.\n  I had the opportunity to have breakfast with him, along with a \nhandful of my colleagues, one morning in the White House. Once again, \nhe regaled all of us with wonderful, charming stories.\n  I have always said that if you could have dinner with anyone, you \ncould not do better than Ronald Reagan or Tip O'Neill, both Irish, both \nwonderful people with a wit and a charm, and both great storytellers.\n  I believe that for President Reagan, politics was not bitter or \nrancid. In fact, he used to talk about the ``11th commandment'' for his \nparty: Thou shalt not speak ill of someone in his own political party. \nIt is a commandment that has been long forgotten, regrettably. I am \nafraid that today's politics have taken a turn for the worse.\n  President Reagan was aggressive in debate but always respectful. I \nbelieve he personified the notion that you can disagree without being \ndisagreeable.\n  He was a man of great strength. After he was shot during an \nassassination attempt--seriously wounded--he was wheeled into the \nhospital emergency room, and he was ready with a quip for the doctors.\n  He was a remarkable person. When the Challenger accident occurred and \nthis country was horrified by seeing the explosion of the Challenger \nand the death of those astronauts, it was Ronald Reagan who came on \ntelevision and talked about that ill-fated flight. But he did it in \nsuch an inspiring way, and finished with the refrain from that poem: \nThey have slipped the surly bonds of Earth and touched the face of God.\n  Later in life, as President Reagan lived in retirement in California, \nhe began a long journey into the darkness of a devastating illness \ncalled Alzheimer's. His last statement to the American people was a \npoignant statement, in which he described his illness and its \nconsequences.\n  This is a man who served his country with great distinction, someone \nwith whom I had disagreements from time to time, but someone who I \nbelieve is owed the admiration of an entire nation.\n  I am reminded of a book that David McCullough wrote about another \nPresident, John Adams. In the book, you learn that John Adams wrote to \nhis wife Abigail, as our Founding Fathers tried to put this country of \nours together--and he asked these questions: From where will the \nleadership come? Who will be the leaders? How will the leadership \nemerge to create this new country of ours? And then he would \nplaintively say to his wife: There is only us. There is me. There is \nBen Franklin. There is George Washington. There is Thomas Jefferson and \nJames Madison. There is George Mason.\n  Of course, in the rearview mirror of history, we recognize that these \nmen were some of the greatest human talent ever assembled on Earth. But \nevery generation has asked that same question for this great democracy. \nFrom where will the leadership come? Who will be the leaders? And this \ncountry has been fortunate that, in generation after generation, men \nand women of virtually all political persuasions have stepped forward \nto say: Let me serve this great country.\n  Ronald Reagan was one of those leaders. He served in California as \nGovernor and then served two terms as President of the United States. \nHe had, in my judgment, a kind of a peculiar quality, a quality that \ngave him an almost quenchless hope, boundless optimism, an \nindestructible belief that something good was going to happen, and he \ncommunicated that to a grateful nation.\n  So today we say thank you. Thank you for your service. God bless your \nmemory, and God bless your family.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, some people have the capacity to change \nyour life. For me, Ronald Reagan was one of those people. Ronald \nReagan's message of strengthening individual liberties, maintaining a \nstrong national defense, cutting through the thicket of Government \nregulations and lowering taxes inspired me to run for public office in \nthe 1980s. He made me believe it is possible to bring about change for \nthe better.\n  I first ran for the Colorado State senate in 1982, the second year of \nReagan's Presidency, and fought to pass resolutions there supporting \nthe policies that the President advocated, such as the balanced budget \namendment.\n  I was a small businessman. I operated a private veterinary practice. \nSo Ronald Reagan's vision of strengthening America's small businesses, \nbecause they are the backbone of our economy and way of life, had a \ngreat deal of appeal. His belief in small Government and cutting taxes \nto allow people to decide how best to spend their own money have been \ntwo of my guiding principles since I was first elected to public \noffice. I believe him to be the father of the modern Republican Party.\n  My wife Joan and I never had the opportunity to meet Ronald Reagan \nuntil he came to Colorado in 1988. Talking to him one on one was an \nemotional high point of my life. We smiled all the way back home to \nLoveland, CO. I have kept his picture hanging in my office, first in \nthe U.S. House of Representatives and now in the Senate, ever since.\n  It is hard to describe to the young people who live in our vibrant \neconomy and confident culture just how unsure and discouraged Americans \nwere in the late 1970s. Everything that could go wrong had. America \nseemed to be shrinking before our eyes. Those in charge of our \nGovernment had apparently given up on winning the cold war. The Soviet \nUnion loomed dangerous and, we were told, invincible. We were being \nadmonished to get used to a dysfunctional economy that combined high \ninflation with low growth, a demoralized military, an ever more \nintrusive and intruding Government, a depressed and depressing \nspiritual malaise that left many in doubt about our fundamental values. \nNo one offered a way out.\n  Ronald Reagan's fresh voice of optimism was like manna to our hungry \nspirits. He talked about how our idling economy could regain its \nformidable power. He talked about how great our country was and how \nmuch greater it could be. He talked about facing down our foes and our \nfears. He talked about restoring American pride and patriotism. He, \nmore than any other individual in the second half of the 20th century, \nbrought America back from the brink of self-imposed defeat and despair. \nHe made us proud once again.\n  Ronald Reagan was a monumentally gifted man, and a man of many gifts.\n  To those in doubt, he brought the gift of optimism.\n  To his supporters and allies, he brought the gift of confidence and \nassurance.\n  To an audience, he brought a magnificent gift of humor.\n  To his opponents, he brought the gift of disagreeing without being \ndisagreeable.\n  His gift to the world was even more significant. He brought about the \nend of a cold war that had cast a 50-year shadow of fear over all the \npeople on the planet.\n  Ronald Reagan never doubted his country's need to defend itself from \nall foes. ``Of the four wars in my lifetime,'' President Reagan said, \n``none came about because the United States was too strong.''\n  It is of paramount importance for us to remember, during this period \nof threat and conflict, the wisdom of one of his favorite phrases: \n``Peace through strength.'' Among his greatest achievements was to \nrearm us, to reinvigorate\n\n[[Page S6611]]\n\nthe American military, and to let our adversaries know, beyond any \ndoubt, that they were in a race they were not going to win.\n  In the past 15 years or so, the United States has decisively fought \nand won two significant wars. The keys to those victories were highly \nmotivated and skilled combat personnel fighting with unmatched military \nequipment and employing unprecedented tactics.\n  How did this renewed and reinvigorated American military might come \nabout?\n  Let's look back to Ronald Reagan's acceptance speech at the 1980 \nRepublican nominating convention. As only the Great Communicator could, \nhe laid out his vision for us with not only clarity, but with a \nconviction that rings true and is still good counsel today.\n  He said:\n\n       We are awed--and rightly so--by the forces of destruction \n     at loose in the world in this nuclear era. But neither can we \n     be naive or foolish. . . . We know only too well that war \n     comes not when the forces of freedom are strong, but when \n     they are weak. It is then tyrants are tempted.\n\n  He added:\n\n       Let our friends and those who may wish us ill take note: \n     the United States has an obligation to its citizens and to \n     the people of the world never to let those who would destroy \n     freedom dictate the future course of human life on this \n     planet. . . . This nation will once again be strong enough to \n     do that.\n\n  He was, of course, as good as his word. Once assuming office, \nPresident Reagan launched a military renaissance that not only led to \nthe demise of the Soviet Union, Soviet communism, and the cold war, but \nalso set the course for our military leadership that continues to this \nday ensuring our safety.\n  President Reagan's initiative was threefold: upgrade our military \nequipment; improve the training and morale of our service men and women \nto improve recruitment and retention; and restore national pride in--\nand global respect of--the United States' military.\n  A major accomplishment of President Reagan's was the development of a \ncredible, modern strategic deterrent. He reinvested in our strategic \nballistic missile weapons inventories, modernized a complement of land, \nsea, and aircraft-based platforms to project our strategic force.\n  This display of offensive force proved to be an effective deterrent, \nbut President Reagan envisioned a world with far fewer of these \ndestructive weapons, and pressed throughout his Presidency for \nsignificant reductions of nuclear weapons. In 1983, President Reagan \nlaunched the Strategic Defense Initiative in the hopes of one day \nrendering all such ballistic missiles ``impotent and obsolete.''\n  Today we are building on his legacy by deploying strategic missile \ndefenses and aggressively eliminating excessive nuclear stockpiles. \nPresident Reagan's legacy to us, of a safer world, is one we must \nconstantly guard and honor.\n  There is no doubt that President Reagan was one of the greatest \nPresidents of the modern era. A man of huge confidence and unwavering \nprinciple, he revived the American spirit, revitalized our economy and \nengineered the fall of communism. He changed the world for the better. \nWe share his family's grief, and keep them in our prayers.\n  In his memory, let us recommit ourselves to President Reagan's goal \nof ensuring that America always remains the ``bright, shining city on \nthe hill.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, on January 20, 1981, Ronald Reagan, after \nbeing sworn in as the 40th President of the United States, looked out \nover The Mall and addressed the Nation. He told us that the challenges \nof our day required:\n\n       Our best effort, and our willingness to believe in \n     ourselves and to believe in our capacity to perform great \n     deeds; to believe that together, with God's help, we can and \n     will resolve the problems which now confront us. And, after \n     all, why shouldn't we believe that? We are Americans.\n\n  I remember the celebrations that evening as if they happened \nyesterday. It was a bitterly cold evening. As our Nation celebrated a \nnew beginning, it was as if the cold January winds swept away a \nnation's doubts and fears and replaced them with a renewed American \nspirit.\n  Ronald Reagan was a unique American leader who understood the \ngreatness and the goodness of America. He knew who he was and what he \nbelieved. Over the last century, no American President was as well \ngrounded as Ronald Reagan. He had faith and confidence in the people of \nAmerica, and that trust was reciprocated.\n  As much as anyone who came before or after him, Ronald Reagan \npossessed an innate understanding of the significance of the American \nPresidency. Ronald and Nancy Reagan set the gold-standard for grace, \ndignity and class in the White House. Reagan understood the weight and \nconsequences of his office beyond the borders of the United States. The \nworld looked to him as a standard bearer of freedom. Reagan also \nunderstood the importance of the Presidency to young people. The \nresponsibility of being a role model to a nation's youth rested easily \non his shoulders.\n  Ronald Reagan is known as the great communicator. While he certainly \nwas one of the best communicators ever to hold the Presidency, he was \nfar more than just a talented communicator. Reagan was a thinker and a \nwriter. He was constantly writing beautiful letters and his speeches in \nlong-hand. Today, these speeches and letters are national treasures. \nReagan thought deeply about the great issues of his time without \ngetting dragged down into the underbrush of detail and trivia. He was \nnot a superfluous man. Our Nation was guided by his clarity of purpose, \nunderstanding of the purpose of power and the limitations of \ngovernment.\n  Since President Reagan left the American political stage, we have \nmissed his imagination and creativity. Since his days of sitting in a \nradio studio doing play-by-play broadcasts for baseball games from news \nwire service copy, he had a genuineness that served him well. He was a \nmasterful story-teller. In today's age of processed politics and \npoliticians, President Reagan's candor and humor are sorely lacking.\n  Ronald Reagan was a child of humble beginnings who never forgot the \nlittle guy. He believed every American had something special to \ncontribute. Reagan let people know that each thread of the American \nfabric mattered. In late September of 1980, I was working as an adviser \non the Reagan-Bush campaign.\n  One evening, I was part of a group invited to an estate near \nMiddleburg, VA, where then-Governor and Nancy Reagan were staying. They \nwanted to thank us for the work we had done for the campaign with a \nwonderful dinner. As the evening was ending, an aide to Governor Reagan \nasked me to remain after the dinner because Governor Reagan wanted to \nspeak with me. I was taken into the house where Governor Reagan was \nstaying. He sat down next to me and told me he wanted to talk about \nVietnam. He wanted to know about my experience and what I thought about \nthe war. That was the kind of man he was. He wanted to understand \nthings. He wanted to know things and he wanted to make the world better \nthan it was.\n  Though his individual accomplishments are great, Ronald Reagan will \nbe remembered for something far greater than the sum of his individual \naccomplishments; he will be remembered for renewing the American \nspirit. He was a true American original. We will never see one like him \nagain.\n  Over the last decade as we struggled to meet the challenges of our \ntime, Ronald Reagan slipped away from us. He now belongs to the warmth \nof eternity and the pages of history. However, he has not left us to \nmeet our challenges alone. The lessons of his leadership and the \nstrength of his spirit that swept across our country on a cold day in \nJanuary 24 years ago, guide us still today.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S6612]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man who \nmeant a great deal to me and a great deal to my State and to our \ncountry. That, of course, is President Ronald Reagan. It is with \nsadness that he has recently passed away. But I have great confidence \nhe has passed away and moved on to a better home. I express my \ncondolences and sympathies to his family and also thank them for their \ngenerosity in sharing Ronald Reagan with us in the public life, both as \nGovernor of the great State of California, and also as President of the \nUnited States for eight wonderful years.\n  I had the privilege, in the same year as Ronald Reagan was elected \nPresident, to be elected to the Senate. I have many fond memories of \nRonald Reagan. I remember very well during his Inaugural Address when \nthe rumors were coming out, and then later confirmed, that the American \ncitizens who were held hostage in Iran for 444 days were released. I \nremember the euphoria that came across the stage. I remember the \neuphoria that came across America. It was such an exciting, positive \nchange. Americans really felt great. This was suppressing our country, \nthe very fact that we had American citizens held hostage for over a \nyear, in many cases being beaten or tortured or abused, with American \nflags burning in Tehran continually. It was such a great day when they \nwere released.\n  I happen to think it was because, in many respects, the leadership of \nIran decided they did not want to worry about this new President, \nRonald Reagan, and what actions he might take. I think they made a very \ngood decision. I was very pleased they did so. I was very euphoric at \nthe time and probably could not have been much more excited at that \ntime.\n  When we were sworn in, there were 18 new Senators elected in 1980 and \nsworn in early in 1981. Of the 18, 16 were Republicans. The leadership \nof the Senate changed for the first time, I believe, since 1954. So we \nhad new committee chairmen; we had new leadership. Howard Baker assumed \nthe responsibility and role as majority leader and did an outstanding \njob. The Senate was a great place to work and to serve, and to work \nwith a President as generous, as humorous, and with such strong \nleadership as Ronald Reagan.\n  I look at the economy that Ronald Reagan inherited, and I see great \naccomplishments. A lot of people do not remember that in 1980 the \ninflation rate was 13.5 percent and it fell to 4.8 percent by 1989. The \ninterest rate in 1980 was 15.27 percent and fell to 10.87 percent by \n1989. Actually, the interest rate had risen to 18.87 percent in 1981. I \nremember that now. Interest rates were at 18 and 19 percent. The \nunemployment rate in 1980 was over 7 percent. In 1981 it reached 7.6 \npercent but by 1989 it was down to 5.3 percent.\n  So we had record high inflation rates, record high interest rates, \nand maybe not record high but very high unemployment rates. We \ninherited an economy that was going nowhere fast. It was going in the \nwrong direction. You could not afford to build a home. You could not \nafford to expand your business. It was a very difficult time.\n  Ronald Reagan came in with such great enthusiasm, such an optimist. \nHe did not say, ``let's moan about it,'' but ``let's do something about \nit.'' He had an economic game plan for which we fought, and we passed \nin the House and the Senate. These were remarkable accomplishments when \nI think about it.\n  He actually was responsible for pushing Congress, Democrats and \nRepublicans, to pass enormous changes in the Tax Code. I happened to \nenjoy working on taxes, and during his 8 years he actually moved the \nmaximum tax rate from 70 percent to 28 percent. That is a phenomenal \naccomplishment. Phenomenal. And he was able to do it with a bipartisan \nmajority. It was not a strictly partisan House and Senate. As a matter \nof fact, the House was always controlled by the Democrats. ``Tip'' \nO'Neill, who was the Democrat leader, the House Speaker at the time, \nwas opposed. So we had big confrontations, political confrontations, \nbig battles over the tax cuts, and over the budgets. Yet they passed \nthem.\n\n  Even though we had big battles, we had a certain dignity and respect \nin large part because of Ronald Reagan. And because of his affection \nfor individuals, Democrats and Republicans, even political adversaries \nwho would have political battles still had a collegial, working \nrelationship. They respected each other and respected individuals \nregardless of their political philosophy. As a result, he was able to \nenact enormous changes in the Tax Code and budgets, and increase \ndefense.\n  Ronald Reagan came in with an agenda, and he largely accomplished \nthose objectives. The result has been economic freedom in this country.\n  He was not satisfied, frankly, with just expanding and improving the \neconomic lot of Americans. He wanted to improve the economic lot and \nthe freedom of people throughout the world. Ronald Reagan was the \nleader of the free world, and he spoke eloquently and often and \nencouraged freedom through the world and countless countries that have \nbeen oppressed or suppressed through Communist leadership. Ronald \nReagan was speaking to them. He would go right over the leaders of \nCongress. If he wanted to get something done budget-wise, tax-wise, or \ndefense-wise, and if Congress was not listening, he would go to the \nAmerican people. And when he would travel internationally he would go \nover the leadership of those countries and speak to their people with \ngreat success.\n  We all remember his speech when he was in Berlin, the speech that \nsays: ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.''\n  The favorite picture of all my memorabilia that I have in my home is \na picture of me standing before the Berlin Wall, and behind it somebody \nspray-painted on the wall: ``When this wall falls, the rest will, \ntoo.'' And they did. The Berlin Wall did fall, and I think it was in \nlarge part because of Ronald Reagan's leadership.\n  When that wall fell, other countries that had been suppressed and \nunder the reins of the Iron Curtain of communism began speaking up, \nexercising their rights, and demanding freedom and obtaining it.\n  Ronald Reagan was the leader in winning the fight in the cold war. As \nMr. Gorbachev said, probably no one else in the world could have done \nit, but Ronald Reagan did it. And he was able to do it with Mr. \nGorbachev. Many times they were political adversaries in negotiating \narms control treaties and so on. Yet they still became friends as only \nRonald Reagan could do. He could become friends with his adversaries \nand eventually that kind of friendship and bond would lead to arms \ncontrol reduction, would lead to a significant reduction in nuclear \nweapons, would lead to agreements with our NATO allies and other \ncountries to expand freedom.\n  Ronald Reagan, probably more than any individual since Churchill or \nRoosevelt, was responsible for expanding freedom throughout the world. \nI compliment him for his great contributions in doing so.\n  He became somewhat of a role model for many of us. I was elected with \nthis group in 1980. Many of us called ourselves Reaganites and \nconsidered ourselves part of the soldiers in the field trying to get an \nagenda done to expand freedom. I am proud to have been part of that. I \nam proud to have had the opportunity to serve with such a great \nindividual.\n  I remember many times going down to the White House, talking issues. \nI remember Ronald Reagan almost always having humor, almost always not \ncaring who got the credit as long as we accomplished our objective.\n  I remember many times he let other people wrestle with the details, \nbut he knew where he wanted to go. He knew the course he was trying to \ndirect our ship of state, and he managed it very well.\n  I have a lot of fond memories. I remember Ronald Reagan coming in to \ncampaign for me in 1986. We had him visit Norman, Oklahoma, the \nUniversity of Oklahoma, Lloyd Noble Arena. We packed the place. It was \nmore than packed. The fire marshal had to turn down people who could \nnot get in. We had thousands and thousands of people. I told President \nReagan: This is Reagan country. They love you here. You don't need to \nmake a prepared speech. You can say whatever you want. They will \napplaud. They love you here.\n  There was a nice, big sign: ``This is Reagan country.'' Very \npositive. The entire rally speech could not have gone better from my \nstandpoint. There were thousands and thousands of people. It was great.\n\n[[Page S6613]]\n\n  Ronald Reagan concluded his speech. He said: ``That is why we need \nDon Rickles in the Senate.'' And I thought: Did he really say that? I \ntold him to wing it, and he did. I have had that honor of being able to \ncall myself Don Rickles for a long time.\n  But Ronald Reagan leaves a legacy. He leaves a legacy of decency. He \nleaves a legacy of integrity. I think he helped restore so much pride \nin America. He was a true patriot, a patriot who loved this country \nfrom the very inner core of his being. And it was contagious. It was \ncontagious through the fact that not only did he love America, but he \nmade Americans feel better about our country.\n  He made other people envy us to some extent. They wanted to be like \nus. They wanted to be free. What does America have that we don't have? \nThey have freedom, optimism. And that freedom would be economic \nfreedom, personal freedom, and political freedom.\n  Ronald Reagan wanted to expand it all for all people. He believed \neverybody--even if they lived in China or Russia or North Korea or El \nSalvador--if people were trying to take that freedom away, he was \nfreedom's friend. He carried that banner very well.\n  He helped people learn to love and respect the United States. I can \nhonestly say I have the greatest admiration and respect for Ronald \nReagan. I loved Ronald Reagan. He has moved this country forward in a \nway that I think all of us can be very proud.\n  Again, I express my condolences and sympathy to Nancy Reagan and to \nthe family. Nancy Reagan was one great First Lady. The love and \naffection she showed toward her husband throughout not only his \nPresidency and governorship but, frankly, throughout the last 10 years \nis more than commendable, and it is the kind of role model that, \nfrankly, we expect from Nancy Reagan. She is a first-class First Lady, \na first-class lady for all of us.\n  Again, my condolences and sympathy to her. And I thank her and her \nfamily for allowing us to share Ronald Reagan for many years as the \nleader of our country. He has made this country and, frankly, this \nworld a much better place to live.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I, too, rise in memory of President \nRonald Reagan. President Reagan will be remembered for his strong \nconvictions, his unfailing optimism, and his deep and abiding \npatriotism.\n  My heartfelt condolences go out to the Reagan family. They have been \nthrough so much in the last 10 years.\n  Our former First Lady, Nancy Reagan, has met one of the greatest \nchallenges that one can face with grace, dignity, and dedication. Her \ncourage is a model for the Nation. I know how tremendously difficult it \nis for a family when a loved one has Alzheimer's. My own dear father \nsuffered from this disease. And, my family and I know what the long \ngoodbye meant. So, I speak for my family, and I think all families who \nhave endured this disease when we salute Nancy Reagan as we pay our \nrespects to our President.\n\n\n          National Reagan Alzheimer's Breakthrough Act of 2004\n\n  Mr. President, as our country reflects on President Reagan's life, \nmany will ask, how should we honor him? I believe the greatest tribute \nwe could give to President Reagan and the Reagan family is a living \nmemorial, something that he would want to see us do, not something we \nwould like to do, and something that would have lasting value. \nTherefore, I would like to issue a bipartisan call to support \nlegislation that Senator Kit Bond and I will be introducing next week, \nlegislation to create breakthroughs for Alzheimer's disease.\n  Let's honor President Reagan's life with new research and new \ninitiatives on how to prevent Alzheimer's, how to care for those who \nhave it, how to support the gallant caregivers, and how, ultimately, to \nfind a cure.\n  President Reagan was a man of vigor. Let's attack Alzheimer's with \nthe same type of vigor that President Reagan demonstrated during his \nlife.\n  The time to act for real breakthroughs is now. Just last month, \nSenator Bond and I held a hearing on Alzheimer's research. Expert after \nexpert told us: We are on the verge of amazing breakthroughs; we will \nlose opportunities if we don't move quickly; we are at a crucial point \nwhere NIH funding can make a real difference.\n  Researchers, families, and advocates all said the same thing, we need \nto do more, we need to do better.\n  Let's answer that call by introducing and passing the Ronald Reagan \nAlzheimer's Breakthrough Act of 2004.\n  Friends, we are on the brink of something that could make a huge \ndifference in the lives of American families. We know that families \nface great difficulties when a loved one has Alzheimer's. There is \ngreat emotional cost as well as financial cost. We know that for our \npublic investment we could get new treatments that would prolong a \npatient's cognitive abilities.\n  Each month we delay admission to a long-term care facility is \nimportant to the family and to the taxpayer. Everybody wants a cure; \nthat is our ultimate goal. But even if we keep people at home for 1 or \n2 more years, to help them with their memory, their activities of daily \nliving, it would be an incredible breakthrough, and what a great \ntribute it would be to President Reagan.\n  It is amazing how far we have come. From the time President Reagan \ntook office in 1981 until the time he wrote that incredibly moving \ngoodbye letter to the Nation--and I note it with great emotion because, \nagain, I know how my own father felt. Back in the early 1980s, when \nPresident Reagan first came to office, Alzheimer's was a catch-all \nterm. Today, doctors diagnose Alzheimer's with 90-percent accuracy. \nEvery day NIH is making progress to identify risks, looking at new \nkinds of brain scans for appropriate detection, and understanding what \nthis disease does to the brain.\n  How did we get this far, this fast? With a bipartisan commitment like \nthe one represented by Senator Bond, Senators Specter and Harkin, the \nAlzheimer's Task Force that is lead by Senators Collins and Clinton, \nand all of us who are working on this issue. With a bipartisan \ncommitment of the authorizers and appropriators, we have been working \nto increase the funding for the National Institute on Aging. Remember, \nthere are 19 institutes at the NIH. One of them is the National \nInstitute of Aging.\n  In 1998 the National Institute on Aging was funded at approximately \n$500 million. Thanks to our bipartisan effort, it is at $1 billion. Now \nis the time to do more.\n  That is why I want to join with my esteemed colleague, Senator Kit \nBond, who himself has been a very strong advocate for research and \nbreakthroughs, to introduce the Ronald Reagan Alzheimer's Breakthrough \nAct of 2004.\n  We want to strengthen our national commitment to Alzheimer's \nresearch, to increase and double the funding of research at NIA, to \ngive them the resources they need to make those breakthroughs they say \nthey are on the horizon of doing. This will mean more clinical trials \nto test the best way to detect, prevent, and treat Alzheimer's.\n  NIH is looking at a range of behaviors and therapies that can make an \nincredible difference.\n  In our legislation, we also call for a national summit on Alzheimer's \nto bring together the best minds to examine current research, to look \nat priorities, and also to look at how we can help families.\n  While we are looking at research to find the cure or the cognitive \nstretch out, we have to support the caregivers. God bless the \ncaregivers. These are family members, often spouses, who take care of \nsomeone with Alzheimer's. The first caregiver is always the family. We \nsaw that with Nancy Reagan who went from being First Lady to first \ncaregiver.\n  We need to support families. We need to give help to those families \npracticing self-help. We now have legislation on the books to do that. \nBut, we need to add more to the Federal checkbook. Most families don't \nknow where to turn to get what services are available. I have a family \ncaregiver tax credit that would reimburse families for prescription \ndrugs, home health care, and specialized daycare. Too often, for \nfamilies with Alzheimer's, family responsibility brings them to the \nbrink of family bankruptcy.\n  There are other things we want to be able to do with this \nlegislation, such as providing news people can use. The legislation \nwould establish a network so\n\n[[Page S6614]]\n\ninformation can get out people about the advances, and things that \ncould be done right now to slow the onset of symptoms. We need to get \nthe word out, such as the wonderful program developed by the \nAlzheimer's Association called ``Maintain Your Brain.'' But, private \nphilanthropy cannot be a substitute for public policy and public \nfunding. We have to fund these initiatives.\n  I believe very strongly in this. There are 4.5 million people with \nAlzheimer's. They live in every State, in cities and suburbs and on \nfarms. They are from every walk of life, like my father, who owned a \nsmall grocery store, or a man who was the President of the United \nStates. Alzheimer's is an all-American disease. It affected an all-\nAmerican President. Now we need an all-American effort to find the \nbreakthroughs.\n  I encourage everyone to consider this when Senator Bond and I \nintroduce this legislation. This research and treatment is very \nimportant. I do not want to be so bold as to speak for Mrs. Reagan, but \nbased on what I know she has gone through and what other families have \ngone through, I believe the legacy she would approve of is an all-\nAmerican effort. An effort to speed up the day when no family ever has \nto have that very long goodbye.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank and commend my colleague from \nMaryland who has been a great champion of the effort to deal with the \nterribly distressing and fatal disease of Alzheimer's in proposing--and \nI am happy to join her--a measure to honor Ronald Reagan, his memory, \nhis life, his work, and his family with a living tribute, a redoubled \neffort on behalf of this Nation to deal with Alzheimer's.\n  Senator Mikulski and others who have lived with and lost a loved one \nfrom Alzheimer's can say very clearly how difficult it must have been \nfor Mrs. Reagan and the Reagan family as this true leader went through \nthe final stages of his life, crippled and debilitated by Alzheimer's, \nto see this man who was so vigorous, who had contributed so much be \nreduced to the indignities of Alzheimer's.\n  His life and legacy can be honored in many ways. People will remember \nhim for many reasons. I will speak of those in a moment. But by \nincreasing research for Alzheimer's disease, helping to limit the \nnumber and maybe even eliminate Alzheimer's, providing assistance to \nfamilies who must deal with patients with Alzheimer's, and providing \nassistance in identifying and preventing Alzheimer's is vitally \nimportant.\n  One of the facts that struck me as we listened to the experts was \nthat as we get older more and more of us are going to suffer from \nAlzheimer's disease. We were told in our hearing about a month ago that \nif you reach 85, you have a 50-percent chance of getting Alzheimer's \ndisease. What a tragic figure. There is something we must do, and we \nbelieve this legislation is one way of making a major effort, showing a \ncommitment, reaching out a hand of hope to the families of those who \nhave Alzheimer's, providing information to all of us on what we might \nbe able to do to lessen the likelihood we will be struck with \nAlzheimer's.\n  As Senator Mikulski said, this bill will serve as a tribute to \nPresident Reagan by doubling the funding for Alzheimer's research at \nthe National Institutes of Health. It would increase funding for the \nNational Family Caregiver Support Program to $250 million. It would \nreauthorize the Alzheimer's demonstration grant program that provides \ngrants to States to fill in gaps in Alzheimer's services, such as \nrespite care, home health care, and daycare.\n  I have done a fair amount of work in home care and daycare. I can \ntell you that a family living with a patient with Alzheimer's needs a \nbreak. They need someone to care for that loved one so they can get out \nand renew their batteries, refresh their view on life. This can help.\n  We would authorize $1 million for a safe return program to assist in \nthe identification and safe, timely return of individuals with \nAlzheimer's disease and related dementias who too frequently wander off \nfrom their caregivers. We hear the tragedies where they can't find \ntheir way home and fall victim to natural or even automobile accidents \nwhile they are gone. We would establish a public education program to \neducate members of the public about prevention techniques, how you can \nmaintain your brain, as you age, based on the current research being \nundertaken by NIH.\n  We would establish a $5,000 tax credit to help with the high health \ncosts of caring for a loved one at home.\n  Today, as Senator Mikulski said, about 4.5 million Americans have \nAlzheimer's, costing about $100 billion a year. But if current trends \ncontinue, and as more of us age, by 2050, 11 to 16 million individuals \ncould have this disease.\n  Over the past 20 years tremendous progress has been made in the \nprevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Alzheimer's. It is now possible \nto diagnose Alzheimer's with more than 90-percent accuracy. There are \nnew drugs, new treatments introduced each year, and investments in \nresearch have set the stage for scientific and medical advances to \nprevent or slow down the progression of Alzheimer's. Quite frankly, \nmost of the successful research to date has been in slowing the impact, \nnot preventing it. But this research offers hope for the 4.5 million \npeople and their families who suffer from the disease today.\n  These are some of what we can do as an honor to the President. It is \nmy great pleasure to speak in this Chamber about the life and \nleadership and the truly remarkable legacy of the 40th President of the \nUnited States, Ronald Reagan.\n  We mourn his loss. We pray for comfort for his family. But most of \nall, we give thanks for his life, his leadership, and his \ncontributions. Truly, he is a man who changed the mood of the country. \nHe changed the economy of the country. And in many ways, he changed the \nmood and the attitude of the world.\n  People talk about President Reagan as the Great Communicator. Nobody \ncould deliver a line better than he could. But do you know something \nabout communication? Communication is only as good as the message you \nhave to communicate. The power of Ronald Reagan was that he delivered \nwith enthusiasm, with optimism, with cheer, with love, a message of \nhope, freedom, and opportunity, not just for Americans but for the \nworld.\n  I had the pleasure of getting to know Ronald Reagan. He was a \ngenuinely optimistic person who brought the spirit of optimism and hope \nto us as Americans and to enslaved peoples around the world. Ronald \nReagan was a man who took disappointment and moved on. He was a man of \nunfailing good humor, care, and thoughtfulness. Even people who \ndisagreed with his policies across the board could not help but like \nhim.\n  And those of us who may have disappointed him found it did not \ninterfere with his friendship. He campaigned for me in 1972 when I was \na 33-year-old kid running for Governor of the State of Missouri. I had \nnever seen anything like it. When he came into town, we had all of the \nsecurity and escorts. But it wasn't until he went up on stage and \nstarted making his presentation that I saw what it was that had brought \nso many people from southwest Missouri in to hear this leader. He had a \nmessage then--the same message--of optimism, growth, and hope for the \nfuture.\n  I was fortunate enough to be elected and to serve with him for 2 \nyears. Two years after that, I hosted the Republican National \nConvention, and I had made a commitment to our President at the time, \nwho selected our State for the national convention. So I supported him \nand not President Reagan. But about 10 years later, when I was running \nfor the Senate, he came to Missouri three times and he put on the most \namazing campaign rallies I ever had. We still talk about it, because \npeople came to hear his message. I stood there, side by side with Jack \nDanforth, and we smiled and glowed in the wonderful feeling he \ngenerated. He helped me a great deal.\n  President Reagan helped the United States. He came to the Presidency \nat a time when a lot of people were saying maybe the Presidency cannot \nwork, maybe nobody can govern this country, maybe it is too much to \nexpect somebody to lead. Well, he led very boldly. Quite simply, he \nthought that if you returned tax dollars to the average American and \ntook off the fetters on\n\n[[Page S6615]]\n\nsmall business, you would create jobs and build the economy. By the \nsignificant lowering of the tax rates, as my friend from Oklahoma, \nSenator Nickles, said, he put money back into the pockets of small \nbusinesses, and small business became the engine of economic growth, \ncreating three-quarters of the new jobs. He built an economy, and that \neconomy allowed us to put money into defense.\n  He tried to negotiate with the Soviets. He asked Mr. Gorbachev if he \nwould sit down and talk with him about how we could end the competition \nbetween Soviet communism and the United States. Mr. Gorbachev didn't \nrespond. So he built up our defenses and showed the Russians, the \nSoviets, that they could not defeat us. He went boldly to Berlin and \ncalled on Mr. Gorbachev--much to the distress of the State Department, \nI might add, and some of his own team--``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this \nwall.''\n  Well, that wall came down literally and figuratively. He had a \nmessage that went far beyond Mr. Gorbachev. That message went to the \nenslaved peoples behind the Iron Curtain. I had the pleasure of \nvisiting some of those countries right before and right after they \nfell, a few years after President Reagan had set in motion the \ninexorable machine of freedom. His message of hope, freedom, and \nopportunity continues to reverberate around the world. I have had the \npleasure of meeting with people and traveling to other countries and \nseeing how this message--the American dream--he championed is taking \nhold. He wasn't the only one responsible for it, but we never had a \nbetter proponent of it. I believe this message of the American hopes \nand the American ideals, for which Ronald Reagan spoke so eloquently, \nis winning the battle.\n  Finally, in his last and boldest move, when Ronald Reagan learned he \nhad Alzheimer's--a disease which was not spoken about often because \npeople hated to think of what would happen to their loved ones, so they \ndidn't talk about it--he said, ``I have Alzheimer's disease,'' and \nAmericans woke up and they thought, this is a world leader who is \nsuffering from this disease; let's do something about it. Let's get \nserious about Alzheimer's disease. That public announcement gave us a \npush that I believe we can continue by carrying on with his work with a \nliving memorial.\n\n  So as we say goodbye to this remarkable American, we join in our \nprayers and thoughts with Mrs. Nancy Reagan and her family, and we \ncelebrate the life of a great American who made a real difference for \npeople throughout the world. Let us honor his memory by helping \nmillions more whom we might be able to save from the scourge of \nAlzheimer's disease and the burdens and the sorrow that imposes on \ntheir families.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, in the elections of 1980 and 1984, the \nState of Oregon sent its electors to the electoral college to vote for \nRonald Reagan. He was the last Republican to win the State of Oregon in \na Presidential election, and he did so at a time of great peril both \nfor my State and our country.\n  When that occurred, America was in economic malaise, communism seemed \nto be in its ascendency, and America was struggling for leadership. \nWinston Churchill once said of a predecessor as British Prime Minister, \n``He had had the misfortune to live in a time of great men and small \nevents.'' When you think of where America was and where it ended after \n8 years of the administration of Ronald Reagan, truly it can be said \nthat all free men and women are better and freer, more prosperous and \nmore at peace because Ronald Reagan was a great man called to a great \ntime.\n  As I contemplated what I could do in my small way to add some measure \nof tribute to the life of Ronald Reagan and to express to Nancy Reagan \nand her family my heartfelt condolences, I thought I should keep my \nwords to a minimum and focus, instead, on the warm and wise words of \nPresident Reagan in his farewell address. It has been the practice of \nthe Senate for the last 140 years that on or around the birthday of \nGeorge Washington, a Senator is selected to read Washington's farewell \naddress. I thought I would begin that tradition this day, with \nPresident Reagan's great speech, to come to the floor on or around \nPresident Reagan's birthday, and share his speech--or if one of my \ncolleagues would like to do so, I would offer them the opportunity. I \nbelieve that this new tradition would be a fitting tribute to Ronald \nReagan, to let Ronald Reagan's words speak again to the American \npeople, far more eloquently than I could on an occasion when we all \nstruggle to find the right superlatives to say thank you to him.\n  So with the Chair's indulgence, I will read the farewell address of \nPresident Ronald Reagan, given shortly before he left the Oval Office \nand George Herbert Walker Bush became the President.\n  The words of President Reagan:\n\n       This is the 34th time I'll speak to you from the Oval \n     Office and the last. We've been together 8 years now, and \n     soon it'll be time for me to go. But before I do, I wanted to \n     share some thoughts, some of which I've been saving for a \n     long time.\n       It's been the honor of my life to be your President. So \n     many of you have written the past few weeks to say thanks, \n     but I could say as much to you. Nancy and I are grateful for \n     the opportunity you gave us to serve.\n       One of the things about the Presidency is that you're \n     always somewhat apart. You spent a lot of time going by too \n     fast in a car someone else is driving, and seeing the people \n     through tinted glass--the parents holding up a child, and the \n     wave you saw too late and couldn't return. And so many times \n     I wanted to stop and reach out from behind the glass, and \n     connect. Well, maybe I can do a little of that tonight.\n       People ask how I feel about leaving. And the fact is, \n     ``parting is such sweet sorrow.'' The sweet part is \n     California and the ranch and freedom. The sorrow--the \n     goodbyes, of course, and leaving this beautiful place.\n       You know, down the hall and up the stairs from this office \n     is the part of the White House where the President and his \n     family live. There are a few favorite windows I have up there \n     that I like to stand and look out of early in the morning. \n     The view is over the grounds here to the Washington Monument, \n     and then the Mall and the Jefferson Memorial. But on mornings \n     when the humidity is low, you can see past the Jefferson to \n     the river, the Potomac, and the Virginia shore. Someone said \n     that's the view Lincoln had when he saw the smoke rising from \n     the Battle of Bull Run. I see more prosaic things: the grass \n     on the banks, the morning traffic as people make their way to \n     work, now and then a sailboat on the river.\n       I've been thinking a bit at that window. I've been \n     reflecting on what the past 8 years have meant and mean. And \n     the image that comes to mind like a refrain is a nautical \n     one--a small story about a big ship, and a refugee, and a \n     sailor. It was back in the early eighties, at the height of \n     the boat people. And the sailor was hard at work on the \n     carrier Midway, which was patrolling the South China Sea. The \n     sailor, like most American servicemen, was young, smart, and \n     fiercely observant. The crew spied on the horizon a leaky \n     little boat. And crammed inside were refugees from Indochina \n     hoping to get to America. The Midway sent a small launch to \n     bring them to the ship and safety. As the refugees made their \n     way through the choppy seas, one spied the sailor on deck, \n     and stood up, and called out to him. He yelled, ``Hello, \n     American sailor. Hello, freedom man.''\n       A small moment with a big meaning, a moment the sailor, who \n     wrote it in a letter, couldn't get out of his mind. And, when \n     I saw it, neither could I. Because that's what it was to be \n     an American in the 1980's. We stood, again, for freedom. I \n     know we always have, but in the past few years the world \n     again--and in a way, we ourselves--rediscovered it.\n       It's been quite a journey this decade, and we held together \n     through some stormy seas. And at the end, together, we are \n     reaching our destination.\n       The fact is, from Grenada to the Washington and Moscow \n     summits, from the recession of '81 to '82, to the expansion \n     that began in late '82 and continues to this day, we've made \n     a difference. The way I see it, there were two great \n     triumphs, two things that I'm proudest of. One is the \n     economic recovery, in which the people of America created--\n     and filled--19 million new jobs. The other is the recovery of \n     our morale. America is respected again in the world and \n     looked to for leadership.\n       Something that happened to me a few years ago reflects some \n     of this. It was back in 1981, and I was attending my first \n     economic summit, which was held that year in Canada. The \n     meeting place rotates among the member countries. The opening \n     meeting was a formal dinner of the heads of government of the \n     seven industrialized nations. Now, I sat there like the new \n     kid in school and listened, and it was all Francois this and \n     Helmut that. They dropped titles and spoke to one another on \n     a first-name basis. Well, at one point I sort of leaned in \n     and said, `My name's Ron.' Well, in that same year, we began \n     the actions we felt would ignite an economic comeback--cut \n     taxes and regulation, started to cut spending. And soon the \n     recovery began.\n       Two years later, another economic summit with pretty much \n     the same cast. At the big opening meeting we all got \n     together, and all\n\n[[Page S6616]]\n\n     of a sudden, just for a moment, I saw that everyone was just \n     sitting there looking at me. And then one of them broke the \n     silence. `Tell us about the American miracle,' he said.\n       Well, back in 1980, when I was running for President, it \n     was all so different. Some pundits said our programs would \n     result in catastrophe. Our views on foreign affairs would \n     cause war. Our plans for the economy would cause inflation to \n     soar and bring about economic collapse. I even remember one \n     highly respected economist saying, back in 1982, that `The \n     engines of economic growth have shut down here, and they're \n     likely to stay that way for years to come.' Well, he and the \n     other opinion leaders were wrong. The fact is what they call \n     `radical' was really `right.' What they called `dangerous' \n     was just `desperately needed.'\n       And in all of that time I won a nickname, `The Great \n     Communicator.' But I never thought it was my style or the \n     words I used that made a difference: it was the content. I \n     wasn't a great communicator, but I communicated great things, \n     and they didn't spring full bloom from my brow, they came \n     from the heart of a great nation--from our experience, or \n     wisdom, and our belief in the principles that have guided us \n     for two centuries. They called it the Reagan revolution. \n     Well, I'll accept that, but for me it always seemed more like \n     the great rediscovery, a rediscovery of our values and our \n     common sense.\n       Common sense told us that when you put a big tax on \n     something, the people will produce less of it. So, we cut the \n     people's tax rates, and the people produced more than ever \n     before. The economy bloomed like a plant that had been cut \n     back and could now grow quicker and stronger. Our economic \n     program brought about the longest peacetime expansion in our \n     history: real family income up, the poverty rate down, \n     entrepreneurship booming, and an explosion in research and \n     new technology. We're exporting more than ever because \n     American industry became more competitive and at the same \n     time, we summoned the national will to knock down \n     protectionist walls abroad instead of erecting them at home.\n       Common sense also told us that to preserve the peace, we'd \n     have to become strong again after years of weakness and \n     confusion. So, we rebuilt our defenses, and this New Year we \n     toasted the new peacefulness around the globe. Not only have \n     the superpowers actually begun to reduce their stockpiles of \n     nuclear weapons--and hope for even more progress is bright--\n     but the regional conflicts that rack the globe are also \n     beginning to cease. The Persian Gulf is no longer a war zone. \n     The Soviets are leaving Afghanistan. The Vietnamese are \n     preparing to pull out of Cambodia, and an American-mediated \n     accord will soon send 50,000 Cuban troops home from Angola.\n       The lesson of all this was, of course, that because we're a \n     great nation, our challenges seem complex. It will always be \n     this way. But as long as we remember our first principles and \n     believe in ourselves, the future will always be ours. And \n     something else we learned: Once you begin a great movement, \n     there's no telling where it will end. We meant to change a \n     nation, and instead, we changed a world.\n       Countries across the globe are turning to free markets and \n     free speech and turning away from the ideologies of the past. \n     For them, the great rediscovery of the 1980's has been that, \n     lo and behold, the moral way of government is the practical \n     way of government: Democracy, the profoundly good, is also \n     the profoundly productive.\n       When you've got to the point when you can celebrate the \n     anniversaries of your 39th birthday you can sit back \n     sometimes, review your life, and see it flowing before you. \n     For me there was a fork in the river, and it was right in the \n     middle of my life. I never meant to go into politics. It \n     wasn't my intention when I was young. But I was raised to \n     believe you had to pay your way for the blessings bestowed on \n     you. I was happy with my career in the entertainment world, \n     but I ultimately went into politics because I wanted to \n     protect something precious.\n       Ours was the first revolution in the history of mankind \n     that truly reversed the course of government, and with three \n     little words: `We the People.' `We the People' tell the \n     government what to do; it doesn't tell us. `We the People' \n     are the driver; the government is the car. And we decide \n     where it should go, and by what route, and how fast. Almost \n     all the world's constitutions are documents in which \n     governments tell the people what their privileges are. Our \n     Constitution is a document in which `We the People' tell the \n     government what it is allowed to do. `We the People' are \n     free. This belief has been the underyling basis for \n     everything I've tried to do these past 8 years.\n       But back in the 1960's, when I began, it seemed to me that \n     we'd begun reversing the order of things--that through more \n     and more rules and regulations and confiscatory taxes, the \n     government was taking more of our money, more of our options, \n     and more of our freedom. I went into politics in part to put \n     up my hand and say, `Stop.' I was a citizen politician, and \n     it seemed the right thing for a citizen to do.\n       I think we have stopped a lot of what needed stopping. And \n     I hope we have once again reminded people that man is not \n     free unless government is limited. There's a clear cause and \n     effect here that is as neat and predictable as a law of \n     physics: As government expands, liberty contracts.\n       Nothing is less free than pure communism--and yet we have, \n     the past few years, forged a satisfying new closeness with \n     the Soviet Union. I've been asked if this isn't a gamble, and \n     my answer is no because we're basing our actions not on words \n     but deeds. The detente of the 1970's was based not on actions \n     but promises. They'd promise to treat their own people and \n     the people of the world better. But the gulag was still the \n     gulag, and the state was still expansionist, and they still \n     waged proxy wars in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.\n       Well, this time, so far, it's different. President \n     Gorbachev has brought about some internal democratic reforms \n     and begun the withdrawal from Afghanistan. He has also freed \n     prisoners whose names I've given him every time we've met.\n       But life has a way of reminding you of big things through \n     small incidents. Once, during the heady days of the Moscow \n     summit, Nancy and I decided to break off from the entourage \n     one afternoon to visit the shops on Arbat Street--that's a \n     little street just off Moscow's main shopping area. Even \n     though our visit was a surprise, every Russian there \n     immediately recognized us and called out our names and \n     reached for our hands. We were just about swept away by the \n     warmth. You could almost feel the possibilities in all that \n     joy. But within seconds, a KGB detail pushed their way toward \n     us and began pushing and shoving the people in the crowd. It \n     was an interesting moment. It reminded me that while the man \n     on the street in the Soviet Union yearns for peace, the \n     government is Communist. And those who run it are Communists, \n     and that means we and they view such issues as freedom and \n     human rights very differently.\n       We must keep up our guard, but we must also continue to \n     work together to lessen and eliminate tension and mistrust. \n     My view is that President Gorbachev is different from \n     previous Soviet leaders. I think he knows some of the things \n     wrong with his society and is trying to fix them. We wish him \n     well. And we'll continue to work to make sure that the Soviet \n     Union that eventually emerges from this process is a less \n     threatening one. What it all boils down to is this: I want \n     the new closeness to continue. And it will, as long as we \n     make it clear that we will continue to act in a certain way \n     as long as they continue to act in a helpful manner. If and \n     when they don't, at first pull your punches. If they persist, \n     pull the plug. It's still trust by verify. It's still play, \n     but cut the cards. It's still watch closely. And don't be \n     afraid to see what you see.\n       I've been asked if I have any regrets. Well, I do. The \n     deficit is one. I've been talking a great deal about that \n     lately, but tonight isn't for arguments, and I'm going to \n     hold my tongue. But an observation: I've had my share of \n     victories in the Congress, but what few people noticed is \n     that I never won anything you didn't win for me. They never \n     saw my troops, they never saw Reagan's regiments, the \n     American people. You won every battle with every call you \n     made and letter you wrote demanding action. Well, action is \n     still needed. If we're to finish the job. Reagan's regiments \n     will have to become the Bush brigades. Soon he'll be the \n     chief, and he'll need you every bit as much as I did.\n       Finally, there is a great tradition of warnings in \n     Presidential farewells, and I've got one that's been on my \n     mind for some time. But oddly enough it starts with one of \n     the things I'm proudest of in the past 8 years: the \n     resurgence of national pride that I called the new \n     patriotism. This national feeling is good, but it won't count \n     for much, and it won't last unless it's grounded in \n     thoughtfulness and knowledge.\n       An informed patriotism is what we want. And are we doing a \n     good enough job teaching our children what America is and \n     what she represents in the long history of the world? Those \n     of us who are over 35 or so years of age grew up in a \n     different America. We were taught, very directly, what it \n     means to be an American. And we absorbed, almost in the air, \n     a love of country and an appreciation of its institutions. If \n     you didn't get these things from your family you got them \n     from the neighborhood, from the father down the street who \n     fought in Korea or the family who lost someone at Anzio. Or \n     you could get a sense of patriotism from school. And if all \n     else failed you could get a sense of patriotism from the \n     popular culture. The movies celebrated democratic values and \n     implicitly reinforced the idea that America was special. TV \n     was like that, too, through the mid-sixties.\n       But now, we're about to enter the nineties, and some things \n     have changed. Younger parents aren't sure that an \n     unambivalent appreciation of America is the right thing to \n     teach modern children. And as for those who create the \n     popular culture, well-grounded patriotism is no longer the \n     style. Our spirit is back, but we haven't reinstitutionalized \n     it. We've got to do a better job of getting across that \n     America is freedom--freedom of speech, freedom of religion, \n     freedom of enterprise. And freedom is special and rare. It's \n     fragile it needs production [protection].\n       So, we've got to teach history based not on what's in \n     fashion but what's important--why the Pilgrims came here, who \n     Jimmy Doolittle was, and what those 30 seconds over Tokyo \n     meant. You know, 4 years ago on the 40th anniversary of D-\n     day, I read a letter from a young woman writing to her late \n     father, who'd fought on Omaha Beach. Her name was Lisa \n     Zanatta Henn, and she said, `we will always remember, we will \n     never forget what the boys of Normandy did.' Well, let's help \n     her keep her word. If we forget what we did, we won't know \n     who we are. I'm\n\n[[Page S6617]]\n\n     warning of an eradication of the American memory that could \n     result, ultimately, in an erosion of the American spirit. \n     Let's start with some basics: more attention to American \n     history and a greater emphasis on civic ritual.\n       And let me offer lesson number one about America: All great \n     change in America begins at the dinner table. So, tomorrow \n     night in the kitchen I hope the talking begins. And children, \n     if your parents haven't been teaching you what it means to be \n     an American, let 'em know and nail'em on it. That would be a \n     very American thing to do.\n       And that's about all I have to say tonight, except for one \n     thing. The past few days when I've been at that window \n     upstairs, I've thought a bit of the `shining city upon a \n     hill.' The phrase comes from John Winthrop, who wrote it to \n     describe the America he imagined. What he imagined was \n     important because he was an early Pilgrim, an early freedom \n     man. He journeyed here on what today we'd call a little \n     wooden boat; and like the other Pilgrims, he was looking \n     for a home that would be free. I've spoken of the shining \n     city all my political life, but I don't know if I ever \n     quite communicated what I saw when I said it. But in my \n     mind it was a tall, proud city built on rocks stronger \n     than oceans, windswept, God-blessed, and teeming with \n     people of all kinds living in harmony and peace; a city \n     with free ports that hummed with commerce and creativity. \n     And if there had to be city walls, the walls had doors and \n     the doors were open to anyone with the will and the heart \n     to get here. That's how I saw it, and see it still.\n       And how stands the city on this winter night? More \n     prosperous, more secure, and happier than it was 8 years ago. \n     But more than that: After 200 years, two centuries, she still \n     stands strong and true on the granite ridge, and her glow has \n     held steady no matter what storm. And she's still a beacon, \n     still a magnet for all who must have freedom, for all the \n     pilgrims from all the lost places who are hurtling through \n     the darkness, toward home.\n       We've done our part. And as I walk off into the city \n     streets, a final word to the men and women of the Reagan \n     revolution, the men and women across America who for 8 years \n     did the work that brought America back. My friends: We did \n     it. We weren't just marking time. We made a difference. We \n     made the city stronger, we made the city freer, and we left \n     her in good hands. All in all, not bad, not bad at all.\n       And so, goodbye, God bless you, and God bless the United \n     States of America.\n\n  I would only add, God bless Ronald and Nancy Reagan, and God bless \nthe United States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, this past weekend, the news quickly made its \nway across the country and around the world. Ronald Reagan, our 40th \nPresident, had died. For many of us, we received the news with a \nmixture of sadness together with a sense of relief that his long battle \nwith illness was now over and he had now found peace at the end of his \nlife.\n  I first met Ronald Reagan when I was president of the Wyoming Jaycees \nat the national convention which was held in California, and he was the \nGovernor. I next met the President when I was mayor of Gillette, WY, \nand the National League of Cities held its national meeting and the \nPresident flew to California and addressed it.\n  Now the greatest thinkers and writers will take up their pens in an \nattempt to determine his place in history and his significance as one \nof our greatest Presidents. For those of us who observed his service as \nour President and admired his leadership, those questions had been long \nsince answered. For us, his place in history was long ago determined by \nhis place in our hearts.\n  Many of those who will examine his life in detail will tell a story \nabout a man who was born without the great privileges and trappings you \nmight expect of such a successful life. That is true, but there is so \nmuch more to the story.\n  Ronald Reagan was born in Illinois, the son of a traveling shoe \nsalesman. Growing up he was strongly influenced by his mother who \ntaught him how to read at an early age. She urged him to read good \nbooks that would encourage him to dream and set goals in his life. She \nknew that he could be anything he wanted to be if he was willing to \nwork hard and expect more of himself than anyone else had any reason to \nexpect. That, more than anything else, really determined his character \nand ultimately mapped his destiny.\n  His natural confidence and determination began to show itself during \nhis school years and again, later, when he began his career as an \nactor. He was a natural leader and he took a leadership role at \nvirtually every stage of his life. In his college days he served as \nstudent body president. In his acting days he served as the president \nof the Screen Actors Guild. In between he worked hard and built a \ncareer as a successful actor in film and on television.\n  If that had been all he had done, it would have been a remarkable \nlife. He would have earned the rags to riches label and inspired others \nto follow his path just by his success in Hollywood and on television. \nThat would have been enough for just about everyone. It was not, \nhowever, enough for Ronald Reagan.\n  With his beloved wife, Nancy, by his side, Ronald Reagan began to \npursue his dream. He wanted to make a greater impact on the world than \nhe could by being a television and movie star, so he began to take a \nmore active role in politics. He discovered he had a talent for that, \ntoo. After a great deal of thought and deliberation, he decided to put \nhis vision for America to the test. He took his case to the people and \nbegan a run for Governor of California.\n  People thought it was an impossible dream and he could never win a \nState like California. Ronald Reagan proved them wrong. He put together \na coalition of both Republican and Democratic voters and, when all the \nvotes were counted, he had made it happen and he was elected Governor \nby almost a million votes.\n  Reagan then set his sights on the Presidency of the United States \nand, after a narrow loss to Gerald Ford, he spent the next few years \ntraveling around the country, sharing his dream for a better United \nStates with the people who came to hear him speak. Many doubted he \ncould do it, but once again, he found the support he needed to win the \nRepublican nomination. The contest for the Presidency put him up \nagainst an incumbent who talked about the serious problems facing the \nNation. Ronald Reagan, on the other hand, spoke with passionate \ncertainty that working together the Nation could overcome them. When \nthe votes were counted, Ronald Reagan had won the presidency in a \nlandslide.\n\n  As President, Ronald Reagan proved himself to be a man of principle, \nsomeone who said what he believed and believed what he said. He had \nexcellent communication skills, and his speeches on television were \nextremely effective.\n  When he took the oath of the office as our 40th President, he took \nover the reins of a country that had great problems. He had often \nreferred to our economic woes as the ``misery index.'' There was high \ninflation, high interest rates, and high unemployment. Perhaps worst of \nall, the Nation seemed to have lost its confidence in its ability to \ndare to do great things--and succeed.\n  There was a lot of doubt and cynicism that any one individual could \ndo much to change things and re-energize the Nation. Again, Ronald \nReagan proved the doubters wrong. As President, his spirit of optimism, \npatriotism and personal pride in his country proved to be infectious. \nBefore long, there was a new spirit in the United States, a renewed \nsense of pride and excitement about our Flag and our Nation that hadn't \nbeen around for a while. Ronald Reagan was just what we needed. He \ninspired a generation to look toward the future with hope and a renewed \ncommitment to the principles upon which our Nation was founded. It is \nstill alive today. It is his legacy that he left with us, his gift to \nthe younger generations of the Nation.\n  During his two terms in the White House, Ronald Reagan spoke the \ntruth, regardless of the sensitivities of those who might not want to \nhear it. It was over the objections of much of his staff that he \nchallenged Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to ``tear down this wall'' \nwhen he was in Berlin. It was against the advice of much of his staff \nto refer to the Soviet Union as an ``evil empire.'' For Ronald Reagan, \nit was simple. If it was the truth, it must be said. For him, there was \ngood guys and bad guys in the world. If the good guys worked hard and \nwere determined to succeed, they won. In Ronald Reagan's world, we were \nthe good guys. And, during Ronald Reagan's Presidency, more often then \nnot, we won.\n  For historians and the history books, Ronald Reagan will be \nremembered as the President who brought a successful end to the cold \nwar; had a great deal to do with the collapse of communism in the \nSoviet Union and the destruction\n\n[[Page S6618]]\n\nof the Berlin Wall; and, dramatically turned the Nation's economy \naround. For those of us who observed his style as our President, he \nwill also be remembered for his spirit, and his attitude of patriotic \noptimism, which rejuvenated the Nation when our spirit was low. He was \na great leader and a great American. His words and his actions will \nlong be remembered.\n  Ronald Reagan dared to do the impossible, not because it was easy but \nbecause it had to be done. The challenges he encountered in his life \nbrought out the best in him, and the challenges we faced as a Nation \nunder him brought out the best in all of us. His is a legacy that we \nwill always cherish. We will miss him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, does the Senator from Florida wish to \nspeak about the subject of the day?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. That is correct.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield for the Senator and ask unanimous consent that I \nfollow the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I will be very brief. I thank the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  Mr. President, on this occasion, when the Nation is mourning the loss \nof President Reagan, I wish to bring to the attention of the Senate a \ncouple of stories which are fresh in my memory about President Reagan.\n  I had the privilege during his two terms as President of serving in \nthe House of Representatives, representing a district from the State of \nFlorida.\n  The first story I wish to share is of a time of great loss to this \ncountry, the loss of the Space Shuttle Challenger. The American people \ncould hardly believe it. The entire technological prowess of our \ncountry was symbolized by America having a very successful space \nprogram. We were the first to the Moon. This new contraption called a \nspace transportation system was reusable, with new technologies that \nhad been developed. America was quite proud.\n  I had the privilege of flying on the 24th flight of the space \nshuttle, 6 days in orbit, returning on January 18, 1986. Only 10 days \nlater, the crew that we had stayed with in quarantine--we had been one \nof the most delayed flights in the history of the space program--was \nthe crew of the Challenger.\n  We all know the story. Ten miles high in the Florida sky, the \nChallenger's solid rocket booster had hot gasses escaping from a field \njoint in that rocket. They happened to come out at a place where the \nstrut was burned. That caused the solid rocket motor to then cantilever \nand it punctured the big apricot-colored fuel tank that held all of the \nliquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. The whole space shuttle then \ndisintegrated.\n  Naturally, the feelings I had were very raw and very emotional on \nthat day, having trained with that crew and having just returned from \nspace 10 days earlier.\n  America's feelings were as raw and as emotional because our whole \nsymbol of technological and scientific prowess had suddenly \ndisintegrated in front of our eyes on our television screens.\n  At a time of a grieving nation, there can be only one person who can \nspeak for the country. That is the President. President Reagan rose to \nthe occasion. That speech on television that night, delivered from the \nOval Office, was a masterpiece, in which he ends up quoting a Canadian \npilot from World War II--a pilot who had experienced the joys of \nflying--and those immortal words that ended the poem that he had \nreached out and he had touched the face of God.\n  President Reagan applied that poem to the feelings of the country at \nthe time about what the seven astronauts had experienced. That is \npolitical genius. That is a leader. That is a leader who has the \nability through communication to connect, to inspire, and in this \nparticular case, on January 28, 1986, to help the Nation through the \nprocess of grieving, to accept what had happened and then pick up and \nmove on, which we have.\n  And of course, 17 years later, we had another very similar kind of \nexperience when we lost an additional seven astronauts.\n  That speech, in my mind, was only exceeded by the speech that \noccurred 3 days later by President Reagan at the Johnson Space Center \nin Houston in a memorial service for the astronauts, the astronauts, \nwhose bodies at that point still had not been recovered from the floor \nof the Atlantic Ocean where, hopefully, they had perished before they \never hit the water. Hopefully, somehow that crew compartment had been \npunctured at that altitude and therefore there would have been instant \ndecompression and there would have been instant loss of consciousness.\n  But with all of that swirling in all of our minds, with all of that \nswirling in the minds of that NASA community--NASA really is a family--\nagain, the leader of the Nation had to rise to the occasion to \nsummarize and to continue the process of healing in the time of grief.\n\n  I saw rough, tough test pilots who were some of the best of the best \nof our astronaut pilots grabbing each other and hugging in that time of \ngrief. And President Reagan, in the moment, gave comfort to all of \nthose, especially to the families of that crew who were lost, led by \nthe commander of that mission, Dick Scobee.\n  Another story I wish to tell about President Reagan is very personal \nto me as well. It was just about the middle of the decade of the 1980s. \nI was a Member of the House of Representatives. There was a particular \nvote coming up that was critically close. I had already made up my mind \nthat the way I was going to vote in this particular case was the way \nPresident Reagan had wanted the vote to go but had not telegraphed that \nto the leadership of either side because there was something I wanted \nto tell the President.\n  There was a 6-month-old infant in my hometown of Melbourne, FL, who \nwas dying because he needed a liver transplant. Mind you, this is 20 \nyears ago. Twenty years ago we did not have the very sophisticated \nsystem we have set up today which allowed people to exchange \ninformation about organ donors. Twenty years ago it was catch as catch \ncan. Twenty years ago, if a donor became available, it was just almost \naccidental that you found out if there was a donor of a particular \norgan. And when it involved an infant, like a 6-month-old infant, you \nnot only had to match the blood type for a liver transplant, but the \nliver had to be the exact size in order to successfully transplant. You \ncan see the difficulty. You can see this child lie dying, with only \nhours to live.\n  The preparation had been made for the jet airplane to fly the child \nto the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center where all the surgeons \nwere standing by. They kept waiting and waiting for a donor. No donor \nwas produced because we did not know when any became available. There \nwas not an exchange of information.\n  So at my home in Melbourne, on a weekend, the call from the President \nof the United States came. He said: Bill, this is President Reagan. We \nare going to have a close vote and I need your vote. I said: Mr. \nPresident, I have already decided that I am voting with you. Now there \nis something that I would like to ask you, to help in the saving of the \nlife of a child. I told him the story, and he said he would have \nMargaret Heckler, the Secretary of HHS, call me the next day and get \nthe particulars, which he did.\n\n  Margaret Heckler immediately held a press conference, and because of \nthat press conference, within 3 days, a tragic death of a child on the \nwest coast of the United States that we would have never known about \nwas known, and the parents donated the child's liver, which was of the \nsame blood type and the same size. That liver was packaged and cooled \nand flown to Pittsburgh, arriving at the same time Ryan Osterblom \narrived, as they wheeled him into surgery.\n  Mr. President, as you can see, I have a catch in my voice because \nthat little boy is going to college this year. He wants to be a \nsurgeon. After that successful transplant, the President had called the \nmother, Karen Osterblom, and for years he continued to correspond with \nthem.\n  It is going to be my pleasure to have the family come up here on \nThursday as the President is lying in state and have them walk through \nthe line in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol to show their respects to \nPresident Reagan.\n\n[[Page S6619]]\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we have heard so many stories about a \ngreat man, the Gipper, and none of them are surprising because he was \nalways such a gentle person. I have to share with you that I had the \nhonor, about a month ago, of giving the commencement address at Oral \nRoberts University. When I did, I used a lot of the 1964 speech ``A \nRendezvous With Destiny.'' I said it should be required reading for \nanyone to graduate at any level in America to read ``A Rendezvous With \nDestiny.'' It is a speech that changed my life. Ronald Reagan gave it \nin 1964. I remember I almost memorized that speech. In fact, I still \nhave most of it memorized. As a result of that, the next year I \ndecided, well, if he did it, if he really feels this concerned, I \nshould, too, and I went and filed for office and ran for the State \nlegislature. So that is how I happened to get started.\n  But that is not as far back as we go. I believe I have had the honor \nof knowing Ronald Reagan longer than any other Member of this U.S. \nSenate. In fact, I am sure that is true. Even though I represent the \nState of Oklahoma, I moved to the State of Oklahoma when I was 8 years \nold. I moved from Des Moines, IA. We were enjoying the poverty of the \nDepression at that time. Everyone was poor, not just us.\n  My dad was an insurance adjuster. Ronald Reagan was a sports \nannouncer for WHO Radio in Des Moines, IA, and they shared the same \noffice. They became very close friends, and they used to play the \npinball machine at that time. You guys would not know what that is. I \nguess they don't have those anymore. On Saturdays they would play cards \nfor a couple hours. All I know is, it was a room above the drugstore.\n\n  But the man I had seen occasionally at that time I thought of as a \ngiant. He was a very large person. We were not all that large. I \nremember that when I was growing up.\n  Well, we moved to Tulsa, OK, shortly after that. But we did not lose \ncontact. As the years went by, Ronald Reagan, who my dad affectionately \nreferred to as ``Dutch,'' ``Dutch Reagan''--every time there was a \n``Dutch'' Reagan movie we would see it. You see, we never went to \nmovies. In those days, we just didn't go to movies except when there \nwas a ``Dutch'' Reagan movie. It did not matter what it was conflicting \nwith.\n  One time we went to Durant, OK, in the southern part of Oklahoma. My \nhome was in the northern part. I remember driving on those roads at \nthat time. I say to my good friend from Minnesota, the roads were--if \nyou could average 30 miles an hour, you were doing well. So we drove 5 \nhours down, watched a ``Dutch'' Reagan movie, and drove 5 hours back. \nWe never would consider missing a ``Dutch'' Reagan movie.\n  Then, of course, the famous speech took place in 1964. That is when \nhe expressed his interest in politics. But at that time my father had \ngotten to where he was much better off, our family was. So when \n``Dutch'' Reagan was going to run for Governor of California, my father \nbecame one of his first large contributors. Again, the friendship had \nnever stopped at any point. So he won.\n  At the time, after he served in that capacity and ran for President--\nI know that the Presiding Officer right now knows what I am talking \nabout because he and I were both mayors of major cities back at the \nsame time in 1980 when Ronald Reagan was elected President. I was the \nmayor of Tulsa, OK, for 4 years. Ronald Reagan and I were closer \ntogether than we had ever been before--I was out in Oklahoma--because \nhe had me do his domestic policy stuff. He would have me on TV. At that \ntime, they did not have CNN and Fox, but they had ``Good Morning \nAmerica'' and the ``Today'' show. So I would be debating all these \nliberal Democrat mayors on the Reagan policy, which was the dynamics of \nthe free enterprise system as opposed to the Government doing \neverything, and they worked beautifully. So I am sure I spent 10 times \nas much time with him at that time than I do with George W. today, and \nI am here in Washington. But it was a real pleasure.\n  Those of us present--and right now I see in the Chamber the Senator \nfrom Minnesota, Mr. Norm Coleman, and the Senator who is presiding, Mr. \nVoinovich--all three of us were mayors. We understand what a hard job \nit is. When I was mayor, I was able to build a low-water dam, and \nPresident Reagan referred to it in his speeches as the largest totally \nprivately funded public project in America. That was the dynamics of \nRonald Reagan. That is what he thought, that Government should be doing \nless, people doing more. And it worked.\n  What a visionary the guy was. When I see things that are going on \ntoday and I remember things that he said many, many years ago--right \nnow, we have a serious problem in America. Probably one of our most \nserious problems is we do not have an energy policy. So we make \nspeeches. All of us make speeches on a regular basis about why we do \nnot have an energy policy and why we should have one. I would like to \nread to you what Ronald Reagan said. This was in 1979. Listen carefully \nbecause this applies to today, but it was 1979:\n\n       Solving the energy crisis will not be easy, but it can be \n     done. First we must decide that ``less'' is not enough. Next, \n     we must remove government obstacles to energy production. And \n     we must make use of those technological advantages we still \n     possess.\n       It is no program simply to say ``use less energy.''\n\n  Sound familiar?\n\n       Of course waste must be eliminated and efficiency promoted, \n     but for the government simply to tell the people to conserve \n     is not an energy policy. At best it means we will run out of \n     energy a little more slowly. But a day will come when the \n     lights will dim and the wheels of industry will turn more \n     slowly and finally stop.\n       The answer obvious to anyone except those in the \n     administration it seems, is more domestic production of oil \n     and gas. We must also have wider use of nuclear power within \n     strict safety rules, of course. There must be more spending \n     by the energy industries on research and development of \n     substitutes for fossil fuels.\n\n  And on and on and on. That speech very well could have been made \ntoday because the problem still exists today. And he knew it was \ncoming.\n  When he talked about the SDI, the Strategic Defense Initiative, that \nwas something no one seemed to care about. They did not see there was \nany great risk facing the American people. Yet he saw that risk. The \nrisk was there. We all know now the risk is very real, even today. So \nhe looked back at the ABM treaty that was put in place in 1972.\n  He said: This is senseless now. It may have made sense in 1972 when \nHenry Kissinger and Richard Nixon put this in, but the policy of mutual \nassured destruction is not a good policy. So he said: What we will have \nto do is have a very strong country. And he was quite scriptural. He \nquoted from Luke: If a strong man shall keep his court well guarded, he \nshall live in peace. And that is exactly what he was doing in his \nrebuilding of the defense system of America. We are so thankful he did \nthat in those days. But he was saying we must do away with the ABM \ntreaty. Finally, after all this time, we recognized 2 years ago he was \nright, and we got rid of the ABM treaty--how prophetic.\n  Tax cuts, this is something that he gave credit to his predecessors. \nHe said: We do need more money. The best way to get more revenue for \nGovernment is to reduce tax rates. He said: That is what President \nKennedy did 25 years ago. He said: He reduced tax rates. And keep in \nmind, that was a Democratic President. And by reducing tax rates, he \nalmost doubled the revenue coming in at the end of his term. It gave \npeople the freedom and money to invest and to breathe and to reinvest \nin the country. So that is the problem. That is what this President \nGeorge W. Bush has been trying to do. That is the reason we are out of \nthe recession he inherited, and we are now coming out because we have \nreduced some of those marginal rates. We know we need to do more. This \nis what the President did.\n  If you remember, in 1980, the total amount of revenue that was \ngenerated from marginal rates, taxes paid by people, was $244 billion. \nIn 1990, it was $446 billion. It almost doubled in that 10-year period. \nYet that 10-year period was the period where we had the largest \nreduction in taxes, thanks to Ronald Reagan, of any 10-year period or \n8-year period in our Nation's history: marginal rates going down from \n70 percent to 28 percent. Yet it had the effect of doubling the \nrevenues. This guy\n\n[[Page S6620]]\n\nknew it, and he did it. That is good advice for us today.\n  I have mentioned quite often that it should have been required \nreading for all of our graduates to read ``Rendezvous With Destiny.'' \nLet me read a couple things to remind us on this very solemn occasion \nhow grateful we are now to have had a President who was so prophetic.\n  In talking about the freedom of our country, he told a story about \nCastro and how a Cuban had escaped Cuba in a small craft and had \nfloated over to the south shores of Florida. As his small craft came up \nthere was a lady there, and he told the lady about the atrocities of \nCastro's Communist Cuba. After he was through, she said: I guess we \ndon't know how lucky we are in the United States.\n  He said: How lucky you are? We are the ones who are lucky. We had a \nplace to escape to.\n  That is what Ronald Reagan said, that we would be the beacon of \nfreedom, the last place in the world to escape to. If we lose it here, \nthere is nowhere else to escape to.\n  On the recognition of the dynamics of the free enterprise system, he \nsaid:\n\n       They also knew, those Founding Fathers, that outside of its \n     legitimate functions, government does nothing as well or as \n     economically as the private sector of the economy.\n\n  He practiced that. It worked. His domestic policies worked.\n  He was prophetic. He accurately described such things as:\n\n       We have so many people who can't see a fat man standing \n     beside a thin one without coming to the conclusion that the \n     fat man got that way by taking advantage of the thin one.\n\n  Ronald Reagan talked about bureaucracy, how difficult it would be for \nhim to cut down the size of Government. He is the one who said, in that \nvery famous speech in 1964, there is nothing closer to life eternal on \nthe face of this Earth than a Government agency once formed. And he \nwent on to explain the reason for it. The reason for it is very simple. \nOnce a Government agency is formed to respond to a problem, the problem \ngoes away, and the bureaucracy stays there. The longer they stay there \nwith nothing to do, the stronger they become. So that happens. He was \nable to cut that down by reminding people that that problem did exist.\n  He said in 1964:\n\n       Let's set the record straight. There is no argument over \n     the choice between peace and war, but there is only one \n     guaranteed way that you can have peace--and you can have it \n     in the next second--surrender.\n\n  That was the message he had. You had to be strong. You had to have a \nNation that believes in God, and you had to stand up for those things \nand not lie down and surrender. That is what people were trying to do \nat that time.\n  He said in that speech:\n\n       There is a price we will not pay. There is a point beyond \n     which they must not advance.\n\n  That was his rendezvous with destiny.\n  I look at American heroes like the senior Senator from Hawaii who \nfought so valiantly and is very familiar with what this President did \nfor our U.S. military.\n  I will say this: The rendezvous with destiny was a very real one. \nMilitary historians have looked at us and said there is no way we could \nhave won the Revolutionary War. Here we were, a handful of farmers and \ntrappers with crude weapons and the greatest army on the face of the \nearth was marching toward Lexington and Concord, and they fired the \nshot heard round the world.\n  As Ronald Reagan would reflect on that great speech by Patrick Henry, \nhe said there are three sentences in that speech that answer the \nquestions of military historians, but people have forgotten about it. \nWe are not weak when we make the proper use of those means which the \nGod of nature has placed in our power. Armed in the holy cause of \nliberty in such a country as that which we possess, we are invincible \nby any force our enemy will send against us. And besides, we will not \nfight our battles alone. There is a just God who reigns over the \ndestiny of nations who will raise up friends to fight our battles with \nus.\n  Those are the favorite three sentences out of the ``give me liberty, \ngive me death'' speech Patrick Henry made.\n  For me, I think about the honor to be able to stand here in the \nSenate and, on behalf of the American people and on behalf of my wife \nand myself and our family of 20 children and grandchildren, to say we \nthank Ronald Reagan for his sacrifices. We thank God for Ronald Reagan. \nWe thank God for his life. We thank God for allowing us to share that \nrendezvous with destiny with Ronald Reagan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I share that sense of humility that has \nbeen so eloquently expressed by my friend from Oklahoma, to be able to \nstand on this Senate floor and to thank God for Ronald Reagan, for what \nhe gave us and what we learned from him. I must admit to being a bit \nenvious to be in the Chamber with my friend from Oklahoma who knew \nRonald Reagan when he was a young man.\n  My friend, the Presiding Officer, on the way to the Chamber--again, \nwe were all fellow mayors--talked about when he was mayor of Cleveland. \nThere were some difficult times, and he talked to the President. He \ntalked about what a good man the President was. What a good man, that \nhe really cared, that he listened, and that he wanted to do things, \nwanted to make a difference. Sometimes when those around him were not \nmaking a difference, he took care of it and got it done. I think my \ncolleagues were part of history being made.\n  I was able to watch history during that time. But I am honored and \nhumbled to be here today. To those of us who grew up in the Midwest and \nfor those like myself who made it our home, Ronald Reagan has a very \nspecial significance. Places like Dixon, IL have been dubbed fly-over \nzones by sophisticated, powerful people who live on the coast. But we \nknow places like that are the heartland, strong, simple, and true. That \nwas Ronald Reagan.\n  What we love about the Midwest is what America and the world came to \nknow and understand and love about Ronald Reagan.\n  To go on and on in flowery rhetoric about Ronald Reagan would not fit \nthe subject matter. Like he did so well, his life deserves a few well-\nchosen words.\n  Oscar Wilde once said:\n\n       Life is not complex. We are complex. Life is simple and the \n     simple thing is the right thing.\n\n  Ronald Reagan could have said that because, surely, he lived it.\n  Democracy is superior to communism. America is the world's best hope. \nLiberty requires limited government. The best is yet to come. Those \nwere Ronald Reagan's moral anchors from the start of his public life to \nthe end. Without deviation, they shaped his outlook and actions for \nhalf a century.\n  He certainly didn't originate any of them, but we all know they are \nfar more prominent in the fabric of American life today because of the \npower of his witness, as he lived his life, the power of what he did \nwith those moral anchors as part of him.\n  In the last few days, we are hearing a lot about Reagan as the Great \nCommunicator. I think we put too much emphasis on the craft. As far as \nRonald Reagan was concerned, the key to being a good communicator was \nhaving something to say. He was the message he delivered, and so he \ntouched hearts and changed minds.\n  He understood the key to American progress was our spirit. Resources, \nwealth, and past accomplishments have ruined more people and nations \nthan they have made. He knew we needed a sense of the heroic, a \nstirring of our souls to rise above selfishness, division, and fear. He \ninspired us.\n  He restored our confidence in the idea of leadership. Vietnam, \nWatergate, inflation, gas lines, and the hostage crisis were causing \nmany to wonder if the American hour had passed. Not Ronald Reagan. He \nstubbornly held onto a wonderful vision of the future rather than focus \non temporary negative circumstances. He led us.\n  And perhaps of greatest importance, by his own choice, Ronald Reagan \nwas not the star of our dramatic national resurgence. Neither was \nGovernment. In Reagan's mind and words, the heroes who restored the \nAmerican economy and won the cold war were ordinary Americans doing \nsimple things, doing their duty--kind of like a national bond raising. \nHe united us.\n  Mr. President, I also grew up as a Democrat. President Reagan deeply \ninspired me, and he had a lot to do with\n\n[[Page S6621]]\n\nthe fact that I am standing on this side of the aisle today. He \ninspired me with ideas, such as if you want to grow an economy, you cut \ntaxes and put money in people's pockets; they will spend it on a \nproduct or service, and there is a job connected to that. He understood \nthat. He showed the power of it. I understood that. It wasn't just \nabout policy, it was about optimism.\n  When I ran for mayor in St. Paul in 1993, my slogan was ``St. Paul's \nbest days are yet to come.'' When I switched parties in 1996, Jack Kemp \ncame over to my house, and I made the announcement. It was that spirit \nof hope, optimism, entrepreneurship, and opportunity that he showed \nworked. That was the key, by the way. For him, it was not about \npolitics; it was about results.\n  My friend from Oklahoma quoted President Reagan saying that solving \nthe energy crisis wasn't easy, but that it can be done. He understood \nthe importance of getting it done.\n  I think Ronald Reagan would be honored to know we are shutting down \nthe Federal Government on Friday. His only concern might be that we are \nstarting it again on Monday. He changed us and transformed the world, \nwithout a doubt. Some days, Mr. President, I get concerned that we are \nchanging back.\n  As we remember his life, I hope we all remember that the simple \nthings are the right things: Freedom, hope, liberty, and optimism.\n  I thank God that he gave us Ronald Reagan when we needed him most. \nNow, this is our time. I pray that we will courageously follow his \nexample and embrace America's destiny in this challenging hour.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the strength of Abraham Lincoln's resolve \nto restore the Union, whatever the terrible cost to do so, was his \nunshakeable faith that in America any father's child could come to \noccupy the same place that his father's child had attained. That \nuniquely American conviction also inspired Ronald Reagan to reach his \ngreat place in our country's history and in the hearts of his \ncountrymen. I doubt Ronald Reagan was much surprised to become \nPresident, despite his humble origins. And I know for certain he never \ntook for granted a single day he occupied the office. He believed such \nan honored privilege was within the reach of any American with \nprinciples, industry and talent, and that once attained, it was to be \nheld with great care to preserve for succeeding generations the \nblessings of liberty that had so enriched his own life. His patriotism, \nwhich he expressed eloquently and often in his public remarks, was \nnever affected. He believed every word. Nor was his unfailing good \nhumor and optimism an actor's performance. He lived in a shining city \non a hill, and he never forgot it.\n  I first met President Reagan and his lovely wife, Nancy, not long \nafter I returned from Vietnam. But I knew of him in the years before I \nregained my liberty, when my fellow prisoners-of-war and I would \ndiscuss in tap codes and whispered conversations the Governor of \nCalifornia who was giving such eloquent voice to the convictions we \nbelieved we had been sent to war to advance. In the more than 30 years \nthat have passed since I first met him, I have never lived a day that I \nwasn't grateful for the privilege of the Reagans' friendship, and the \nstrength of his faith in America that inspired my own, and so many \nothers.\n  His accomplishments in office were historic, and will be long \nremembered as will the humility, grace and decency with which he \nachieved them. It was an honor to have known him, and Cindy and I shall \nmiss him very much. We offer our sincerest condolences to Nancy, and to \nMichael, Patti and Ron, and pray that God grants this good man eternal \nlife, reunites him with his daughter, Maureen, and with all his loved \nones who have preceded him.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, at a luncheon with Bernard Baruch, Mr. \nBaruch commented that Harry Truman ``had a good memory'' and ``he also \nhad a good bad memory.'' We are hearing both at the passing of former \nPresident Ronald Reagan. There is no question that if a President is to \nbe credited for the end of the Cold War that credit should go to Ronald \nReagan. We were anxious about the depletion of our defenses in the U.S. \nSenate in the year preceding President Reagan's administration so we \npassed a 5 percent across-the-board increase in the Defense budget. But \nPresident Reagan came on board and really moved to strengthen our \ndefenses, building a 600-ship Navy and not hesitating to deploy \nintermediate missiles in Europe. He also moved to formalize our \nballistic missile defense system, calling it the Strategic Defense \nInitiative and increasing its support. President Reagan can also be \ncredited with a competitive trade policy. Though he had the power to \nrescind the anti-dumping order on the importation of motorcycles, he \nlet the order stand; reviving as we all know the Harley Davidson \nindustry. Moreover, he imposed voluntary restraint agreements in steel, \nsemiconductors, machine tools and automobiles. There is no question, \nfor example, that Intel would have had a hard time surviving had it not \nbeen for Sematech and Reagan's VRA on semiconductors.\n  But at this time of praise, those with ``good bad memory'' forget it \nwas Ronald Reagan who started supply side economics. Former Senator Bob \nDole led the opposition to its forerunner, Kemp-Roth, and former \nPresident George Herbert Walker Bush characterized this cutting \nrevenues to increase them as ``voodoo.'' With Reagan looking for an \nissue at a low point in his administration, he locked onto supply side, \nignoring his campaign pledge to ``balance the budget within one year.'' \nIt is good to note that in this country after 200 years existence, with \nthe cost of all the wars from the Revolution up to the War in Vietnam, \nthe national debt stood at less than $1 trillion. Reagan's supply side \nor ``voodoo'' gave us the first trillion dollar debt and he left office \nhaving increased the national debt $1.7 trillion. Under Bush 41, in 4 \nyears the debt increased $1.4 trillion. President Clinton over 8 years \nslowed the increase of the debt to $1.6 trillion with spending cuts and \ntax increases, leaving a projected surplus. President George W. Bush, \nwith three tax cuts or Reagan ``voodoos,'' has eliminated the surplus \nand increased the debt over $2 trillion in 4 years. As his chief \ncounselor Vice President Cheney said, ``Deficits don't matter.'' Since \nthe beginning days, this country has shown sacrifice at a time of war \nby adopting a tax measure to pay for the war. But not for the War on \nTerrorism. We in the Congress need a fourth tax cut, voodoo, to get \nreelected. Today the GI fighting the war is also going to have to pay \nfor the war. At this time of remembrance, let's not forget that Reagan \ndignified ``voodoo.''\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, on Saturday, our Nation lost a strong \nleader and the State of California lost an adopted son.\n  As a citizen, Ronald Wilson Reagan embodied the American dream. He \npersonified the image of California--can-do, risk-taking, cutting-edge. \nRonald Reagan was all of those things.\n  As a President, he unified a country and helped bring an end to the \ncold war, the premier struggle of his time in public life.\n  My fondest memory of President Reagan took place while I was mayor of \nSan Francisco at a March 1983 dinner the President and First Lady \nhosted for Queen Elizabeth II in San Francisco. The Queen was thrilled \nto visit California for the first time and especially pleased to be \nwelcomed by a President from California.\n  During that trip the Queen quipped at one point that she knew England \nhad exported many traditions to the United States, but she hadn't \nrealized the weather was one of them.\n  San Francisco's London-like weather aside, as Mayor I was enormously \nproud of the wonderful welcome we had provided for the Queen of \nEngland.\n  Growing up in small-town central Illinois in the years leading up to \nthe Great Depression, President Reagan was instilled with the values \nthat would guide him as a person and as a leader. There he learned the \nimportance of hard work and optimism as the key ingredients for \nsuccess.\n  It was this optimism combined with his ever-present sense of humor \nthat characterized him best, enabling him to both ``fill the screen'' \nand make a stellar entrance wherever he went.\n  After 4 years at Eureka College, where he was known as a gritty, \nthough undersized tackle on the football team, he began searching for a \njob in broadcasting. In 1932, at the height\n\n[[Page S6622]]\n\nof the Depression, he headed into the job market confident that a job \nwould be his soon.\n  After several years as a broadcaster covering University of Iowa \nfootball games and later recreating Chicago Cubs' games based on \ntelegraph reports, a young Ronald Reagan traveled to California to \ncover the Cubs' spring training.\n  It was his first trip west of Kansas City and it nurtured his \nfascination with Hollywood. While he was there, he used his \nconsiderable charm to convince a movie agent to arrange a screen test \nfor him at Warner Brothers Studios.\n  Before long, he returned to the Midwest, packed his bags and started \nthe quintessential American journey westward in search of opportunity. \nOf course, he found it as a movie star.\n  He won many fans through his on-screen charisma. The optimism he \ninspired was exemplified by his role as Notre Dame football player \nGeorge Gipp in the film ``Knute Rockne--All-American.'' Years after \nGipp's death, Coach Rockne gave a pep talk to his team urging them to \n``win one for the Gipper'' one of the more memorable lines in American \nsports history.\n  But President Reagan's greatest impact on the world was as a \npolitician. As a labor leader with the Screen Actors Guild, his roots \nas an activist were shaped significantly by a deep concern about \ncommunism.\n  Yet despite his strongly anti-communist views, he condemned the \nunfair smearing of many liberals by Senator Joseph McCarthy and the \nHouse Un-American Activities Committee. He refused to reveal names \npublicly, but exposed some people to the FBI privately.\n  As Governor of California he had a strong record of environmental \nprotection: adding 145,000 acres to the State's park system, protecting \nLake Tahoe from rampant development, blocking the construction of dams \non the Dos Rios and Eel rivers, and stopping the paving of a federal \nhighway through the Sierra Nevada Mountains that would have cut through \nthe John Muir Trail.\n  He also signed legislation to protect rivers on California's north \ncoast and approved strict car emissions standards that forced the \nNation's automakers to manufacture cleaner-burning cars. But he lobbied \nagainst the Coastal Protection Act approved by voters in 1972 and \nresisted air pollution controls imposed by the federal government.\n  Despite his personal opposition to abortion, Governor Reagan loosened \nan 1872 statute to allow abortion in cases of rape, incest, when a \nmother's health was at stake, or when there was a high risk that a baby \nwould be born with birth defects. Many States followed Governor \nReagan's lead on this important issue.\n  However, his move to close down mental health facilities in \nCalifornia resulted in widespread homelessness in urban areas. Though \nhe sought to steer the mentally ill into community-based mental health \nfacilities the end result was a spike in homelessness, a problem that \nwe continue to deal with to this day.\n  While in Sacramento, he generally approached fiscal policy as a \nmoderate, first presiding over a $1-billion tax increase to balance the \nState budget and another subsequent increase. He eventually lowered \ntaxes, but in his two terms as Governor, State spending doubled overall \nand the State's workforce grew by 34,000.\n  As President, he was a unifier and an optimist. His infectious, \nupbeat attitude rallied people to his goals. He was extremely \nsuccessful in passing legislation by joining that optimism with a \nwillingness to compromise with a Democratic Congress.\n  In his dealings, he was tough, but ready to negotiate. There is no \nbetter example of this than his relationship with former Soviet leader \nMikhail Gorbachev. He often used harsh rhetoric in challenging the \nactions of our cold war adversary, but it was always backed by his core \nbeliefs.\n  Once, as he prepared for his first summit with the Soviet leader, he \nmet with a room full of foreign policy advisors, each offering their \nsuggestions about what he should say. After a half-hour of discussion, \nPresident Reagan turned to his advisors and said, ``Gentlemen, I've \nbeen thinking about what I'm going to say to this man my whole life. \nAnd I know exactly what I'm going to say.''\n  Gorbachev described Reagan as ``a great President, with whom the \nSoviet leadership was able to launch a very difficult but important \ndialogue.''\n  His tough negotiating stance yielded some important accomplishments \nincluding signing treaties reducing intermediate-range nuclear missiles \nand limiting strategic arms. These acts of diplomacy combined with his \nrelentless advocacy for freedom played a major role in bringing about \nan end to the cold war.\n  At the same time, Reagan had a tendency to overreach in the area of \nforeign policy. The invasion of Grenada, the intervention in Lebanon \nthat left American soldiers uncertain of their role and vulnerable to \nattack, and, above all, the Iran-Contra scandal--were all cases in \nwhich the Reagan Administration went too far in seeking to reshape the \nworld.\n  At home, President Reagan sought to limit the size of government and \ntap the entrepreneurial spirit of the American people. And though he \nwas famous for cutting taxes, he approved two tax increases during his \nfirst term in the White House.\n  Unfortunately, the tax cuts were coupled with sharp increases in \ndefense spending that resulted in massive deficits. The Federal budget \nfinally recovered from those years of deficit-spending during the late \n1990s, but the surpluses that were generated disappeared in the blink \nof an eye under the current administration's fiscal policies.\n  President Reagan's cuts to public housing, job training, and the \nbroader social safety net were another serious blow domestically. And, \nas cities and mayors across the country were reeling from the advent of \nAIDS--no place suffered more than San Francisco--President Reagan \nfailed to act. He would not even publicly comment on the AIDS crisis.\n  Though people did not always agree with his policies, it cannot be \ndenied that President Reagan redefined politics through his tremendous \nskills as a communicator. In particular, his ability to define clear \ngoals and persuade others to support those goals earned him the \nadmiration of many Americans.\n  As we all know, President Reagan suffered from Alzheimer's Disease \nduring the last decade of his life.\n  As we honor his memory in the days and weeks to come, it is my hope \nthat we will consider what we can do here in Congress to battle this \nterrible disease.\n  A good first step would be to approve legislation that supports \nembryonic stem cell research. This research offers tremendous hope, not \nonly to those who suffer from Alzheimer's, but also the millions of \npeople with cancer, diabetes, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis and \nspinal cord injuries. What a fitting tribute passage of this bill would \nbe to President Reagan.\n  In closing, there probably is no American who has more fully lived \nthe American dream from actor to Governor to President than Ronald \nReagan. Today, we mourn his loss, but recognize that his was a full \nlife.\n  Thank you for your service to this country, President Reagan.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I pay my respects to a beloved \nleader who, with grace, wit, and charisma, led our country through some \nof the great challenges of the twentieth century. President Ronald \nWilson Reagan was a dedicated public servant whose confidence and \noptimism reinvigorated the American people and made him one of the most \nhonored and respected Presidents in our Nation's history.\n  Although he lived most of his life in California, President Reagan \nwas a fellow Midwesterner. Born in 1911 in Tampico, IL, Ronald Wilson \nReagan attended high school in nearby Dixon and worked his way through \nEureka College. There he earned his B.A., played on the football team, \nand participated in school plays. He eventually won a contract in \nHollywood and appeared in 53 films over two decades.\n  The father of four children became increasingly involved in politics \nand in 1966 was elected the governor of California, and was reelected \nin 1970. His optimistic message, at a time when the country was beset \nby inflation and by the taking of American hostages in Iran, helped him \nto win the presidency in 1980. Four years later, he was reelected in a \n49-state sweep.\n  In foreign affairs, it is impossible to separate President Reagan's \nlegacy\n\n[[Page S6623]]\n\nfrom the astounding change in world affairs that began while he was in \noffice: the collapse of the U.S.S.R. and the end of the Cold War. \nPresident Reagan spoke frankly and frequently about the bankruptcy--\nboth moral and economic--of the Soviet regime. His words and actions \nenergized dissidents and activists struggling for change and for \njustice in the face of Communist repression and tyranny. His optimism \nhelped to give them confidence that they were, indeed, on the right \nside of history.\n  President Reagan not only recognized the monstrous nature of \nCommunist totalitarianism, but he also understood the horror of a \ngeopolitical reality that made the entire world hostage to the threat \nof nuclear annihilation. He had the courage to act, to reach out to the \nSoviet leadership and to craft landmark arms control agreements, \nincluding one that, for the first time, eliminated a class of nuclear \nweapons.\n  On the domestic front, it was under the leadership of President \nReagan that the solvency of the Social Security program was extended \nthrough reforms to the existing program. Although modest in their \noverall scope, those reforms were seen by many as politically risky, \nand President Reagan provided critical leadership that helped assure \nboth a reluctant Congress and an uncertain public. Today, we should \nbuild on the Reagan reforms, and strengthen the existing program, as he \ndid.\n  Another significant domestic policy challenge that President Reagan \ntackled was the simplification of our tax code. In the face of special \ninterest pressures, and under the leadership of his Secretary of \nTreasury, Donald Regan, as well as a bipartisan group of members of the \nHouse and Senate, President Reagan was able to push through the last \nsignificant reforms to our increasingly complex tax code in 1986.\n  At the time, I was the Chairman of the Taxation Committee in the \nWisconsin State Senate and we were holding a variety of hearings around \nthe State, addressing parallel reforms. These hearings and reforms were \ndriven by President Reagan's proposal. Though far from perfect, that \nreform effort is another model for action we need to undertake again. \nAnd policymakers in Congress and the executive branch would do well to \nfollow President Reagan's example in this matter.\n  Of course, no review of President Reagan's legacy would be complete \nwithout acknowledging his Alzheimer's disease which, sadly, defined the \nlast 10 years of his life as well as the lives of his family. As the \nauthor of Wisconsin's Alzheimer's program, I have become all too aware \nof the heartbreaking tragedy that this dread disease brings to a \nfamily.\n  President Reagan's brave, public acknowledgment of the disease, and \nthe wonderful efforts of his wife Nancy, have done a great deal to \neducate the country about this horrible affliction. They have also \nhelped to spur government investment in the research needed to find a \ncure, and to raise awareness of the need for long-term care services \nfor those suffering from Alzheimer's.\n  President Ronald Wilson Reagan helped to transform America and the \nworld. He and his achievements will forever be honored and remembered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, the Capitol today is overflowing with \nvisitors, flags stand at half-staff, and the Nation has collectively \nstopped this week--all to honor a remarkable man who accomplished \nremarkable things during a remarkable time.\n  President Ronald Reagan gave his life to public service and has left \na legacy of leadership that will always be remembered.\n  We remember President Reagan's strong vision for political and \neconomic freedom which was instrumental in the fall of communism and \nthe spread of democracy in Eastern Europe. The world held its breath as \nAmerica stared communism in the face, but in the end we peacefully won \nover the respect and cooperation of our enemy. Less than a year after \nReagan left office, Mr. Gorbachev stepped down, the Berlin Wall fell \nand the cold war ended.\n  I will never forget President Reagan's historic speech on June 12, \n1987, in front of the Brandenburg Gate near the Berlin Wall when he \ncalled on Mikhail Gorbachev to ``Open this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, tear \ndown this wall.''\n  Today, the United States is working with Russia to replace tyranny \nand fear in Iraq with peace and stability.\n  Of President Reagan, Gorbachev said, ``A true leader, a man of his \nword and an optimist, he traveled the journey of his life with dignity \nand faced courageously the cruel disease that darkened his final years. \nHe has earned a place in history and in people's hearts.''\n  We also remember Dutch, the Great Communicator, the Gipper as a man \nof great optimism and humor. My kids' history books recall the dates \nand facts of this time, but they do not convey this Hollywood actor \nturned President's good-natured spirit or genuine optimism for a better \ntomorrow. Nor can they express his unyielding dedication and love for \nour country. However, I believe the outpouring of respect and affection \nshown by the American public this week says we will forever remember \nhis character and personality.\n  Finally, we remember a man who never stopped believing, never stopped \nadvocating America's ability to succeed and prosper. He stuck to his \nconvictions and his visions for America, whether popular or not.\n  Ronald Reagan's initiatives didn't please all Americans and Democrats \nand Republicans did not always agree on President Reagan's foreign \npolicy or domestic agenda, but he never encouraged or played the biting \npartisan games that exist today. Even with those people whom he had \ngenuine ideological differences, President Reagan always showed a level \nof respect and acknowledged that we are all Americans and we are in \nthis together.\n  Years ago, President Reagan and Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill used \nto joke that, ``between 9 and 5 we are enemies, but at 5 o'clock let's \ngo have a cocktail together.'' To truly honor and remember President \nReagan--this man of great accomplishment, optimism, and oratory--\nperhaps we could find ways to work better together for a better \ntomorrow.\n  I extend my deepest sympathies to the Reagan family in their time of \nsorrow, and I hope it is of some comfort that Americans and many others \nthroughout the world mourn by their side.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/08/senate-section/article/S6623-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6623-S6624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GEORGE TENET\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, we all learned recently that an \noutstanding public servant, the Director of Central Intelligence, \nGeorge Tenet, has decided to step down. I am personally saddened by \nthis announcement because I believe the country has been well served by \nMr. Tenet.\n  George Tenet started his career in public service as part of the \nSenate family working for the late Republican Senator John Heinz. He \nserved on the professional staff of the Senate Intelligence Committee \nrising to become the committee staff director for my good friend \nSenator David Boren.\n  I was the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee \nduring that period. Our committee works closely with the Intelligence \nCommittee in determining the funding for our classified programs. So I \nbelieve I can speak with some authority in saying that George was a \ntop-notch staff director. And, I believe his tenure in the Senate \nprepared him well for the position of Director of Central Intelligence.\n  I have known every CIA Director since Allen Dulles. I have worked \nclosely with each Director for the past 30 years. All of them have been \nhonorable men, well-meaning and decent public servants, but none was a \nbetter Director of Central Intelligence than George Tenet.\n  Intelligence is a critical part of our national security. Obviously \nit does not get the public scrutiny that most Government functions \nreceive. To do so would jeopardize the lives of countless agents and \nanalysts who serve this Nation. We limit the number of people\n\n[[Page S6624]]\n\nwho receive sensitive information to lessen the chance that it will be \ninadvertently disclosed and harm our national security. As such, much \nof the good news in intelligence is never brought to light.\n  When the CIA breaks up a terrorist cell in Albania or Egypt it cannot \nbe disclosed. When critical information is discovered by our \nintelligence community about weapons trafficking on the high seas, the \nweapons can be confiscated, but the American people are not told.\n  Unfortunately, only the operations that fail become public. So our \nCIA Directors are generally not known for their successes, only for \ntheir failures.\n  It is an historical fact that there has been great temptation to use \nintelligence operations and analysis to achieve political objectives.\n  As most of my colleagues know, the Senate established the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence in the mid-1970s to review intelligence \nactivities in response to improprieties which occurred in the 1960s and \n1970s. During that period, I was fortunate to serve as the first \nChairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n  There have been other unfortunate incidents when individuals in the \nexecutive branch have circumvented the law to further their objectives. \nWe all remember the Iran-contra scandal when rogue elements ran an \nextra legal operation out of the White House.\n  Some have suggested that intelligence was recently politicized to \njustify the war on Iraq.\n  It is my view, and I think history will one day prove that any \npolitization of intelligence that might have occurred on Iraq did not \ncome from George Tenet.\n  Those who are charged with oversight of intelligence for the Congress \nhave a difficult task. We must review intelligence activities and \npractices, but the universe is truly enormous. There are not enough \nhours of the day for us to know all the details of intelligence. We \ncould never amass enough staff to monitor every action of the \nintelligence community. Therefore, we need to be able to trust our \nintelligence leaders.\n  The Senate could trust George Tenet to tell the truth and be \nforthright with this institution. Perhaps it was because of his \nbackground as a Senate staff member, but George was always eager to \ninform and consult with the Senate to share important information \nregardless how sensitive it might have been.\n  My experience with the CIA has been that many past Directors were \nreluctant to provide detailed information to the Congress. Perhaps it \nwas the ingrained culture that protects secrets, or perhaps it was the \nlack of trust between the executive and legislative bodies, but for \nwhatever reason, they didn't want to tell the Congress any more than \nthey had to.\n  With George it was different. He would take time to explain \ncontroversial and highly classified issues in detail. At times he would \ndirect his associates in the community to be more forthright in their \nresponses when he felt they might be holding back.\n  George Tenet trusted the Congress with the Nation's secrets as \npartners in national security, not adversaries or impediments.\n  I know the Director has his critics, but they do not come from the \nDefense Subcommittee. I think I can speak for my chairman when I tell \nyou we both had the utmost confidence in George Tenet. And, no one in \nthe Senate or the House has spent more years overseeing the \nintelligence community than Ted and I.\n  George Tenet is depicted today by some as the Director of \nIntelligence who failed to stop the tragedy of 9/11 and criticized for \nthe description by author Bob Woodward that the case for weapons of \nmass destruction in Iraq was a ``slam dunk.'' Both of those miss the \npoint.\n  George Tenet should be remembered as one of the finest Directors in \nthe history of Central Intelligence. He should be remembered as the \nmost honest and forthright of any CIA Director. He should be thought of \nas the Director who took an agency from the cold war mentality and \nstarted to reshape it for the 21st century. I know he will be \nremembered by the thousands of CIA employees as a great leader who did \nhis very best to support them and the entire intelligence community.\n  I will remember him as a tremendous public servant who served \nhonorably, effectively and tirelessly.\n  Mr. President, someday when the records are declassified and the \nanalysis is completed, historians will likely remember George with \ngreat regard. It is my view that he should not have to wait. We should \nall thank him for his dedication to duty and his service to our \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/08/senate-section/article/S6624-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6624-S6625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        ELIMINATION OF THE 30-PATIENT LIMIT FOR GROUP PRACTICES\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, S. 1887, which the Senate adopted \nyesterday, ensures that all appropriately trained group practice \nphysicians may prescribe and dispense certain recently approved drugs \nfor the treatment of heroin addiction. It addresses the unintended \neffect of the Drug Addiction and Treatment Act of 2000, DATA, that \nhinders access to new treatments for thousands of individuals who seek \nsuch help.\n  When Congress passed DATA as Title XXXV of the Children's Health Act \nof 2000, Public Law 106-310, it allowed for the dispensing and \nprescribing of Schedule III drugs, like buprenorphine/naloxone, in an \noffice-based setting, for the treatment of heroin addiction. As a \nresult of DATA, access to drug addiction treatment is significantly \nexpanded; patients no longer are restricted to receiving treatment in a \nlarge clinic setting, but now may receive such care from specifically \ntrained physicians in an office-based setting.\n  DATA limits qualified individual physicians to treating no more than \n30 patients at a time. This same 30-patient limit applies to medical \ngroups as to individual physicians. For example, the physician members \nof the Duke University Medical School faculty practice plan may treat \nonly 30 patients at one time, even though they may have 10 individual \nphysicians trained and willing to treat patients and more than 30 \npatients would benefit from newly available treatment. The difficulties \nthat have arisen, including the dashed hopes for treatment of many, due \nto the patient limitation on group practices, are detailed in a May 30 \narticle in the Boston Globe, by Peter DeMarco. I would like to share a \nfew excerpts from that article with my Colleagues, as follows:\n\n       When buprenorphine became available as a treatment for \n     OxyContin and heroin addiction 18 months ago, many medical \n     professionals and addicts hailed it as a miracle drug, \n     bringing addicts back from the brink and helping them lead \n     normal lives when all else had failed. But for many addicts, \n     buprenorphine remains one of the hardest drugs to obtain. \n     Approved by the Federal Food and Drug Administration in 2002, \n     buprenorphine is an opiate like heroin or the painkiller \n     OxyContin. Unlike those drugs or methadone, the prescribed \n     drug it's meant to replace, buprenorphine doesn't cloud the \n     minds of patients, allowing them to work or study as if \n     they're not on any drug at all. Nearly all who take \n     buprenorphine, meanwhile, say they lose all physical cravings \n     for street drugs.\n       But a combination of federal limits on the distribution of \n     buprenorphine, and reluctance on the part of some physicians \n     to offer it to patients has kept thousands of opiate addicts \n     from receiving the drug in Massachusetts and across the \n     country. At the heart of the issue is federal legislation \n     passed in 2000--two years before the drug was approved by the \n     FDA--that restricts individual clinical practices from \n     treating more than 30 patients with buprenorphine at a time.\n       While many substance-abuse experts say the 30-patient \n     figure is too low for some practices, their main quarrel with \n     the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 is its failure to \n     differentiate single-physician practices, hospitals, and \n     health care organizations. For example, all the doctors who \n     work for Tufts Health Plan can treat a combined 30 patients--\n     the same total as can be seen by a physician practicing \n     alone.\n       Boston health officials, along with their counterparts in \n     the State and Federal governments, say the Federal \n     legislation erred on the side of caution, and needs to be \n     changed to allow wider access to buprenorphine.\n       Boston Medical Center's main practice has 200 or more \n     general internal-medicine doctors, and within that practice, \n     we can only treat 30 people. It's the craziest loophole,'' \n     said Colleen Labelle, nurse-manager of the hospital's Office-\n     Based Opioid Treatment Program. ``We get 20 calls a day from \n     across the state. People are begging, desperate to get \n     treated, who we can't treat.''\n       The Federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \n     Administration has begun an internal process to increase the \n     30-patient cap. But because any proposed change would be \n     subject to the public-review process, approval could take as \n     long as two years, said\n\n[[Page S6625]]\n\n     Nick Reuter, a senior public health analyst with the agency.\n\n  It clearly was not the intention of DATA that individuals seeking \ntreatment have less access to new medications simply because they \nreceive care from a physician practicing in a group, or from a group-\nbased or mixed-model health plan. Nevertheless, this is the effect it \nis having and it is a severe effect. The problem is addressed by \nremoving the 30-patient aggregate limit on medical groups. The patient \nlimitation would remain on individual treating physicians. This is \nachieved in the bill, S. 1887, which I introduced along with Senators \nHatch and Biden. It simply removes the statutory limit on the number of \npatients for whom doctors in medical groups may prescribe certain newly \navailable, FDA-approved medications to treat heroin addiction.\n  I would like to close with another excerpt from Mr. DeMarco's article \nregarding the positive impact buprenorphine treatment has had on an \nindividual who sought help with his addiction, and was fortunate enough \nnot to be turned away. It is as follows:\n\n       Timothy Tigges says his addiction began after he wrenched \n     his back and bummed a few Percocet pills, a prescription \n     analgesic, from a friend to dull the pain. Before he knew it, \n     he was hooked on opiates, alternating between OxyContin and \n     shooting up heroin as his life went to pieces.\n       In October, Tigges, a 27-year-old East Boston carpet \n     installer, began taking buprenorphine, placing an orange pill \n     the size of a dime under his tongue until it dissolves, four \n     times daily. He hasn't touched an illegal drug since the day \n     he started the program, has put on 80 pounds from lifting \n     weights at the gym, and has yet to miss a day of work. For \n     the first time in three years, Tigges hopes to see his 5-\n     year-old daughter, whose mother has refused to let him visit.\n       I've had clean urines, 100 percent, for nine months now. \n     There's nothing I'm prouder of than that,'' he said, choking \n     back emotion. ``What I read on the front page of the paper \n     every day is 18- and 20-year-old kids dying of garbage drugs. \n     There's just no need for it. I would take every ounce of \n     heroin off the street and give them this stuff. You watch the \n     crime rate go down.\n\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their wisdom in adopting \nthis much-needed legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/08/senate-section/article/S6625-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO LORRAINE PERONA\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my deep gratitude to \nmy long-time office manager, Lorraine Perona, who, after more than 27 \nyears of outstanding and dedicated service to the U.S. Senate, is \nretiring on June 30, 2004.\n  When I first took office as a U.S. Senator from the State of \nConnecticut on January 3, 1989, Lorraine was one of a small group of \nstaff members I had assembled to assist me as I began my service. I was \nfortunate to have a person of Lorraine's extensive knowledge and years \nof Senate staff experience to set up my office. She did a wonderful job \nand has kept my office running for more than 15 years, as office \nmanager and financial director; and she has done so with style and \ngrace. She has been an influential leader in my office, and her \ncontributions have been many. Many staff and interns have passed \nthrough the doors of my office over the years. All have benefitted from \nLorraine's caring guidance, common sense, and expertise.\n  Lorraine studied international relations at American University and \nsubsequently worked at Dartmouth College in charge of foreign study \nprograms. Through a contact there, she learned of an opening in the \noffice of Senator John Durkin, Democrat from New Hampshire, and thus \nbegan her Senate career in March 1977. Following her work in Senator \nDurkin's office, Lorraine built her career in the Senate setting up \noffices for newly elected Members, including Senator Carl Levin, \nDemocrat from Michigan, in 1979, Senator Frank Lautenberg, Democrat \nfrom New Jersey, in 1982, and, of course, myself in 1989. Lorraine is \nan expert at creating attractive, functional and comfortable work \nspaces, not an easy task given our limited space and resources. She is \nrespected and beloved among her office manager colleagues and \nthroughout the Senate community, where she has made many friends.\n  For the past few years, Lorraine has been faced with many serious \nhealth problems. She has faced these personal challenges with great \ncourage. Despite her suffering and hardship, she has continued to do \nher utmost in service to me and the citizens of Connecticut. Lorraine \nhas been an inspiration to us all.\n  I know it is difficult for Lorraine to leave my office and her \nextended Senate family; she often speaks of the Senate as ``home.'' It \nis difficult for us, as well, for we will miss her kindness, warmth, \nand wise counsel. But hers is a retirement well earned, and Lorraine \ncan be very proud of her public service and contributions to the work \nof the Senate. As she completes her Government career, I wish Lorraine \ngood health and every happiness. I know she has a great deal to look \nforward to with her husband, Bernie Rooney, and lovely daughter, \nShannon, and I wish them all the best.\n  I extend to Lorraine Perona my personal thanks and congratulations \nfor more than 27 years of exemplary service to the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/08/senate-section/article/S6625-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6625-S6626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ALLIED HEALTH REINVESTMENT ACT\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, last week I introduced S. 2491, the \nAllied Health Reinvestment Act, with my colleagues, Senators Bingaman \nand Lieberman. As I mentioned at that time, the Allied Health \nReinvestment Act will encourage individuals to seek and complete high \nquality allied health education and training by providing additional \nfunding for their studies. This funding will help provide the U.S. \nhealthcare industry with a supply of allied health professionals \nsupport the nation's health care system in this decade and beyond.\n  The bill has a number of supporters. I would particularly like to \nexpress my appreciation to the Association of Schools of Allied Health \nProfessions, ASAHP, for its support of the legislation as well as its \nongoing efforts to address the need for allied health professionals and \nallied health faculty.\n  ASAHP, founded in 1967, has a membership that includes 105 \ninstitutions of higher learning throughout the United States, as well \nas several hundred individual members. ASAHP publishes a quarterly \njournal and also conducts an annual survey of member institutions. This \nannual survey, called the ``Institutional Profile Survey,'' is used \nfor, among other purposes, collecting student application and \nenrollment data. These data substantiates that there is a pressing need \nto address existing allied health workforce shortages, which have been \nfurther exacerbated by declines in enrollment that have occurred for 4 \nstraight years.\n  Using data from the Institutional Profile Survey, as well as the \nGeneral Accounting Office, U.S. Census Bureau, and other sources, ASAHP \nhas compiled what I believe to be a compelling rationale in its support \nfor the Allied Health Reinvestment Act that I introduced. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this Rationale for \nan Allied Health Reinvestment Act from the Association of Schools of \nAllied Health Professions be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Rationale for an Allied Health Reinvestment Act\n\n       Led by the Association of Schools of Allied Health \n     Professionals, a Washington-DC based organization with 105 \n     colleges and universities as members, a coalition of 30 \n     national organizations supports the enactment of an Allied \n     Health Reinvestment Act. S. 2491 was introduced in the 108th \n     Congress by Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), and \n     Joseph Lieberman (D-CT) and H.R. 4016 was introduced in the \n     House by Cliff Stearns (R-FL) and Ted Strickland (D-OH).\n       The well-being of the U.S. population depends to a \n     considerable extent on having access to high quality health \n     care, which requires the presence of an adequate supply of \n     competently-prepared allied health professionals. Workforce, \n     demographic, and epidemiologic imperatives are the driving \n     forces behind the need to have such legislation enacted.\n\n\n                        the workforce imperative\n\n       Many allied health professionals are characterized by \n     existing workforce shortages, declining enrollments in \n     academic institutions, or a combination of both factors. \n     Hospital officials have reported vacancy rates of 18 percent \n     among radiologic technologists and 10 percent among \n     laboratory technologists, plus they indicated more difficulty \n     in recruiting these same professionals than two years prior.\n       Fitch, a leading global rating agency that provides the \n     world's credit markets with\n\n[[Page S6626]]\n\n     credit opinions, indicates that labor expenses due to \n     personnel shortages will continue to plague hospitals and is \n     the biggest financial concern for that sector because it \n     typically costs up to twice normal equivalent wages to fill \n     gaps with temporary agency help.\n       The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that in the \n     period 1998-2008, a total of 93,000 positions in clinical \n     laboratory science need to be provided in the form of \n     creating 53,000 new jobs and filling 40,000 existing \n     vacancies. Of the 9,000 openings per year, academic \n     institutions are producing only 4,990 graduates annually. BLS \n     projections in 2004 show that nine of the 10 fastest growing \n     occupations are health or computer (information technology) \n     occupations.\n       Accredited respiratory therapy programs in 2000 graduated \n     5,512 students--21% fewer than the 6,062 graduates in 1999. \n     In 2001, the number of graduates from these schools fell \n     another 20% to 4,437. The BLS expects employment of \n     respiratory therapists to increase faster than the average of \n     all occupations, increasing from 21% to 35% through 2010. The \n     aging population and an attendant rise in the incidence of \n     respiratory ailments, including asthma and COPD, and \n     cardiopulmonary diseases drive this demand.\n       Employment growth in schools will result from expansion of \n     the school-age population and extended services for disabled \n     students. Therapists will be needed to help children with \n     disabilities prepare to enter special education programs.\n       The American Hospital Association has identified declining \n     enrollment in health education programs as a factor leading \n     to critical shortages of health care professionals. That \n     assessment is buttressed by data from 90 institutions \n     belonging to the Association of Schools of Allied Health \n     Professions. The following professions were unable to reach \n     enrollment capacity over a three-year period: cardiovascular \n     perfusion technology, cytotechnology, dietetics, emergency \n     medical sciences, health administration, health information \n     management, medical technology, occupational therapy, \n     rehabilitation counseling, respiratory therapy, and \n     respiratory therapy technician.\n       Given the level of anxiety over the possibility of \n     terrorist attacks occurring in this country, in a study \n     released by the General Accounting Office (GAO) on April 8, \n     2003 that focused on the nation's adequacy of preparedness \n     against bioterrorism, it was reported that shortages in \n     clinical laboratory personnel exist in state and local public \n     health departments, laboratories, and hospitals. Moreover, \n     these shortages are a major concern that is difficult to \n     remedy.\n       Laboratories play a critical role in the detection and \n     diagnosis of illnesses resulting from exposure to either \n     biological or chemical agents. No therapy or prophylaxis can \n     be initiated without laboratory identification and \n     confirmation of the agent in question. Laboratories need to \n     have adequate capacity and necessary staff to test clinical \n     and environmental samples in order to identify an agent \n     promptly so that proper treatment can be started and \n     infectious diseases prevented from spreading.\n       Meanwhile, the U.S. population continues to become more \n     racially and ethnically diverse. A health care workforce is \n     needed that better reflects the population they serve. \n     Practitioners must become more attuned to cultural \n     differences in order to facilitate communication and enhance \n     health care quality.\n\n\n                       The Demographic Imperative\n\n       The U.S. Census Bureau reports that rapid growth of the \n     population age 65 and over will begin in 2011 when the first \n     of the baby boom generation reaches age 65 and will continue \n     for many years. The larger proportions of the population in \n     older age groups result in part from sustained low fertility \n     levels and from relatively larger declines in mortality at \n     older ages in the latter part of the 20th century. From 1900 \n     to 2000, the proportion of persons 65 and over went from 4.1 \n     percent to 12.4 percent.\n       In the 20th century, the total population more than \n     tripled, while the 65 years and older population grew more \n     than tenfold, from 3.1 million in 1900 to 35.0 million in \n     2000.\n       Among the older population, the cohort 85 years and over \n     increased from 122,000 in 1900 to 4.2 million in 2000. Since \n     1940, this age group increased at a more rapid rate than 65-\n     to-74 year olds and 75-to-85 year olds in every decade. As a \n     proportion of the older population, the 85 and over group \n     went from being four percent of the older population to 12 \n     percent between 1900 and 2000.\n\n\n                     The Epidemiological Imperative\n\n       The baby-boom generation's movement into middle age, a \n     period when the incidence of heart attack and stroke \n     increases, will produce a higher demand for therapeutic \n     services. Medical advances now enable more patients with \n     critical problems to survive. These patients may need \n     extensive therapy.\n       According to Solucient, a major provider of information for \n     health care providers, profound demographic shifts over the \n     next twenty-five years will result in significant increases \n     in the demand for inpatient acute care services if current \n     utilization patterns do not change. An aging baby boom \n     generation, increasing life expectancy, rising fertility \n     rates, and continued immigration will undoubtedly increase \n     the volume of inpatient hospitalizations and significantly \n     alter the mix of acute care services required by patients \n     over the next quarter century. Nationwide, demographic \n     changes alone could result in a 46 percent increase in acute \n     care bed demand by 2027. Total acute care admissions could \n     also increase by almost 13 million cases in the next quarter \n     century--a growth of 41 percent from the current number of \n     national admissions. Currently, the aged nationwide account \n     for about 40 percent of inpatient admissions and about 49 \n     percent of beds. By 2027, they could make up a majority of \n     acute care services--51 percent of admissions and 59 percent \n     of beds.\n       Along with the aging of the population came an increase in \n     the number of Americans living with one, and often more than \n     one, chronic condition. Today, it is estimated that 125 \n     million Americans live with a chronic condition, and by 2020 \n     as the population ages, that number will increase to an \n     estimated 157 million, with 81 million of them having two or \n     more chronic conditions. Twenty-five percent of individuals \n     with chronic conditions have some type of activity \n     limitations. Two-thirds of Medicare spending is for \n     beneficiaries with five or more chronic conditions.\n       Many individuals with chronic conditions rely on family \n     caregivers. Approximately nine million Americans provide such \n     services, and on the average, they spend 24 hours a week \n     doing so. Caregivers age 65-74 provide an average of 30.7 \n     hours of care per week and individuals age 75 and older \n     provide an average of 34.5 hours per week.\n       Women are more likely than men to have chronic conditions, \n     in part because they have longer life expectancies. These \n     same women are caregivers to other chronically ill persons. \n     In addition, 65 percent of caregivers are female, and of all \n     caregivers, nearly 40 percent are 55 years of age and older.\n       Physicians report that their training does not adequately \n     prepare them to care for this type of patient in areas such \n     as providing education and offering effective nutritional \n     guidance. Allied health professionals can provide those \n     aspects of care, but many of them need better preparation to \n     treat and coordinate care for patients with chronic \n     conditions. While much emphasis is placed on curative forms \n     of care, additional efforts must be devoted to slowing the \n     progression of disease and its effects.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/08/senate-section/article/S6626-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 IN REMEMBRANCE OF HAROLD ``HAL'' RUBIN\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is my honor to speak in memory \nof Harold ``Hal'' Rubin, a professor and activist who will always be \nremembered for his love of family, politics and the environment.\n  Hal Rubin was an excellent example of a citizen who consistently \nworked to make his community a better place. Mr. Rubin's love for \npolitics motivated his involvement in numerous local issues and \npolitical races in Placer County. He was passionate about issues such \nas campaign spending limits, the environment and preserving the rural \ncharacteristics of Placer County.\n  Hal had an exceptional career as a professor. He began his teaching \ncareer as a professor of English and Political Science at Sierra \nCommunity College. At Sierra, he was voted by the students as their \nfavorite professor. He continued his teaching career as a professor of \njournalism at California State University, Sacramento.\n  His strong writing skills coupled with his concern for the \nenvironment led him to a job as a senior technical writer for what is \nnow GenCorp Incorporated, where he wrote about nuclear propulsion in \nthe Nation's space program. Those traits combined with his interest in \npolitics also led him to a freelance writing career, with articles \npublished in various California magazines.\n  In addition to his dedication to politics, teaching and the \nenvironment, Hal was devoted to serving his country. His service during \nWorld War II as a member of the Army Air Force was an act of selfless \ndedication to protecting our Nation. He also served as a member of the \nVeterans of Foreign Wars, Post 1942.\n  Hal Rubin committed his life to his community, his Nation and most of \nall his family. He touched the lives of many, and his impact on his \ncommunity will be long remembered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/08/senate-section/article/S6626-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6626-S6627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO HAROLD O. DAVIES\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I would like to take the \nopportunity to honor Mr. Harold O. Davies, a Seaman on the USS Yorktown \nin the Battle of Midway during World War II.\n  During the Memorial Day holiday, we have honored many of our service \nmen and women who risked their lives for their country. We have \nespecially honored what Americans call ``our greatest generation''--the \nmen and women who fought in WWII--and Mr. Davies is an\n\n[[Page S6627]]\n\nextraordinary addition to this generation.\n  Mr. Harold Davies fought on the USS Yorktown at the Battle of Midway. \nShortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States' \nretaliation emerged in a grueling war of the Pacific. The Battle of \nMidway was the major turning point in the Pacific in which Japan lost \nall four aircraft carriers and all of the airmen and planes in the \nbattle. On June 4, 1942, before the last Japanese aircraft carrier \nsunk, it struck the USS Yorktown, leaving the ship dead in the water. \nThe crew worked diligently to repair the damage and returned the ship \nto fully operational. The USS Yorktown, also known as the ``Fighting \nLady,'' launched fighters for three more days, gaining a major victory \nfor the United States before sinking on June 7.\n  Mr. Davies never left his post during this battle. He remained \ncourageous and loyal to his crew and duties. As the ship was sinking, \nhe refused to board the lifeboat until all the wounded were aboard. \nAfter the ship sank, he remained in the water for two and a half hours \nbefore being picked up by a whaleboat. Mr. Davies was not injured in \nthe battle. He lives today as a prominent member of his community and \nchurch in Hebron, KY and is able to share the story of the legendary \nBattle of Midway. This type of valor should not go unrecognized. \nTherefore, I join my fellow Kentuckians to honor Mr. Harold O. Davies \nand thank him for his service in the United States Navy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/08/senate-section/article/S6627-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING DAVID TIDMARSH\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I wish today to recognize David \nTidmarsh from South Bend, IN, as the champion of the 77th annual \nNational Spelling Bee. On June 3, 2004, David became the first Hoosier \nto win the National Spelling Bee in more than 75 years.\n  In his quest to be the Nation's top seller, David triumphed over 265 \nof the best spellers from across the Nation. He successfully disposed \nof his competition in 15 rounds over three days and claimed victory \nwith the correct spelling of ``autochthonous.'' David and his fellow \ntop spellers, including fourteen other from Indiana, emerged from a \npool of more than 9 million 9- to 15-year-olds through winning their \nlocal spelling contests.\n  David's achievement is a testament to his perseverance and \ndedication. This was David's second time participating in the \ncompetition. He tied for 16th place in last year's National Spelling \nBee. His hard work and commitment to his goal of winning the National \nSpelling Bee will serve as an example and inspiration to students \nacross the country and around the world.\n  Hoosiers throughout Indiana can take immense pride in David's \naccomplishment, as he represents the full academic potential that \nexists in the young people of our State. David's parents and educators \nalso deserve a great deal of credit for David's success. Their support \nand encouragement throughout David's schooling have been critical to \nhis success and will continue to play an important role in his future \nacademic achievement.\n  I am honored to enter the name of David Tidmarsh into the \nCongressional Record, to officially congratulate him on his \naccomplishment as champion of the 2004 National Spelling Bee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/08/senate-section/article/S6627-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO WILMINGTON'S REVOLUTIONARY MAYOR\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nmayor of Wilmington, DE, who created a revolutionary government and was \nbeloved by all.\n  Mayor John E. Babiarz Sr. was a legend in his native city of \nWilmington. He was first elected to office in 1948, then served as \npresident of city council before being elected to Mayor in 1960. His \nreign was made all the more remarkable because he was the city's leader \nthroughout the turbulent 1960s. He was a voice of calm and reason when \nDelaware's Governor ordered the National Guard to patrol the streets of \nWilmington in 1968 after Martin Luther King Jr.'s death.\n  Despite the troubled times in which he served as mayor, he will be \nforever remembered and credited with creating a revolution toward a \nmodern form of government for Delaware's largest city and corporate \nhub. He changed the old commission form of government into a modern, \nmerit political system.\n  On a personal note, I owe my start in politics to the integrity, \nguidance, and friendship of Mayor Babiarz. He was a confidant and a \nfriend.\n  Mayor Babiarz' best friend in life was his wife of 65 years, Adele. \nShe and their two sons, John Jr. and Francis, were the joys of his \nlife.\n  Wilmington has truly lost one of its greatest native sons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/08/senate-section/article/S6627-3", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           IN RECOGNITION OF THE CHURCH OF THE PRECIOUS BLOOD\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I invite my colleagues to join \nin recognizing a wonderful celebration that will take place in my \nhometown, Detroit. On Sunday, June 13, 2004, the Church of the Precious \nBlood will celebrate its 75th Anniversary.\n  Founded in 1929 by Father William Hermes with a congregation of only \n94, the church grew to a membership of nearly 900 families. Its numbers \nare moderately lower today, but the work performed in the community by \nthe active members has never waned and is no less vital.\n  The Church of the Precious Blood, under the outstanding and \naccomplished leadership of Father Hermes, succeeded by Father Marvin \nYoung, succeeded by Father Leo Priemer and then Father Donald Clark, \nfollowed by Father Ronald Kurzawa, succeeded by Bishop Moses Anderson \nand now led by Deacon Wyatt Jones, has experienced great transition, \nencountered enormous challenges, overcome monumental obstacles and \ncelebrated wonderous victories to become the oasis, the Hidden \nTreasure, in Detroit's northwest community.\n  For 75 years, the Church of the Precious Blood has been committed to \nministering to a diverse community, ethnically, culturally, socially, \neconomically, providing the kind of support and encouragement necessary \nto confirm the spirit of faith and hope in humankind and our ability as \nnurturing and loving individuals to make this world a better place. \nSunday's celebration is a major milestone on Precious Blood's committed \njourney on the path of fostering spiritual and economic growth, raising \neducational standards and providing a multitude of services to the \nwomen, men and children in the area.\n  It is an honor and a pleasure for me to ask my colleagues to join in \nextending our congratulations and the sincere wish for even greater \nvictories over the next 75 years for the members and community of the \nChurch of the Precious Blood.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/08/senate-section/article/S6627-4", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/08/senate-section/article/S6627-5", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/08/senate-section/article/S6627-6", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6627-S6628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  A COMMUNICATION FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OFFICIALLY \n  NOTIFYING THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES OF THE DEATH OF FORMER \n                     PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN--PM 84\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was ordered to lie on the table:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  By this message, I officially inform you of the death of Ronald \nReagan, the fortieth President of the United States.\n  Ronald Reagan was a great leader and a good man.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a \nfeasibility study of a Chimayo water supply system, to provide for the \nplanning, design, and construction of a water supply, reclamation, and \nfiltration facility for Espanola, New Mexico, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr DOMENICI. Mr. President, my home State of New Mexico is currently \nfacing the greatest threat to its prosperity that I have witnessed \nduring my 31-year tenures as a United States Senator. The threat is one \nthat we all too often take for granted: the availability of water.\n  I rise today to introduce a bill that would address New Mexico's most \nurgent water needs.\n  The water problems facing New Mexico are twofold. The State faces \nboth water supply shortages and the contamination of the scarce water \nresources it does have. This has resulted in inadequate water supplies \nto meet our State's needs, causing great hardship to New Mexico \ncommunities.\n  New Mexico faces significant contamination of both surface and \nsubsurface water stores. Nowhere is this more evident than in the \ncenturies-old community of Chimayo. The 3,000 citizens of this \nunincorporated community rely on individual wells for their potable \nwater and rely on largely deteriorated septic systems to dispose of \nwaste water. Hydrologists have determined that, because of absence or \ndeterioration of sewer and water infrastructure in the basin, an \nalarming 75 percent of well samples taken had significant contamination \nof both total coli form and fecal coli form. Their individual wells are \nfurther tainted by high levels of total dissolved solids. Because of \nthe unreliability of the well water, many residents use water from \nirrigation ditches for drinking. This water, too, was found to have \nhigh levels of fecal coli form contamination.\n  The water contamination in Chimayo is so desperate that in 2001, \nthen-Governor Gary Johnson declared the region an emergency area and \nhad the National Guard bring in tanker trucks to provide potable water \nto the area every other day. Chimayo is still in ``emergency status'' \nand the tanker trucks still provide the only potable water to many of \nthe citizens. This state of affairs is clearly unacceptable in the most \ntechnologically advanced and wealthy country on earth.\n  The bill I introduce today would provide emergency water treatment \nassistance to Chimayo so that its communities' citizens no longer have \nto rely on water tankers for their water. In addition, it would direct \nthe Interior Secretary to perform an assessment of water resources in \nthe area and to help the city of Chimayo to make good decisions about a \nregional water system.\n  Ever decreasing water supplies in Espanola, New Mexico have also \nreached critical levels and require immediate action.\n  The city of Espanola's current water system produced approximately \n1,000 gallons per minute less than is needed to provide for its current \npopulation. This production shortfall has resulted in insufficient \nwater pressure throughout the city. The chronic lack of pressure is \nprevalent especially in the portion of the city where the Espanola \nHospital is located. The city has twice declared a state of emergency \ndue to lack of adequate water and water pressure. As a result, the city \nhas called on the National Guard to supply water to the hospital.\n\n  Further exacerbating the problem, the city has been unable to make \ngood use of its water resources. Although it has been allocated 1,000 \nacre feet per annum of San-Juan Chama Project water by the Bureau of \nReclamation, the city is unable to divert this water due to inadequate \nwater infrastructure. Instead of making use of its available San Juan \nChama water, the city has been depleting its limited groundwater, a \nresource which the city needs to save for years of reduced surface \nflows.\n  I commend the efforts of Espanola to secure funding for \ninfrastructure necessary to make use of its San-Juan Chama Project \nwater. To date, the city has secured funding for a necessary diversion \nproject and has identified a site for the project. It has also raised \nfrom State, local and Federal sources nearly all the money required to \nbuild a water filtration facility to treat its San Juan Chama Project \nwater.\n  The bill I introduce today would provide the sum of $3 million at a \n25 percent Federal cost share to complete this critically necessary \nproject.\n  These are two problems are representative of many we have just begun \nto address. There are no easy answers or solutions to the western \nstate's water woes. New Mexico and much of the Western United States \nwill face these and other problems for years to come. However, \npreserving the livelihood of my home state requires that we address \nthese issues instantly and vigorously. I hope the Senate will give this \nbill its every consideration.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2511\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nsimplify the medicare prescription drug card program, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Drug Discount \nCard Simplification Act, which will take needed steps to improve the \nMedicare-approved drug discount card program.\n  The drug discount card program was designed to provide seniors with \ntemporary relief from high drug costs until the full Medicare drug \nbenefit starts in 2006. This program has the potential to give real \nhelp to low income seniors in particular, because it will give them up \nto $600 both this year and next year toward their prescription drug \npurchases.\n  Unfortunately, the way the program has been implemented is \nunnecessarily confusing. In talking to North Dakotans, I have heard \nrepeatedly that seniors are finding it extremely difficult to figure \nout which card, if any, is right for them. And no wonder. The media are \nfull of stories detailing how difficult it is to get accurate \ninformation about the program.\n  The 1-800-MEDICARE phone help line is continuously busy. When someone \nfinally answers the phone, the operators often can't answer seniors' \nquestions or, even worse, give incorrect information.\n  The web site is easier to access, but many seniors don't have access \nto the Internet. Those who do have Internet access have found that the \npricing information is often incomplete or out-of-date, or pharmacy \naccess information is incorrect.\n  The bottom line is that the program, as implemented, overwhelms \nseniors with too many choices. Don't get me wrong. I like choice. But \nwhen it comes to 60,000 different drugs purchased with 73 discount \ncards at over 50,000 pharmacies, the combinations seem endless for a \nsenior with several different prescriptions to be filled. On top of \nthat, the prices can change weekly.\n  Besides the number of cards, seniors also hesitate to purchase a card \nbecause they are concerned about the lack of reliability in coverage \nand available discounts.\n  Once seniors choose a card, they are locked into that card until the \nopen enrollment period at the end of the year. During the time when \nthey are locked in, the drug card program sponsor is allowed to reduce \nthe discounts provided, drop coverage of a drug, or even drop its \nprogram altogether--leaving seniors without drug coverage and forcing \nthem to go through the sign up procedure over again. I don't think this \nis fair for seniors or a wise policy for Medicare.\n  Faced with this complexity, seniors are simply choosing not to sign \nup. So far, of the 15 million seniors estimated to be eligible for the \ndrug card program, fewer than 500,000 have signed up voluntarily. \nAnother 2.4 million have been signed up automatically by their HMO.\n  If seniors want anything, it's simplicity, consistency, and \nreliability. That's why I am introducing the Drug Discount Card \nSimplification Act. My bill has three provisions.\n  First, my bill would require the Secretary to select the best three \ndiscount cards in each region. The Secretary would choose among the \nexisting approved cards and base his decision on the following three \nfactors: (1) which cards give the deepest discounts; (2) which cards \ncover the widest range of drugs; and (3) which cards make it easiest \nfor seniors to get their drugs by having the widest network of \nparticipating pharmacies.\n  Second, my legislation would prohibit drug card sponsors from \noffering discounts that are less than the discounts seniors are \npromised during the sign-up period.\n  Finally, the bill I introduce today will protect seniors' access to \ndrugs by requiring discount drug card sponsors to continue offering \ncoverage of a drug throughout the duration of the program.\n  By simplifying the program, my bill will increase participation, \nensuring that seniors can benefit from the discounts that are being \nprovided. And it will help smooth the path for successful \nimplementation of the drug benefit itself in 2006.\n\n[[Page S6632]]\n\n  Now, some may argue that my bill will eliminate competition. I \ndisagree. My bill will increase competition by encouraging sponsors to \noffer the best discounts available in order to be approved as one of \nthe three cards. In addition, my idea is not new; in fact it is \nconsistent with the Administration's proposal to limit the PPO options \nin the Medicare Modernization Act MA to just three per region.\n  I believe my legislation will provide better discount drug cards for \nseniors and make it easier for them to sign up for these benefits. I \nurge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/08/senate-section/article/S6632-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 372--DESIGNATING JANUARY 1 OF EACH YEAR AS ``GLOBAL \n                              FAMILY DAY''\n\n  Mr. INOUYE (for himself and Mr. Coleman) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 372\n\n       Whereas in this perilous time of international unrest, it \n     is vital that all means possible for the restoration of peace \n     and the reduction of hate, terror, hunger, and disease be \n     pursued with diligence;\n       Whereas the people of the world are inextricably linked as \n     1 human family;\n       Whereas the people of the world are in need of a shared \n     tradition to acknowledge and celebrate mutual kinship;\n       Whereas shared holidays strongly influence the creation and \n     maintenance of bonds among faiths and cultural and national \n     groups, and the lack of such bonds may invite mistrust and \n     conflict;\n       Whereas the United Nations General Assembly, through the \n     passage of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 54/29 \n     of November 18, 1999, and United Nations General Assembly \n     Resolution 56/2 of October 30, 2001, and many foreign heads \n     of state have recognized the importance of establishing an \n     annual shared global tradition of 1 day of peace;\n       Whereas the Congress, through the unanimous adoption on \n     December 15, 2000, of Senate Concurrent Resolution 138, 106th \n     Congress, has encouraged the adoption of a day dedicated to \n     all those members of the human family who are suffering and \n     to the development of strong global family values; and\n       Whereas on this 1 day of peace and sharing, now commonly \n     called ``Global Family Day'', people around the world are \n     called to recognize and celebrate its mission by gathering \n     with their family, friends, neighbors, faith communities, and \n     with people of another culture, to share food, traditions, \n     and mutual pledges of nonviolence: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates January 1 of each year as ``Global Family \n     Day''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe this \n     day of peace and sharing with appropriate ceremonies and \n     activities.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit a resolution to \ndesignate January first of each year as Global Family Day.\n  More than 30 years ago, a small group of inner-city children \nconceived of a holiday devoted to peace and understanding amongst the \nglobal community. They envisioned a day to celebrate life and extend \nhands in friendship, rather than in violence, in an effort to overcome \nworld events that have produced fear, hate, and grief.\n  In the years leading up to the turn of the new millennium, this small \ngroup of children and their mothers petitioned Congress and the United \nNations for the establishment of a one-day peaceful celebration. As a \nresult of their efforts, ``One Day of Peace January 1, 2000'' was \nofficially designated by the United Nations General Assembly and \nsupported by more than 1,000 organizations, more than 100 governments, \nand 25 U.S. Governors. ``One Day of Peace January 1, 2000'' was a 24-\nhour period during which the people of the world united for a virtually \nviolence-free day devoted to positive interactions amongst different \nraces and cultures.\n  The U.S. Congress unanimously approved a resolution recognizing ``One \nDay of Peace January 1, 2000.''\n  The resolution I am submitting today will give our nation's citizens \nan opportunity to renew the teachings of ``One Day of Peace January 1, \n2000'' by designating January first of each year as Global Family Day. \nCongressional recognition of Global Family Day will provide an \nopportunity for Americans to discuss and educate themselves on how to \nend inter-cultural fear, mistrust and alienation.\n  I invite my colleagues to join me in support of Global Family Day and \nthe designation of January first of every year as a day to appreciate \nand learn about other cultures and communities, in an effort to bring \npeople all over the world closer together.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 116--PROVIDING FOR CONDITIONAL ADJOURNMENT \n        OR RECESS OF THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\n\n  Mr. FRIST (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That when the Senate recesses or adjourns on \n     Wednesday, June 9, 2004, on a motion offered pursuant to this \n     concurrent resolution by its Majority Leader or his designee, \n     it stand recessed or adjourned until noon on Monday, June 14, \n     2004, or at such other time on that day as may be specified \n     by its Majority Leader or his designee in the motion to \n     recess or adjourn, or until the time of any reassembly \n     pursuant to section 2 of this concurrent resolution, \n     whichever occurs first; and that when the House adjourns on \n     the legislative day of Wednesday, June 9, 2004, it stand \n     adjourned until 12:30 p.m. on Monday, June 14, 2004, for \n     morning-hour debate, or until the time of any reassembly \n     pursuant to section 2 of this concurrent resolution, \n     whichever occurs first.\n       Sec. 2.

We will be back on the Defense bill next week, and Senators \nshould expect rollcall votes to occur Monday evening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/08/senate-section/article/S6635-5", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
