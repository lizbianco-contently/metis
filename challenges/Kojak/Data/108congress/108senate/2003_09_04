Mr. President, the Senate will resume debate immediately \nthis morning on the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill. It is the \nfirst bill we are addressing coming back from our recess. We made \nsignificant progress on the bill on Tuesday and on Wednesday. I thank \nour colleagues for coming forward and offering their amendments. Today \nwill be an important day as we wrap our hands around how many \namendments we have so we can systematically address those and engage in \ndebate and vote accordingly.\n  I inform all Members that rollcall votes will occur throughout the \nday today. It is our intention that we can set a vote on one or more \namendments to occur this morning. Members will be notified when the \nfirst vote is scheduled.\n  I wish to make one final plea: That people come forward as soon as \npossible to talk to the managers and make it clear what their \nintentions are on the various amendments.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, while the majority leader is still on the \nfloor, I would like to renew the managers' plea for amendments to come \nto the floor. There has been good cooperation with the distinguished \nassistant Democratic leader about moving toward the preparation of the \nlist. If we are to finish this bill and get it completed before \nSeptember 30, we are going to move ahead with expeditious diligence. If \nwe do not get it completed by September 30, we are going to lose $3 \nbillion. This is a very tight bill as it stands at the present time.\n  There is always concern about what is going to happen on Friday. In \nmy capacity as manager of the bill, it is my desire to move ahead and \nhave substantive votes tomorrow morning. Our custom is to conclude by \nnoon, but I believe we are going to have to do that if we are going to \nfinish this bill in a timely way.\n  There is word that there are 13 amendments ready to go today, which \nis good. But we may be a little slow getting out of the box here with \namendments being ready to come to the floor as early as 10 o'clock. The \nSenator from Florida, Mr. Nelson, is ready to go. But that may be a \nshort amendment.\n  I think it would be advisable to work on into the evening with the \nstacking of votes tomorrow morning early. There might be an earlier \ndeparture, if we have a list, if we know where we are going, and if we \nsee that there would be a conclusion, say, next Tuesday.\n  This is an issue where we have already been advised about the need to \nbring some Members in from the other side of the aisle.\n  We prefer not to schedule in accordance with the Presidential \ncandidacies. But we understand that people can talk, and we want to \nwork it out on a cooperative basis. That would be a Tuesday target to \nwrap it up completely. To accomplish that, we are going to have to go \ninto the evening and have votes tomorrow morning--at least until \nmidmorning, and perhaps until noon. At least that is as this manager \nsees it.\n  We did not complete as much work as we should have yesterday. The \nquorum call was on for a considerable period of time. As I have said \nrepeatedly, that is sort of the bane of a manager's existence--trying \nto do third reading and go to completion.\n  The majority leader advised everyone on August 1--more than a month \nago--to be ready with amendments. It is my hope that our colleagues \nwill come forward with amendments so we can get a list and see \nprecisely where we stand so we can accommodate a lot of conflicting and \ncompeting interests on schedules.\n  I hope we will proceed with amendments today. If we work into the\n\n[[Page S11052]]\n\nevening, we could stack votes early in the morning and have a departure \nwhich would not be too late to accommodate the schedules of many \nMembers who would like to understandably depart going back to their \nhome States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/04/senate-section/article/S11052-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I appreciate the indulgence of the \nmajority leader, the bill's managers, and Senator Nelson and Senator \nReid. Before we get on to the business of the day today, I wish to say \na couple of words about our guest Chaplain, Max Lucado, who opened the \nSenate with prayer this morning.\n  Max is a longtime friend of mine and our family and is the minister \nof the Oak Hills Church in San Antonio. He has a wonderful wife, \nDenalyn, and he is a loving father to their children: Jenna, Andrea, \nand Sara.\n  Most people will know Max because of his best-selling books. \nCurrently, he has more than 33 million books in print, and is America's \nleading inspirational author.\n  A half century ago, Dietrich Bonhoeffer wrote about the difference \nbetween ``cheap grace'' and ``costly grace'' when it comes to our \nfaith. Cheap grace, he said, requires nothing of us but vague \nsentiment--but costly grace requires a lifetime of faithful sacrifice \nand service.\n  Someone who understands and embraces that kind of costly grace with a \nwhole heart is a true disciple. By that definition, Max Lucado is a man \nwho exemplifies what a disciple is and can be.\n  I thank Max for his service to Texas, to America, and today to the \nSenate, and also to his Creator who chose to set a disciple like him \namong us for such a time as this.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/04/senate-section/article/S11052-3", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

GAO STUDY AND REPORT ON THE PROPAGATION OF CONCIERGE \n                   CARE.\n\n       (a) Study.--\n       (1) In general.--The Comptroller General of the United \n     States shall conduct a study on concierge care (as defined in \n     paragraph (2)) to determine the extent to which such care--\n       (A) is used by medicare beneficiaries (as defined in \n     section 1802(b)(5)(A) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395a(b)(5)(A))); and\n       (B) has impacted upon the access of medicare beneficiaries \n     (as so defined) to items and services for which reimbursement \n     is provided under the medicare program under title XVIII of \n     the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.).\n       (2) Concierge care.--In this section, the term ``concierge \n     care'' means an arrangement under which, as a prerequisite \n     for the provision of a health care item or service to an \n     individual, a physician, practitioner (as described in \n     section 1842(b)(18)(C) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395u(b)(18)(C))), or other individual--\n       (A) charges a membership fee or another incidental fee to \n     an individual desiring to receive the health care item or \n     service from such physician, practitioner, or other \n     individual; or\n       (B) requires the individual desiring to receive the health \n     care item or service from such physician, practitioner, or \n     other individual to purchase an item or service.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than the date that is 18 months \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, the Comptroller \n     General of the United States shall submit to Congress a \n     report on the study conducted under subsection (a)(1) \n     together with such recommendations for legislative or \n     administrative action as the Comptroller General determines \n     to be appropriate.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, this is an amendment that I \nthink is noncontroversial, that I am led to believe will be accepted by \nboth sides. It calls for a study by the GAO of a practice that is going \non in health care today that I have considerable concerns with, which \ncould cause the beginning of the demise of a major part of Medicare, \nwhich is our health insurance system provided by the Federal Government \nfor senior citizens.\n  The practice, interestingly, started in my State of Florida. It has \nspread to other States. We do not know the extent of this practice. \nThat is one of the reasons for the GAO study that would take place over \nthe next year and a half.\n  But here is what happens: Let's say a doctor has a patient list of \nsome 3,000 patients, and the doctor wants to constrict his or her \npractice. So the doctor writes all of the patients--and what I am \nrecounting right now is in fact what has happened in Florida--the \ndoctor writes all of the patients and says: Henceforth, I am going to \nlimit my practice. If you want to continue with me, you must pay an \nentrance fee of $1,800 per year. In some cases it has been noted in \narticles that have appeared in periodicals such as the Los Angeles \nTimes, the Washington Post, and the New York Times that that entrance \nfee is as high as $20,000 per patient.\n  So what happens is, patients who have enjoyed the services of that \nphysician in the physician-patient relationship, and who cannot afford \nthe entrance fee, suddenly have to go elsewhere to seek their health \ncare services.\n  You may say: Well, that sounds reasonable because we ought to have \nthe opportunity for individuals to charge what they want for the \nservices they provide as a physician. And, of course, that is our free \nmarket system way of doing things. But when part of the equation is a \nhealth insurance system funded by the Federal Government for senior \ncitizens, and the doctor wants to continue to receive reimbursement by \nthat health insurance system called Medicare, and the doctor is \nlimiting the access of patients with an entrance fee which that patient \nmust pay, then what we start to create under Medicare is a two-tier \nsystem of those who can afford it and those who cannot. It was never \ncontemplated that is what Medicare would be.\n\n[[Page S11053]]\n\n  Let me give you an example in the private sector. If Blue Cross/Blue \nShield has a panel of doctors, and those doctors on that panel are \nentitled to receive reimbursement from the health insurance company--in \nthis case in the private sector my example is Blue Cross/Blue Shield--\nif those doctors say, ``Well, I will be glad to see you, enrollee of \nBlue Cross/Blue Shield, insured by Blue Cross/Blue Shield, but you have \nto pay me $1,800 a year before I will see you,'' do you think Blue \nCross/Blue Shield is going to keep that doctor on its panel of \nphysicians who are going to handle those insureds of that insurance \ncompany? The answer to that is, of course not.\n  If that will not occur in the private sector, then why, in the public \nsector, in a health insurance system funded by the Federal Government \nfor senior citizens, should the Federal Government close its eyes and \nlook the other way while the physicians limit their practice with that \nentrance fee?\n  We have already addressed this. The Senate took its first step in \nopposing the use of these access fees by doctors who treat Medicare \npatients by including a provision in last year's budget resolution that \nexpressed the Senate's preference that Federal funds should not \nreimburse doctors who charge their Medicare patients any unnecessary \nfees.\n\n  What has happened in the meantime is the doctors who practice this, \nof course, want these entrance fees because they can now limit their \npractice. But, oh, by the way, they still want to continue to receive \nthe insurance benefits from Medicare, so naturally they are going to \nfight this. And they have engaged all kinds of lobbyists to fight it.\n  So what I am asking for is a study. It is my understanding that both \nsides of the aisle have agreed to have this provision. This is a study \nby the GAO over the next year and a half that will look at how \nextensive this is and whether there is any diminution in the service \nthrough Medicare to the Medicare recipients we are trying to help. I \nmaintain there is.\n  What the doctors will tell you is: No, no, no; what we are doing is \nwe are adding all kinds of different services. We are adding an annual \nhealth checkup, a physical exam. We are going to give them hot towels. \nThere won't be any waits in a waiting room. They will have a special \nprivate waiting room.\n  I do not have any problem with that if that is what the patient wants \nto pay. But to say no patient can come to that doctor who is receiving \nMedicare reimbursement unless that patient is, at the same time, paying \nthem that entrance fee--which ranges across America from $1,800 per \npatient in Florida to $20,000 per patient that was noted by the New \nYork Times and the Los Angeles Times in a case out in California--then \nI think it is beginning to establish a dangerous precedent that in \neffect could impose a means test to access Medicare providers. That \nwould further increase the gap between those who can afford health care \nand those who cannot. That is not the purpose of Medicare.\n  The purpose of Medicare is to assist all seniors, not just some \nseniors. The purpose of Medicare is a health insurance system funded by \nthe Federal Government for all senior citizens, not just some. I think \nthe logical extension of this practice is, as you go down the line, \nwith access limited, we are going to create a two-tier system, and that \nis not what Congress had in mind.\n  So what I am offering is an amendment that would get at the heart of \nthis. Let's be fair. If the doctors can make their case to GAO, then so \nbe it. I personally believe strongly that it is the beginning of the \ndisintegration of the main principle of Medicare, which is to have \naccess to health care for all senior citizens.\n  Mr. President, that is the essence of the amendment. I will abide by \nthe leaders of the bill as to how they want to dispose of it. If the \nleader of the committee, the chairman, would like me to call for a \nvote, I would be happy to do so. It is whatever is the pleasure of the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee, the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Florida for \noffering this amendment. I think he has articulated good reasons for a \nstudy by the General Accounting Office. These are important issues \nwhich could have a significant impact on health care delivery in our \ncountry. We are prepared to accept the amendment.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am grateful to the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Trying to be brief in acceptance to give plenty of time \nfor other amendments to be offered, but as the Chair can observe, there \nare no Senators in the Chamber seeking to offer amendments. If we are \nto proceed, as I said earlier, to get this bill considered and acted \nupon, we will have to have people coming to the floor with amendments.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there any further debate?\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1557.\n  The amendment (No. 1557) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are having a little down time. We expect \na significant number of Senators to have their schedules arranged so \nthey will be here, but it is not right now; it probably won't be until \n45 minutes or so. We will see what we can do to try to get someone to \ncome. We have people who have indicated they will offer their \namendments today, a dozen Senators. But we have had difficulty getting \npeople to come during the 10 o'clock hour.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1543\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, with the permission of the \ntwo leaders, I would like to speak to another amendment that is \npending. That is Senator Byrd's amendment. Since we have no one else in \nthe Chamber ready to offer an amendment, I would like to do so at this \ntime.\n  Senator Byrd's amendment, on which we will be voting probably later \ntoday, will allow us to fulfill the promises we made when we passed 2 \nyears ago the No Child Left Behind Act which was the additional \neducational assistance from the Federal Government to the States and \nlocal governments in order to help children by increasing title I for \ndisadvantaged children. Let me go back and cite a little of the \nhistory.\n  The Federal Government has had a very limited role in education. \nToday, of all the expenditures for education--be it at the university \nlevel all the way down to the beginning of school, pre-K and K--the \nFederal Government only engages in 7 percent of those expenses. Ninety-\nthree percent is borne by the governments you would expect to carry the \nload in education--the State and the local governments, mainly through \nthe school boards.\n  Along about 20 years ago or so, when we set up the Department of \nEducation--and I don't remember the exact time title I was set up--it \nwas believed that there was a particular role for the Federal \nGovernment to play in assisting State and local government on \neducational expenses by helping the children who had disadvantaged \nbackgrounds, and thus was born title I which sends money to help \nchildren who come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Indeed, an example is \nthe School Lunch Program. It is clearly an acknowledgment that a child \ncannot learn if the child is hungry--and a whole host of other kinds of \nmoneys that flow from the Federal Government to try to reach that \nprinciple that every child should have an equal opportunity to an \neducation.\n  In the Senate 2 years ago--fortunately, then, we were looking at a \nsurplus in our Federal budget--we crafted, in a give and take, not only \nwith the other body, the House of Representatives, but also with the \nWhite House--especially with the White House--this act that is referred \nto as No Child Left Behind. It had additional provisions of \naccountability, testing so that you could measure the progress of \nchildren\n\n[[Page S11054]]\n\nin those school districts in those States. It was authorized at a \nspecific level. It was authorized at approximately $18 billion, whereas \nat the time the funding was about $11 billion. That was the clear \nintent when we passed it.\n  But when we got around to appropriating the moneys, for whatever \nreason, the White House decided it was not going to support the \nincreased funding to the level authorized in the bill, the No Child \nLeft Behind Act, of $18 billion, but instead was only going to support \nan increase of roughly $1 billion, to the tune of somewhere around $12 \nbillion, from $11 billion.\n  As a result, I had about 25 townhall meetings when I was home in \nAugust. When those school board members came, when that superintendent \nof the schools came to that townhall meeting or when I met, in one \ncase, in Volusia County, with the entire school board, they were crying \nthe blues that they have all kinds of requirements under this new law \nwe enacted but the money did not flow with it.\n  Senator Byrd has offered an amendment to take that level of funding \nup to what was worked out with the President and the Senate in our \nnegotiations in a bipartisan way in the Senate as well as between the \nleadership of the Senate--at that time it was under the leadership of \nSenator Daschle, as majority leader--and the White House. That is what \nSenator Byrd's amendment does. It increases it roughly about $6 billion \nto the level authorized.\n  Folks back home--and I believe it is this way all over America, not \njust in Florida--are crying the blues about how the No Child Left \nBehind Act was not funded as promised. Title I schools provide \neducation to the most disadvantaged children in our country. These are \nthe very children we pledged not to leave behind. Typically they use \nthose funds to buy educational material, to provide afterschool \nprograms, to provide professional development to teachers, all of these \nthings aimed at that special category of children, the disadvantaged \nchildren. This is separate and apart from the disabled children.\n  We had an amendment yesterday, which unfortunately did not pass, to \nbring up the level of funding on the program known as IDEA which is \nspecial funding from the Federal Government for disabled children. \nThink of all the problems that a school board, that a school, that a \nclassroom teacher has to confront these days--disabilities, as well as \nchildren coming from disadvantaged backgrounds. We were not able to \npass that amendment yesterday on disabled kids. I hope we will be able \nto pass this one for disadvantaged children.\n  Why we would deny the most needy schools, providing education in the \nmost difficult circumstances, the resources they need to make a \ndifference in the lives of those disadvantaged kids is, to use a \nsouthern expression, beyond me. Why would we pass a law that claims to \nleave no child behind and then underfund the very reforms that were \nincluded in the bill to reach all of those students? In order to ensure \nthat every child, no matter where that child comes from, has the \nopportunity to achieve, we simply have to stop paying lipservice to \neducational reform and we have to start funding it. That is what I \npromised my people back home in Florida that I was going to come back \nup here and try to articulate to this Senate.\n  It doesn't make any sense, given all the budgets we have, that our \neducation budget is any lesser priority, especially given that this is \nthe future of America. So with Senator Byrd's amendment, we have the \nopportunity to reach a little over 2 million more disadvantaged \nstudents. I simply don't want us to pass up this opportunity.\n\n\n                               Head Start\n\n  Madam President, as long as I don't see any other Senators seeking \nrecognition, I want to bring something else to the attention of the \nSenate. It came home to me loudly and clearly when I was home. The last \nweek before the August recess, the House of Representatives passed a \nbill by a one-vote margin that is starting the demise of another one of \nthe most successful and tremendously popular programs, the Head Start \nProgram.\n  What the House of Representatives passed in late July before they \nleft--and most people around the country don't know this. There was a \nsimple one-line mention in the newspapers that the House of \nRepresentatives had passed, by a vote of 217 to 216, a bill to take the \nfunding formula for Head Start and change it in eight States, to be \ndetermined, instead of in those eight States sending the funding \ndirectly to those Head Start centers--instead, to package it in a block \nand send it to the Governor and the legislatures of eight States, yet \nto be determined.\n  Now, let me tell you why I think this is the beginning of the demise \nof Head Start. Head Start is a wildly popular program because it has \nbeen so successful over three decades of doing what? Of bringing 3-\nyear-olds, 4-year-olds, and 5-year-olds who come from disadvantaged and \npoor backgrounds up to the level that, by the time they enter school at \nprekindergarten and the first grade, they are not so far left behind \nthat they have a chance to compete and they don't become discarded in \nthe system and then, of course, so much more expensive in the long run \nbecause of the cost to society of the dropout, and so forth.\n  I visited a Head Start center and you should have seen it. It was \ndown in Boynton Beach in Florida. It has this happy little classroom \nenvironment where these 3, 4, and 5-year-olds are beginning to learn \ntheir numbers, beginning to learn the alphabet, beginning to interact \nin a classroom setting, beginning to learn self-discipline, respect for \nproperty, respect for others, and respect for themselves--a wildly \nsuccessful and, therefore, enormously popular program. There are 19,000 \nHead Start centers all over America, and the funding formula--since \nthis was a program that was set up by the Federal Government over three \ndecades ago, again, with that principle that we are trying to achieve \nthat of giving each child an equal opportunity for an education--the \nfunding was set up by the Federal Government to try to assist the \nStates.\n  Now, let me tell you--well, I don't have to; just go talk to your \nschool board members, talk to the principals and the teachers in those \nelementary schools. Ask them whether they think it is of extremely high \nvalue--the Head Start Program--when those kids are in pre-K and the \nfirst grade and they see their progress throughout the elementary \nschool system. They will give you an earful of just how important it is \nto keep it.\n  But that is not what the House of Representatives did. The House of \nRepresentatives, by that one-vote margin, decided they were going to \nfund it in a different way. Instead of the money, as it has for over 30 \nyears, going straight to the Head Start center based on a formula of \nhow many children and what kind of background, instead, they are going \nto ball up all that money for all of the Head Start centers in eight \nStates, yet to be chosen--by the way, you can pick eight States that \nhave well over half of the population of the entire country--and they \nare going to give that in a block grant to the Governor and legislature \nof those States. Well, have we missed reading all of the chronicling on \nthe front pages of the newspapers of how 48 of the 50 States are in \nfiscal cardiac arrest, how they are hurting so much they don't have \nenough funds? Can you imagine the temptation, even though we might try \nto put requirements on it, to find ways around it to siphon off some of \nthose funds from Head Start into other educational programs? I am \ntelling you, if we did that, in this Senator's judgment, that would be \nthe beginning of the demise of one of the most successful and popular \nprograms in America, the Head Start Program.\n\n  I have enough confidence in the common sense of this Senate and in \nthe sensitivity of the Members of this body in listening to their \npeople back home--even though what the House did didn't get a lot of \npress attention--that this Senate would not even consider the change of \nthat funding formula. But we have to speak out on it because it hasn't \ngotten a lot of attention.\n  It is appropriate that while we are debating the question of funding \non education, particularly with Senator Byrd's amendment that goes to \ntitle I, which is getting at those disadvantaged kids, we also ought to \ntalk about Head Start, which is getting at the very beginning of the \neducational process of those disadvantaged kids before they ever get to \nthe elementary level of education.\n\n[[Page S11055]]\n\n  So I wanted to share with the Senate--to again use a southern \nexpression--that I had received an earful back home. I am glad I did \nand I am glad I could share this with the Senate. When that bill comes \nover from the House they passed in the last week of their session, I \nhope we will tell them nothing doing, we are not messing with an \nextremely popular program. Instead, what we are going to do with that \npopular and successful program is expand it because today it only, as \nsuccessful as it is, reaches 60 percent of the eligible children. Even \nof the earlier ones that we can start working on below age 3, we are \nonly reaching about 3 percent of that eligible population. We have a \nlot of room to help these little folks as they get ready to compete so \nthey don't get so far behind once they enter school.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, since the issue of education has been \nbrought up not only this morning but over the last couple of days, and \nI have listened to some wailing and comments, I feel compelled to talk \na little bit about education myself.\n  This week, many of my colleagues have come to the floor to criticize \nthe President and criticize his administration and even to criticize \nthe Senate leadership for their commitment to education. This is a \ndiscussion we need to have every time the Senate debates spending, but \nevery time we seem to plow the same old ground. There are a lot of \nplatitudes and myths out there that keep being regenerated. It takes a \nlot of time, and it keeps us from completing the spending bills. I hope \nI can say a few words that will put this debate in perspective.\n  My colleagues have argued that the current appropriations bill cuts \neducation spending and it underfunds the No Child Left Behind Act. They \nhave suggested, and I suppose will continue to insist, that the bill \ncontains harsh and unacceptable cuts to education and that it will \nsomehow leave students and teachers on their own. That is simply not \nthe case.\n  The bill contains over $12 billion for title I programs, the third \nstraight year it has had an increase. That is a total increase of 45 \npercent in title I funding since 2001.\n  It also contains $1 billion for Reading First, close to $700 million \nfor State education technology grants, and over $1.1 billion for impact \naid programs. All told, this bill contains about $56 billion for \neducation programs, over $12 billion more--$12 billion more--than \nfiscal year 2001. Yet my colleagues insist that this bill cuts too much \nfrom education. They argue it does not go far enough and that we must \nincrease our Federal deficit by several billion dollars more to assure \nwe have adequately funded education. Where are these disastrous cuts? \nHow is a $12 billion increase in education funding over 4 years a harsh \nand unacceptable cut?\n  Before I came to the Senate, I worked as an accountant. I learned how \nto balance accounts and read ledgers, and I am astounded to see my \ncolleagues insisting that a $12 billion increase in education funding \nfor over 4 years somehow constitutes a cut. I guess that kind of gives \nyou an idea why we have some problems. It does not take special \ntraining in accounting to understand that a $3.9 billion increase in \ntitle I spending since 2002 is not a cut. Even without my training as \nan accountant, I am confident I would understand, as do families across \nAmerica, that a $12 billion increase is not a cut, no matter how you \nframe it.\n  It is interesting to see how many of my colleagues are now \ncriticizing the President and this administration for recommending less \nthan the authorized amounts--authorized amounts--under No Child Left \nBehind. Let me explain authorized amounts.\n  We go through a three-step process around here. We have a budget \nprocess. A budget is something the President has to present to us by \nFebruary so that we can approve a massive outline of how we are going \nto do spending by April 15. It is a Federal statute. It has been \ncomplied with twice in the history of the country. Once was this year. \nThe other one was many decades ago. We did a budget.\n  Then there is a second part to the process. It does not necessarily \nhave to come after the first part. It can be contiguous or it can be \nbefore the first part. It is called authorization. Authorization is \nwhen a bill is drafted by the committee of jurisdiction, the ones that \nhave the knowledge and the concentration and focus on the problem. They \ndo an authorization bill. It is usually a 6-year authorization, and it \nis an authorization for the maximum amount that will be spent, not \nminimums.\n\n  I hope everybody catches that. The authorization bill does not give \nminimums of spending, it gives the authorization for the maximums of \nspending, and that is the maximums of spending over a 6-year period.\n  Taking into account inflation, new programs, and issues such as \nthose, nobody ever starts at the maximum and hopes they can sustain and \nincrease that through the period of the authorization bill. That is not \nhow it works. We always start at less than the authorized amount, and \nwe build up to it over the 6-year period.\n  Let's take a look at some history because I seem to recall that this \nbody did the exact same thing last year when they were doing No Child \nLeft Behind in this particular bill.\n  My colleagues, of course--now they are in the minority--held all of \nthe leadership positions at that time. They were in charge of doing \nthis appropriations bill. They were the ones in charge of figuring out \nhow much of that authorization could logically be tucked into this \nappropriations bill.\n  If we look at the appropriations bill reported out of committee last \nyear, we find that it contained $3.5 billion less than the authorized \nlevel in title I funding. Somehow the administration is now being taken \nto task for recommending more than the colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle who were in charge last year recommended, even though they \nboth recommended less than the fully authorized amounts. That is not \nunusual, and it shows that both sides of the aisle understand how this \nworks.\n  Remember, we will find that the appropriations bill reported out of \ncommittee last year contained $3.5 billion less than the authorized \nlevel in title I funding, and the administration is now being taken to \ntask for recommending more than the other side of the aisle did. I \nguess that should cut both ways. You cannot accuse the President of \ncutting education spending because he asked for less than the fully \nauthorized amount when the other side of the aisle has done the same \nthing.\n  Even though my colleagues approved a bill last year that left a gap \nbetween appropriations and the fully authorized amounts, it has now \nbecome unacceptable in their eyes to fund No Child Left Behind at less \nthan the fully authorized levels. In Wyoming, we have a lot of \nexpressions we use to describe that kind of behavior, but the only one \nI can probably use on the floor of the Senate is doubletalk.\n  I also want to point out that we never made it to an Education \nappropriations bill last year. We never passed a budget last year. That \nwas when the other side of the aisle was in the leadership. And it took \nus until this spring, under our current leadership, to pass any \nincrease in title I and the No Child Left Behind Act. I think that \nbears a little bit of extra description.\n  Yes, I have held town meetings in Wyoming, and I have had to answer \nto education, and I have had to explain to them that a year ago we \ncould not even pass a budget. A year ago, we did not even take up \nEducation appropriations. Yes, we had this new authorization bill for \nNo Child Left Behind, but, Madam President, do you know what. You \ncannot appropriate any additional dollars if you do not do an \nappropriations bill, and that appropriations bill never got done under \nthe leadership last year. There was not a dime of increase passed last \nyear.\n  When Senator Frist became the majority leader this year, we went to \nwork on getting the appropriations done, and with the cooperation \nacross the aisle, we were able to get nine bills approved in 8 days. I \nthink that is about how it was.\n  That was the first funding for education under No Child Left Behind. \nWhen did that happen? The President signed it into law on February 26, \nand the bureaucratic machine moved faster than it ever has. By March \n26, the checks went out to the States. Miraculous. But school in this \ncountry ends at the end of May or the middle of June at\n\n[[Page S11056]]\n\nthe latest. So on March 26, the mail went out. Eventually the States \ngot those checks. Then the States had to do the allocation out to the \nschool districts.\n  I do not imagine they got that done in one day. I do not imagine they \ngot that done in a month. So now we are talking about the end of April, \nand school is going to end the next month. What kind of education \nfunding is that?\n  So nobody got an increase for last year. They had to operate on the \nbudget that they had from the year before. We never passed a budget. It \ntook us until this spring, under our current leadership, to pass any \nincreases in title I and the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  The current Senate leadership can point to two separate increases in \nfunding for education compared to last year when this body did not \napprove any increases in education funding. If this issue is such a \npriority for my colleagues, why did we adjourn last fall without \npassing an additional dollar for education? As I am sure my colleagues \nwill recall, we left Washington last year without a single dime more \nfor education than was available the year before. Incidentally, because \nof this delay, when the President made his budget recommendation to \nCongress--that is that first step of the process I mentioned--we were \nstill working on fiscal year 2003 appropriations; we had not finished \nthem.\n  Those appropriations should have been the base for the President's \nrecommendation, but we require him to have that in by February, and he \ndid. That is the only way we can get our work done by April. He \ncomplied. So what figures could the President use?\n  The present administration is being blamed for this body's failure to \npass an appropriations bill last fall, and that seems preposterous to \nme. Of course, he had to base his budget on what we had done for 2002, \nand he did, and he made substantial increases.\n  I want to mention just a little bit about the budget process we went \nthrough, too. During the budget process, we had an interminable number \nof votes attempting to do unprecedented earmarking. Well, that is not \nreally what it was designed to do. What it was designed to do was to \nmake it look as if a majority of the Senators who were doing \nresponsible budgeting were actually voting against key programs that \nare normally not outlined specifically with earmarking. So the \nresponsible Senators did the right thing and voted against what looked \nlike voting against kids, and that is exactly politically how it was \ndesigned to be. But they did it so that we could have a responsible \nbudget.\n  Now here we go again with the interminable number of votes I am sure \nwe will be expected to take that will earmark an increase and change, \nand all of them are outside of the budget process that has already been \napproved.\n  Fortunately, I am sure the people across America are educated \nenough--I am sure our system has done that--to see through what is \nhappening. We all know the Senate's budget process and we know the \nPresident is required to make that recommendation in February. When \nthis body does not pass the appropriations bill that normally serves as \nthe basis for the President's recommendation, it is unconscionable to \nthen criticize the President for his recommendations.\n\n  The bottom line is that this body passed last year's appropriations \nbill 6 months late, and only then under the current Senate leadership. \nA better comparison would be the President's recommendations on the \nfiscal year 2002 appropriations, which were the only figures available \nat the time the President submitted his recommendation to Congress.\n  Clearly, this discussion is not about funding levels, it is about \npolitics. This body has too much important business before it to waste \ntime playing politics, particularly playing politics on education. \nThere are students and teachers depending on this body to give them \nadditional funding, and that is what my colleagues on the \nAppropriations Committee have done. Let us get the business of the \nSenate completed so these students and teachers can get what they need \nthis year, rather than another day, another week, or another month of \ndebate that could once again push the dollars into the following year.\n  Let us get our work done timely. Let us give some consideration to \nwhat kind of amendments are being offered. Let us put the politics \nbehind for our kids and let us get this bill done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1558 to Amendment No. 1542\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendments?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1558 to amendment No. 1542.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide additional funding for the ombudsman program for \n             the protection of vulnerable older Americans)\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       Sec. __. In addition to any amounts otherwise appropriated \n     under this Act under the heading of Administration on Aging, \n     there are appropriated an additional $1,000,000: Provided, \n     That in addition to the amounts already made available to \n     carry out the ombudsman program under chapter 2 of title VII \n     of the Older Americans Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3058 et seq.), \n     there are made available an additional $1,000,000.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, this is a noncontroversial amendment I \nhope will be accepted later today. It addresses the tragedy of abuse \nand neglect in our Nation's nursing homes and other long-term care \nsettings.\n  Our seniors made our country what it is today, and they have earned \nthe right to live out their days with dignity and the best possible \ncare.\n  For most seniors in long-term care, they have that opportunity. The \nvast majority of nursing homes, home health agencies and other long-\nterm care providers do a good job taking care of their patients under \ndifficult circumstances. But too often across this country, there have \nbeen and continues to be cases in which our elderly and disabled are \nabused, beaten, starved, or neglected.\n  Last year, a House Government Reform Committee report found that \nnearly one-third of nursing homes had been cited for an abuse violation \nin the past 2 years. Ten percent of nursing homes had violations that \ncaused actual harm or placed residents in immediate jeopardy of injury \nor death. The Senate Aging Committee, on which I serve, has repeatedly \nheard from the GAO that abuse and neglect are a major problem in our \nNation's nursing homes.\n  Tucked away in this appropriations bill is a little program that has \na big impact on these problems. The State Long-Term Care Ombudsmen \nProgram places caring people throughout each State to assist elderly \nand disabled patients who have been abused or neglected. The ombudsmen \nhave the responsibility to make sure that patients' complaints are \ninvestigated and addressed. They help these vulnerable people and their \nfamilies navigate the complicated system and get the help they need.\n  In addition, the ombudsmen work with nursing homes to improve care. \nThey also serve a large number of patients in home health care and \nassisted living. In cases where a nursing home must be closed because \nit cannot or will not improve, the ombudsmen help patients relocate to \nthe best possible setting.\n  Unfortunately, a lack of funding and staff make it difficult for the \nombudsmen to serve the large number of people who need their services--\nleaving patients vulnerable to substandard care.\n  A recent Administration on Aging report found that complaints to \nombudsmen increased 48 percent from 1996 to 2001. Yet funding still \nlags far behind what is needed. Ombudsmen are being asked to do more \nand more, and Congress should make sure they have the resources to do \ntheir jobs.\n  I greatly appreciate the chairman and ranking member's willingness to \nwork with me over the past several\n\n[[Page S11057]]\n\nyears to increase funding for the ombudsman program. Through our \nefforts, we have increased funding by $6 million since fiscal year \n2000.\n  This is a great start. But I have been advised by the National \nAssociation of Ombudsman Programs that it would take a $36 million \nincrease to adequately fund the program. I realize that such a large \nincrease is not possible in a single year--especially a year that has \nsuch tight fiscal constraints as this one. But I am concerned that the \nbill before us includes no increase at all.\n  This amendment would take another small but real step forward by \nincreasing the program by $1 million this year. This increase will help \nombudsmen keep up with the growing demand for their services. And it \nwill help make sure that patients are better protected from abuse at \nthe hands of those who are supposed to care for them.\n  I thank the chairman and ranking member for working with me. I know \nwe all have the same goal of making sure our seniors are adequately \nprotected in law term care.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin for offering this \namendment. I share his concern about adequate care for seniors in \nnursing homes. That account is currently funded at $13.361 million. I \nnote that the Senator from Wisconsin wants to add $1 million. We would \nlike to be accommodating. However, as Everett Dirksen once said, a \nmillion here and a million there add up.\n  I would be interested to know if the Senator from Wisconsin would \ncare to respond why he picks $1 million instead of $2 million or \n$750,000? Where does the Senator from Wisconsin see the need for an \nadditional $1 million when there already is $13.361 million? I am \nsearching for some rationality as to why this million should be added.\n  Mr. KOHL. I do appreciate that. As I say, it will take $36 million, \nin our judgment, to adequately fund the entire program. I know very \nwell that is not possible. That is not going to happen. I could pick \nout a figure larger or smaller than a million, and it was Senator \nDirksen who did say a million or a billion added up to quite a bit of \nmoney. I do recognize $1 million is a lot of money, but considered in \nthe context of what we are talking about and the importance of the \nprogram, which I know the Senator from Pennsylvania agrees, $1 million \nis a reasonable number.\n  I would not impose on the Senator the burden of having to make a \ndifficult decision if that number were considerably larger. So I am \nasking for the support of the Senator with respect to a rather nominal \nnumber when we are considering the people we are talking about and the \nneed for our service to them.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, the difficulty which I have as manager, \nwe are now up to our 302(b) allocation. To find another $1 million, we \nhave to take it from somewhere. It is a matter of evaluating whether $1 \nmillion means anything significant on top of $13 million which we \nalready have.\n  However, I understand the interests of the Senator, the thrust of the \nargument by the Senator from Wisconsin. It is a worthwhile program. I \nwill sharpen my pencil and pull down my green eyeshade and see if we \ncan find some money to accommodate what the Senator from Wisconsin \nwould like to have done. No commitments, but we will take a close look.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, the Senator from Georgia is on the \nfloor and has requested an opportunity to speak for a few moments on \nanother subject. From the manager's point of view, this would be a good \ntime to do that. There is no other Senator on the floor now. I see \nSenator Murray is on the floor, but I think we can accommodate the \nSenator from Georgia for 7 minutes. I ask unanimous consent the Senator \nfrom Georgia be permitted to speak as if in morning business for 7 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Miller are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Madam President, I come to the floor this morning to \noffer an amendment to help some of the millions of Americans who are \nlooking for work in this very tough economy. The amendment I am \noffering right now provides an additional $801 million for critically \nneeded worker training and retraining programs under the Workforce \nInvestment Act. I am proud that Senators Kennedy, Dodd, Leahy, \nJeffords, and Bingaman are cosponsors of this important amendment.\n  Today our Nation faces both a jobs crisis and a skills crisis. There \nare 9.1 million Americans searching for jobs and another 5 million more \nAmericans are working part time because they cannot find full-time work \nin this stagnant economy. Those millions of workers need training and \nskills to get good jobs that are going to last, and that is what this \namendment before us provides.\n  I am proud that a wide range of organizations have endorsed my worker \ntraining amendment, including the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the \nNational Association of Counties, the National Workforce Association, \nthe Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the National Association of \nWorkforce Boards.\n  My office has also received hundreds of letters of support from local \nworkforce boards, mayors, county executives, employers, and just \nordinary Americans. They all want this Senate to provide additional \ntraining opportunities for our workers.\n  The amendment before us would provide training opportunities for an \nadditional 200,000 adults, young people, dislocated workers, Native \nAmericans, and migrant and seasonal farmworkers. Most of these \nworkforce and training programs have not had any--none--increases in \nfunding for the entire last decade.\n\n[[Page S11058]]\n\n  Think about that. We are in the middle of a jobs and skills crisis \nbut most of our training programs have not had any funding increases in \na decade.\n  My amendment will increase funding for adults by $100 million; for \ndislocated workers by $159 million; for youth by $99 million; for youth \nopportunity grants by $250 million; for migrant and seasonal \nfarmworkers by $23 million; for Native Americans by $20 million; and \nfor one-stop infrastructure by $150 million. That funding is going to \nmake a huge difference.\n  I think any Senators who spent time with their constituents during \nthe August recess from which we have just returned will recognize the \nurgent need for jobs and job training.\n  Last month when I was home I visited two of our one-stop employment \ncenters in my State and I met with staff members who are working to \ntrain residents. I met with local employers who want to hire people in \nthe community if they have the right skills. I met with workers, from \nyoung people who are just starting their careers to established workers \nwho have been displaced by much larger economic forces. All of them \nwant the skills they need to find a good job. But for many of them it \nis very tough going.\n  In King County, where Seattle is located, there is currently a 10,000 \nperson waiting list for training. That is appalling. These are people \nwho want to work. They desperately want training. But in King County \nalone they are stuck on a waiting list with 10,000 other people. They \nhave been waiting a long time. In King County, the freeze on training \nservices began last January. It has been a very long and very difficult \nyear for everyone on that waiting list. They need our help and the \nMurray amendment will provide it.\n\n  Residents of the State of Washington continue to suffer with the \nthird highest unemployment in the country, 7.5 percent. Since January \nof 2001, my State alone has lost 73,000 good-paying jobs in areas such \nas technology, aerospace, and manufacturing. Workers who were \naccustomed to earning $30 to $40 an hour as engineers in my State are \nnow forced to accept warehouse jobs that pay $8 to $12 an hour.\n  Today, one-stop employment centers across the country are being asked \nto serve more people than ever before, yet their funding remains below \nwhat it was in fiscal year 2001 when our country was still experiencing \nrelative economic prosperity. As a result, workers who are searching \nfor jobs are taking longer than in previous recessions to find work. In \n2000, it took an average of 12 weeks to find a new job. Currently, it \ntakes approximately 20 weeks, and that is only if there are jobs to be \nfound.\n  According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, some 1.1 \nmillion workers have exhausted their extended unemployment benefits \nwith no employment prospects on the horizon. These workers have worked \nhard and they have played by the rules, yet they are losing their homes \nin record numbers and even foregoing medical treatment for their \nchildren. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee these jobs are going to \nreturn, making it even more crucial that this Senate provide the \nretraining dollars to help those workers find jobs in the industries \nand sectors of the economy that have the greatest potential for growth.\n  Unfortunately, young people seem to be the hardest hit by the current \njob crisis. The youth unemployment rate has hit a 10-year high of 19.3 \npercent. The minority youth unemployment rate continues to hover around \n30 percent.\n  Recent studies have shown that nearly 50 percent of the job losses in \nthis recession have occurred to young people who are 16 to 24 years \nold. Young people desperately need help but our Federal workforce \ndollars currently serve only about 7 percent of our eligible youth \nnationally.\n  My amendment would increase the youth formula grant money to States \nand localities, and would fully fund the Youth Opportunity Grant \nProgram, which has a real track record of success in many communities \nand on Indian reservations around the country. My amendment also \nprovides desperately needed modest increases for some of our most \nvulnerable populations--migrant and seasonal farmworkers and Native \nAmericans. These two groups often have unemployment rates above 50 \npercent with few prospects for jobs that will provide a sustainable \nincome to support themselves and their families.\n  As a nation, we have to place a higher priority on helping these \nchronically underserved populations. My amendment does just that.\n  Finally, my amendment provides critical infrastructure funding for \nour national network of 1,900 one-stop employment centers. These one-\nstop employment centers integrate nearly 20 Federal workforce and \nsocial service programs at the local level.\n  In the HELP Committee, we have been working very hard to reauthorize \nthe Workforce Investment Act, and to include more related programs such \nas TANF, small business, and transportation into the one-stops with an \nadditional emphasis on program integration and seamless service \ndelivery for all eligible Americans.\n  In summary, the Murray amendment that is before this body will \nprovide additional hope and opportunity for citizens who need jobs \ntoday. Given the employment trends we will face over the next decade, \nwe cannot afford to waste the talents of any worker as we continue to \ncompete in the global economy.\n  I hope all Senators will agree with me that taking care of the \ntraining needs of our workers at home should be a top priority for our \nGovernment. The rest of the world is monitoring how we train our \nworkforce because these foreign governments are looking for every \nadvantage to capture additional market share for goods and services \nthat are currently produced in the United States.\n  Let us not give our competitors a leg up. Let us support the Murray \namendment so we can continue to have the most highly skilled and \nproductive workforce in the world and so we can put our Americans back \nto work in good jobs that will last.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Murray amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator from Washington has just made an excellent \npresentation on an issue which is the heart and soul of our economic \nchallenge; that is, to ensure that we are going to have continued \nupgrading of skills for workers to be able to compete in the world \neconomy.\n  On Labor Day, I heard the President of the United States talk about \nthe importance of job training and the importance of continuing \neducation in the employment field. Yet it is my understanding, in terms \nof the administration's request, that there was actually a reduction in \nfunding for this program--not that money in and of itself is the sole \nanswer. But the Senator is very aware that the job training program \nthat has been worked out and is in place at the present time is really \nthe result of a very strong, bipartisan effort by Senator Kassebaum, \nSenator Murray, myself, and others involved in trying to work out one-\nstop shopping working with labor, work, and business. We finally got a \nprogram that is effective, and now the resources are really needed. We \nfind that workers getting the training are able to find employment. It \nis really a key issue in terms of our economy today and in terms of the \nfuture.\n  Is the Senator not somewhat perplexed, given the statements by the \nPresident that we would have a reduction in funding of the program, \nwhich program reflects strong bipartisan effort, passed overwhelmingly \nin the House and Senate, and supported by the President, and which is \nso necessary in terms of having people getting the skills necessary for \nthem to get back to work?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Massachusetts is correct. I heard the \nPresident on Labor Day. I was delighted to hear that he was facing up \nto the fact that our economy is struggling, with thousands of people \nout of work. I am very perplexed that he is not willing to add \nadditional money to train our workers.\n  As the Senator from Massachusetts knows, when a young man or woman is \nlaid off, they don't have the money to provide for their family. It \nimpacts not just themselves but their entire family and their entire \ncommunity as they\n\n[[Page S11059]]\n\nstruggle. They are not going to find the same jobs. Our economy is \nchanging. The only way they are going to get back into the workforce is \nif we give them the skills and training to get into the economic \nsectors that have job openings. These programs are critical in getting \nour economy back on track. They are fundamental to getting our economy \nback on track.\n  It is very perplexing to me that the President has not asked for nor \nsupports the amendment before us that will help those workers.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator also understands that we are talking about a \ndifferent aspect in terms of the need for training. We have the youth, \nwe have the adult workers, and we have those who are laid off because \nof skills. There are a variety of different challenges out there, are \nthere not? What we want to try to do is make sure we are going to take \nscarce resources and use those resources in ways which will result in \ngiving skills to individuals--whether they are young, whether they are \ndislocated, whether they are the adult workers--and get them back into \ngainful employment, paying taxes and really returning resources to the \neconomy in a very constructive and productive way.\n\n  I understand the Senator's amendment attempts to do that. Am I \ncorrect?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely correct. As \nI traveled around in August to talk to people in my State, where we \nhave been severely impacted--we have the third highest unemployment in \nthe Nation--I talked to students just out of high school who cannot \nafford to go college because of tuition increases and who do not have \nthe skills to simply enter the workforce. It is very different than \ntalking to a young father who is 35 years old with three young kids, \nwho was an engineer at Boeing, who will not get that job back and \ndoesn't have the computer training skills to get into another job that \nwill provide him with the income to sustain a family with three \nchildren.\n  There are different programs funded in my State which we have worked \non and which were supported in the HELP Committee. They are different \nfor dislocated workers or for adults or for youth.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Beyond that, as I understand it, some of the resources \ncould be used to retain individuals actually in school rather than \nretraining young workers who drop out of school.\n  This has an important relationship to what we have been trying to do \nin terms of focus, attention, and support for strengthening our \neducation process to reach out to those individuals who may be tempted \nto drop out but can be retained in school and perhaps acquire some \nskills.\n  This effort is reflective of a long experience--not that there \nshouldn't be some changes and alterations in a program.\n  I see our good friend from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, on the other side \nof the aisle who is an expert in terms of training programs, OSHA, and \notherwise.\n  We have tried to work this out in a bipartisan way. This is really a \nkey to our economic recovery.\n  I thank the Senator from Washington for bringing this to the \nattention of the Senate. I hope we will have strong bipartisan support. \nWe have had bipartisan support in the past. This certainly is an \namendment that deserves it. I thank her for offering it on the \nappropriations bill.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his support, \nhis words of wisdom, for his longstanding commitment to people in this \ncountry who do not have the opportunities, and for making sure that \nevery American, no matter who they are, where they come from, or what \ncircumstances have hit them in their lives, gets the opportunities for \nthe American dream that all of us want. Certainly this amendment is \npart of that effort.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, as chairman of the Subcommittee on \nEmployment, Safety, and Training of the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee, I have enjoyed working with the Senator from \nWashington, the ranking member. I appreciate all of her efforts on the \nWorkforce Investment Act, and, of course, the ranking member of the \nfull committee, Senator Kennedy, who has been working with us, and his \nstaff who have been working in great detail to be sure we have a \nWorkforce Investment Act we can pass this year so that we can make sure \nthe money is funneled through the proper channels and the most people \nare taken care of for the money. It is up for reauthorization this \nyear. It is particularly critical that we do it. It is landmark \nlegislation that is a priority for both myself and my colleague from \nWashington. I am pleased that they worked so closely on getting this \nbipartisan bill to this point. I think we will be able to finish it and \nget it marked up sometime this month.\n  During the reauthorization process, we have considered how resources \nare most effectively used for the people who need it most. There is no \nproblem for anybody to see that there is a problem.\n  Having said that, I need to explain that I will be opposing this \namendment. I want to carefully explain that. I am not questioning the \nimportance of job training in these difficult economic times, nor am I \nquestioning the importance of the Workforce Investment Act as our \nFederal workforce development system. But I am opposing the amendment \nthat increases funding for job training without appropriately \noffsetting such increased amount. At the appropriate time, I will be \ntaking that action.\n  The way this appears to be offset but really isn't is through what we \nuse rather liberally in some of the amendments, even a couple pending \nbefore us now, which is advance funding. That means that we steal a \nlittle bit out of another year's appropriations so we can spend it in \nthis year's appropriations, and, oddly enough, spend it in that year's \nappropriations, too. You can see if we get into a process of spending \nmoney twice, we are going to be in some real trouble.\n  This amendment increases funding that is not targeted to individuals \nwho are in most need of job training and assistance. Of the $801 \nmillion increase in funds, only $159 million will go to the dislocated \nworkers program--those individuals most in need of assistance to get \nback to work.\n  So we are going to throw $801 million at the dislocated worker \nproblem. Granted, there are uses for that money in those other areas, \nbut we are going to do that to take care of $159 million that will go \nto dislocated worker programs. I don't think that is the right way for \nus to go about the process.\n  The committee bill provides $5.1 billion for job training and \nemployment services, and that is $164 million above the budget request. \nOf this total amount, the committee bill provides $1.43 billion for \ndislocated worker activities.\n  We went through this during the process of the budget. We approved a \nbudget. A change in the budget is what results in budget points of \norder. So the Labor-HHS bill must seek to address a lot of important \nneeds, not the least of which is job training funding to ensure \nAmerican workers are equipped to contribute and succeed in a changing \neconomy. Of course, we always want that to happen faster than it is \never possible for it to happen.\n  The committee bill does reduce job training funding from fiscal year \n2003 by $85 million, but I explained in a speech just a little while \nago how that comes about. The President had to submit his budget before \nhe knew what we were going to do in 2003, because we did not do a \nbudget for the previous year; and then we did not pass the \nappropriation. So what we were going to be doing was not known until \nafter he had to submit a budget to us. So he had to base his budget on \nwhat had been done for 2002, and there was a significant increase from \n2002. Again, we raised it a little bit, and did so again in the \nappropriation.\n  So unless that can be offset, I am going to have to reluctantly \noppose the amendment. Again, I don't think we ought to spend $801 \nmillion trying to solve a $159-million problem. I ask my colleagues to \noppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Wyoming, and I \nunderstand he is opposing the amendment. I just say we are in a crisis \nin this country. We are in a crisis\n\n[[Page S11060]]\n\nwhen there are 10,000 people on a waiting list in King County alone to \ntry to get into a training program in order to get the skills they need \nto get back to work. We are in a crisis when our economy continues to \nstruggle and people are unable to put food on the table, send their \nkids to college, and to be able to feel secure when it comes to their \njobs.\n  We all know we are spending $1 billion a week in Iraq in order to \nreconstruct that country. It seems to me totally reasonable to ask for \n$801 million for next year to help train our workers, to get our \neconomy back on track, and to give American families the security they \nneed in their homes to know they can take care of their own.\n  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment at \nthe appropriate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the amendment offered by the Senator from \nWashington addresses a very important issue on job training, beyond any \nquestion. In structuring this appropriations bill, it has been very \ndifficult, given the budget resolution and the allocation which we had.\n  We have at the present time in the Senate bill $3,564,436,000 on this \nline. With respect to the dislocated workers assistance, this committee \nincreased the recommendation of the President, which had been at \n$1,383,040,000, and we put it back up to the funding of 2003 at \n$1,431,340,000.\n  The youth opportunity grants is a program which had a 5-year sunset. \nThe President did not ask for funding for migrant farm workers, but we \nreinstated more than $77 million there.\n  We maintained the funding for Native Americans, and maintained the \nfunding for one-stop centers.\n  Now, in an ideal world, with more funds, the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Washington might well be the thing to do. But the \nsubcommittee is faced with the constraints, and we structured the very \nbest we could in allocating, as I say, in excess of $3.5 billion for \njob training.\n  Unless we can find some offset--and we are constantly taking a look \nat the long list of items which we have where the appropriations are \nrecommended for the total of $137 billion--it is very difficult to see \nhow the amendment can be accepted, without some offset, without \nexceeding the limits which we have under our allocation from the Budget \nAct.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I take the floor for a few minutes to \ndiscuss an amendment Senator Kennedy and I and others plan to offer to \naddress a very important issue, one that affects the livelihood of \nmillions of American workers and their families. It is an issue that \nbubbled up earlier this year when the Department of Labor--and I choose \nthis word carefully--sort of surreptitiously issued proposed \nregulations, changes in regulations that would affect the 40-hour \nworkweek and take away overtime protection for millions of American \nworkers.\n  They did not have one hearing on that. They published it, put this \nout as a proposed change in the rules and regulations. Not too many \npeople knew about it. However, I am now aware that over 78,000 comments \nhave come in on this issue from around the country. So now the \nDepartment of Labor is hearing back, and more and more Americans are \nbeginning to find out about this proposal.\n  Senator Kennedy and I, and a number of our colleagues, will offer an \namendment to protect the 40-hour workweek and to make sure overtime \nprotections are there for American workers.\n  What the administration has proposed is a change in our regulations \nthat would eliminate the 40-hour workweek by allowing employers to deny \nmillions of workers overtime pay, workers who are currently covered and \nguaranteed overtime pay protections under the Fair Labor Standards Act \nof 1938.\n  This proposal by the administration is antiworker, it is antifamily, \nand it is bad economic policy. It is an attack on America's middle \nclass. It won't create one job in our struggling economy. In fact, it \nwill do just the opposite. It will cost us jobs. It is part of what I \ncall the ``economic malpractice'' of this administration. And it is \nworking Americans who are the victims.\n  Unemployment continues to climb. It is now at 6.2 percent, the \nhighest level since 1994. That means 9.4 million people looking for \nwork can't find any.\n  Since President Bush was sworn in, we have lost 3.1 million private \nsector jobs. We are losing jobs every month. The economy is limping \nalong. Our deficit continues to bloom. It is now over $450 billion, I \nam told, by the end of this year and may be $500 billion by the end of \nnext year. So the administration passed two record tax cuts for the \nwealthy to explode the deficit. And instead of trying to put money in \nthe pockets of working Americans, the administration now wants to take \nit away, taking money out of the pockets of hard-working Americans, \nhard-working Americans who may be working overtime to help pay some \nextra bills.\n  Late last month, the Economic Policy Institute issued a report that \nanalyzed the reach of this administration's proposal. It found that up \nto 8 million workers who currently are eligible for overtime pay will \nlose that eligibility. And as they noted, overtime pay for many of \nthese workers can make up to 25 percent of the family's income. We are \ntalking about people such as nurses, police officers, firefighters, \nretail managers, journalists, medical technicians, surveyors, among a \nwhole host of others. For most of these men and women, that overtime \npay is not spare change or for frivolous spending; it is essential. It \nhelps pay the mortgage, feed the kids, and maybe put a little bit away \nfor college for their kids or save a little bit for retirement.\n  I have a recent letter from the National Association of Police \nOrganizations that represents thousands of law enforcement officers \nfrom across the country. They oppose the administration's proposal \nbecause, as they said:\n\n       [U]nder such regulations, America's State and local law \n     enforcement officers, already strained by countless overtime \n     hours ensuring community safety from terrorist threats, could \n     lose their basic benefit accorded for their efforts.\n\n  A recent national survey shows that working Americans are now \nbecoming more aware of this proposal and have great concerns about it. \nA survey released this past week by Peter D. Hart Research Associates, \npollsters, found that Americans overwhelmingly disagree with the Bush \nadministration proposal. By 17 to 1, the public believes that Federal \nlaws governing overtime should be changed to cover more employees \nrather than fewer. Fifty-one percent said it should cover more \nemployees. Only 3 percent said it should cover fewer employees. \nSeventy-four percent of Americans in this poll oppose the Bush \nadministration's proposal to eliminate several million employees' legal \nright to overtime pay.\n  I would like to take a few minutes to explain briefly how the rules \nwork right now under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Hourly \nworkers are generally guaranteed overtime pay when they work more than \n40 hours a week. That has been accepted since 1938. Many salaried \nworkers are also eligible for overtime pay under current law.\n  So what the administration's proposal would do would be to make it \nmuch easier for employers to deny salaried workers overtime pay \nprotection. The result is that millions of salaried workers, earning \nmore than $22,100 a year, currently eligible for overtime will be \ndenied overtime under these proposed changes. This proposal will keep \nworkers from spending time with their families, working longer hours \nwithout compensation. Employers will be able to force workers to work \nlonger hours without pay.\n  In case someone says that isn't happening, I suggest they might want \nto go back and read the story in the Sunday Post of August 31 by \nKirstin Downey, who documented some of the things that are happening in \nthe country today.\n\n  For example, Wal-Mart Stores, Incorporated, the Nation's largest \nretailer, is facing 37 lawsuits in 29 States from employees who allege \nthey were illegally forced to work extra hours free to meet corporate \nproductivity demands. In December, a Federal jury in Portland, OR, \nfound Wal-Mart guilty of asking workers to clock out and then return to \nwork unpaid. About 400 current and former Wal-Mart employees\n\n[[Page S11061]]\n\nparticipated in the lawsuit, with some workers testifying that they \nfalsified their time records to keep their jobs because they live in \nsmall towns with few other jobs.\n  About 270 insurance claims adjusters have filed suit in U.S. District \nCourt in Washington, DC, alleging that their employer, GEICO, broke the \nlaw by improperly classifying them as workers exempt from overtime pay.\n  Stan Fortune, quoted in this article, age 47, a former Wal-Mart \nmanager in Weatherford, TX, said he felt driven to climb into store \nmanagement ranks during the 17 years he worked there. On one temporary \nassignment in Las Vegas, he said he worked 13 to 14 hours a day from \nSeptember 1 through December 26 with only 1 day off. Said Fortune:\n\n       It builds up to where that's the norm. You get three or \n     four hours' sleep. It becomes what you are used to. Now that \n     I look back it is pretty sad.\n\n  That is happening around the country today. More and more workers are \nbeing asked to work longer hours. What the administration wants to do \nis say: We will make that legal. We are just going to exempt them.\n  American workers already work longer hours than any other \nindustrialized country. Right now, according to this article in the \nWashington Post, according to the International Labor Organization, \nAmerican workers work more than other people in developed economies. \nThey found that American workers put in an average of 1,825 hours per \nyear. French workers, by comparison, average 1,545 hours per year; \nGerman workers, about 1,444 hours per year. According to Lawrence \nJohnson, chief of the ILO's employment trends team:\n\n       The European Union and the United States have two different \n     systems and react to economic conditions differently. . . . A \n     lot of what Europeans have--longer vacations, shorter hours--\n     are legislated, and in the United States, it is handled \n     through collective bargaining.\n\n  The problem is now only 13 percent of American workers are covered \nunder collective bargaining. So most workers are not in the collective \nbargaining agreements that cover overtime.\n  Major women's organizations, including the National Partnership for \nWomen and Families and the American Association of University Women, \noppose this proposal because they fear that an increase in mandatory \novertime would take time away from families and disrupt the schedules \nof working parents as well as impose additional childcare and other \nexpenses.\n  Ross Eisenbrey of the Economic Policy Institute has shown that this \nproposal, probably more than anything else, affects women in this \ncountry. It is women who are working in these jobs that are about at \nthat level, but it is also the women who have to take their children to \nchildcare. So get this: What the administration is saying is that you \nwill have to leave your child in childcare longer hours during the day. \nYou will be forced to work overtime, longer hours, but you won't get \none more nickel for it. Talk about fairness. Talk about compassion.\n  This proposal will not create one new job. It will do just the \nopposite. What it will do is give employers a disincentive to hire \npeople because it will allow them to work their current workers longer \nhours, force them to work longer hours without any extra pay.\n  When President Roosevelt signed the Fair Labor Standards Act into law \nin 1938, he made that exact point, that if a worker is working 50 hours \na week and not getting paid for that, it does two things--takes him \naway from his family and, secondly, it is a disincentive to hire anyone \nelse to work. So that is what this proposal will do. It will add to the \nunemployment figures in America, not put people to work.\n  As columnist Bob Herbert recently wrote in the New York Times:\n\n       You would think that an administration that has presided \n     over the loss of millions of jobs might want to strengthen \n     the protections of workers fortunate enough to still be \n     employed. But that's not what the administration is about.\n\n  Again, as I said in my opening, the administration does not want the \nAmerican worker to find out what they are doing. They didn't hold one \nhearing on its proposed rule. Maybe they thought they would slip it \nthrough and people would not know about it.\n  I don't think we should in the shadows set policy that would affect \nmillions of workers and their families. We need to do it in the open. \nThat is why I plan to offer this amendment.\n  My amendment is very simple. It would prohibit any money, any \ntaxpayer dollars, from being spent to in any way implement any \nadministration proposal that would exempt more workers from overtime \npay protections, who are now currently eligible. Very simple and \nstraightforward. It would allow the administration today, tomorrow, or \nat any time, to increase the number of workers who are eligible for \novertime pay.\n  Again, I wish to take a couple of minutes to clarify some of the \nclaims that some of the opponents of our amendment have made about the \nadministration's proposal.\n  The first claim is that the proposed regulation will only result in \ndenying overtime pay protection to 644,000 workers, not 8 million. \nWell, that is because the administration is only counting people right \nnow who are getting overtime pay. There are millions more eligible for \novertime pay but they are not getting it because the employers don't \nwant to pay the overtime. However, if you now exempt them, the employer \nhas no disincentive whatsoever. They can work those people longer than \n40 hours per week and not have to pay them one additional nickel. So \nthe administration's estimate completely ignores the incentive that \nwill be built in for employers to work these eligible people longer \nhours per week.\n  Claim No. 2: The administration's proposal will actually guarantee an \nadditional 1.3 million low-income workers overtime pay.\n  This is an overstatement. They are saying it because they are raising \nthe current income threshold from $8,060 a year to $22,100 a year--no \none is opposed to that--and it is long overdue. Of course, it has been \nraised several times since 1938.\n  According to the National Employment Law Project--a coalition \nrepresenting the interests of low-wage workers--most, if not all, of \nthose 1.3 million workers were already covered by overtime protections \nbecause they were working in low-paying nonexecutive jobs. They add \nthat the DOL's proposed threshold increase ``does not help nearly \nenough workers, because 80 percent of the workforce still makes \nover the proposed threshold [of $22,100], and workers earning more than \nthe threshold are barely making ends meet in today's economy.'' Again, \nI point out that my amendment does not affect the increase in the \nthreshold limit.\n\n  The third claim they make is that first responders--police and \nfiremen--will not lose their overtime protection with this proposal. \nThey have been making this claim all along. Unfortunately, the proposed \nregulation as written would, in fact, put many first responders--police \nand firefighters and others--at risk of losing overtime eligibility. \nThere is no specific carve-out for first responders. This proposed \nregulation is so vague that it would apply to many first responders who \nmay have minimal supervisory duties.\n  The National Association of Police Officers and the International \nUnion of Police Associations both oppose the regulations as written.\n  The fourth claim: This proposal simplifies current regulations, and \nit will make it easier for employers to determine who qualifies for \novertime and who doesn't. It will also reduce litigation.\n  Well, perhaps that is so. It would reduce litigation because it is \ngoing to exempt all these people from overtime protection. But it is \nnot going to make it easier. In fact, it would make the rules more \nconfusing by replacing well-established standards with vague and \nambiguous language and would spawn litigation over the meaning of these \nnew rules.\n  According to the Chicago Tribune:\n\n       The Labor Department's [Wage and Hour Administrator] Tammy \n     McCutchen predicts a deluge of lawsuits as employees and \n     employers press for clarifications once the new rules go into \n     effect.\n\n  Also, a recent analysis by the Congressional Research Service found \nthat the proposal is vague--it will be largely up to the interpretation \nof employers and the Labor Department to determine who qualifies and \nwho doesn't qualify for overtime pay protection.\n  So what that says to me is that employers will have wide discretion--\ncompared to what they have now--to reclassify and disqualify all kinds \nof\n\n[[Page S11062]]\n\nworkers from overtime pay protection in order to make them work longer \nhours without compensation. I don't really expect the Labor Department \nto proactively go around and check on these employers. They don't do it \nnow. What if a worker complains? How many workers are going to risk \nlosing their jobs by complaining? As a person who worked for Wal-Mart \nsaid, ``In a small town there are no other jobs. Therefore, when they \nwant you to work overtime without any extra pay, that is what you do.''\n  I close by saying that I also believe this proposed regulation is \ndesigned to give cover to employers that are already abusing standing \novertime laws. Lawsuits by the hundreds--cases pending before the Labor \nDepartment that are now months and years backlogged--will be wiped off \nthe books because now the employers that are denying overtime pay will \nbe legal in doing so.\n  So why do we want to make it easier to deny American workers overtime \npay? How does it help the economy to take money away from millions of \nlow- and middle-income men and women?\n  Again, the administration's proposal will do nothing to put money in \nthe pockets of working Americans. It will not create new jobs. It will \nkeep people away from their families longer hours. It is a slap in the \nface to millions of hard-working Americans--men and women who are \nstarting to make ends meet and yet spend some time with their families. \nIt is bad policy. We have an opportunity to stop it with my amendment. \nI plan to offer that shortly. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/04/senate-section/article/S11062-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11062-S11065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WITHDRAWAL OF ESTRADA NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, a few moments ago we received a message \nfrom the White House. I will read the message and I have comments to \nmake on that particular message, and it will explain the interruption \nof the debate on this very important bill that we are addressing.\n  The message from the White House reads:\n\n       To the Senate of the United States:\n       I withdraw the nomination of Miguel A. Estrada, of \n     Virginia, to be United States Circuit Judge for the District \n     of Columbia Circuit.\n\n  That message was signed by President George W. Bush.\n  It was 29 months ago that the President of the United States \nnominated Miguel Estrada. Today, we have received this message that \nMiguel Estrada's name has been withdrawn from further consideration by \nthe Senate. I expect that many on the other side of the aisle will be \nglad of this. Indeed, we have seen our Democrat colleagues block the \nentire Senate from having a very simple, honest up-or-down vote for 29 \nmonths--well over 2 years.\n  Today is a shameful moment in the history of this great institution. \nThe Senate has been denied the right to confirm or reject a brilliant \nand a well-qualified nominee because of the obstruction of the few--a \nhard-working and honorable immigrant American who has excelled in the \npursuit of the law and risen to the very top of his profession has been \nturned away because of the rankest political partisanship.\n  In rising today, I wish to take a moment to express my regret to Mr. \nEstrada and to his family and to express my regret to the American \npeople who have been denied the service of this extraordinarily \ntalented and accomplished man.\n  The record, however, is clear--it is crystal clear: Miguel Estrada \nwas and is superbly qualified to serve on the bench. He was, in fact, \nunanimously well qualified, according to the rating by the American Bar \nAssociation, a rating Democrats once called the gold standard.\n  Miguel Estrada graduated with honors from Columbia University and \nthen from Harvard Law School where he was editor of the Law Review. He \nwent on to public service, including 2 years of service in the Clinton \nadministration. No one--no one--can claim this man is not qualified to \nserve on the Federal judiciary, and I fully expect that some day he \nwill stand for a vote by this Senate again.\n  Mr. President, as you know, earlier this year the Senate engaged in \nan unprecedented month-long debate on the Estrada nomination. This \ndebate has continued for months thereafter and, indeed, before the \nAugust recess we took the seventh--the seventh--cloture vote to end \ndebate and to allow the Senate--a very simple request--a simple up-or-\ndown vote, as the Constitution requires. No nominee has ever had this \nmany cloture votes.\n  As a result of the Estrada debate, the Senate has had the opportunity \nto consider the proper nature of the advise-and-consent role of the \nSenate and to question the propriety of the filibuster as applied to \njudicial nominees. That self-examination is far from over. The fact is \nthat the use of unprecedented filibusters to deny the Senate the \nfreedom to give advice and consent has, I believe, done great harm to \nthe Senate and to, more generally, public discourse.\n  Mr. President, let me review the lengthy saga of Miguel Estrada's \nconfirmation process.\n  Miguel Estrada was nominated by President Bush on May 9, 2001, 29 \nmonths ago. He was among the very first nominees to be sent to the \nSenate for consideration, as the Constitution requires, for this body, \nthe Senate, to advise and consent.\n  It is worth noting since that time Miguel Estrada was nominated, our \ncountry has fought two wars and changed the regimes of two nations.\n  For the first 505 days of the Estrada nomination, the Democrat \nleadership refused even to hold a hearing. They defended this delay by \narguing that they knew nothing about the candidate, as if a hearing \nwere not the usual and customary way to resolve such a concern of \nhearing about the candidate. In truth, there was more in Mr. Estrada's \nrecord than in the records of many judicial nominees Democrats had \ncomfortably confirmed in previous years.\n  Opponents also argued at the time that Estrada lacked judicial \nexperience, despite the fact this was not an impediment to the Clinton \nnominees who had never served on the bench, nominees, it should be \nnoted, who went on to serve on the very same court to which Estrada was \nnominated. In fact, Earl Warren, William Rehnquist, William Douglas, \nLewis Powell, and Thurgood Marshall--none of these great jurists had \nany judicial experience when first nominated to a Federal court. But no \nmatter, our Democrat colleagues continued to obstruct. They continued \ntheir obstructionist tactics. Then after finally giving Mr. Estrada a \nhearing a year ago, they announced it was too late in the year to give \nMr. Estrada a vote in the Judiciary Committee.\n\n  After the Republicans won the majority in 2002 and Democrats no \nlonger controlled the calendar or the committee, opponents moved to \nplan B, to level baseless charges.\n  First came the accusation that Mr. Estrada had ``refused to answer a \nsingle question'' at his hearing. At best, that is hyperbole. In fact, \nMr. Estrada answered over 125 questions. The transcript from Mr. \nEstrada's 7-hour long hearing weighs nearly 3 pounds. Admittedly, the \ntranscript is heavy with questions my colleagues knew full well Mr. \nEstrada could not answer. They knew he could not answer and also \nmaintain his respect for the independent judiciary and abide by the \ncode of judicial ethics.\n  We learned through the course of a lengthy debate that, in truth, \nsome nominees of President Clinton answered fewer than 20 questions. \nOne nominee answered only three questions, and he was smoothly \nconfirmed by a Republican-led Senate.\n  In truth, Mr. Estrada answered more than twice as many questions as \nall three of President Clinton's appointees to the same circuit court \nwere asked at their hearings--all three combined.\n  Such facts as these naturally raise the serious question as to why \nour Democrat colleagues imposed a double standard on this particular \nnominee with his particular background. In fact, the only questions Mr. \nEstrada declined to answer, as previous nominees had similarly declined \nto answer, involved how he would rule on cases that might come before \nhim. During his hearing, Mr. Estrada explained why. He told the \ncommittee members that he prizes the independence of the\n\n[[Page S11063]]\n\njudiciary; that he believes a judge must put aside his personal views \nand maintain impartiality. In my mind, rather than being a reason or a \ncause for opposing his nomination, his integrity only strengthened the \ncase for supporting him.\n  Since that hearing, Democrats had almost 12 months to ask further \nquestions of him--any at all. Repeatedly, the White House offered Mr. \nEstrada to answer any written question posed to him. To my knowledge, \nonly one Democrat Senator took up that extraordinary offer. \nAdditionally, the White House offered Mr. Estrada to meet with any \nSenator. To my knowledge, only two Democrat Senators took up that \nparticular offer. But unlimited availability in writing and in person \nwas simply not enough.\n  Mr. Estrada's opponents continued that partisan drumbeat and \ncontinued to obstruct a simple up-or-down vote by their colleagues so \nwe would have that opportunity to express advice and consent.\n  At the end, when all the false arguments were exposed, our Democrat \ncolleagues fell back on one last carbuncle. They denied Mr. Estrada a \nvote, they said, because the Justice Department refused to hand over to \nthem Mr. Estrada's workpapers from the years while he was in the Office \nof the Solicitor General in the Clinton administration.\n  This was their asking price, despite the fact that every--every--\nsingle living Solicitor General, both Democrat and Republican, told the \nSenate that such a release of documents would create a harmful new \nprecedent against the interest of the American people.\n  All of this now has passed. What the American people now deserve is \nan explanation of why. I suspect many know the answer. The saga of \nMiguel Estrada is a tale of great and unbridled Democratic \npartisanship, and the American people, sadly, are the losers.\n  In the course of the Estrada debate, I observed and I listened and I \nhave reached my own conclusion. I do not believe anyone in the Senate \nwould block a nominee based solely on ethnicity. I do not believe any \nof my colleagues harbor this kind of rank bigotry. I do believe, \nhowever, that what happened to Mr. Estrada was due to base politics.\n  To date, the President has nominated a greater percentage of Hispanic \nnominees to the Federal bench than any President before him. The \nPresident has made clear that he shares the aspiration of the American \npeople to see a Latino serve on the Supreme Court. I believe Miguel \nEstrada's incredible abilities and special talents would have \neventually led him down this path. I believe, as many do, that given \nhis strong credentials, he would be a superb candidate should there be \nan opening on that Court.\n  Many Democrats and hard-left Washington special interests fear that \npossibility. They do not want this President to have a Hispanic nominee \nof Miguel Estrada's extraordinary abilities named to the Supreme Court \nshould a vacancy arise. I believe when all is said and done, the \nAmerican people, who are sensible and fair, will reach a similar \nconclusion about this sorry chapter.\n  The fight is not over. We will continue to press for an up-or-down \nvote for the President's nominees. We will continue to press for \nfairness. We will continue our fight to put qualified women, men, and \nminorities on our courts.\n  We will fight the obstructionist tactics of the Democrats and the \nliberal special interest ideologues that drive them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader \nfor those comments and express my own personal regret on the withdrawal \nof the nomination of Miguel Estrada. It is not too long ago that I was \nin college, in law school, and to hear the academic record of Miguel \nEstrada is enormously impressive. One does not go to Columbia and rank \ncum laude and one does not go to Harvard and serve as editor of the Law \nReview there without very substantial academic achievements.\n  Miguel Estrada is a man with a superb record beyond his academic \nachievements. When the issue was raised about not disclosing the \ncontents of memoranda which he had written when he was an assistant in \nthe Solicitor General's Office is absolutely specious. It is just a red \nherring. There is no reason for that at all. If one is going to ask to \nhave a lawyer's work product made available, there would be an enormous \nchilling effect on lawyers who are working day in and day out \nexpressing their views, giving their opinions in an honest and candid \nway so their superiors can make an evaluation and a judgment as to what \nto do.\n  Having gone to college and law school, and having been a lawyer \nwriting memoranda, which I wrote plenty of, I know the indispensable \nquality of being able to say what you believe without having somebody \nlook over your shoulder years later in an attempt to deny some \nappointment. If you are going to have to play defense all the time, you \ncannot have the kind of ingenuity, assertiveness, independence, and \nintelligence which is what has made our country strong.\n  I believe the country is much weaker for the withdrawal of Miguel \nEstrada as a potential Federal judge. There have been a lot of \nobjections raised to a lot of nominees, but the situation with Estrada \nwas uniquely unmeritorious in what his detractors had to say.\n\n  He is a young man, and I agree with the majority leader that he will \nbe back.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Pennsylvania yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I say to my good colleague from the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania that I know he is on the Judiciary Committee. Since Miguel \nEstrada lives in Virginia, my colleague, John Warner, and I presented \nMiguel Estrada to the Judiciary Committee. The Democrat leader was then \nin charge.\n  Was the Senator from Pennsylvania present at that committee meeting?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I was.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I remember him being there. I remember the joy of that \ncommittee meeting. Miguel Estrada was there. His wife was there. His \nmother Clara and his sister Maria were all there. They were so proud of \nthis young man, who came to this country from Honduras as a teenager. \nHe was unable to speak English. He applied himself, worked hard, and \nwent on to an Ivy League school for undergraduate studies. He then went \nto Harvard Law School, where he graduated magna cum laude. He later \nworked in the Solicitor General's Office under President Clinton, where \nhe argued 15 cases before the Supreme Court of the United States, \nwinning most of them. He also clerked for Supreme Court Justices. The \nAmerican Bar Association unanimously recommended him with their highest \nqualifications. It was really a day of joy. It was uplifting.\n  There were four vacancies on the court. I remember saying \n``adelante'', come, ``Miguel Estrada.'' So people were charged up about \nthis country seeing that a Horatio Alger story still was possible. \nSeeing that if someone worked hard in this country and applied \nthemselves, that if someone recognizes them, like President Bush, and \nallows them to serve their country on the second most important court \nin this country, which is the D.C. Court of Appeals, that everyone \nwould say, this is what America is all about; there is opportunity for \nall people, regardless of their background, so long as they have that \nrecord of performance.\n  Then we saw obstruction month after month. It took everything the \nSenator could do on the Judiciary Committee to even get him out of \ncommittee. When the Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Daschle, was Leader, \nwe could not even get it out of committee. So this hold continued, \nthese personal fouls.\n  Now we come to this day, 28 months after President Bush nominated \nMiguel Estrada. I have not served as long as the Senator from \nPennsylvania, Mr. Specter, or our great leader, Senator Frist of \nTennessee, but I know my colleagues all look at history. Today I think \nis a very sad, dark day in the history of the Senate. An injustice has \nbeen perpetrated, an injustice to this gentleman with impeccable \ncredentials, who is an inspiration to all Americans.\n  In particular, this was an opportunity for a Hispanic American for \nthe\n\n[[Page S11064]]\n\nfirst time ever to serve on the D.C. Court of Appeals. The real motive \nof this obstructionism is not his qualifications, not his judicial \nphilosophy, not claims that Miguel Estrada would be an activist or does \nnot understand the proper role of a judge, but the reality is they want \nto deny him that added aspect on his record of performance that he \nserved on the Court of Appeals. They fear that, should a vacancy arise \non the Supreme Court of the United States, President Bush would like to \nmake history and appoint someone who has the proper judicial philosophy \nand is also a Hispanic American to the Supreme Court.\n  This is a sad day for America. As the Senator from Pennsylvania says, \nhe is a young man. He is willing to serve in the future and we are \ngoing to still champion Miguel Estrada. I know Senator Specter, Senator \nMcConnell, Senator Frist, and those on this side of the aisle, and a \nfew on the other side of the aisle, such as Senator Miller of Georgia, \nSenator Nelson of Florida, Senator Nelson of Nebraska, and Senator \nBreaux of Louisiana, we are going to keep fighting for well-qualified \njudges such as Miguel Estrada.\n  I hope and pray some day in the future we will have another \nopportunity to vote on Miguel Estrada to serve this country, because we \nare going to stand for people of quality, of character, of performance, \nand of competence. This sort of obstruction needs to stop. Senators do \nnot have to vote in favor of judges if they so desire, but they should \nvote one way or the other--not delay, not hold, not obstruct. It is \nwrong to treat people in such an unjust, unfair, and inequitable way.\n  I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, for his great \nleadership in getting Miguel Estrada out of the Judiciary Committee. It \nis a shame and I think a disgraceful day that Miguel Estrada has been \nforced to withdraw his name so he can focus, with his family, on his \nfuture.\n  He has a bright future. I know Senators share my view that he has a \ngreat future for service in this country someday when the Senate stops \nits obstruction.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I have been on the Judiciary Committee for 23 years, and \nvery few nominees have come with Miguel Estrada's record. When a man \ncomes to Washington to serve with that record, we ought to welcome him, \nnot send him packing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on the day of the withdrawal of Miguel \nEstrada, it is important to keep in mind we have approved 145 of the \nPresident's judicial nominees. We have worked with the President to do \nso in a swift and unprecedented pace. Despite the anti-Hispanic \nrhetoric surrounding Mr. Estrada's nomination generated by some on the \nother side of the aisle, a Democratic President appointed the vast \nmajority of Latino Americans serving now in our Federal courts.\n  Mr. Estrada's withdrawal presents a positive opportunity for the \nPresident.\n  I have worked with the Presiding Officer. The President should look \nat what we have done in Nevada as a model for selecting nominees. \nSenator Ensign and I have worked closely on recommending nominees to \nthe White House. I have worked with the junior Senator from Nevada, who \nis a representative of the President's party, in selecting four judges.\n  Larry Hicks, who has waited 10 years to become a judge, was selected \npreviously by the first President Bush. He patiently waited. He was \nnominated again by the Senator from Nevada and confirmed and is now \nsitting as a judge.\n  Jim Meehan, I practiced law in the same community as Judge Meehan. He \nwas a fine lawyer. He has made a fine judge.\n  In the Ninth Circuit, Jay Bybee. Jay Bybee was criticized by some as \nbeing too idealistic, but his background is superb, an academic, \nsomeone who worked not only in academia but worked in various \nadministrations of at least two Presidents. He was approved very \nquickly and swiftly.\n  Yesterday, we completed a hearing on Robert Clive Jones to be a \ndistrict court judge.\n\n  We do not need the furor surrounding judicial nominations. We have \napproved 145 judges. We should work to have bipartisan support of these \njudges. There are lots of judges who have more conservative ideology \nwho do not draw a lot of attention. One hundred forty-five judges have \nbeen approved and three have not been approved.\n  The victim in this has been Miguel Estrada. Miguel Estrada has stated \npublicly that he would answer the questions, but we were told by the \nPresident's counsel that he was not going to answer the questions. We \nwere told by the President's counsel, Mr. Gonzales, that Mr. Estrada \nwould not be allowed to come forward with the memorandums he had \nwritten while in the Solicitor's Office. He was taking directions from \nthe President's lawyer, Mr. Gonzales.\n  If there is a victim in all this, it is Miguel Estrada--I acknowledge \nthat with the majority--but it is caused by the President and the \npeople surrounding him, not caused by us. All we wanted was to have him \nanswer questions and supply the memo while in the Solicitor's Office.\n  I heard a statement as I walked in the room saying we have to stop \nthis kind of obstructionism. One hundred forty-five judges are now \nserving, and we have approved those judges--we have turned down three--\nbut 145 to 3 is not bad. It is overwhelmingly positive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I hope our colleagues listen carefully to \nthe statement of my friend and colleague from Nevada in outlining the \nfactual situation regarding the consideration of Mr. Estrada. He states \nit quite accurately as a member of the Judiciary Committee.\n  The real issue is whether the Senate is going to perform as our \nFounding Fathers expected us to perform. Any fair reading of the \nConstitutional Convention indicates quite clearly until the final few \nweeks of the Constitutional Convention that appointed power of all \nUnited States judges was in the Senate. Only in the last few weeks was \nthe decision made to make it a shared power. It was never understood \nthat we were to be a rubber stamp for anything that the Executive posed \nin terms of judicial nominees.\n  The members of the Judiciary Committee in the Senate take that \nresponsibility very carefully and closely. Part of fulfilling the \nresponsibility after the President makes a nomination is for us to make \na balanced and informed judgment. In order to make a balanced and \ninformed judgment, we ought to know, the people ought to know, the \nSenate ought to know the information the White House knows; that the \nPresident knows when he is going to make a nomination to the district \ncourt, in this case.\n  When the nominee comes before the Judiciary Committee and says, look, \nI am quite prepared to share that information, and where Members of the \nother side of the aisle implore the White House to make that \ninformation available so that there could be a complete understanding \nof the positions taken by Mr. Estrada, and then a movement toward the \ncompletion of the nominee, the White House indicated they were not \ngoing to comply with that particular request. They are the ones who \nmade the judgment that it was more important for them not to have that \ninformation shared than the consideration for the Senate of the United \nStates to make a balanced and informed judgment about the complete \npositions, understanding, and awareness of this nominee and how they \nview the Constitution of the United States.\n\n  I am very hopeful, as the Senator from Nevada pointed out, since \nthere has been sufficient and overwhelming acceptance of so many of the \nWhite House nominees, that in the future we will be able to work out \nthe process so we can have someone who is qualified, someone who can \ncommand the kind of strong support in the Senate as so many other \nnominees have. And, in particular, this is an enormously important \ncourt, as the Senator from Nevada knows, the DC Circuit Court. It has \nvery special jurisdiction.

It is a privilege to join Senator Harkin on this \nurgently needed proposal to protect the 40-hour workweek and the right \nto overtime pay for millions of working men and women. The Bush \nadministration's new regulations are an unfair scheme to prop up \nbusiness profits by allowing firms across America to reduce their costs \nby denying overtime protections to more than 8 million hard-working men \nand women, including 200,000 in my own State of Massachusetts. Police \nofficers, nurses, cooks, clerks, physical therapists, reporters, and \nmany others would be required to work longer hours for less pay.\n  Our amendment is very clear. It says that no worker now eligible for \novertime protections can be denied overtime pay as a result of the new \nregulation.\n  With a failing economy, with more than 9 million Americans out of \nwork, with so many other families struggling to make ends meet, \ncutbacks in overtime pay are a nightmare that no worker should have to \nbear. Overtime pay now makes up a quarter of their total pay, and the \nadministration's proposal will mean an average pay cut of $161 a week \nfor them.\n  Hard-working Americans do not deserve this pay cut, and it is wrong \nfor the administration to force it on them. Overtime protections of the \nFair Labor Standards Act have been a fundamental right of this Nation's \nworkers for more than half a century. This basic law was enacted in the \n1930s to create a 40-hour workweek. It requires workers to be paid \nfairly for any extra hours. Especially in times such as these, it is an \nincentive for job creation because it encourages employers to hire more \nworkers instead of forcing current employees to work longer hours.\n  The economy has lost more than 3 million private sector jobs since \nPresident Bush took office. The Bush administration is wrong to propose \nregulations that will enable businesses to require their employees to \nwork longer hours and reduce the need to hire additional workers.\n  According to the congressional General Accounting Office, employees \nwithout overtime protection are more than twice as likely to work \novertime as those covered by that protection. Americans are working \nlonger hours today than ever before, longer than in any other \nindustrial nation. At least one in five employees now has a workweek \nthat exceeds 50 hours, let alone 40 hours a week.\n  We know that employees across America are already struggling hard to \nbalance their family needs with their work responsibilities. Requiring \nthem to work longer hours for less pay will impose an even greater \nburden to this daily struggle. Protecting the 40-hour workweek is vital \nto protecting the work/family balance for millions of Americans in \ncommunities all across the Nation. The last thing Congress should do is \nto allow this antiworker administration to make the balance worse than \nit already is.\n  Sixty-five years ago the Fair Labor Standards Act was signed into law \nby President Franklin Roosevelt and established minimum wage and \nmaximum work hours. It was in the midst of the Great Depression, and as \nPresident Roosevelt told the country:\n\n     . . . if the hours of labor for the individual could be \n     shortened . . . more people could be employed. If minimum \n     wages could be established, each worker could get a living \n     wage.\n\n  Those words are as true in 2003 as they were in 1938. Our modern \neconomy has lost more private sector jobs during this economic decline \nthan in any recession since the Great Depression.\n  What can the administration be thinking when it comes up with such a \nshameful proposal to deny overtime protections on which millions of \nworkers rely? Congress cannot sit idly by when more and more Americans \nlose their jobs, their homes, their livelihoods, and their dignity. We \nwill continue to battle to restore jobs, provide fair unemployment \nbenefits, raise the minimum wage, and we will do all we can to preserve \nthe overtime protections of which so many American families depend.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this essential proposal to keep faith \nwith the Nation's working families.\n\n  I wish to take a few moments of the time of the Senate to review what \nis happening to American workers in relation to other countries around \nthe world. It is reflected in this chart. The red columns indicate the \nnumber of hours workers are working and comparing it with other \nindustrialized nations of the world.\n  As you can see from this chart, American workers are working longer \nand harder than those in any other industrial nation of the world. That \nhas been a phenomenon that has really developed in the recent times.\n  This chart shows that U.S. work hours have increased while those in \nother industrial nations actually decreased. The United States--we see \nover here the increases; and the decline in other industrial nations. \nSo here we have a workforce that is prepared to work and prepared to \nwork long and hard. Yet we find the administration is attempting to \npenalize these workers for being willing to work and for working long \nand hard.\n  This chart here is ``Workers Without Overtime Protections Are More \nThan Twice As Likely To Work Longer Hours.''\n  What does this chart say? That if the workers do not have the \novertime protections, the employers work them more than twice what they \nwould work if they did have the overtime protection. Why is that \nimportant? Because this particular proposal is taking away this kind of \nprotection. The result will be that the workforce, which is working \nlonger and harder than that in any other industrial nation in the \nworld, is going to find they are going to have to work even longer and \nharder to make ends meet. This is true, even if they are working 50 \nhours a week. Then they are three times as likely to be required to \nwork longer than if they had the overtime protections.\n  So we have a situation where we see Americans working longer and \nharder. We have a situation that, if they do not have the overtime \nprotections, they are required by their employers to work twice as hard \nas those with the overtime protections. In the instances of those who \nwork 50 hours a week, they are required to work three times as hard.\n  These are the facts. Nearly 3 in 10 employees already work more than \n40 hours a week and one in five Americans work more than 50 hours a \nweek. One in five Americans are working more than 50 hours a week. \nThese working Americans don't have the time they need to meet their \nfamily responsibilities.\n  Parents today define that biggest daily challenge as balancing work \nand family responsibilities and instilling values in their children. \nWhen parents have more time to spend with their children, they achieve \nmore academically, improve behavior, and demonstrate lower dropout \nrates.\n  This proposal by the administration is an antifamily proposal because \nit is going to deny essential resources for families to be able to meet \ntheir particular needs. The result will be all the additional social \nproblems that impact families that do not have a chance to be together, \nto stay together, to work together, to pray together, to enjoy each \nother.\n  The Fair Labor Standards Act overtime protection works. Workers are \ncompensated time and a half their regular pay for hours worked in \nexcess of the 40 hours per week. That is what the law is. Employers \nhave a financial disincentive to work employees excessive hours. \nEmployers have an incentive to hire more workers instead.\n  As we see, that is the current law. This is the current employment \nsituation where we see the loss of jobs for more than 3 million \nAmerican workers over this period of time. So we are finding at the \npresent time our workers are working longer and they are working harder \nin order to provide for their families. We have the greatest loss of \njobs that we have had since the time of the Great Depression.\n\n[[Page S11066]]\n\n  What this particular proposal is saying is that isn't even enough. \nEven though you are working longer and working harder than at any time \nbefore, we are going to take away the protections which are going to \neffectively deny the average family who is receiving overtime about \n$161 a week.\n  With all the challenges we are facing in this country, the fact that \nworkers who are working longer and harder and are making $161 on \naverage in overtime is not on the front burner. These Americans are \nworking. They ought to be entitled to that protection.\n  We have now more than 8 million workers--2.5 million workers are \nsalaried employees and 5.5 million hourly workers--who will lose their \novertime pay under the Bush proposal. Even some who are salaried \nworkers are eligible for overtime. This is 8 million who would be \neligible for overtime who will be denied that.\n  Even the business community admits this will have widespread effects. \nAccording to the Society for Human Resource Management:\n\n       This is going to affect every workplace, every employee, \n     and every professional.\n\n  This is widespread in its impact on working families in this country.\n  This is a chart which should give you some kind of historical \nperspective of the number of workers who were protected in terms of \novertime. The percentage of workers who were not protected was 17 \npercent in 1983. In 1998, it was 20 percent. Now, under the Bush \nproposal--here it is--33 percent. Thirty-three percent of the workers, \neffectively.\n  It includes the 8 million who will not be eligible. The impact of \nthis is very clear. That is sort of a major pay cut for workers. \nAmerican workers are working longer and harder than any other \nindustrial society in the world. Who are they? They are millions of \nworkers who would lose overtime protections under the Bush proposal.\n  Let us be clear for any who are watching this debate. Police officers \nwill be affected. Nurses will be affected. Cooks and chefs and clerical \nworkers will be affected. Firefighters and physical therapists will be \naffected. It is interesting that these are first responders--police \nofficers, firefighters, and nurses. They are our first responders. We \nare talking about trying to give support to our first responders on the \none hand, and on the other hand we are taking away the economic \nprotections they need to provide for their families.\n  We continue along with the various groups: Paralegals, reporters, \ndental hygienists, graphic artists, bookkeepers, lab technicians, and \nsocial workers.\n  The interesting irony is that they are our first responders. We not \nonly fail to give support to the local communities which they need for \nthe first responders to terrorism, but on the other hand we are sending \na message to the police officers, firefighters, and nurses that we are \ngoing to reduce their pay at the same time. What kind of message is \nthat at a time when we are talking about homeland security?\n  Millions of workers depend on their overtime pay to make ends meet. \nThe most recent statistics show that overtime pay accounted for more \nthan 25 percent of the income of workers who worked overtime which they \ndepend on in terms of their income. The workers are stripped of their \novertime protection, and they will be forced to work longer hours for \nless pay.\n  That is what this is about. It is just a major broadside against \nworkers in America who are working longer and harder, attempting to \nmaintain their jobs, hopeful that they won't be dismissed or fired as a \nresult of the economic policies of this administration which has seen \nthe greatest growth of unemployment since the Great Depression as a \nresult of economic policy.\n  The Senator from Iowa will remember when we had different economic \npolicies. We had them during the period of President Clinton when we \nhad the longest period of economic growth and price stability in this \ncountry since the early part of the 1960s. That was because of economic \nleadership at the national level. In the early 1960s, we had the \nlongest period of economic growth and price stability than we had for \nbetter part of the century.\n  National economic leadership is essential in terms of ensuring the \npeople are going to work. We have a failed economic policy with 3 \nmillion people left out of work. And for those who are left in, we are \ncutting back on the pay of some of the hardest working individuals in \nthe world. That is unfair. That is unjust. It is done by the issuance \nof a regulation rather than as a result of legislation and hearings. It \nwill not stand.\n  I commend the Senator from Iowa for his leadership in this area \nbecause he is involved in some other issues that affect working people \nand farmers and others on the forefront. I commend him for all he has \ndone. I am proud to join with him in resisting this proposal because it \nis just wrong. It is wrong for the workers. It is wrong for our \neconomy. It is wrong for families. This is a family issue. It is a \nhomeland security issue. It is a children's issue. It is a women's \nissue because so many of these workers who work overtime in the economy \nare women.\n\n  Make no mistake, the women will be hurt by this proposal. They are \nworking hard and trying to raise their families. Make no mistake about \nwho is being impacted on this.\n  It has broad implications in terms of our economy. It is not right, \nit is not fair, it is not just, it is bad economics, and it is just \nlousy policy.\n  There are those of us who will be joining together with the Senator \nfrom Iowa to see that we resist this proposal.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I first wish to thank the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts for his many years of leadership and support on issues \nthat really affect working families in America. No one has fought \nlonger and harder and more successfully in the past to protect the \nworking families of America than the senior Senator from Massachusetts. \nI am very proud to have his support for this amendment and for his \njoining us in trying to do what we can to stop this assault on the \nAmerican working families, as the Senator so ably pointed out.\n  I must say to the Senator that people ask me all the time: Why would \nthey do this? Why would the administration, sort of under the cover of \ndarkness, want to at this point in time, or any time, take away the \nprotections of overtime pay for millions of Americans? I must tell the \nSenator from Massachusetts that I am hard pressed to answer that \nquestion. Why would they want to do this? I throw up my arms. It makes \nno sense economically. It is antifamily, as the Senator from \nMassachusetts pointed out. It is bad economic policy. We are not going \nto create more jobs. In fact, we will cause the loss of more jobs. I am \nhard pressed.\n  I wonder if the Senator has any ideas to help me answer constituents \nand others who ask me why the administration proposes an outlandish \nassault on working families. I am at a loss. I don't know if the \nSenator can help me. Maybe they have given in to some of the people in \nthe business community. As I say, it is not all the people. Not all the \npeople in the business community agree with us. But there are a few who \nare pushing.\n  Maybe the answer is that people in the business community just want \nto be able to tell their workers what to do, when to do it, and how to \ndo it, with no restrictions whatsoever on how they tell their workers \nwhat to do and when they can work. That is the best I can come up with.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The only answer I can reach is that it is the result of \npressure being exerted on the administration by these business groups \nthat do not want to be in a position of having to hire additional \nworkers, and they don't want to be paying additional overtime pay that \nhas been a part of the whole social balance in this country and society \nand recognized as such by Republicans and Democrats since the 1930s.\n  Forty hours of work a week is what workers ought have as an \nopportunity for employment. Under special circumstances, if they are \ngoing to have to work longer or want to work longer, they get the time \nand a half.\n  Now what we undermining is the age-old concept about the importance \nof protecting a 40-hour week. We are effectively eliminating that. Make \nno mistake about it. Effectively, the 40-hour workweek will be \neliminated for\n\n[[Page S11067]]\n\nmillions of workers with this proposal because now employers will be \nable to require hours from the workers without having to give them fair \ncompensation.\n  But let me ask the Senator. The Senator from Iowa is a floor manager \nwith the Senator from Pennsylvania on this legislation which has \nimportant funding for education programs, for health programs, for job \ntraining programs, for the NIH, and all the research we are doing in \nterms of cancer research--all kinds of research.\n  Is it true that this administration has said, if their proposal--\nwhich will deny millions of workers overtime pay--is eliminated, this \nadministration and this President will veto the underlying bill which \nthey feel so strongly about in terms of the income of working families \nwho are working longer and harder providing for their children; that \nthey are prepared to risk the funding of these vital services which are \nabsolutely at the heart of the quality of life of the American people?\n  Am I correct in understanding that this is the administration's \nposition, that they feel so strongly about taking away the overtime pay \nfor workers that they are prepared to risk the whole funding stream for \neducation, for health, for NIH, and for job training, the range of \ndifferent services that are so important to the well-being and health \nand education of people in this country?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I just respond to the Senator, he made a great point. I \ncan only say what Reuters news agency reported 1 day ago, yesterday, \nsaying:\n\n       The White House issued a veto threat . . . against a \n     Democratic bid to derail its proposed changes in federal work \n     rules that [would] cost millions of Americans overtime pay. . \n     . .\n       If the Senate adopted the amendment, President Bush's \n     advisers would recommend he veto the spending bill, the White \n     House budget office said.\n\n  I say to the Senator from Massachusetts, this is again mind-boggling, \nthat if the Senate expresses its will that we do not want these rules \nto go into effect, they are going to veto this bill that has money in \nit for vital basic medical research for all of NIH, the National \nInstitutes of Health, all of the funding for higher education and Pell \ngrants--and, by the way, I know the Senator and others have amendments \nto make sure we get those Pell grants up, and I support him in that \neffort--all of the funding for elementary and secondary education, Head \nStart programs, maternal and child health care programs. They are going \nto veto the whole thing because they are so adamant that they want to \ntake away overtime pay from American workers.\n  I hope this is a mistake. I hope Reuters was wrong, but I can only \nrely upon what they have said. The White House has not communicated \nthis to me directly, but this has been reported from the White House, \nthat they are going to veto this bill over this.\n  I say to the Senator from Massachusetts, I am glad he mentioned that \nbecause, again, it just shows to me the zeal--the zeal--with which this \nadministration and their advisers want to attack working families in \nthis country and to take away overtime pay; that they are willing to \nput out that threat of a veto and take away Head Start Program funding, \nmaternal and child health care, elementary and secondary education, all \nthe other things that are in this bill, simply because they want to \ntake away overtime pay from millions of American workers. Again, I find \nthis bordering on the bizarre.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I say to the Senator, I certainly agree. I know we are \ngoing to have an opportunity to address this and debate this issue, but \nI hope our colleagues, over the period of the next day or so, will \nreally think long and hard and deeply about this proposal.\n  We have been attempting in this body to raise the minimum wage for \nworking families. Effectively, without raising the minimum wage this \nyear, we will lose all of the gains of the last increase. And we are \ndenied on the other side of the body. We indicated we would like to \nraise the minimum wage.\n  In fact, there are millions of workers in this country who are \nworking two or three jobs a day. These are primarily women. About 62 or \n63 percent of those workers who earn the minimum wage are women. One-\nthird of those women have children, so it is a children's issue. It is \na women's issue. It is a civil rights issue because most of the people \nworking at the minimum wage are men and women of color. And it is a \nfairness issue.\n  The American people support overwhelmingly the fact that people who \nwant to work hard, 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, should not have to \nlive in poverty for themselves and their children. We cannot get a vote \non it. The other side will not let us have a vote on it.\n  So they will not let you take care of those who are at the lower end \nof the economic ladder. Here they are going on to take the overtime \naway. They have assaulted Davis-Bacon, which is ways of giving \nprotection to workers who are trying to do a decent job in terms of \nbuilding and constructing the great parts of American commerce. And \nwhat in the world, we find out that on the issue of worker health and \nsafety, they are now rescinding the proposed tuberculosis standards \nwhich have been in development for 10 years, when we have a \ndramatic increase in the problems of tuberculosis and other airborne \ndiseases in this country. The list goes on and on.\n\n  What is it about this administration? With all the challenges, with \nIraq adrift, our grids and electrical systems crashing, the judicial \nnomination process in shambles, and the economy sputtering, they are \nspending their time attacking and assaulting working men and women in \nthis country. Can the Senator possibly help me understand how this is a \npriority, given all the other kinds of needs we are facing in this \nNation?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I respond to the Senator from Massachusetts, from all the \npolls we have seen, all the data we have seen, the American people do \nnot want this. They want more overtime pay protection, not less.\n  I say to the Senator from Massachusetts, while he was speaking, I was \nthinking about something I said a few days ago about the fact that the \nadministration is turning the clock back prior to 1938 when we passed \nthe Fair Labor Standards Act. And someone said that was sort of \noverblown rhetoric on my part--that of course no one wants to turn the \nclock back.\n  As I started doing more research into what happened with the Fair \nLabor Standards Act, I came across an interesting item. The first kind \nof strikes that occurred asking for an 8-hour day started in 1886, the \nfamous Haymarket Square riot in Chicago. That was trying to get an 8-\nhour day at that time. This finally built up to the 1930s during the \nGreat Depression. The 40-hour workweek was a compromise. The Senate, in \n1937, passed a measure providing for a 30-hour workweek. Think about \nthat. If we were to propose a 30-hour workweek around here, I don't \nknow how many votes you would get. You would not get many.\n  In 1937, the Senate passed a measure providing for a 30-hour \nworkweek. It was only because business ganged up and they said they had \nto compromise, and they compromised on a 40-hour workweek.\n  So when I say they are turning the clock back to before 1938, I mean \nit. That is exactly what they are trying to do, put us back to a time \nwhen people worked 10, 12 hours a day with no compensation for it and \nhad little time with their families. That is exactly what this measure \nis intended to do.\n  You couple that with what the Senator from Massachusetts said about \nDavis-Bacon, the fact that we can't even get a vote on the minimum \nwage. The Senator from Massachusetts for the last couple, 3 years has \nbeen trying to get this vote up. We can't get a vote up. They won't let \nus vote on it. I hope we will vote sometime this year on the minimum \nwage. But these are all attacks on workers.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. All of them.\n  (Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. DAYTON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have the floor, and after the Senator has finished, I \nwill be glad to yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Go ahead.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Isn't it also true that this administration proposed \neliminating taxation on other income? Doesn't the Senator think it is a \nlittle odd for an administration to be penalizing people who want to \nwork, people who want to work overtime and, at the same time, providing \ntax breaks or tax elimination for people who don't work for their \nincome?\n\n[[Page S11068]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is quite correct. There is a panoply of \ndifferent issues that affect working families. On each and every one of \nthem, I think any fair assessment is that the administration comes down \non the wrong side of it. Today it is overtime. And this is a debate at \nthe core of what policy this administration is focused on.\n  But I think, as Senator Dayton and others have pointed out, there are \na whole range of issues that shortchange American workers, and we have \nevery intention of continuing the battle for them.\n  Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly on another subject. I \nknow there are others who want to speak. But I will just take a moment \nof the Senate's time to address an education issue which, hopefully, we \nwill have a chance to address and debate further. But I think it is \nimportant that we have it out in the Record so our colleagues are aware \nof it.\n  Mr. President, many of us are deeply concerned about the continuing \nfailure of our appropriations for education to fulfill to promise that \nthe Congress and the administration made to pay for the school reforms \nof No Child Left Behind signed just a year and a half ago.\n  Make no mistake, the bill before us continues to have harsh cuts in \neducation that will hurt families, students, and teachers throughout \nthe country. These are the children of these workers we were just \ntalking about.\n  The President and Congress promised to reform and improve public \neducation, to leave no child behind over a year ago. We said to the \nparents and teachers: Help is on its way. But if we pass the school \nbudget before us, the message to parents and teachers and schools would \nbe: You are on your own.\n  A pattern is emerging. Each year the President picks a large area to \nwork on in a bipartisan fashion and promises compassion and help. In \nthe past, that area has been in education. This year, it is the global \nAIDS crisis, and we hope that the promised support will happen. But on \neducation, the promises made consistently have been broken. In fact, \nthe bill before us contains a litany of broken promises on education, \nbecause the Republican Congress refuses to keep them:\n  In January 2002, President Bush promised that ``America's schools \nwill be on a new path of reform . . . our schools will have greater \nresources to meet those goals.'' But the bill before us cuts funding \nfor the No Child Left Behind Act by $200 million. We have raised \nstandards and raised expectations on school children. We hold schools \naccountable for better performance. Yet now, the Republican majority \nwants to cut funding for school reform.\n  President Bush promised that we would ``leave no child behind,'' and \nthat became the title of the landmark school reform bill he signed into \nlaw over a year and a half ago.\n  But the bill before us leaves 6 million children behind. It \nunderfunds the Title I program for needy children by over $6 billion. \nUnder the Republican education budget, some 6 million needy children \nwill not get smaller classes, will not get supplemental services, and \nwill not get the special attention they need to meet high standards.\n  In March of last year, President Bush promised to support teachers, \nmaking sure they ``get the training they need to raise educational \nstandards.''\n  But the bill before us cuts 20,000 teachers from professional \ndevelopment programs. It completely eliminates training for teachers in \ntechnology. We need to upgrade and expand teacher quality efforts, not \ndowngrade teacher training. The No Child Left Behind Act requires \nschools to give every classroom a high quality teacher. They need more \nresources, not fewer resources, to reach that goal.\n  President Bush promised that his Administration ``will promote \npolicies that expand educational opportunities for Americans from all \nracial, ethnic, and economic backgrounds.''\n  The bill before us undermines support for non-English speaking \nchildren and undermines support for many of the nation's neediest \nchildren.\n  The bill before us cuts 32,000 children from English as a Second \nLanguage programs.\n  It cuts 40 percent of funding for the children of migrant workers \nstruggling to get their GED and go to college.\n  It eliminates dropout prevention funding.\n  It eliminates the Thurgood Marshall Scholarship program.\n  This legislation basically does nothing to help families afford \ncollege, at a time when the rising cost of college is keeping minority \nand low-income students out. Average public college tuition rose almost \nten percent this past year. The average public university's annual \ncosts now equal more than 62 percent of a working class family income. \nEach year, over 400,000 college-ready, low-income students do not \npursue a four-year college degree, because they cannot afford the cost. \nYet this bill has a zero increase in individual student Pell grants, \nzero increase in the campus-based financial aid program, and zero \nincrease in the college work study program.\n  After all the promises made and all the public visits to schools, how \ncan we possibly approve a cut to the No Child Left Behind Act?\n  If we intend to hold schools and students accountable, Congress and \nthe Administration have to be accountable too. We know what works in \nschool reform. When we provide the resources, we know that schools can \nbe turned around. They can upgrade their curricula, provide diagnostic \ntests that identify learning needs early, train teachers in the latest \nand best instructional techniques, and give students the after-school \nacademic help and English language instruction they deserve. We have \nseen hundreds of high-poverty schools across the country turn \nthemselves around with exactly these reforms, because they have the \nnecessary resources to do. We need more, not fewer, resources for \nschool reform, so that the reforms we say we care so much about can \nactually succeed.\n\n  Sadly, the Senate is suddenly starting to move even more harshly in \nthe wrong direction. For the first time in eight years, the Senate \neducation budget is lower than the House proposed education budget. And \nthe House Republican bill falls short by over $8 billion, compared to \nthe amount needed to fully carry out the No Child Left Behind Act. The \nSenate bill before us is even worse. This bill actually cuts funds for \nthe No Child Left Behind Act.\n  Obviously, money is not the answer to all the problems of our \nschools. But the way we allocate resources in the federal budget is a \npretty clear expression of our view of the nation's priorities. And the \npriorities on education reflected in the bill before us--the product of \na Republican-only budget process--are profoundly wrong.\n  I hope a bipartisan group of colleagues will come together as we \nconsider this legislation, and keep the promises we made to help these \nschools. Our nation and our nation's schools and students deserve no \nless.\n  I want to talk about the issue of higher education, specifically. In \nthe area of education, the amendment I offer with Senator Collins \nincreases the maximum Pell grant by $500, increases other financial aid \nto keep pace with the soaring tuition costs college students and their \nfamilies are now facing. A coalition of 56 higher education and student \norganizations throughout the country supports it. The $2.2 billion is \noffset by the same mechanism the majority uses in the underlying \nsubstitute to offset their funding levels. We rescind $2.2 billion in \nfiscal year 2004 advanced appropriations made in fiscal 2003 and \nreappropriate those funds in fiscal 2003.\n  Our Nation faces a growing crisis in higher education because of the \nsoaring costs of tuition in recent years. The crisis is now far worse \nbecause State and local budgets are in crisis, too. Cash-strapped \nStates are dealing with $80 billion in deficits by cutting higher \neducation funds and forcing public colleges to raise tuition. According \nto a USA Today report last week, over 40 percent of public colleges in \nAmerica, which educate three-quarters of all college students, are \nraising tuition by more than 10 percent a year. There has been a $1,750 \nincrease in tuition and fees at the University of Massachusetts. \nNorthern Virginia Community College, which has the most community \ncollege students in Virginia, has raised tuition by 45 percent. Iowa \nhas raised tuition by 19 percent at all public colleges. The University \nof Arizona has raised tuition by 28 percent; the University of Missouri \nby 18 percent.\n\n[[Page S11069]]\n\nUnless this amendment is adopted, over 100,000 current college students \nare in danger of dropping out because of higher tuition costs and zero \nincreased financial aid.\n  Hard-working students are threatened, students like Tawn Pham at the \nUniversity of Massachusetts in Boston. Tawn is 21 years old. He works \nat the local courthouse. He is a Pell grant recipient. He borrows \nStafford loans. His family came to America from Vietnam in 1987. \nWithout financial aid, he would never have gone to college. Without \nincreased financial aid, his college education is threatened by recent \ntuition and fee hikes. The American dream we all pay homage to is \nthreatened for young students like Tawn Pham because of our threatened \nfailure to increase financial aid.\n  The answer is not simply to allow students to borrow more and more. \nVast numbers of college students are already borrowing, for example, \ntens of thousands of dollars to pay for their education. Twenty years \nago a typical aid package was 40 percent loans, 60 percent grants. \nToday the figures are reversed. The typical package is now 60 percent \nloans and 40 percent grants. And students who are pursuing graduate \nwork confront upwards of $120,000 in student loan debt. Yet the banking \nindustry proposed that students borrow even more at higher interest \nrates to go to college.\n  Last year the Bush administration proposed to make consolidated \nstudent loans more expensive. No young person should have to mortgage \ntheir future in order to go to college. They should be paying off the \nloans they have at lower interest rates, not higher interest rates.\n\n  Vast numbers of students are already taking jobs to defray the costs \nof their education. Half of all college students who take part-time \njobs are now working 25 hours a week and trying to be full-time \nstudents, too. Their studies are clearly suffering, and so is their \nfuture.\n  According to GAO, only 41 percent of students who work between 20 and \n31 hours a week complete a college degree. For students who work 32 \nhours a week or more, the figure is even worse.\n  Sadly, this bill provides virtually no new help for students and \nfamilies struggling to pay the increased cost of higher education.\n  In the bill before us, there is zero increase in the maximum Pell \ngrant; zero increase in Perkins loans; zero increase in work-study aid; \nzero increase in campus-based financial aid; zero increase in support \nfor leveraged State student aid.\n  The amendment Senator Collins and I are proposing is a stopgap effort \nto provide assistance for hard-pressed college students and their \nfamilies. It will help the 4.8 million Pell grant recipients whose \nmedian family income is $15,000 a year. There are 4.8 million students \nwho are going to institutions of higher learning, and their family \nincome is $15,000 a year. It will bring new Pell grants to 200,000 new \nrecipients. It will expand the TRIO and the GEAR-UP Programs to enable \nhistorically underrepresented students to achieve the goal of a college \neducation. It supports graduate students in the science, humanities, \nand public interest.\n  It will bring us a step closer to guaranteeing all Americans a \npromise of education security. Just as we have made Social Security and \nMedicare a promise to our senior citizens over 60 years ago, we should \nmake education security a promise to young men and women. If you work \nhard, finish high school, and are accepted for admission to college, we \nshould guarantee you will have the opportunity to earn a college \ndegree.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the pending amendment. Surely we have \nreached the stage in America where we can say it and mean it--inability \nto pay the cost will never again be a barrier to the dream of a college \neducation.\n  I would just point my colleagues' attention to a statement from the \nadministration, an administration policy. I will include the relevant \nparts--executive branch, September 2 statement, Pell grant programs:\n  ``The bill provides $12.2 billion for Pell grants, $538 million less \nthan the President's request for the high priority program.''\n  This is the administration saying that the underlying substitute is \n$538 million below what the President of the United States even \nrequested.\n  Under the Department's most recent estimates of Pell, the Senate \nlevel may be insufficient to cover the cost for student awards in 2004. \nThat's true.\n  We believe that this amendment that we're offering ought to be \naccepted. It is related obviously not only to those children who are \ngoing on to college, but it also helps and assists GEAR-UP children \ncoming in--which are basically the children who would fit into this \ncategory, and helps the TRIO Programs. It gives general support for the \neducation continuum for these children that would otherwise definitely \nnot have the chance to attend higher education.\n  I ask unanimous consent to set the pending amendment aside so that I \nmight offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1566 To Amendment No. 1542\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I understand there are a number of \npending amendments, the order of which and\n\n[[Page S11070]]\n\nthe time of which will be worked out by the floor managers. We wanted \nto make available to the Members today this amendment. We will \nobviously work with the leadership and floor managers to have \nappropriate time for debate and discussion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, first I wanted to speak on Senator \nHarkin's amendment with regard to protecting overtime pay for hard-\nworking Americans. I also want to second the efforts Senator Kennedy is \nmaking. Both Senators Harkin and Kennedy are giants with regard to \nprotecting hard-working Americans who are under incredible stress in \nour economy today.\n  I heard Senator Kennedy talk about the people with $15,000 annual \nincomes who benefit from Pell grants. Tuitions are going up 15, 20 \npercent across the board. They are 9 percent in New Jersey, so I guess \nwe are doing well at Rutgers. We are not increasing our financial aid \nat all. The Senator also knows that back in the drawing rooms of the \nEducation Department they are changing the regulations that are \nreducing the amount of grants and availability of funding for both \ngrants and financial aid for middle-class Americans. It is unbelievable \nwhat we are doing to and the pressure we are putting on the American \npeople, the hard-working people who drive this economy. I compliment \nthe Senator on his efforts in raising this issue on higher education.\n  I think what singles out more than almost anything I have heard \ndebated is trying to take away overtime pay for the American people. I \nam just one individual who believes that the best way to grow our \neconomy is to have rising tides lift all boats, making sure everybody \nparticipates in the excellence and the wealth of America. But we are \ndoing everything we can to undermine that for millions of American \nworkers. So I am proud to join Senator Harkin, Senator Kennedy, and all \nthose who want to speak up for those who are making America work.\n  We are talking about the whole of America's economy. We need to put \nit in the context of what is happening in the American economy. People \ntalk about the stock market going up, rising to the point that we have \nrecouped $2 trillion of $7 trillion lost; but the fact is we have not \nrecouped job one yet during any kind of economic turnaround. Nine \nmillion Americans are unemployed today. A million have dropped out--\nactually 2 million have stopped looking for jobs. The unemployment rate \nhovers at 6.2 percent even today. We have heard that unemployment \nclaims went up to 15,000 today, the highest in the last 12 weeks, above \nthe threshold that shows there is weakening job growth in the economy.\n  The average length of unemployment is longer than it has ever been--\n19 weeks. It spiked this summer to the highest level in two decades. \nQuite honestly, we are seeing the worst employment recession we have \nhad since the Great Depression. It is a real problem for working \nAmericans. And now we are trying to make it really hard on the people \nwho do have jobs. Not only are we not doing addressing unemployment in \nthis country in a real sense, but we are now placing burdens on those \nwho actually are delivering and working every day. I think it is just \ndiscouraging to undermine the economic well-being of those who are \nworking, as well as ignoring those who are left out in this jobless \nrecovery we have.\n  Senator Harkin has been so eloquent in talking about this back-to-\nhistory view of where we are taking ourselves. Looking at the 1938 Fair \nLabor Standards Act and the 40-hour workweek--one of the highest ones \nin economically developed countries--nobody is arguing that we ought to \nchange that; we are saying you ought to get time and a half when \nworking overtime, and we should define it in a way that is \nreally meaningful for people who work on hourly wages.\n\n  I just don't understand the timing. I don't understand the \nproposition of it. We should be encouraging having resources in the \npockets of people who will go out and spend it and drive the economy. \nWhen we are talking about how we get jobs growing in this country, \npeople need the ability to create demand. This does the opposite. It \njust seems hard to understand why we want to strip workers of their \nright to overtime pay, particularly at a time of economic stress in our \neconomy.\n  American families are the drivers of our economy. It is the vast \nmiddle class in this country who are in these jobs. They are not in \nexecutive positions. This is not redefining what executive positions \nare. This is trying to cut away at the bulk of those people who are \nworking on an hourly basis, really providing so much of what is good \nhappening in our economy.\n  These changes mean real losses--on average, 25 percent of annual \nincome--for an estimated 8 million Americans. By the way, if that \nhappens, what does that do to the competitive labor market, or for \nchanges in what is going on? This is about building up the bottom line \nof corporate America at the expense of working Americans. Again, I go \nback to rising tides lift all boats and why we want to undermine the \neconomic well-being of policemen, nurses, firefighters, EMTs, and even \njournalists. Some of us sometimes have trouble with them, but \njournalists are also folks who would be carved out of this.\n  I have heard Senator Kennedy say--and I am sure Senator Harkin \nmentioned this before--that so much of this is focused on women in the \nworkplace. It is incredible. We are asking families to have two wage \nearners so they can make it in today's society, and we have turned the \nsituation into where overtime pay will be taken away from the folks \nmaking the sacrifices, trying to get their kids into higher educational \nenvironments where they can have access to the American promise.\n  I don't get it. I don't think the American people get it. I think we \nhave to make sure everyone understands this administration, and those \nwho believe they want to so-call ``clarify'' the rules and change them, \nis really undermining the economic health and welfare of our American \nmiddle class--the people who are paying the bills, living their lives \nwithin the rules, and doing the right things for everyone.\n  Mr. President, this country deserves better, in my view. I stand \nfully behind the efforts of Senator Harkin and those who are pushing \nvery hard to block this work rule change that I think undermines the \nhealth of our economy and the health and welfare of working Americans \nin our economy. It is bad and it should not go through. We need to \nsupport this amendment that protects working Americans. By the way, \nthat will be good for everybody. That will be good for business, good \nfor creating demand in our society, and I hope we understand we have to \nlook at this on a holistic basis, not on something that just helps \nspecial interests and a limited number of folks in our economy.\n  I think we can do a lot to improve our economy. One of the ways to do \nit is to stop these kinds of actions from taking place. I am proud to \nstand with Senator Harkin in this effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am a little confused because for the last \nhour I have been listening to debate on an overtime amendment and, as \nfar as I can tell, an overtime amendment has not been laid down. But it \nis my understanding that when it is, what it will do is keep the \nSecretary of Labor from spending a single dollar to review the proposed \nrule dealing with overtime.\n  Now, the process we usually have is that agencies propose rules, they \npublish them, and then they get comments. As I understand it, there are \n80,000 comments on this. Now, the job of the agency following that is \nto take those comments into consideration and, if worthy, put them into \nthe rule. What we are saying is we don't want anybody to look at what \nthe public is saying; we don't want anybody to say what the 80,000 \npeople who took the time to comment said. We don't want to see if there \ncan be a change to this rule. We think we can blast it best in its \npresent form. So don't let the Secretary look at the comments.\n  It is her job to look at them. It is her job to see if there needs to \nbe a change to the proposed rule. All this amendment does is keep the \nSecretary from taking that action. I suppose it is no coincidence that \nwe are possibly taking up this amendment right after the Labor Day \nweekend. Each year at this time, we honor those who work hard and help \nto strengthen the economies of our States and the country. The holiday \ncannot help but remind us of\n\n[[Page S11071]]\n\nthose workers this amendment purports to protect.\n  Now we must carefully consider who is really helped and hurt by this \namendment--this amendment that stops the Secretary of Labor from \nlooking at 80,000 comments on ways to improve her rule.\n  Most of us were able to spend a considerable amount of the August \nwork period meeting with our constituents. At each town meeting I held, \nthere was usually someone in attendance who was quite concerned about \nGovernment regulations. I was often told to rein in big Government, \nkeep the rules and regulations simple, current, responsive, and make \nsure they make sense in today's everchanging workplace.\n  This amendment that would keep the Secretary of Labor from looking at \nthe 80,000 comments has the opposite approach. Instead of keeping the \nregulations simple and current, it would prohibit the Secretary of \nLabor from updating the rules exempting white-collar employees from the \nFair Labor Standards Act overtime requirements. Simply put, it is an \nattempt to reject the new, turn back the clock, look to yesterday for \nthe answer to tomorrow's problems. It is an approach that is doomed to \nfailure before it is even applied, and I am opposed to it.\n  There is no question that the workplace has dramatically changed \nduring the last half century. It changed during the last half decade. \nThe regulations governing white-collar exemptions, however, remain \nsubstantially the same as they were 50 years ago. The existing rule \ntakes us back to a time when workers held titles such as ``straw \nboss,'' ``keypunch operator,'' ``legman,'' and other occupations that \ndo not exist today. As our economy has evolved, new occupations have \nemerged that were not even contemplated when those regulations were \nwritten 50 years ago.\n  A 1999 study by the General Accounting Office recommended that the \nDepartment of Labor ``comprehensively review current regulations and \nrestructure white-collar exemptions to better accommodate today's \nworkplace and to anticipate future workplace trends.'' That was the \nGeneral Accounting Office telling the Department of Labor they needed \nto ``comprehensively review current regulations and restructure white-\ncollar exemptions to better accommodate today's workplace and to \nanticipate future workplace trends.'' That is precisely what the \nDepartment of Labor's proposal to update and clarify the white-collar \nregulations will do.\n  While the Department's proposal will update and clarify, this \namendment will do neither. It keeps it from happening, it keeps the \ncomments from being reviewed, and it will set the clock back to 1954 \nand try to force the square peg of the jobs of the 21st century into \nthe round hole of the workplace of 50 years ago.\n  I am a former shoe salesman, and I know how to tell when something \nwill not fit. This amendment just will not fit. It is like trying to \nforce a size 10 foot into a size 6 shoe. It will not fit no matter how \nhard you try.\n  So let's be clear about what this amendment will do. The amendment \nthat keeps the Secretary from looking at the 80,000 comments will \nundermine the Department of Labor's efforts to extend overtime \nprotection to 1.3 million low-wage workers. Under the current rules, \nthese 1954 rules, only those rare workers earning less than $8,060 a \nyear are automatically protected for overtime. You have to make under \n$8,060 to automatically be protected.\n  The administration's proposed rule would raise that threshold to \n$22,100. As a result, 20 percent of the lowest paid workers would be \nguaranteed overtime pay. The overtime provisions of the Fair Labor \nStandards Act were originally intended to protect lower income workers. \nThe proposed rules would provide lower income workers with the \nprotection they deserve.\n\n  By undermining the administration's efforts to better protect lower \nincome workers, whom will this amendment protect? The supporters of \nthis amendment claim that an estimated 8 million workers will become \nineligible for overtime under the proposed rules. However, this \nestimate is based on a study by the Economic Policy Institute, and I \nhave to tell you, Mr. President, it looks as if it is riddled with \nerrors.\n  For example, the study includes in its calculations at least 18 \npercent of the workforce who work 35 hours or less a week. These part-\ntime workers do not work more than 40 hours a week and, therefore, they \ndo not receive overtime in the first place.\n  The study also claims the proposed rule will deny overtime pay to \nwhite-collar employees earning more than $65,000 a year. However, not \nall employees earning over $65,000 are exempt under the proposed rule--\nonly those performing office or nonmanual work or one or more exempt \nduties. This means that workers such as police officers, firefighters, \nplumbers, teamsters, carpenters, and electricians will not lose their \novertime pay. Of course, under union contracts, that is already \nstipulated regardless of what kind of rule there is.\n  The Department of Labor does acknowledge the possibility that 644,000 \nhighly educated workers making over $65,000 a year might lose their \novertime. It rings in 1.3 million making under $22,100, and then there \nis the possibility that 644,000 making over $65,000 a year would lose \ntheir overtime.\n  Supporters of this amendment claim the proposed rules will strip \novertime pay for first responders and nurses. If we strip the rhetoric \nfrom the reality, we will find there will be virtually no change in \nstatus for the first responders and nurses under the proposal. Under \nboth the current and the proposed regulations, only registered nurses \nare exempt from overtime pay.\n  Again, what this amendment does is keep the Secretary of Labor from \nlooking at the 80,000 comments on the proposed rule to see if the rule \nought to be changed. There is not anything in the appropriations bill \nthat automatically puts into place any rule, but it will keep her from \nlooking at the comments that have been sent in.\n  Whom will this amendment protect if not lower income workers, first \nresponders, nurses, or millions of other working Americans? The \nantiquated and confusing white-collar exemptions have created a \nwindfall for trial lawyers. Ambiguities and outdated terms have \ngenerated significant confusion regarding which employees are exempt \nfrom overtime requirements. The confusion has generated significant \nlitigation and overtime pay awards for highly paid white-collar \nemployees. Wage and hour cases now exceed discrimination suits as the \nleading type of employment law class action.\n  The amendment will not preserve overtime for millions of working \nAmericans. This amendment will not help employers and employees clearly \nand fairly determine who is entitled to overtime.\n  The only clear winners of this amendment will be the people filling \nin their time from chasing personal injuries. It is a sideline. So the \ntrial lawyers will continue to benefit from the current state of this \nconfusion.\n  Businesses need to know the rules. The rules need to be interpretable \nby the average small businessman. I really object to the inference that \nthe only reason anybody would pay overtime is that the Federal \nGovernment said you had to. That is not true. That is not the way it \nworks, and I can tell you that even if the Federal Government says you \nhave to, there will still be one-tenth of 1 percent of the people who \nwill not comply. But for the most part, 99.9 percent of the people do \ncomply and want to comply--not only will comply but will exceed \ncomplying in a number of areas.\n  We are spending taxpayers' dollars sorting through the court cases \nthat could be solved with clarity. We are talking about taxpayer money \nbeing spent to review the 80,000 comments. I think that is entirely \nnecessary. I expect any agency that has a rule to review the comments \nof the rule and to make changes based on the comments.\n  The Department of Labor has received and is currently reviewing those \n80,000 comments to the proposed regulation. We should allow that \nregulatory process to continue and give the Department a chance to \ncomplete its review of the proposed rules.\n  Once the review is completed, the Department will align the white \ncollar regulations with the realities of the 21st century workplace and \nwhat they have learned from the comments, should they get to read them, \nand the intent of the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n  I want to assure my colleagues that if the rule has gone astray, when \nit is\n\n[[Page S11072]]\n\nfinished we put into place something called the Congressional Review \nAct. That is where we get to jerk these agencies back to reality if \nthey do not follow the proper procedures, if they do not pay attention \nto what is being said. We have used that before, and that would be the \nappropriate place for us to jerk the Department of Labor back to \nreality if they do not pay attention to the comments that are coming \nin.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, allow those comments \nto be read, check and see if there are going to be changes to the \novertime rules, and see if it does not clarify it for the workers and \nthe employers so that there will be less conflict.\n  Time spent in court does not benefit anybody but the trial lawyer. \nThere is no point in having that done if we can clarify things so \neverybody understands what the rules are, and we raise that terrible \n$8,000 up to $22,100 so that we are covering more people for overtime.\n  I do ask that the amendment be defeated when it is put in, should it \nbe put in.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, an agreement has been cleared on both \nsides, and I ask unanimous consent that the vote in relation to the \nMurray amendment No. 1559 occur at 1:45 today; provided that no \namendments be in order to the amendment prior to the vote, and that \nthere be 2 minutes equally divided for debate prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, with respect to the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Massachusetts, which would increase Pell grants and \nincrease other funding in higher education, there is no doubt that it \nwould be highly desirable to have more funding on more lines. The \nKennedy amendment seeks to raise the Pell grants from $4,050 to $4,500.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. REID. I apologize for interrupting, but I would appreciate that \nin the future, before any UCs are offered, that we be on the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I think that is a fair request. I had \nmade a similar request to the assistant Democratic leader last year \nwhen we were debating the resolution on the use of force in Iraq when \nthere was a unanimous consent agreement made when I was off the floor. \nI had thought this was cleared. The one last year on Iraq was not \ncleared with me, but I think that is a good idea and I will adhere to \nit during my managerial time.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Going back to the issue on the Pell grants, I do not \nthink anybody has fought harder to raise the Pell grants than this \nSenator. During my tenure as chairman of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Education, I have battled, along with Senator Harkin, \nto raise the Pell grants. If one takes a look at where they were a few \nyears ago in fiscal year 1997, they were at $2,700. Now they are at \n$4,050. It is an increase of about 50 percent in the course of those \nfew years.\n\n  When the fiscal year budget for 2002 was set with the Pell grants at \n$4,000, there was a vociferous objection from the Director of the \nOffice of Management and Budget. I recall the meeting in my Senate \noffice where there was a very strong objection that we had gone too \nfar. They wanted a recision on our bill, but we held our ground. We \nkept the Pell grants at $4,000.\n  So it would be a delight to me to be able to raise them to $4,500, \nbut it simply cannot be done within the confines of the funding we have \navailable, unless we go to some other lines to balance out by cuts in \nprograms like community health centers or strengthening historical \nblack colleges. Now I am not about to suggest cuts there, but if we are \nto have an increase of $2.2 billion, as the Senator from Massachusetts \nwants, we are either going to be way over our allocation or we are \ngoing to have to make some other cuts.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts has added funding on a number of \nlines. He has added funding on leveraging education assistance \npartnership, on the Federal work study, on TRIO, on GEAR UP, on \nPerkins, on the Javits Fellow Graduate Assistance, all of which would \nbe highly desirable in many ways if we had an allocation which would \nsupport it.\n  One of the most difficult jobs I have every year is managing this \nbill. I cast more controversial votes in my capacity in managing this \nbill than I do in all the rest of the year combined. As the manager, it \nis my obligation to try to bring this bill in in accordance with the \nbudget resolution and in accordance with the allocation which has been \nmade to this subcommittee.\n  In the absence of any other Senator seeking recognition at this \ntime--pardon me. The Senator from Minnesota is present. I yield to the \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I sympathize with the predicament the distinguished \nSenator from Pennsylvania has expressed. He has been a stalwart in \nsupport of increased funding for many of these educational efforts over \nthe years, and I note that his independence and integrity have resulted \nin his being cited by yet another prominent publication today.\n  If those qualities of an independent mind, intelligence, experience, \nand real compassion for people are considered to be detriments, then it \nis a sad and unfortunate day for the Senate. I think the Senator's \nrecord shows clearly to the contrary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If the Senator would yield for a question.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask him what publication he is referring to. \nIndependence has its price, and I am prepared to pay it.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DAYTON. The Senator's distinguished record speaks for itself.\n  I rise on a matter related to what the Senator just described, the \nquandary regarding funding for education programs. Yesterday, for the \nfourth time, I attempted to obtain 40 percent of Federal funds for \nspecial education to fulfill a promise that was made by the Federal \nGovernment to States and school districts 27 years ago, which today, \nand if we pass the appropriation measure that is before us, would be \nless than half of that 40 percent share. Every one of my colleagues in \nthe Republican caucus voted against this amendment, evidencing that \nspecial education funding in the scheme of everything else is simply \nnot a high enough priority.\n  At that time, yesterday, the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor \nand Pension Committee made some observations that I still find rather \nastounding, particularly as it relates to the actual experience of \neducators in my State of Minnesota. According to the senior Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, it seems we are putting so much Federal money into \nthe education programs--in fact, to quote the Senator, so much so fast \nunder President Bush and the Republican Senate that we now have a \nsituation where a large percentage of the dollars which we have already \nappropriated cannot be spent and have not been spent.\n  Over $9 billion were cited that are supposedly sitting in some vault \nsomewhere over at the Department of Education, title I funding, that \nwas appropriated over the last 2 or 3 years evidently that the States \nhave not drawn down to spend.\n  We were told before that funding for other areas of education had \nincreased so rapidly that those dollars could not be utilized. We were \ntold by the Senator about 2 months ago that there are so many Head \nStart slots available that some of those are unfilled because there is \nmore availability than parents desiring to put their children into Head \nStart.\n\n  That comes as quite a surprise to parents and educators and Head \nStart service providers in Minnesota where there has been known to be a \nserious shortage of funding for those who are eligible and would like \nto utilize that program for years. It would come as a surprise to the \nschool board members in school districts all over Minnesota that there \nis unused money in Washington for education. Our State is experiencing \na shortage of some $250 to $300 million in education funding resulting \nin school districts across the State having to make drastic cuts in \nfunding\n\n[[Page S11073]]\n\nfor public education, cutting teacher positions, cutting curriculum \nofferings, cutting supportive services.\n  I wrote this morning to the Secretary of Education to ask him exactly \nthe circumstances resulting in this $9.2 billion of unexpended Federal \nfunds and to ask for his recommendation on what can be done to make \nthese funds available to schools and school districts throughout the \ncountry where the funds, I can guarantee, would be well used today, \ntomorrow, or the day after so we do not have a situation where we have \nsupposedly $9 billion of Federal funds lying around waiting for some \nschool or school board to identify this opportunity to provide the \neducational services that schoolchildren in Minnesota are being denied \ntoday because of a critical shortage of funding.\n  We also offered yesterday amendments to increase funding in this bill \nbefore Senators were lambasted for our fiscal irresponsibility. We were \ntold again by the chairman of the HELP committee that we have finally \nset up in the Senate this year a budget for ourselves and we have \nrenewed the concept of fiscal discipline through a budget after having \nbeen abandoned for a year under prior leadership of the Senate. Even \nthough we have a budget, we should, we are being told, ignore it and \nfund all these additional programs for education.\n  Yes, I did seek yesterday to increase funding for special education \nby $11 billion next year. That is a lot of money. But it is money \nfulfilling broken promises of over a quarter of a century. It was \nlambasted for its fiscal excess.\n  Yesterday the manager of the bill noted there were no Senators \noffering amendments. It seems one of the reasons was that quite a \nnumber of Senators were at the White House literally at the same time I \nwas offering my amendment. About the same time the critics were \naccusing my amendment and other amendments being offered for being \nfiscally reckless, Members were being notified by the President that he \nwould seek another $60 billion or $80 billion--according to estimates I \nhave seen, but it will actually be $100 billion--additional spending \nfor the war effort in Iraq over the next fiscal year in addition to the \n$87 billion we approved earlier this year for additional funding for \nthat effort, which I supported. And I will support, I expect, the \nrequest by the President for this continuing effort. Once we are in a \nwar situation, as we are, we cannot conduct a war under budget. We have \nto conduct a war to win, to secure that victory, as the administration \nis trying now to do.\n  It struck me as an odd juxtaposition of priorities, particularly \ngiven the Republican assistant leader spoke yesterday and said we were \nvery clear that what the President wants he is going to get in terms of \nadditional dollars.\n  If we want to break the budget for an additional $160 million, as was \none proposal yesterday for education--another proposal was for $68 \nmillion for education; in my case, $11 billion for additional funding \nfor special education--those are figures that somehow break whatever \nthis budget and this fiscal discipline the majority caucus claims we \nhave established within this body. As soon as the administration wants \nanother $80 or $100 billion next fiscal year, no questions asked. What \nthe President wants, he will get.\n  I wish the President would add to his list of priorities in addition \nto funding the economic reconstruction of Iraq, for $10 billion, we are \ntold in this proposal, and another $15 billion over the next few years \nfor AIDS in Africa, a worthwhile cause, but I wish we would give the \nsame priority to the special needs of the students of America, both \nthose at the elementary and secondary levels and also, as Senator \nKennedy pointed out, those in postsecondary education who find getting \na Pell grant or getting a college work-study opportunity about as \nscarce as finding a weapon of mass destruction in Iraq.\n  As the American people look at the fiscal crisis afflicting this \nGovernment's budget, from the beginning of this fiscal year of a \nprojected deficit of $150 billion to now a deficit projected to be in \nthe neighborhood of $550 billion--that includes, by the way, the use of \nthe Social Security trust fund surplus of $155 billion for this year so \nactually the operating account of the Federal budget is in deficit \nclose to $700 billion this year. Next year, the budget deficit for \nfiscal year 2004 was expected to be $200 billion and now it is already \nup to $480 billion. That does not count the $80 billion or $100 billion \nfor the next fiscal year to be added for the President's request. So we \nare looking at the start of the fiscal year of a deficit next year of \nsome $580 billion, almost three times what was projected a year ago. \nThat is in contrast, by the way, to a surplus that we enjoyed in each \nof the last 4 years under President Clinton.\n  There is one area, however, where there does not seem to be such a \nproblem on the spending side. That is when it comes to pharmaceutical \nindustry prices and profits. There was another interesting article \ntoday in the New York Times looking at the practice of the Veterans \nAdministration in successfully lowering the price of prescription drugs \nfor the VA and making it possible for millions of veterans to pay just \n$7 for up to a 30-day prescription. It is astonishing to see what the \nSenate and House bills now contain for prescription drug coverage \ncontrasted with the VA copay of $7 per prescription. No wonder \nthousands of veterans are signing up for this program every month, \nstretching those appropriated dollars.\n  I ask unanimous consent this New York Times article be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit No. 1)\n  Mr. DAYTON. For all its apparent success, lawmakers have disregarded \nthe Veterans Administration model and others like it that use the \nGovernment's immense power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices. \nIn fact, under the Senate and House bills, under existing law, Congress \nwould exempt the drug industry from the kind of cost controls in place \nfor virtually every other major provider of Medicare services.\n  One of the founders of the current health maintenance organization \nconcept who then recanted his support based on what they became, former \nMinnesotan Dr. Paul M. Elwood, said in the article:\n\n       The legislation pending in Congress does more to deform \n     than to reform Medicare.\n       Drug companies [the article goes on] say they support \n     prescription drug coverage under Medicare [since the taxpayer \n     will be paying for more of these medicines]. But in the last \n     few years, they have invested several hundred million dollars \n     in campaign contributions, lobbying and advertising to head \n     off price controls.\n\n  They were the largest contributor in the last campaign cycle for \nFederal campaigns, and of course those are not philanthropic \ncontributions; they are political investments on which they expect and \nare receiving their desired return.\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       The legislation ``reflects a political judgment that the \n     pharmaceutical industry'' would block ``price controls or any \n     arrangement that used the concentrated purchasing power of \n     the government to buy prescription drugs,'' said Paul B. \n     Ginsburg, president of the Center for Studying Health System \n     Change, a private research institute.\n\n  Why would the pharmaceutical industry be able to block the Congress \nfrom enacting legislation that would lower prescription drug prices for \nthe people of America? It begs the question, Whose interests are being \nrepresented, that an industry, the pharmaceutical industry, can block \nlegislation right here on the Senate floor, right over there in the \nHouse of Representatives--can block legislation that would result in \nlower prescription drug prices for senior citizens and people of all \nages across this country?\n  It goes on to say that the VA plan, by contrast, uses its buying \npower and uses it successfully to lower prices that VA pays for the \nmedicines and that the veterans in turn pay. According to the National \nAcademy of Sciences:\n\n       . . . the VA's methods had achieved nearly $100 million in \n     savings over the past 2 years.\n\n  But Congress did not consider that approach; in fact, Congress did \nthe opposite. Congress said you cannot use that approach. Medicare \ncannot get involved in price reductions. Medicare cannot use the vast \npurchasing power on behalf of all senior citizens and others under \nMedicare, which goes far beyond what the Veterans' Administration has \nin terms of numbers--cannot use that clout to negotiate or insist on\n\n[[Page S11074]]\n\nlower pharmaceutical prices for seniors, for others on Medicare. Why? \nBecause that would cut into the profits of this already excessively \nprofitable industry.\n\n       Representative Michael Bilirakis, the Florida Republican \n     who is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee \n     on Health, said that if Medicare pooled its purchasing power, \n     it would amount to ``a form of price controls.''\n       ``That's not America,'' Mr. Bilirakis said. ``Many of my \n     constituents would feel that price controls are a great \n     thing. But ultimately some of us have to be responsible.''\n\n  Since when is it responsible for Congress to allow drug prices to go \nup higher and higher, beyond the reach of our fellow citizens? Since \nwhen is it responsible in America to let an industry, the drug \nindustry, write a letter that 53 Senators sign, saying they would \noppose any kind of reimportation such as that proposed by my colleague \nfrom the House of Representatives, Gil Gutknecht, Republican House \nMember from Minnesota. He was one of those who courageously and \nsuccessfully led the drug reimportation victory in the House, one which \nI hope this body will enact and follow suit.\n  But when a pharmaceutical industry lobbyist can write a letter that \n53 Senators sign, stating exactly what the pharmaceutical industry \nwants said, that this is somehow dangerous to the safety and well-being \nand welfare of Americans, says a lot about who controls what happens in \nWashington.\n\n  In fact, if the record be shown, the imports of foreign-manufactured \ndrugs exceeded $14 billion last year. These were drugs that were made, \nmanufactured outside of this country and imported. The only difference \nis they were imported by the drug companies at higher prices. If the \nconsumers want to import those same drugs from Canada or somewhere else \nat lower prices, that is what is objectionable. But once again, it is \nthe pharmaceutical industry and its profits that are given priority \nover people.\n  So we have this very bizarre but, unfortunately for America, all too \nreal juxtaposition of less spending for education. I see the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, who has been such a champion \nof funding for education and so many other causes benefiting the people \nof his State and across America. His amendment is one that we will \nconsider. I wish and hope it will fare better than my amendment \nyesterday for special education. Given the votes on the other side of \nthe aisle, I don't think that is promising.\n  But when time after time we try to put more money into education and \nare defeated, yet we can, without even a blink of an eye, put $80 \nbillion or $100 billion more into economic reconstruction or other \nefforts in Iraq paying, as I was told, in Iraq, paying 1.8 million \nIraqi citizens not to work, not to do anything, just not to foment \nrevolution, pay 1.8 million Iraqi citizens not to work and we are not \nwilling to pay Americans who want to work overtime, or extend \nunemployment benefits for those who want to work and are seeking work, \nwhen we can run up deficits of humongous proportions, the biggest \ndeficits in this Nation's history, three times more 12 months later \nthan they were projected to be, without a blink of the eye on the other \nside of the aisle. But there is nothing to be said when drug companies \nwant to raise prices and take more money out of the pocket of \nAmericans.\n  I would say it is time for this body to look very carefully at \nitself. It is time for the American people to look carefully at this \nbody.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, Sept. 4, 2003]\n\n     Some Successful Models Ignored As Congress Works on Drug Bill\n\n                  (By Robert Pear and Walt Bogdanich)\n\n       By most measures, the Department of Veterans Affairs has \n     solved the puzzle of making prescription drugs affordable for \n     at least one big group of Americans without wrecking the \n     Federal budget.\n       Wielding its power as one of the largest purchasers of \n     medications in the United States, the V.A. has made it \n     possible for millions of veterans to pay just $7 for up to a \n     30-day prescription. Thousands are signing up for the program \n     every month.\n       Yet for all its apparent success, lawmakers have \n     disregarded the V.A. model--and others like it that use the \n     Government's immense power to negotiate lower prices--as they \n     try to give older Americans relief from rising drug costs \n     while reshaping how the elderly get medical services.\n       Instead, a Congress deeply divided by ideology has given \n     birth to legislation that would add prescription drug \n     coverage to Medicare, but that many experts say would fall \n     short of meeting the needs of the elderly. The benefits, \n     costing $400 billion over 10 years, are complex and limited, \n     and the legislation relies in part on cost control mechanisms \n     that are untested or unproven.\n       In fact, Congress would exempt the drug industry from the \n     kind of cost controls that are in place for virtually every \n     other major provider of Medicare services.\n       ``The legislation pending in Congress does more to deform \n     than to reform Medicare,'' said Dr. Paul M. Ellwood, a noted \n     health policy analyst who was an early proponent of managed \n     care. ``Instead of creating a system of readily \n     understandable choices based on cost and quality, Congress is \n     writing legislation that will increase the complexity of \n     Medicare, so it will be more difficult for seniors to \n     navigate.''\n       The effort to forge a final deal on Capitol Hill, blending \n     separate House and Senate measures, was high on the agenda as \n     Congress returned to work this week. Lobbyists and health \n     policy experts say the likelihood that a comprehensive drug \n     bill will become law this year seems no better than 50-50. \n     But Thomas A. Scully, administrator of the federal Centers \n     for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said yesterday that he \n     was ``95 percent sure we will get a Medicare bill out of \n     Congress.''\n       Politically, the legislation is a marriage of convenience, \n     combining drug benefits, long sought by Democrats, with a \n     Republic approach to administering the benefits, through \n     private health plans and insurance companies. To secure \n     votes, the Senate bill was festooned with provisions aiding \n     various interest groups. There is language that would, for \n     examples, aid chiropractors; marriage and family therapists; \n     doctors in Alaska; hospitals in Iredell County, NC; operators \n     of air ambulance services; and many other groups.\n       The need for bipartisan support ``led to a series of \n     compromises that resulted in a hodegepodge of a bill,'' said \n     Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, who opposed \n     the Senate bill.\n       Michael Valentino, a manager of the V.A.'s drug benefit \n     program, praised Congress for trying to help Medicare \n     patients buy prescription drugs. But he added that the \n     coverage could be expanded if Medicare took full advantage of \n     its purchasing power.\n       John C. Rother, policy director for AARP, the lobbying \n     group for older Americans, said the legislation was a ``real \n     godsend'' for people with low incomes or high drug expenses.\n       ``But for many others,'' he said, ``the benefits will be \n     seen as inadequate.''\n       Premiums and drug benefits could vary from plan to plan, \n     state to state and year to year. The Senate and House bills \n     both establish a standard drug benefit, with substantial \n     coverage upfront and catastrophic coverage for high costs. \n     But beneficiaries would have to pay all drug costs in the \n     middle, until their out-of-pocket costs reached a certain \n     level--$3,700 a year under the Senate bill and $3,500 under \n     the House bill.\n       Robert D. Reischauer, former director of the Congressional \n     Budget Office, said the gap in coverage ``defies rational \n     policy analysis'' and was not found in commercial insurance. \n     Congress engineered the gap to keep the drug plan's cost \n     under the $400 billion limit.\n\n\n                          `political judgment'\n\n       Drug companies say they support covering prescription drugs \n     under Medicare. But in the last few years, they have invested \n     several hundred million dollars in campaign contributions, \n     lobbying and advertising to head off price controls.\n       The legislation ``reflects a political judgment that the \n     pharmaceutical industry'' would block ``price controls or any \n     arrangement that used the concentrated purchasing power of \n     the government to buy prescription drugs,'' said Paul B. \n     Ginsburg, president of the Center for Studying Health System \n     Change, a private research institute.\n       The V.A. plan, by contrast, owes its relative success to \n     its buying power--and a willingness to use it. Its doctors \n     and pharmacists analyze research to establish a list of \n     preferred drugs for various conditions. The V.A. obtains \n     discounts through bulk purchasing arrangements--using generic \n     drugs where possible--and competitive bidding.\n       ``We are so far ahead of anybody else, it's almost \n     ridiculous,'' Mr. Valentino said. In 2000, the National \n     Academy of Sciences found that the V.A.'s methods had \n     achieved nearly $100 million in savings over the previous two \n     years.\n       But Congress decided not to adopt the V.A.'s approach; in \n     fact, it was not seriously considered. Lawmakers also passed \n     up other alternatives including vouchers for the purchase of \n     health insurance and proposals to assist only people with low \n     incomes.\n       Representative Michael Bilirakis, the Florida Republican \n     who is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee \n     on Health, said that if Medicare pooled its purchasing power, \n     it would amount to ``a form of price controls.''\n       ``That's not America,'' Mr. Bilirakis said. ``Many of my \n     constituents would feel that price controls are a great \n     thing. But ultimately some of us have to be responsible.''\n       The political imperative that seems to have produced \n     today's fragile consensus stems from complaints that every \n     lawmaker has heard from constituents: prescription drugs \n     costs too much.\n\n[[Page S11075]]\n\n       At Medicare's inception in 1965, policy makers chose not to \n     cover outpatient drugs, because medicines now so \n     indispensable to treating disease either did not exist or \n     were relatively inexpensive.\n       Instead, Medicare focused on big-ticket items like hospital \n     care and doctors' services. For years, Medicare mostly paid \n     whatever bills health care providers submitted, but by the \n     1980's Congress decided it needed to restrain rising costs. \n     In subsequent years, Medicare prospectively set limits on \n     what it paid major health care providers, including \n     hospitals, doctors, skilled nursing homes and home health \n     agencies.\n       The controls have never been popular with the health care \n     industry.\n       ``In Medicare, the tendency is to set prices too low,'' \n     said Dr. Donald J. Palmisano, president of the American \n     Medical Association. Indeed, Carmela S. Coyle, senior vice \n     president of the American Hospital Association, said 67 \n     percent of hospitals lose money on Medicare.\n       By and large, however, the measures have managed to slow \n     the growth of Medicare costs, say many health policy experts, \n     including Bruce C. Vladeck and Nancy-Ann DeParle, who ran \n     Medicare under President Bill Clinton. Drug costs, however, \n     have skyrocketed, and while most of the elderly get some help \n     from retiree health benefits, Medicaid or state programs, at \n     least one-fourth of Medicare beneficiaries have no drug \n     coverage.\n       Under the bills passed this year, the government would \n     subsidize drug coverage provided to Medicare beneficiaries by \n     private insurers and health plans. They would bargain with \n     drug companies to secure discounts and rebates, a task likely \n     to be delegated to pharmaceutical benefit managers, or \n     P.B.M.'s, the companies that already perform the service for \n     many employers. Both bills stipulate that Medicare officials \n     cannot ``interfere in any way'' in those negotiations.\n       For President Bush and Republicans in Congress, the concept \n     makes sense: let the marketplace set the prices, rather than \n     government. For years, lawmakers have found fault with \n     Medicare's arcane and voluminous regulations. Congress has \n     frequently intervened to tweak the formulas, taking money \n     from some providers while giving more to others--often to \n     those with the most persuasive lobbyists.\n       That, in turn, contributes to anomalies in medical care, \n     because doctors have financial incentives to perform certain \n     services and not others. Mr. Scully, the Medicare \n     administrator, said such anomalies were inevitable because \n     Medicare was ``a big dumb price-fixer.''\n       Still, Medicare has been a boon to the elderly and their \n     children. Surveys show that beneficiaries are overwhelmingly \n     satisfied with their care. Before Medicare, only 56 percent \n     of the elderly had hospital insurance; the program has \n     contributed to an increase in life expectancy and a sharp \n     reduction in poverty among the elderly.\n       Moreover, some studies show Medicare has done better at \n     controlling medical costs than private health insurance. \n     Cristina Boccuti, a researcher at the Urban Institute, and \n     Marilyn Moon, a former public trustee of the Medicare \n     program, said Medicare spending grew more slowly than private \n     health insurance costs from 1970 to 2000. Republicans say \n     such comparisons are misleading and contend that Medicare's \n     cost controls have slowed access to new treatments and \n     technology.\n\n\n                          Negotiated Discounts\n\n       But that does not seem to be a problem for the V.A. The \n     study by the National Academy of Sciences found that its \n     approach had ``meaningfully reduced drug expenditures without \n     demonstrable adverse effects on quality.''\n       Mr. Valentino said: ``When we make our recommendations, \n     it's not because Doctor A, in his or her opinion, believes it \n     is the best drug. It is because the evidence says it's the \n     best drug.'' Echoing the criticisms of government \n     investigators, he added that P.B.M.'s, by contrast, sometimes \n     make deals favoring expensive drugs for their own financial \n     benefit.\n       Under the House and Senate bills, Medicare beneficiaries \n     would have access to drug discounts negotiated on their \n     behalf by private insurers and P.B.M.'s. Supporters of the \n     legislation say these discounts could reduce retail drug \n     prices by 20 percent. But Congress consciously decided to \n     disperse Medicare's purchasing power. It did not want \n     Medicare to establish a uniform nationwide list of preferred \n     drugs or a price list for those drugs--mechanisms that the \n     drug industry opposes.\n       ``Price controls cause artificially low prices,'' said \n     Jeffrey L. Trewhitt, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical \n     Research and Manufacturers of America. And low prices for a \n     government program, he added, would reduce the money \n     available for researching new drugs and could prompt drug \n     makers to seek higher prices from patients with private \n     insurance.\n       Critics of the drug industry dispute such arguments--and \n     say that they obscure the obvious.\n       ``The obvious is that if you control prices, you pay \n     less,'' said Mr. Vladeck, the former Medicare administrator. \n     ``There are some problems with it, and not all price controls \n     work as well as others. But the pharmaceutical industry does \n     have enough political juice to prevent any reasonable price \n     controls.''\n       The idea of giving people a choice between traditional \n     Medicare and private health plans has deep roots.\n       ``We must promote diversity, choice and healthy competition \n     in American medicine if we are to escape from the grip of \n     spiraling costs,'' the Nixon administration said in 1970, in \n     words similar to those of President Bush in 2003.\n       In 1978, Alain C. Enthoven, a Stanford University \n     economist, called for regulated competition among private \n     health plans. Medicare, he said, would subsidize premiums, \n     and the most efficient health plans would pass on their \n     savings to consumers, so patients would have a financial \n     incentive to enroll.\n       Prompted by such thinking, the government offered new \n     private alternatives to the traditional Medicare program in \n     the 1980's, and Congress encouraged the development of health \n     maintenance organizations. Enrollment grew, in part because \n     many H.M.O.'s offered drug benefits not available in \n     traditional Medicare.\n       Medicare beneficiaries generally praised the care they \n     received in H.M.O.'s, but the plans did not control costs as \n     their proponents had hoped. Many H.M.O.'s began reducing some \n     benefits, including drug coverage.\n       They also pressed Congress for more money, saying that \n     their costs were rising 10 percent a year--five times the \n     increase in payments from Medicare. Unable to persuade \n     Congress to close the gap, many abandoned Medicare or \n     curtailed their participation.\n       That track record has heightened critics' skepticism about \n     the current legislation.\n       ``The myth of the market,'' said Lynn M. Etheredge, who \n     worked at the White House Office of Management and Budget \n     from 1972 to 1982, ``has a powerful sway over people's minds, \n     despite evidence that it is not working in the Medicare \n     program.''\n       The Congressional Budget Office estimates that under the \n     legislation, many private plans will cost slightly more than \n     traditional Medicare. Moreover, there is widespread doubt \n     that insurers--who do not now sell stand-alone drug \n     insurance--will begin to do so.\n       Even Mr. Scully concedes that such drug coverage ``does not \n     exist in nature'' and would probably not work in practice. \n     The elderly are heavy users of prescription drugs, so few \n     insurers are eager to write coverage for their drug costs \n     alone, separate from their other medical expenses.\n       ``It would be like providing insurance for haircuts,'' \n     Charles N. Kahn III said several years ago, when he was \n     president of the Health Insurance Association of America.\n\n\n                           limits of coverage\n\n       Even if President Bush signs a Medicare drug bill in the \n     coming year, it will not be the last word.\n       Health policy experts say that costs may well grow faster \n     than the official projections suggest. That would increase \n     pressure on Congress to hold down drug costs, just as \n     lawmakers continually try to slow the growth of Medicare \n     payments to hospitals.\n       At the same time, when Medicare beneficiaries realize the \n     limits of the new drug coverage, they can be expected to \n     lobby for more generous benefits. In supporting the Senate \n     bill, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, \n     made clear that it was only a down payment, a foundation for \n     more comprehensive drug benefits.\n       Ms. DeParle predicts that the legislation will produce a \n     huge demand for drugs, and she is far from certain that \n     competition will do much to control costs. ``It is pretty \n     much theory, and that is what worries me about it,'' she \n     said. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that per \n     capita drug spending for the Medicare population will \n     increase about 10 percent a year over the next decade.\n       Critics of the legislation doubt its cost can be kept to \n     the $400 billion budgeted by Congress. ``Utilization will go \n     up dramatically, and costs could explode,'' said Senator Don \n     Nickles, Republican of Oklahoma.\n       For now, however, politicians have chosen to favor drug \n     companies over Medicare beneficiaries, said Prof. Uwe E. \n     Reinhardt, a health care economist at Princeton University.\n       ``On one hand, there is the taxpayer and, in fact, patients \n     who would benefit from having costs controlled,'' Dr. \n     Reinhardt said. ``But on the other hand, those people do not \n     finance the campaigns of these legislators.''\n       Ms. Coyle of the hospital association declined to address \n     the question of why her industry, but not the pharmaceutical \n     industry, had been subject to price controls. Her group's \n     biggest concern about the legislation, she said, is that ``we \n     are not addressing the larger problem: a health care system \n     that is fundamentally broken.'' The nation, she said, wants \n     the best care for everyone, but needs to decide if it is \n     willing to bear the cost.\n       So who would be the big winners if the legislation is \n     signed into law?\n       ``The short-run political winner is George Bush, because \n     this law will not be understood by anyone,'' Dr. Reinhardt \n     said. ``It is so complex. But he can go in 2004 and say, \n     `Look, for 30 years you tried to get a drug benefit--I got \n     you one.' ''\n       And, he added: ``the elderly will benefit, too, relative to \n     nothing. Who loses? Obviously the people who pay for it.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, what is the question before the Senate?\n\n[[Page S11076]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question before the Senate is Senator \nKennedy's amendment, No. 1566.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, am I at liberty to speak \nout of order? I do not intend to speak on that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is at liberty to speak out of \norder.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, after reading about the Bush \nadministration's proposed rules with regard to overtime pay, there \nshould be no question that American workers are under assault by the \nBush administration.\n  The Denver Post reports that since President Bush's election in 2000, \nthe Labor Department has repealed 41 worker-safety regulations in \ndevelopment, including two aimed at addressing hazardous chemical \ndangers. Within 2 months of taking office, President Bush sought to \nrepeal the Labor Department's ergonomic standard to prevent repetitive \nstress injuries, and has issued four Executive orders to curb the \nrights of labor unions.\n  It is not enough that the Bush administration has sought to prevent \nFederal workers from unionizing or that the White House has blocked an \nincrease in the minimum wage. It is not enough that over 3 million jobs \nhave been lost under the Bush administration's watch or that over 9 \nmillion workers are unemployed. The administration now wants to take \naway the right of millions of workers to receive overtime pay.\n  America's workers should be very concerned about the overtime changes \nbeing proposed by the Bush administration. These rule changes would \nforce workers in executive, administrative, and technical fields to \nlabor for longer hours and could make as many as 8 million salaried and \nhourly workers, many of whom have grown to depend upon overtime pay, \nineligible for it.\n  It is not just hourly workers in factories and restaurants who will \nbe affected by these rules. We are talking about roughly 14 million \nU.S. workers who are considered to be eligible for overtime pay--from \ncomputer engineers, paramedics, and paralegals, to secretaries, grocery \nclerks, and delivery route drivers. We are talking about the policemen, \nfirefighters, health care officials--the heroes of the September 11 \nattacks who worked around the clock. These are the workers from whom \nthe administration wants to take overtime pay.\n  These are not innocuous rule changes. The Labor Department has been \nflooded with more than 80,000 letters and e-mails debating the merit of \nits proposed overtime changes, the most mail the agency has received on \nany wage-and-hour topic in at least a decade. The Washington Post \nquoted a number of these letters in a story last July:\n  ``Shame on you, President Bush,'' read one letter.\n  ``Please do not take away our overtime pay,'' wrote a Marylander, who \nsaid that her husband works overtime so that she can afford to stay at \nhome to take care of their infant daughter.\n  ``Deplorable,'' ``unfair,'' ``absurd;''--these are the words used to \ndescribe this administration's proposal. To these I would add callous, \nhard-hearted, and out-of-touch.\n  Overtime pay is about more than just making ends meet. In many cases, \nit is the money used for unexpected health care costs, to pay medical \nbills, to care for elderly parents. For many families, it is the money \ncarefully squirreled away to pay for a college education years in the \nfuture--those things that make life more than simply going to work to \nsurvive. I don't believe that the administration has any real \nappreciation for how important these extra wages are to a family in \nthese tough economic times.\n  After graduating from high school in the midst of the Great \nDepression, I sought employment wherever I could find the opportunity--\npumping gas at a filling station, working as a produce salesman, and \nbecoming a meat cutter. It was difficult to make ends meet. So I and my \nwife, Erma, can well appreciate the willingness to work extra time to \nprovide for a better life for the family. Such willingness to go the \nextra mile should be rewarded.\n  Earlier this week, Americans celebrated Labor Day to show our \nappreciation to this Nation's workers. If we really want to show our \nappreciation, the Senate should stand up for America's workers against \nthe assaults of this administration and support the amendment by \nSenators Kennedy and Harkin.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my name be added as a \ncosponsor of that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak about \nan amendment I will be offering that will bring up the level of \nPresident Bush's international mother and child prevention of HIV \ninitiative to the level which the President actually requested. Right \nnow, the bill before us falls $60 million short of what the President \nrequested. I believe we need to fix that. We need to get the numbers \nback up to what President Bush asked this Senate and asked this \nCongress to provide.\n  The international mother and child prevention of HIV initiative is \ntruly one of the most cost-effective ways that we can stop the spread \nof HIV/AIDS to children. This initiative very simply allows doctors and \nnurses to give drugs to pregnant women who are HIV positive, or who \nhave AIDS, to lessen the chance that this disease is then passed on to \ntheir unborn babies.\n  For as little as $3, doctors and nurses can give these mothers the \ndrugs they need to lessen the likelihood that their babies are born HIV \npositive. In fact, when treated with drugs, we are seeing HIV/AIDS \ntransmission rates from the mother who has AIDS to a child about to be \nborn drop from 30 percent to 5 to 10 percent. It is almost a miracle.\n  Less than a week ago, I returned from a 10-day trip to southern \nAfrica, along with Majority Leader Bill Frist and Senators Warner, \nEnzi, Coleman, and Alexander. We traveled to South Africa, Mozambique, \nBotswana, and Namibia to assess the HIV/AIDS crisis in each one of \nthese nations. On this trip, we saw firsthand how well these mother-to-\nchild transmission programs are working in these countries and how \nimportant they are to saving the lives of these unborn babies.\n  There are already many programs in place in these countries and in \nother countries around the world--programs that are working and \nprograms that are saving lives. We heard so many times people saying, \nThank you--thank you to the United States, thank you to President \nBush--for helping set up these programs and for making these programs \nwork.\n  The bill in front of us provides additional resources for the \ncontinuation of these programs and the creation of more programs. The \nproblem is that it does not go far enough. I simply will be asking in \nthis amendment to fulfill the commitment and the request that President \nBush made of this Congress to provide a specific amount which he has \nasked us to provide.\n  These programs work. We need to get them fully funded.\n  On our recent trip, for example, we visited a mother-to-child \nprevention program run by Catholic AIDS Action in Namibia, a nation \nwith a 22.5-percent HIV rate for pregnant women--the fifth highest in \nthe world. At St. Mary's Hospital in Rehoboth, Namibia, Catholic AIDS \nAction is doing a very good job in enrolling pregnant women in the \nWomen-To-Infant Program. The program has an excellent success rate and \nis making a difference. We could see that difference. We heard about \nit.\n  We met with and talked with a HIV-positive mother. She told us about \nhow this program had reached out to her. She was so very happy and so \nvery proud that, even though she was HIV positive, she had given birth \nto a child who was healthy and was not HIV positive. She was so very \nhappy. What a miracle it was. What a great thing it was to see.\n  We saw so many more examples of this throughout our trip. We saw so \nmany good programs out there. People are already doing so much good \nwork to stop the spread of this disease from mother to child.\n  There are many more good programs ready to go. We just need to get \nthem funded with all the funds they truly need.\n  One of the most important things I took away from this trip is that \nwe don't have time to delay in helping\n\n[[Page S11077]]\n\nthese people. Each day we delay, people die--real people, not \nstatistics, real parents and children and babies. And there are things \nwe can do now to start saving these lives.\n  Time, as the President of the United States told this Congress, is \nsimply not on our side. We need to move forward and provide the proper \nlevels of assistance. So I will be asking my colleagues to support the \namendment I will be offering, an amendment to provide the President of \nthe United States with the level of funding he requested for the mother \nand child initiative. Doing so will help save countless lives and offer \nhope to the next generation for a life free from HIV. It is the right \nthing to do.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1559\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the time has arrived for voting on the \nMurray amendment. I raise a point of order under section 504 of the \nconcurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2004 that the \namendment exceeds discretionary spending limits specified in this \nsection and therefore is not in order.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Murray, I, by virtue of \nthe relevant statute, move to waive the point of order that has been \nraised and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I notice that the Senator from Washington \nis in the Chamber now. If she would like to have her 2 minutes of \nargument, I ask unanimous consent that we proceed to 2 minutes of \nargument on each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. There are 2 minutes on each \nside.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and appreciate his \naccommodating me.\n  The amendment the Senate is about to vote on is a really important \none. Across this country thousands of people who have lost their jobs \nwill never get these same jobs back.\n  Today, in my home State of Washington, there are 10,000 people on a \nwaiting list in King County alone trying to get into a retraining \nprogram in order to obtain the skills they need to get back into the \nworkforce and put food on the tables for their families.\n  Certainly, at this time in our country's history, when our economy is \nsluggish, when people are struggling everywhere, the best we can do--\nand one of the most important things we can do--is give these workers \nthe skills they need to get back into the workforce.\n  This amendment is critically important. Many of these training \nprograms have not received any increase in funding in a decade. It is \nimportant to us as a country that we have a workforce that has the \nskills to be marketable. That is what this very critical amendment \ndoes. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if we had unlimited funding, I would say \nthe Murray amendment would be a good one. But the fact is we do not. \nThis account already has, in the Senate budget bill, in excess of $3.5 \nbillion. The Murray amendment would seek to add another $163 million, \nand it simply is not within our allocation.\n  If we were to try to find some accommodation within the existing \nbudget limit, we would have to cut other programs. As it is, the Senate \nreport is $125 million over what the administration had requested. And \nwhen you look at the total sum of money which has in excess of $3.5 \nbillion, that is, obviously, very substantial funding. So I ask my \ncolleagues to vote no and not to waive the point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Missouri (Mr. Talent) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham), the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry), and the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. \nLieberman) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``Yea''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Are there any other Senators \nin the Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The yeas ands nays resulted--yeas 46, nays 49, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 325 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--46\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--49\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     Edwards\n     Graham (FL)\n     Kerry\n     Lieberman\n     Talent\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The point of order is \nsustained and the amendment falls.\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to offer an amendment in a moment, \nand I will ask unanimous consent to lay aside the pending amendments, \nbut I would first like to announce we are prepared to go to conference \non Energy. I am sure later on today we will ensure that the conferees \nare announced. I have been working with the distinguished ranking \nmember on Energy, Senator Bingaman. He and Senator Dorgan, Senator Bob \nGraham, Senator Ron Wyden, and Senator Tim Johnson, along with Senator \nBaucus from the Finance Committee, will be our conferees on the Energy \nCommittee.\n  I thank Senator Akaka for his willingness to allow Senator Baucus to \ntake his place as a conferee as a result of the decision not to \nbifurcate conferences but to keep the conference membership together. \nSenator Baucus will be an official part of the entire conference, and \nSenator Akaka kindly allowed Senator Baucus the opportunity to \nrepresent the Finance Committee as it relates especially to tax issues.\n  I know there was some comment that our Republican colleagues were \nwaiting for us. We were told right before the August recess that they \nwere not ready to go to conference and so we did not anticipate the \nneed to appoint conferees until we were told a couple of days ago that \nthey were now ready. Of course, we are prepared now to do so as well. \nSo there was not any delay on our part. This is something we wanted to \ndo for a long time. Given the fact we were told they were not ready, we \ndid not feel the need to expedite this matter until we returned.\n  On another matter, I know there was a good deal of discussion this \nmorning on an amendment that we will take up next week, but I wanted to \nspeak to the amendment myself and that is the amendment relating to the \novertime regulation.\n  Our economy has been hemorrhaging jobs over the last 3 years. We have \nlost\n\n[[Page S11078]]\n\nmore than 3.2 million private sector jobs since January of 2001, \nincluding 2.4 million jobs in the manufacturing sector alone. At the \nsame time, incomes are flat. The only way many Americans can make ends \nmeet is to work overtime. I know there are many Americans, and many \nSouth Dakotans, who I talked to over the course of the last couple of \nweeks, during the month of August, who told me that were it not for \novertime they would lose up to a fourth of their income.\n  For millions of working families, overtime pay makes the difference \nbetween their ability to pay bills and their fear of greater \nindebtedness. Health bills, education bills, clothing bills, grocery \nbills, rent, mortgage, child care, all of that is possible.\n  The reason they work so hard and so long--and I might say that the \naverage workweek has now grown to a larger number of hours than it has \nbeen in more than 50 years. This overtime pay reliance is possible \nbecause 65 years ago this country made a promise to the workers who \ndrive our economy forward. It was called the Fair Labor Standards Act. \nIt struck a balance between the needs of business and the rights of \nworkers. It actually required employers to pay employees time and a \nhalf for every hour of overtime worked, and that now has been the law \nof the land, as I said, for 65 years.\n  This simple and fair bargain has improved the lives of hard-working \nAmericans all over this country, expanded the job market by providing \nan incentive to employers to hire more people when business was good. \nIt has been vital to our economy, and I think it has been the essence \nof prosperity for many families.\n\n  If the administration now gets its way, all of the practice and \ncommitment we have made to workers for 65 years will be swept away and \n8 million Americans will be forced to take a pay cut. This spring, the \nadministration revealed its plans to undo protections of the Fair Labor \nStandards Act and end overtime for 8 million workers. This is an \noutrage.\n  Overtime is giving families the means to save for a house or a \ncollege education. For hundreds of thousands of families, it lifts them \nout of poverty. This is what the White House wants to abolish.\n  Just yesterday, the White House released its Statement of \nAdministration Policy. It declares that if the Senate acts to protect \nworkers' overtime pay in this bill, the President will veto it. The \nmessage comes through loud and clear. For them, abolishing overtime is \nmore important than every other provision in this bill.\n  Let's be clear. This is one of the most egregious and brazen attacks \non the American working family in years. The White House proposal would \naffect workers all over the country and virtually every sector of the \neconomy.\n  As I said, while I was home in South Dakota during the August recess, \nI heard from all kinds of people who came up to me on the streets, in \nstores, concerned about these changes and they told me how it would \ndevastate them: nurses and physician assistants caring for our sick, \nteachers educating our children, criminal investigators keeping our \nneighborhoods safe, and millions of others.\n  We need these people to do their jobs and to do them well. \nFrequently, their jobs ask that they work long hours away from their \nfamilies. Their time is valuable. Their work is critical. They deserve \nto be paid fairly. We should be taking every possible step to increase \njob opportunities for working Americans, but changing the FLSA will not \nonly undermine efforts to increase employment but lead to even more \nlost jobs as employers cut staff and demand increased hours from \nremaining employees.\n  This is a critical moment for our economy. Workers are struggling. \nInterest rates are rising. The number of people who are unemployed \nincreases every single day. The answer to our economic problems is not \nto take still more money out of the pockets of working Americans. We \ncannot allow workers to be forced to spend more time on the job and \nhave less pay to show for it.\n  Next week we will have an opportunity to vote on the Harkin \namendment. I must say for working families all over this country, I do \nnot think there will be a more important amendment this entire \nCongress. I would hope on a bipartisan basis we would say to this \nadministration that 65 years of progress in treating Americans right \nand fair ought not be reversed by some regulation in this \nadministration or by anybody else. Let us show on a bipartisan basis \nthat we stand with the workers. We will continue to provide them the \novertime pay they deserve.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1568 to Amendment No. 1542\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I have an amendment at the desk. I ask unanimous consent \nthe pending amendment be set aside and this amendment be considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle], for himself, \n     Ms. Collins, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Baucus, \n     Mr. Pryor, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Johnson, Mr. \n     Kerry, and Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1568 to amendment No. 1542.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n           (Purpose: To provide funding for rural education)\n\n       On page 76, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n       Sec.__. In addition to any amounts otherwise appropriated \n     under this Act to carry out part B of title VI of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     7341 et seq.), there are appropriated an additional \n     $132,347,000 to carry out such part: Provided, That of the \n     funds appropriated in this Act for the National Institutes of \n     Health, $25,000,000 shall not be available for obligation \n     until September 30, 2004: Provided further, That the amount \n     $6,895,199,000 in section 305(a)(1) of this Act shall be \n     deemed to be $7,027,546,000: Provided further, That the \n     amount $6,783,301,000 in section 305(a)(2) of this Act shall \n     be deemed to be $6,650,954,000.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank Senator Conrad and Senator \nCollins who have been partners in this effort. I thank them for their \ncosponsorship and I appreciate very much their help in addressing this \nchallenge.\n  America's rural schools today educate nearly 40 percent of the \nchildren in our country. Many face funding challenges because of \nlimited tax bases, their remote locations, and the large geographical \nareas they serve.\n  The Rural Education Achievement Program is part of the No Child Left \nBehind Act. It is designed to help schools in rural communities address \nthese challenges and make sure rural students have access to a high \nquality education. Unfortunately, this program, like so many others in \nthe new law, is grossly underfunded.\n  The amendment we offer today provides an additional $132 million to \nfully fund the REAP Program at the authorized level--I emphasize the \n``authorized'' level--of $300 million. REAP is the first Federal \nprogram dedicated to helping rural schools address the unique \nchallenges they face. It consists of two sections, the Small and Rural \nSchools Achievement Program and the Rural and Low-Income Schools \nProgram. Small school districts generally receive low levels of funding \nunder formula programs because of their small student populations, \nwhich are a very characteristic part of who they are. They also receive \nfewer competitive grants than their urban and suburban counterparts \nbecause they do not have grant writers. The Small and Rural Schools \nAchievement Program provides supplemental grants to rural schools with \n600 or fewer students. It also allows these schools to combine their \nformula funds into one flexible fund to address their most critical \nareas of need. In the first full year of funding, more than 4,000 \nschool districts applied to receive funding under the program. Of that \ngroup, 3,500 had never received competitive funds from the Department \nof Education. Over 85 percent of those who applied never received \ncompetitive funds in previous years from the Department of Education.\n  The average award in this program was $18,000. While the grants are \nsmall, most districts at least doubled the total funding they received \nfrom the Federal Government, and are able to use these resources to \naddress many of their very critical needs.\n  The Rural and Low-Income Schools Program is targeted to larger rural \ndistricts that have high levels of poverty.\n\n[[Page S11079]]\n\nThese grants flow through State education departments to eligible local \ndistricts. The resources are used to enhance teacher recruitment and \nretention, educational technology acquisition, afterschool enrichment \nactivities, and other areas that pose challenges for low-income rural \ndistricts.\n  More than 2,000 districts benefitted from this program in 2002, with \nan average award in that year of $30,000.\n  Nearly 40 percent of America's schoolchildren attend public schools \nin rural areas in small towns with populations of under 25,000. Almost \n50 percent of the Nation's public schools are located in rural areas in \nsmall towns and 41 percent of public school educators teach in rural \ncommunity schools.\n  Rural schools face formidable challenges in meeting the requirements \nof No Child Left Behind Act because their budgets are particularly \nlimited.\n  I was in Kadoka, South Dakota in early August and a teacher \napproached me on the street. All he wanted to talk about was the No \nChild Left Behind Act. All he could say is that, for them, compliance \nwas almost impossible unless they get some help. He pleaded with \nCongress to recognize the unique problems the No Child Left Behind Act \npresented to rural schools, especially Kadoka.\n\n  Per-pupil costs tend to be higher in rural districts. Because classes \nare smaller, the cost of providing teachers is higher per student. \nSuperintendents in South Dakota are also concerned about the impact of \nthe new teacher qualification requirements. Many teachers in rural \nschools teach several subjects but may not have degrees in all of those \nsubjects. This, too, was an issue the teacher in Kadoka mentioned to me \nand expressed grave concern about. He noted it can be very difficult to \nfind a good biology teacher, but in a small school that person often \nteaches general science and chemistry as well as physics because they \nhave no other choice.\n  Similarly, transportation costs can be significantly higher in rural \ndistricts since buses must travel longer distances with fewer students.\n  In spite of these circumstances, rural schools are expected to apply \nthe same academic standards and obtain the same higher results as urban \nand suburban school systems under the new law. Additional funding for \nrural school programs is desperately needed to help these schools \naddress their unique challenges so they, too, can improve student \nproficiency.\n  My State has a particularly large number of rural school districts. \nMore than two-thirds of our districts have fewer than 600 students. \nAdministrators tell me they do not have the staff to deal with the \npaperwork needed to complete Federal grants. For example, when I \nnotified our schools that the Early Reading First Program was seeking \nproposals, Jack Broome, the superintendent from Burke, SD, responded \nthat while he thought his students might benefit he was unable to \nassign anyone to fill out the preapplication which was more than 100 \npages long. He serves fewer than 250 children. Of those, 15 to 20 \nstudents need additional help with reading. REAP, however, is much \neasier to apply for and those funds are helping to fill that gap.\n  Although 2002 is the first year schools could participate in this \nprogram, 135 out of 177 school districts in South Dakota are currently \nparticipating just a year later. Nearly 40,000 children benefit in my \nState alone. School administrators tell me how much they appreciate and \nneed this help.\n  Doug Voss is the superintendent in Centerville, SD, an agricultural \ncommunity which educates about 250 students. They receive $17,809 in \nREAP funds, an increase of more than 10 percent above the amounts they \nreceived from other Federal programs. They used their funding to hire a \npart-time elementary schoolteacher, provide more training for other \nteachers, and expand their reading incentive program.\n  John LaFave, the superintendent of the Hansen school district, \nreceived $16,474. That represented a 10 percent increase in their \nFederal support. The Hansen school district serves 326 students. They \nused refunds to hire two teaching assistants to work with their growing \npopulation of English language learners.\n\n  The President's budget has actually proposed that we eliminate \nfunding for the REAP program, for 2 years in a row. He did it last \nyear, but Congress objected. He wanted to do it again this year.\n  The amendment I have offered would ensure that no student in a rural \ncommunity is left behind as schools work to implement education reform \nunder the No Child Left Behind Act. We simply cannot turn our backs on \nthe needs of these rural communities. They are doing all they can to \ncomply. Their intent is good. They are troubled; they are concerned; \nthey are frustrated by their inability to comply because they don't \nhave the resources.\n  Our amendment is very simple. It just says we are going to provide \nthe funding authorized under the law by title VI of the No Child Left \nBehind Act passed in 2001. That is all it does.\n  These funds will be spent to enhance key areas outlined by the law, \nincluding teacher recruitment and retention, professional development, \neducation technology, parental involvement, school safety, drug use \nprevention--all in an effort to enhance the academic achievement among \nrural students as we are demanding they do under the law.\n  This program is going to help many school districts, not only in my \nState but I daresay in every single State in the country. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important amendment. I hope we could see \noverwhelming bipartisan support as we take it to a vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as the Senator from South Dakota has \noutlined the need for funding in rural education, I think he raised a \nvery valid point. I have special reference to that, having grown up in \na small community myself, in a little town called Russell, KS. I think \nthe Presiding Officer knows one of my fellow townsmen, a fellow named \nDole, Bob Dole. It is a little town on the windswept plains of Kansas, \nhas 4,989 people. It used to have 5,000 until Dole and I left town.\n  I am not sure that Russell qualifies under the Rural Education \nAchievement Program, but I think it probably does. The rural areas need \nhelp, although Russell perhaps not as much as some. Russell is located \nin an area where there was a lot of oil underground. In fact, they \nfound oil to the south of town and to the northwest of town. Then they \nfound oil in the town. The requirements were that to drill an oil well \nthere had to be agreement of quite a number of property owners. They \ncouldn't get the agreement because nobody wanted the oil well in their \nbackyard. They all wanted the proceeds but didn't want the oil well. So \nI am not sure if Russell was in as great a need as some communities.\n  But that aside, just as a parenthetical expression, there is no doubt \nthat helping the rural part of America is very important. I think it is \nworth noting that this is a very new program. It came into existence \nwith the authorization in fiscal year 2002 at $162.5 million, raised $5 \nmillion in 2003. This year, the administration zeroed out the program, \nsaying there would be sufficient funds from other lines.\n  When our subcommittee took a look at all of the programs, we decided \nwe ought to keep it, and we funded it at a level rate, as we had to do \nwith so many programs.\n\n  In structuring an appropriations bill for the Department of Labor, \nwith worker safety; and the Department of Health with the tremendous \nneeds of NIH and Head Start; and the Education Department, with the \nmammoth needs in so many directions, it is a Hobson's choice every time \nwe turn around.\n  As the manager of the bill, along with Senator Harkin, we have worked \non a bipartisan basis. We felt constrained to live within our means as \ndefined by the budget resolution and by the 302(b) allocations.\n  If we are to measure up to the full authorization and put in $133 \nmillion, we would either have to cut into some of the existing funding, \nor we would have to go beyond our allocation. I would be at a loss, \nfrankly, to find where an offset might be found. If the proponent of \nthis amendment has any ideas on offsets, I would be delighted to \nconsider them on a comparative basis as to where the priorities ought \nto be.\n  When the Senator from South Dakota talks about all we want to do is\n\n[[Page S11080]]\n\ncome to the authorization, that is not quite so simple. It is the \ngeneralization that the authorization is characteristically higher than \nthe appropriation. This issue came up in our consideration of the Byrd \namendment. As I pointed out earlier, when it came to the issue of Title \nI funding for fiscal year 2002, when Senator Byrd was chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee and the Senator from South Dakota was the \nmajority leader, the appropriation was for $10.35 billion or $2.85 \nbillion under the authorization; so that the common practice is to have \nthe appropriation under, and frequently substantially under, the \nauthorization.\n  If you take a look at the Homeland Security bill, the Transportation \nSecurity Agency letter of intent for airport security had an \nauthorization of $500 million and an appropriation of $309 million. \nFire grants were $900 million authorization, $750 million \nappropriation. And so it goes on many lines. On the Violence Against \nWomen Act, authorization $667 million; appropriation, $407 million.\n  I could go down on item after item where an appropriation is \ncharacteristically not as high as the authorization.\n  So in essence, I find the arguments of the Senator from South Dakota \ncompelling on the desirability of having more funding for rural areas, \nhaving grown up in one myself, and, frankly, having been the \nbeneficiary of a very good education system. I have gone to some \noutstanding educational institutions, but I never had a better \neducation than at Russell High School or a better teacher than Ada May \nGroetzinger, who was the debate coach.\n  I think the Senator from South Dakota had a pretty good education, \ntoo, the way he handles himself, deports himself, and his achievement \nlevel. I would like to see many young people come out, come to the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate. Not too many more competitors from \nPennsylvania, I have enough this year. But I think the idea of \nimproving educational attainment and more funding is an excellent idea. \nI just wish I had more money at my disposal for my subcommittee to \ngrant the request made by the Senator from South Dakota. But I don't.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me say, first, I think the \ndistinguished chairman, as always, does a fine job in working with the \nallocation with which he is presented. That is not only his choice, I \nknow in many respects he has fought hard for greater allocations so we \ncan address many of these issues. So my argument is not with him. He is \nmaking the most out of a very difficult situation.\n  Having said that, let me just say a couple of other things. We have \nused the same mechanism in an offset for this amendment that our \ncolleague, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, used in \noffering his amendment to increase the subcommittee's allocation for \nfiscal 2004. So I join with Senator Stevens in using what apparently is \nan appropriate and acceptable mechanism for the offset.\n  So we have the offset. But I would make one other point. Again, I say \nthis with all deference to the chairman of the committee. I don't \nremember how he voted on the budget. I didn't vote for the budget. I \ndidn't vote for these allocations. I didn't vote for the priorities \nthat that budget presents--$3 trillion of tax cuts over the course of \nthe next 10 years.\n  We are going to be asked--I am told this morning by the White House--\nto find another $70 billion for Iraq. I am not sure yet what my vote \nwill be. I want to hear the justification from the administration. I \nwould like to ask them what their offset is. I would like to know how \nmuch money we are spending in rural Iraq for education compared to what \nwe are spending in rural South Dakota. If we can find $70 billion for \nIraq over the course of the next few months, I think we can find a few \nmillion dollars to fund the authorized amount of education funding for \nrural America so that we can go back and tell them they have the \nresources and now we want them to comply with the No Child Left Behind \nAct.\n  I don't know what answer I give to a school superintendent in South \nDakota when he says, You tell me I don't have the resources, and then \nyou--Daschle--go and vote for $70 billion for Iraq. Explain that to me. \nI don't have an answer.\n  Again, that is not the chairman's problem. But that is a problem I \nhave. That is a problem of priorities that I think this administration \nis yet to explain.\n  So I don't buy the administration's argument that we just do not have \nthe funds for education when we have all these funds and there is \napparently more where that came from when we need it for Iraq.\n  Again, I compliment the chairman for the work he does in meeting many \nof the needs we have. He has a tough job. But on this issue, I think we \ncan find the funds if we have the desire.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President. I am very pleased to join my distinguished \ncolleague and the minority leader as a cosponsor of an amendment to \nincrease funding for the Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP). No \nSenator has been a stronger advocate on behalf of rural schools and \nsupporter of REAP. The amendment would increase REAP funding by $132 \nmillion, bringing appropriations for the program to the authorized \nfunding level of $300 million under the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  As my colleagues are aware, the Senate Appropriations Committee \nreported a Labor-HHS bill that funds REAP at a level of $167.6 million \nfor fiscal year 2004, the same funding level as fiscal year 2003. The \nHouse Labor-HHS appropriations bill, H.R. 2660, includes $170 million \nfor REAP. I am especially grateful to appropriators in both the House \nand Senate for funding rural education, especially since the \nAdministration failed to recommend any funding for REAP in the fiscal \nyear 2004 budget.\n  While I am pleased with action by Senate appropriators to provide \n$167.6 million for REAP, the recent enactment of the No Child Left \nBehind Act has made clear the critical need for additional grant \nassistance for smaller, rural school districts. Historically, rural \nschool districts receive a smaller percentage of federal education \ndollars because of their inability to compete as effectively for \nfunding as larger urban or suburban districts are able to do. \nAdditionally, the geographic isolation of many smaller, rural schools, \nmany of which also have declining enrollments, a very limited tax base \nand significant transportation costs, makes it more difficult to find \nthe resources to provide certain educational opportunities for \nstudents.\n  As my colleagues may recall, Senator Susan Collins and I introduced \nlegislation to authorize the Rural Education Achievement Program during \nthe 106th Congress. At the time, we were very concerned that many \nsmaller, rural districts did not have the resources or staffing to \ncompete effectively for many of the Department of Education competitive \neducation grant programs. Additionally, in cases where rural school \ndistricts received formula allocated funds based on student population \nor other criteria, the funding was minimal and there was no flexibility \nto enable local school officials to more effectively use the limited \nfunds to help improve student achievement or professional development.\n  The REAP program was enacted late in the 106th Congress and initially \nfunded at a level of $162.5 million in fiscal year 2002. Under the REAP \nprogram, two small, rural schools programs were authorized. The Small \nand Rural Schools Achievement Program is a formula grant program that \nauthorizes grants directly from the DOE to eligible school districts. \nThe districts eligible under this program must have an average daily \nattendance of 600 students or less and be designated by the National \nCenter for Education Statistics, NCES, with a locale code of 7 or 8. \nUnder the Small and Rural Schools Achievement Program, school districts \nare permitted to consolidate new formula allocated funds under teacher \nquality, local technology, safe and drug free schools, and innovative \nprograms. The consolidated funds may be spent on any of the preceding \nprograms or Title I, Part A, language improvement and after school \nprograms.\n  Under the Rural and Low-Income Schools Program, funding is \ncompetitive and school districts may apply directly to DOE. School \ndistricts must have an NCES local code of 6, 7, or 8\n\n[[Page S11081]]\n\nand have a census poverty rate of 20 percent. Funds may be sued for \nteacher recruitment, professional development, parental involvement, \nTitle I, Part A, bilingual education or Safe and Drug Free Programs.\n  The REAP program is very important for smaller, rural schools, \nespecially with the new requirements for testing and professional \nstandards under the No Child Left Behind Act. Approximately 80 percent \nof schools in North Dakota are eligible for REAP funding. I know from a \nBudget Committee hearing that I chaired last week on implementation of \nthe No Child Left Behind Act and conversations with rural school \nofficials in North Dakota that the $1.2 million in REAP funding that \nwent to North Dakota last year helped 117 school districts meet some of \nthe challenges under the new Act. Funds were used for professional \ndevelopment for teachers, to provide distance learning opportunities to \nassist with the purchase of computer equipment for classrooms.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, funding in the fiscal year 04 Labor, \nHHS bill for No Child Left Behind including for rural education, is not \nadequate. Although S. 1356 provides $23.6 billion for DOE education \nprograms, the bill provides $8.4 billion less than the authorized level \nin fiscal year 04 for No Child Left Behind, including $132 million \nbelow the authorized level for REAP. Without question, we are not \nfulfilling our responsibility to provide adequate funding to states and \nlocal school officials to help communities achievement the goals under \nNCLB. REAP is an essential program under NCLB, and I hope that my \ncolleagues will support the Daschle amendment to fully fund rural \neducation at the $300 million level.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1572 To Amendment No. 1542\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for himself, Mr. \n     Hagel, Mr. Jeffords, Ms. Collins, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Dorgan, \n     Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. Pryor, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1572 to amendment No. 1542.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide additional funding for grants to States under part \n         B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act)\n\n       On page 76, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n       Sec.__. In addition to any amounts otherwise appropriated \n     under this Act for grants to States under part B of the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1411 \n     et seq.), there are appropriated an additional $1,200,000,000 \n     for such grants: Provided, That of the funds appropriated in \n     this Act for the National Institutes of Health, $84,000,000 \n     shall not be available for obligation until September 30, \n     2004: Provided further, That the amount $6,895,199,000 in \n     section 305(a)(1) of this Act shall be deemed to be \n     $8,095,199,000: Provided further, That the amount \n     $6,783,301,000 in section 305(a)(2) of this Act shall be \n     deemed to be $5,583,301,000.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself \nand my colleagues, Senator Hagel of Nebraska, Senator Jeffords of \nVermont, Senator Collins of Maine, Senator Murray, Senator Dorgan, \nSenator Bingaman, Senator Kerry, Senator Mikulski, and Senator Pryor. \nThere may be others who will ask to be added as a cosponsor, but those \nare the ones I have at this particular time.\n  This is an amendment that all of my colleagues are familiar with. \nThey have voted on this amendment on several occasions over the last \ndecade. On at least one occasion, we voted unanimously in support of an \neffort to increase funding for the Individuals With Disabilities \nEducation Act, commonly known as IDEA.\n  This amendment deals with special education funding. There is not a \nMember here who has not met a Governor, a mayor, a county supervisor, \nor a teacher who has not talked about this issue and the importance of \nit and the implications to their communities and their States if the \nFederal Government does not live up to its commitment of 40% full \nfunding. A commitment made almost three decades ago.\n  I offer today a modified version of full funding. We have already \nvoted once, in the last, I think, 24 or 48 hours, on a special \neducation proposal from my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Dayton. He \nproposed a far more aggressive program, one that would have added about \n$11 billion, if I am not mistaken, to this program. My amendment is \n$1.2 billion above the Labor-HHS appropriations for special education \ngrants to states. The budget within the bill adds $1 billion for Part B \nGrants to States. This amendment would add and additional $1.2 billion \nto that, for a total $2.2 billion increase.\n  Let me explain what we are trying to do and why I hope my colleagues \nunderstand how critically important this issue is, regardless of \nwhatever feelings they have had about other proposals. First, \nobviously, this amendment will help provide needed education for \nchildren with special needs. Second, it will provide financial relief \nfor communities.\n  Most of the dollars spent on special education come from local \nproperty taxes. Some States are different, but the overwhelming \nmajority of States in this country support educational efforts through \nlocal property taxes. If we do not continue to provide some additional \nsupport and live up to the commitments we made three decades ago to \nfund IDEA at 40%, you are going to see an increase in local property \ntaxes to meet these obligations. I don't think anyone needs to spell \nout the kind of hardship that would pose for a lot of families across \nthis country. Families that are already facing tremendous economic \npressures, with high unemployment, and with huge deficits at the State \nand local levels.\n  You have heard over and over again of the tremendous pressures \ncommunities are facing today. You have heard about the added burden of \nhaving to watch property taxes go up to meet obligations we promised we \nwould make at the Federal level in regards to special education. This \namendment would ease that burden by picking up some of the cost.\n  As I said, almost 30 years ago Congress passed the Individuals With \nDisabilities Education Act. This was designed to help States provide \nall children in this country with disabilities with a free, appropriate \npublic education in the least restrictive environment possible.\n  When we passed this legislation, the Federal Government also made a \ncommitment to our States and localities. We said we would cover 40 \npercent of the State cost of servicing these students with special \nneeds over time.\n\n  Thirty years later--three decades later--we have yet to make good on \nthat commitment. Today, our level of commitment hovers around 18 \npercent, not 40 percent. This means, of course, that States are bearing \nmore than their share of responsibility for meeting a federally \nmandated requirement regarding disabled student's needs. States that, \nmind you, are facing astronomical deficits, as I mentioned a few \nmoments ago. States that often have no choice but to pass costs on to \nmunicipalities, which then, of course, pass them on to every-day, \naverage American taxpayers through local property tax increases.\n  The amendment I am offering with my colleague from Nebraska, Senator \nHagel, Senator Jeffords, Senator Collins, and others, is designed \nspecifically to provide some relief in this area. This legislation \nwould add an additional $1.2 billion to the special education fund, \nbringing us up to a $2.2 billion in the total increase to grants to \nStates. This is exactly what we promised to provide in the fiscal year \n2004 budget resolution. This is exactly what we voted on. We said this \nis what we would provide, an additional $2.2 billion. So not only did \nwe make a commitment 30 years ago to provide 40 percent of the funding, \nas recently as within the last year this body made a\n\n[[Page S11082]]\n\ncommitment that we would fund an additional $2.2 billion in grants to \nStates in the area of special education.\n  This amendment makes us live up to that commitment. This $1.2 billion \nadded increase would raise the level of the Federal Government's IDEA \ncommitment to 21 percent from 18 percent. That is just over half of the \n40 percent we set as a goal almost 30 years ago. At this rate, $2.2 \nbillion a year, the Federal Government would meet its goal of 40 \npercent full funding by the year 2012, some 9 years from now.\n  I know there are those who would suggest that we ought to fully fund \nthis immediately. I wish we could do that. I would be supportive of \nthat kind of an effort, but, obviously, given the tremendous fiscal \nproblems we face at the national level, it is impossible. So rather \nthan suggest we fully fund a remaining 21 percent or more, what we are \nsuggesting here is a $2.2 billion increase for one year. If we \nmaintained this increase over the next 9 years, up until the year 2012, \nwe could fully fund the commitment that we made 30 years ago.\n  Currently the Labor-HHS appropriations bill adds roughly $1 billion \nin grants to states. According to the Congressional Research Service, \nthis boost would fund IDEA at about 18.7 percent. More importantly, if \nthis $1 billion increase were to become the standard rate of increase \nover the coming years, we would never fully fund the special education \nprogram. We would never be able to meet the goal that we promised 30 \nyears ago of 40-percent funding, certainly not by the year 2012.\n  Again, the cost of special education is extremely high. We all know \nthat. Talk to any superintendent of schools, any mayor, county \nsupervisor, Governor, any teacher in any school, and they will tell \nyou, whether they are Democrats or Republicans, anywhere in the United \nStates, all 50 States, the cost of this program is extremely high. They \nunderstand the need for it as well. If you talk to them you begin to \nunderstand the tremendous fiscal pressures they feel in their \ncommunities. In fact, I am quite sure every one of us in this body, \nincluding in the other body, have had these types of conversations with \nour mayors and other local leaders, telling us how important it is that \nwe try to meet our special education commitment of 40 percent.\n  Better yet, talk to any rural mayor or selectman in my State, \nVermont, Nebraska, any one of the communities around this country, and \nyou will begin to understand how as little as two or three special \neducation students in a rural community can throw an entire district's \nbudget off balance. These school districts need our help. They have \nbeen asking for it year in and year out.\n  To the credit of this institution, in years past we have risen to the \nchallenge. This body has voted in support of special education funding. \nKeep in mind that the amendment I am offering on which Senators Hagel, \nJeffords, and Collins worked closely, provides for an additional $1.2 \nbillion for only 1 additional year. It is not full funding. In the \ncontext of this bill, we have not asked to fully fund IDEA over a set \nnumber of years. We are merely asking that we provide our States with \nsome fiscal relief now and provide our taxpayers with some fiscal \nrelief now by providing States and rural counties with the funds they \nneed to carry out their obligations to children with special needs \ntoday. It is a modest proposal but a much needed one across the \ncountry.\n  In my State of Connecticut, in spite of spending hundreds of millions \nof dollars to fund special education programs in our school districts--\nand it is true in almost every other State across the country--schools \nare struggling to meet the needs of students with disabilities. The \ncosts borne by local communities and school districts are rising \ndramatically. The local burden is immense. This amendment is an \nopportunity not to alleviate it entirely but to alleviate some of that \nburden. Providing an additional $1.2 billion for special education not \nonly demonstrates this body's commitment to universal access to \neducation for all children, it helps entire communities by easing the \ntax burden of everyday taxpayers.\n\n  When we do not meet our Federal funding obligations then a mayor or \ncounty executive has to make up the difference. As you can imagine, \nthere are only two ways to do this: Either you slash social services or \nyou raise local taxes. I don't know about my colleagues, not all of \nthem, but I can assure you that now is not the time to raise local \ntaxes. I also do not want to see our students shortchanged in the \nquality and quantity of the programs that are offered from town to town \nand city to city all across the country. I don't understand how raising \ntaxes or cutting services or quality of services are even options that \nought to be considered.\n  Recently the President signed into law a tax cut of over a hundred \nbillion dollars for some of the wealthiest of our fellow citizens. I \nrepresent, of course, one of the most affluent States in this country, \nConnecticut. Still I can say without equivocation that the vast \nmajority of people in my State would support increasing expenditures \nfor something as important as education. In fact, I know and am \nconfident that even the wealthiest of my citizens, who are the \nbeneficiaries of some of the tax cuts, would much rather see resources \nused to improve the quality of education for children in the 21st \ncentury than to provide a tax cut which most of them would tell you \nthey don't need at all.\n  I am asking today that Congress, without equivocation, support the \nsame thing that the overwhelming majority of our citizens say they \nsupport. I say this with the understanding that the Federal Government \nis facing its own budget challenge similar to that of the States. I \nunderstand that our economy is slumping and that the deficits at the \nState level are estimated to run at roughly $100 billion. Still, I \ncannot accept the argument that because our economy is faltering, we \ncannot provide our children and their families with the critical \neducational resources they need, and we need, as a nation. I cannot \naccept that we cannot increase the Federal commitment to special \neducation and otherwise ease the burden of the average American \ntaxpayer.\n  I do not find it acceptable, further, that we are yet again passing \nthe overwhelming majority of costs of special education implementation \non to our States. I do not find it acceptable that we are passing on \nthe overwhelming majority of costs of special education implementation \non to our local taxpayers.\n  Having said all of this, I stress again, education needs to be viewed \nas, and remain, a national priority. Investment in education is no less \nimportant in a weak economy. In fact, I could make a case it is more \nimportant. Education is the gateway to a better life, the key to a \nhealthy democracy, and absolutely essential to our long-term national \neconomic growth and security. For these reasons, I ask that my \ncolleagues help our schools, our families, and our children by \nproviding them with the resources they need to maximize their \npotential.\n  My colleagues understand that and know well how strongly the \nGovernors, mayors, and county executives across this Nation feel about \nthis issue. Inevitably, over the years they list special education as \none of the most, if not the most, important areas in which the Federal \nGovernment can assist them by meeting the obligation that we proposed \n30 years ago.\n  Thirty years ago, when we passed the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act, we told States we would help them meet their \nconstitutional obligation to provide children with disabilities a free, \nappropriate education by providing States with 40 percent of the cost. \nThey would have to pick up 60 percent. The States accepted this ratio \nof 40 to 60 percent.\n  Tragically, for three decades the States have picked up 80 percent; \nin fact, only recently, 80. Up until a few years ago it was more.\n  The amendment I am offering only gets us about halfway to 40 percent, \nto about 21 percent. At a rate of $2.2 billion it would be another 9 \nyears before we fully meet the 40 percent obligation. But we have to \nstart. We have passed this legislation in the past, or at least similar \nlegislation, and regrettably the other body has refused to accept it \nand rejected it. But that doesn't mean we ought not to keep on trying.\n  I hope the President will step up and support this effort. Every \nmayor and Governor I have ever talked to, Republican or Democrat, tells \nme they need help in this area and they want us to live up to our \nobligations.\n\n[[Page S11083]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support the effort my colleagues from \nNebraska, Maine, Vermont, and I, and others, are offering. This is a \nbipartisan amendment being offered by Democrats and Republicans. This \nis one area in which we ought to find common cause and common bond and \nsay to our States and mayors: We hear you. You are under great pressure \ntoday, tremendous pressure and we can help. Here is a modest proposal \nto get us to a level of funding that can truly make a difference in our \nNation.\n\n  I will remind my colleagues that just 2 years ago a bipartisan group \nof 31 Members of this Chamber introduced legislation to direct the \nAppropriations Committee funds to fully fund special education by the \nyear 2007. That bill, S. 466, was the foundation of the Harkin-Hagel \namendment to the No Child Left Behind Act. It was passed by this body \non a unanimous vote. Every single Member of this body voted for it. It \nwould have increased Federal support for special education by $2.5 \nbillion a year until we reached full funding.\n  Unfortunately, because of strong opposition from the President of the \nUnited States and the Republican House leadership, this provision, \nadopted unanimously by this body, was not included in the final \ndrafting of the No Child Left Behind Act. The administration seemed to \nbe saying no child left behind--unless, of course, he or she is a \nspecial needs child.\n  Today's amendment builds on the step this body took in 2001, 2 years \nlater, through the Harkin-Hagel amendment, to fully meet our special \neducation obligation. Today's amendment enables us, once again, as a \nbipartisan body, to recommit ourselves to this cause.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment because it is good for \nstudents, families, for schools, municipalities, States, and for the \naverage American taxpayer, because so much of education is paid for \nthrough local property taxes. Before 1975, only 20 percent of children \nwith disabilities received a formal education. Eighty percent of kids \nwith special needs were being left out of the educational process. \nToday, as a result of the Special Education Act, we serve 5.4 million \nschool age children, as well as 200,000 infants and toddlers, and \n600,000 preschoolers. That is something for which all of us can be \ndeeply proud.\n  I remember working on this idea when, under President Gerald Ford, I \nwas a new Member of Congress--30 years ago. I had a head of black hair \nin those days. And while it has turned white over 30 years of \nexperience around here, I remember the great sense of pride in the \ncountry when President Ford initiated the effort to not leave behind 80 \npercent of special education students that were not getting services.\n  Let me recite the numbers again because every Member ought to be \nproud of the fact that this is a better and stronger country today \nbecause special education children are getting an opportunity to \nmaximize their potential through our public schools, are getting an \nopportunity to be self-sufficient, independent, contributing citizens. \n5.4 million school age children, 200,000 infants, and 600,000 \npreschoolers are all getting assistance as a result of IDEA. This \nassistance is being paid primarily with local property tax money.\n  We need to step up and meet our obligation. As a result of special \neducation legislation, the number of children with disabilities who \ngraduate from high school and go on to college has increased \nsignificantly over the last few years. These are things for which \nAmerica can be proud.\n  Yet, while we are proud, we must also be concerned with the \ndifficulty the cost of this program causes for cash-strapped States and \nlocalities in our Nation. We need to recognize that if we do our part--\nif we provide States with additional special education funds--we are \nhelping to relieve tax burdens.\n\n  I am going to be asked, I am sure, how do we pay for this. We do this \nby forward funding--an idea used here by others in the Chamber. By \nforward funding, we can pick up the cost without creating the kinds of \nhardships that are felt by slashing away at other programs that need \ncontinued support.\n  Let me just mention, if I can, what this amendment may mean to States \nin terms of additional assistance. I don't have every State here, but \nto give you an idea, this amendment would provide an additional $130 \nmillion for California; $14 million for my State of Connecticut; for \nNebraska, $8 million; for New Hampshire, $5 million; for Pennsylvania, \n$49 million more for special needs kids; for Tennessee, $26 million \nmore. Think of what that means to the States. I will provide these \nnumbers for my colleagues so they know exactly how much more passing \nthis amendment would mean to their States. What kind of relief it could \nprovide for them as they struggle to meet fiscal burdens and \nchallenges.\n  I see my colleague from Vermont is here, a cosponsor of the \namendment. I don't know how my colleague from Pennsylvania wishes to \nproceed. I presume he wants to hear from all of us.\n  At this point, I yield the floor and I hope others may be heard on \nthis issue. I think it is extremely important and it is my fervent hope \nthat this is an amendment that deserves broad-based support.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota, Mr. Coleman, be added as a cosponsor as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. We are getting to the point where we have almost as many \nDemocrats as Republicans cosponsoring this amendment. My hope is that \nwe can all join together on this. We have been divided on a lot of \nissues. Special needs kids deserve us joining forces. We ought to \ndemonstrate that we can do things together on something such as this. \nWe did it in 2001. It is 2003 now and the problems are so much more \nsevere today in terms of the burdens on States and localities.\n  I hope I can add every Senator to this amendment. What a wonderful \nmessage that would be as we have come back from the August break. The \nschool year has begun and parents are worried about whether resources \nwill be there for their kids. Taxpayers wonder whether there will be \nadditional costs to them. This amendment provides an opportunity for us \nto get together and send a resounding message across the country that \nwe are willing to get this job done. It may take another 9 or 10 years, \nbut we are on the road to getting it done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues, \nSenators Dodd, Hagel, and others, in offering the amendment today that \nwill provide an additional $1.2 billion in funding for special \neducation. This will bring the total to $2.2 billion and put us on the \npath to fully fund special education within 8 years.\n  Unfortunately, I think this has become an annual event. Every year we \ntry again to make the Federal Government fulfill its promise of nearly \n30 years ago. Every year we have tried and every year we have failed. \nThis battle started in 1975 when Congress passed the special education \nbill. As a freshman Congressman, I had the pleasure of working on that \nbill with my colleague, then-Congressmen Harkin and Dodd.\n  We recognized that special education would be costly, and we pledged \nto help States by covering 40 percent of these costs. But time and time \nagain, the Federal Government has failed to keep its word. Instead of \nproviding 40 percent, as we promised, we are currently providing only \n18 percent.\n\n  The bill before us proposes to increase spending by about $1 billion, \nand many of my colleagues will speak to how significant an increase \nthis is.\n  I wish to recognize the chairman and the ranking member for their \nefforts on increasing special education funding, but I am afraid it is \njust not enough to meet the needs of our schools. We could increase \nspecial education spending by $1 billion each year, but at this rate we \ncould never reach the level of funding that was promised.\n  Congress has failed time and again to keep its word on special \neducation, and I am both embarrassed and troubled by this. I am \nembarrassed because we claim to be committed to educating our children, \nbut we do not provide the support to our local schools to do so.\n  This pattern of chronic underfunding hurts all the children. When \nschool boards develop their budgets, they have\n\n[[Page S11084]]\n\na court-ordered constitutional responsibility to ensure that special \neducation needs are addressed. Too often, they are forced to raise \nlocal property taxes or to cut services to all children. Failure to \nfully fund our share of special education forces our school boards to \nmake impossible choices and divides our communities.\n  We cannot continue to pretend we are doing our part here in \nWashington. We cannot continue to call for higher standards and greater \nachievement while not living up to our end of the bargain. We cannot \ncontinue to pit our students against each other in classrooms and \nschool board meetings across the country. And we cannot continue to \nleave our States, our towns, and our local taxpayers to foot the bill \nbecause the Federal Government has failed to keep its promise.\n  I am troubled because in my State of Vermont, a promise is not made \ncasually or taken lightly. In developing this legislation which has \nhelped so many, I gave my word that this would be a shared \nresponsibility and that the Federal Government would pay its fair \nshare. We have not, and this has gone on for too long.\n  We have heard over and over from State legislatures and school boards \naround the country that full funding of special education is a top \npriority, a constitutional requirement.\n  In my small State of Vermont, we are talking about the difference \nbetween $21 million, the amount of the Federal special education funds \nmy State will receive this year, and $44 million, which is what Vermont \nwould have received if we had just kept our promise.\n  Right now, my State is struggling, like so many others, to cut \nbudgets because of the economic downturn. Education dollars will not be \nspared, and that additional $23 million would have gone a long way this \nyear toward easing the pain of the State's budget crunch.\n  We are here today to ask the Federal Government to keep its promise. \nWhile we are almost 30 years overdue, there is no better time than now \nto do it. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. The Senate \nhas repeatedly passed symbolic votes to fully fund IDEA, but these \nvotes have been nothing more than symbolic. It is time to move beyond \nthe symbolism. Please join me in passing this bipartisan legislation. \nPlease allow us to be able to look into the eyes of the children and \nthe citizens of our States and tell them we have kept our promise.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Vermont for his \nleadership on this issue. Along with Senator Harkin, we were both \nfreshmen Members of Congress in 1975. President Gerald Ford, along with \nthe Congress, adopted the legislation which created the act to deal \nwith students with disabilities. Senator Jeffords has been a champion \non this issue for 30 years. I am so pleased to be joining with him in \nthis effort once again. I regret it has taken us this long. We have had \nsome great successes in the past.\n  As I mentioned earlier, less than 2 years ago we voted unanimously to \nsend a message that we cared about this issue. In fact, we adopted a \nlarger sum of money than what we are asking for today. The amendment \nSenator Jeffords offered, along with Senator Harkin and Senator Hagel, \nwas for $2.5 billion. We are talking about $2.2 billion, when you add \nthe $1.2 billion that is in the bill. It is less than what we asked for \n2 years ago to get us on a road to meeting the full 40 percent funding \ncommitment we made 30 years ago.\n  I thank the Senator from Vermont once again for his tireless efforts \non behalf of America's children, their families, and taxpayers. I know \nothers want to be heard on this matter.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a listing of all the \nincreases, to print what this $1.2 billion will mean State by State. I \nknow the Presiding Officer, my good friend, will be curious to know how \nIdaho would do. Idaho will get an additional $6 million under this \nprogram if we get these additional dollars for special education funds. \nI am quickly looking down the list because I do not want to leave out \nmy colleague from Oregon. An additional $14 million will go to his \ncommunities to defray the cost of special needs children. I include \nwhat this amount means to each State so my colleagues can have some \nidea as to how they will benefit.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                         FY2004 Senate

..................\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I thank my colleague \nfrom Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before they leave, I commend my colleague \nfrom Connecticut, Senator Dodd, and my colleague from Vermont, Senator \nJeffords, for the tremendous work they are doing on behalf of that \ncritically important population of kids.\n  As the Senator from Connecticut noted, my home State would receive \nsubstantial sums under their important amendment. I support it and urge \nall my colleagues in the Senate to support the amendment.\n\n\n                          Iraq Reconstruction\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, news reports last week revealed that the \nBechtel Corporation would be receiving an extra $350 million in Iraq \nreconstruction work over and above the $680 million contract they were \nawarded by the U.S. Agency for International Development earlier this \nyear.\n  Meanwhile, it was also reported that the Halliburton company has been \nawarded contracts totaling $1.7 billion in connection with the war in \nIraq.\n  Despite repeated promises by the administration to recompete \nHalliburton's contract, most recently in July, this has still not \noccurred.\n  This is especially relevant today because the papers today reveal \nthat the administration intends to seek more than $60 billion in \nadditional taxpayer funding to cover the mounting costs in Iraq, and \nthat is, of course, on top of the $79 billion wartime supplemental \nfunding the President signed into law last April.\n  I come to the floor this afternoon because as this new debate begins, \nit should be noted that not once have U.S. taxpayers been given a true \naccounting of expenditures in Iraq.\n  This summer, I held, like so many colleagues, town meetings at home. \nI had 10 town meetings all across Oregon, and repeatedly at these \nsessions citizens would come up and say: Where are these vast sums \ngoing? What is being done to prevent waste in these expenditures? And \nisn't something being done to make sure that at a time when we are \nhaving so much difficulty in Oregon funding schools, health care, and \nessential services, steps are being taken at the national level to make \nsure these huge sums being spent for Iraqi reconstruction are being \nspent wisely?\n  But the fact is that the public and the Congress are in the dark with \nrespect to a true accounting for these expenditures for Iraq \nreconstruction. I think the American people and the Congress deserve \nbetter.\n  The budget presented earlier this summer by the Administrator for \nIraq, L. Paul Bremer, in effect, used accounting that resembled the \napproach about which Enron was talking. It had over $1 billion in \ncapital expenditures off budget, and if these costs had been included, \nthe budget simply would not have been in balance.\n  Certainly, no private company could operate this way. Its accounting \nwould never pass muster with the Securities and Exchange Commission \nunder the Corporate Accountability Act.\n  My concern is the American taxpayers do not want to find themselves, \nwith respect to these Iraqi reconstruction expenditures, in a situation \nlike so many Enron employees faced--I had constituents involved in \nthis--that hits them when the house of cards begins to crumble.\n  With enormous sums at stake, American taxpayers deserve a full \naccounting of what they are getting for their hard-earned tax dollars.\n  The question now for the Senate is: How much longer is the Congress \ngoing to continue to shovel money out the door for Iraqi reconstruction \nwithout insisting on the truth for those at home whom we represent? \nAmericans have been kept in the dark about how these handpicked \ncontractors go about doing their business.\n  Senator Collins, Senator Clinton, myself, and a group of Senators on \na bipartisan basis, have been concerned about the substantial evidence \nthat indicates that these contractors were not picked because they were \nthe most cost competitive. In a rare moment of candor, one of the \nofficials in the administration actually admitted that they were using \ncompanies to perform work that could be done at a lower cost. Yet there \nhas been no justification for that, no explanation as to why time and \nagain Federal agencies have let contracts for Iraqi reconstruction \nwithout asking for competitive bids at all or by confining the bidding \nprocess to a select group of U.S. companies that seem to have very good \nconnections.\n  Earlier this year in the Defense appropriations bill, I was able to \nwrite into the legislation a measure that would require the \nadministration to explain why it chose to let billions of dollars in \nprivate contracts for reconstruction go forward without open and \ncompetitive bidding. That measure is now in conference. I urge my \ncolleagues to accept that provision, make sure that it gets to the \nPresident's desk, and that there is some accountability with respect to \nthese dollars.\n  If billions of dollars are going to go out in private contracts, the \nrule ought to be open competitive bidding. Colleagues such as Senator \nCollins, who chairs the Committee on Governmental Affairs, have great \nexpertise in this area. There have been various reports in recent years \nthat have documented how it is fraught with problems for taxpayers if \nwe get away from the principle of open and competitive bids. Yet it \nseems that the closed-bid process, closed and secret bids, are more the \nrule rather than the exception with respect to Iraqi reconstruction \ncontracts.\n  I believe if Federal agencies had to justify their spending decisions \nin Iraq, there would be egregious cases of waste that would be stopped. \nWe would not see money funneled to a handpicked group of companies, and \nwe would see more of the contracts awarded to lower bidders who \nactually had to compete, and the public would see the fruits of full \nand open competition.\n  Clearly, as this rebuilding effort goes forward, the American people \nare saying, at a time when our schools are closing early, at a time \nwhen we have bridges, roads, and critical infrastructure crumbling from \nneglect, they want to know what is being done to ensure that their tax \ndollars are spent in a judicious fashion.\n  This is not the first time this request has been made on the Senate \nfloor, and I am certainly not the only Senator who has been issuing \nthis call. As I said, on various legislation, the Defense \nauthorization, the Defense appropriations bill, a bipartisan group of \nus, particularly the chair of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, \nSenators Collins, Clinton, Byrd, Lieberman, and myself, all of us have \nsaid it is time for some sunshine. It is time for some sunshine at a \nperiod when vast sums of the people's money are being used for Iraqi \nreconstruction, and yet little is known about how this money is being \nspent and whether it is being spent in a prudent fashion.\n\n  At a time when Oregon families are hurting, when we are having \ndifficulty getting funds for education at home in Oregon--and I know \nthis is true elsewhere--I want the full truth about how these tax \ndollars are being spent in Iraq and why the administration is refusing \nto use the most cost-effective method again and again for doling these \ndollars out.\n  Most of all, it is time for the administration to level with the \npublic. At this point, virtually the only information Congress and the \ncitizens of this\n\n[[Page S11086]]\n\ncountry have with respect to these billions of dollars worth of \ncontracts are the news reports. Certainly, what I am reading makes the \nIraqi contracting process look more like a cash grab for a few \ncompanies than a fair process to get the taxpayer the best deal. \nInstead of awarding the contracts to the lowest bidders, too often the \nadministration has funneled ever larger sums to a select group of \ncompanies that seem awfully well connected.\n  Now, more than ever, taxpayers deserve to know the terms of the \ncontracts that have been awarded and how these contractors were \nselected.\n  My amendment to the Defense appropriations bill would require the \ndisclosure of that critical information. It would create not just \nopenness in the contracting process but would help ensure that the \ncareful spending of tax dollars in Iraq gets the value that America's \nworking families deserve.\n  I think virtually every Member of the Senate would agree that the \nAmerican people should not be asked to write blank check after blank \ncheck for the cost of rebuilding Iraq. They certainly should not be \nasked to do it when they have gotten absolutely no answers with respect \nto how their money is being spent and why. The American people have not \nreceived any assurance that their tax dollars are not being wasted in \nIraq while so many of them are hurting at home.\n  So I intend to keep this fight visible on the Senate floor. I think \nall of us ought to be taking every step possible. We have two pieces of \nlegislation to do it, to ensure that there is accountability for these \nexpenditures, and to ensure that actual steps are taken to cut the \nwaste. The families I represent in Oregon deserve careful, not \nwasteful, spending of tax dollars that are used to reconstruct Iraq. \nRight now, those citizens and the Congress are in the dark and the \nAmerican people deserve better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on two of the \namendments that I am pleased to join my colleagues in cosponsoring. \nFirst, let me acknowledge the hard work of Senator Specter and Senator \nHarkin in shaping this bill. There are so many important priorities. \nThey have done a very good job.\n  The amendments I have cosponsored have to do with education spending. \nFirst, I think it is important that all of the Members of this body \nacknowledge and recognize that under President Bush's leadership we \nhave invested unprecedented amounts of Federal funding to improve the \neducation of our children. We should never forget that fact. In fact, \nPresident Bush's budgets are 60 percent higher for education funding \nthan the budgets presented under President Clinton. Nevertheless, there \nare a couple of areas where I think we can do even better and make a \nreal difference.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1566\n\n  For this reason, I have been very pleased to join my colleague from \nMassachusetts in offering an amendment to the bill to provide \nadditional funding for higher education.\n  Our system of higher education is in many ways the envy of the world, \nbut its benefits today have not been distributed equally to all \nAmericans. As tuition rises, the road to higher education in America \ngets steeper and harder to climb for low- and middle-income families.\n  In 1979, a student in the top quartile of family income was four \ntimes more likely to obtain a baccalaureate degree by age 24 than a \nstudent from the bottom quartile. That discrepancy has grown by an \nadditional 70 percent by graduation day for the class of 2001.\n\n  Tuition fees at 4-year public colleges have increased by 40 percent \nover the past decade. Everyone is familiar with the pressures State \nbudgets are under, and that, too, has caused more pressure on the \ntuition at public universities and colleges.\n  At the same time, the value of Pell grants has declined by nearly \nhalf over the last 20 years. Today, Pell grants cover only 40 percent \nof the average fixed costs at 4-year public colleges whereas 20 years \nago the Pell grant covered more than 80 percent of public college \nexpenses.\n  From my experience in working at a Maine college before my election \nto the Senate, I know how critical Pell grants and other forms of \nFederal financial aid are in opening the doors of educational \nopportunity to many students. In fact, at Husson College where I \nworked, 85 percent of the students were reliant on Pell grants and \nstudent loans to finance their college education. Without that \nassistance, they simply would not be able to afford higher education.\n  I found more and more of our students are graduating with a mound of \ndebt because of that change in ratio. It used to be that Pell grants \nand other forms of assistance covered most of the costs of a college \neducation. Now, they cover far less and thus our students are forced to \ntake out more and more and greater and greater amounts of loans to \nfinance their education.\n  I am not saying education should be paid for the students, but we \nneed to strike the right balance or else the doors of higher education \nand, thus, economic opportunity will be slammed shut for far too many \nlow-income families.\n  Therefore, our amendment provides $2.2 billion to help fund crucial \nhigher education programs including Pell grants, the SEOG, Work-Study, \nPerkins loans, the LEAP program, GEAR UP, and last but not least, the \nTRIO programs. The Kennedy-Collins amendment would provide desperately \nneeded funding to increase the maximum Pell grant award. Our amendment \nprovides a $450 increase in the maximum Pell grant and increases Pell \ngrants to approximately 4.8 million students with a median family \nincome of only $15,200. A Pell grant makes all the difference to these \nlow-income families. It makes the difference between their children \nhaving economic opportunity, being able to pursue an education that is \nso necessary for a brighter future, that is necessary to participate in \nthe American dream.\n  We can take this step, we can provide this $450 increase in Pell \ngrants to these low-income children. In my State of Maine, this \namendment results in an increase of $6.3 million in Pell grant aid.\n  I also want to talk about the importance of this amendment and the \nsignificant increases for other student-oriented programs. Again, I \ncommend the committee and subcommittee chairmen for their hard work in \nbringing education spending up to unprecedented levels.\n  There is a program that I believe is so important to expanding \nopportunity for so many students. That is the TRIO Program. Our \namendment provides a $160 million increase. The TRIO programs may be \nbetter known to many of my colleagues as Upward Bound, for example. \nThat is an example of the TRIO programs. They help first-generation \ncollege students and low-income students get on the right track and \nbegin to think about higher education as something that should be part \nof their lives.\n\n  I have talked to many students in Maine whose parents did not have \nthe advantage of higher education. They told me that prior to \nparticipating in the TRIO programs, they just did not realize that \ncollege could be part of their lives. The TRIO programs exposed them to \nhigher education, encouraged them, counseled them, helped them afford \nSATs, for example. It makes a difference. It truly changes the lives of \nso many students who come from families with absolutely no experience \nin higher education.\n  We have proposed to increase the funding for TRIO programs as well as \nfor the GEAR UP and LEAP program which are aimed at younger children. \nThe sooner we get students interested in higher education, the better. \nThese programs change lives for the better. I hope we can help keep the \ndoors of higher education open to all qualified students no matter \ntheir financial needs.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1568\n\n  I am also very pleased to be a cosponsor of an amendment offered by \nSenator Daschle and Senator Conrad that would increase the funding for \nthe Rural Education Achievement Program. This program I authored along \nwith Senator Conrad as part of the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  Again, I acknowledge the tremendous efforts of the chairman, Senator \nSpecter, on behalf of rural schools. The administration's budget, I am \nsad to say, eliminated funding altogether for the\n\n[[Page S11087]]\n\nRural Education Achievement Program. Senator Specter was able to \nrestore this funding, which I deeply appreciate. It is essentially flat \nfunded, however, and I would like to see an increase.\n  Our rural schools--and in Maine, that is 56 percent of the school \ndistricts in the State--need help in meeting the mandates of the No \nChild Left Behind Act. Children in small rural school districts deserve \nthe same educational opportunities as their more urban counterparts.\n  We enacted the Rural Education Achievement Program to respond to two \nproblems. First, smaller school districts do not have the grant writers \nand the other resources to compete for Federal grants the way the \nlarger, more urban school districts do. Second, they often receive so \nlittle funding under the formula programs that it is not sufficient to \naccomplish the goals of those programs.\n  So the concept behind the Rural Education Achievement Program was to \ngive more funding for rural schools, that they would not have to go \nthrough an elaborate grant-writing process, and to give them the \nflexibility of combining funding streams so they could have the funds \navailable that would make a difference.\n  Let me give a couple of examples. In Jackman, ME, for example, a \nsmall community in western Maine, last year the school district \nreceived $16,000 in REAP funding in the Rural Education Achievement \nProgram. The superintendent plans to use that money to support \ntechnology in the classroom and teacher training. There are other \nexamples. In the Bradley School District in Penobscot County, ME, with \n104 students, they received $21,000 through the Rural Education \nAchievement Program. The total Federal formula funding under ESEA going \nto this small school district will be about $25,000 this year. That is \nenough to allow Bradley the flexibility to hire a part-time reading \nspecialist to meet the mandates of No Child Left Behind, to update \ncomputer systems, or provide some extended-day learning opportunities.\n  With the increased challenges of No Child Left Behind, our Nation's \nrural school districts need the additional financial resources and the \nflexibility provided by the rural education program now more than ever.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this amendment as \nwell.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I think the managers, if I can get \nSenator Harkin's attention, are prepared to go to third reading. That \nnotion is gaining support on the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. What a jester you are. I wouldn't mind it.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Senator Harkin says he wouldn't mind. It is not a formal \ncommitment. This may replace late-night television, Mr. President.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Does that mean you will accept all our amendments and \njust go to third reading?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Does that mean we will accept all your amendments? Let's \nhear some amendments so I will know if I can accept them or not. You \ncannot accept a pig in a poke, as the expression goes. I think that is \nan Iowa expression. It comes from Waterloo, IA.\n  Senator Harkin and I are prepared to go to third reading if we don't \nhave amendments down here by 4:15.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Waterloo, MO.\n  Mr. SPECTER. In a very serious vein, there is a long list of \namendments and there is talk about Senators wanting to go home on \nFriday. That may or may not be possible, depending upon what the status \nof this bill is. But in the light of these assertions, I yield to my \ndistinguished colleague from Iowa to concur.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would like to ask my good friend, the chairman of the \ncommittee, does he know from the leadership on his side whether we will \nbe having votes tomorrow? If we are, that is fine. We will get some \nvotes packed in tomorrow, on some amendments tomorrow. I don't know. No \none has advised me.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We cannot have votes tomorrow unless we have amendments. \nI think that is definitive. So the alternative to that is go to third \nreading and then we do have a vote.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand there are some amendments coming down this \nafternoon. There are some amendments pending right now.\n  Mr. SPECTER. There is no amendment being offered on the floor. There \nis no amendment we can put our hands around. The only thing we could \nput our hands around would be third reading. We could do that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We have a vote at 5 o'clock, I understand. Was that \nalready ordered? Oh, not yet.\n  There is the rural education amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We have that, that we can vote on, and we can vote on \nthe Dodd amendment? We can't vote on the Dodd amendment either? We \ncan't vote on the Dodd amendment until the Senate is in session, and \nthe Senate is not in session until the Democratic Presidents come back.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand we can have votes tomorrow on certain \namendments. The Senator has an amendment which I am supporting on NIH. \nIs that going to be offered here this afternoon? We could vote on that. \nWe have amendments on both sides. I am supporting that amendment, as my \nfriend knows. Why can't we vote on that?\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, again, let me make a plea to our \ncolleagues to come to the floor and offer the amendments. There are \nquite a few on the Republican side who have listed amendments, as well \nas Democrats.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand we want some people back for that, too, on \nNIH.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this has been cleared on both sides. In \nthe presence of the ranking member of the subcommittee and the \nassistant Democratic leader, I ask unanimous consent that the vote in \nrelation to the Daschle amendment No. 1568 occur at 5:10 today; \nfurther, that no amendments be in order to the amendment prior to the \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Is there a quorum call in effect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would ask the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania--and this is certainly not his fault--but we received a \ncall. We need to change the time of the vote to 5:40, and with 10 \nminutes of debate prior to a 5:40 vote; 5 minutes for Senator Daschle \nand 5 minutes for those opposing the rural education amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, if that is the best we can do, so stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest, as modified?\n  Hearing none, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have been asked, on behalf of the \nleader, to have that vote followed by a judge vote. So as in executive \nsession, I ask unanimous consent that following the scheduled vote at \n5:40 under the previous unanimous consent agreement, the Senate proceed \nto executive session to the consideration of calendar No. 349; further, \nthat there be 2 minutes equally divided in the usual form for debate, \nand that the Senate then vote on the confirmation of the nomination, \nwith no intervening action or debate. Finally, I ask consent that \nfollowing the vote the President be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am wondering if the Senator will withhold. \nWe may be able to have the judge's vote\n\n[[Page S11088]]\n\nfirst and then go to the Daschle amendment at 5:30. If the Senator \nwould withhold just for a minute, we could check that out. It might be \nmore convenient for everybody to have the vote earlier rather than \nlater.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, that would be agreeable.\n  Mr. REID. If we could, then, Mr. President, I ask the distinguished \nSenator from Pennsylvania--and I do again apologize to him, but I think \nit would be better for everyone involved if we had the vote on the \njudge at 5 o'clock, followed by a vote on the Daschle amendment at \n5:40, and prior to the 5:40 vote there be 10 minutes of debate equally \ndivided in the usual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is kind of like the kangaroo cops on my \nside. We can't have the vote before 5:30--I apologize--the first vote. \nI apologize. The unanimous consent request offered by the Senator from \nPennsylvania, as unmodified, we accept. We would have the first vote at \n5:40, followed by a vote on the judge.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1575 to Amendment No. 1542\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, shortly, I am going to offer another \namendment dealing with school renovation and construction on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Clinton from New York. This is an issue I have been \ninvolved with for over almost 12 years now. I first started talking \nabout the need for the Federal Government to be involved in school \nconstruction and renovation back in 1991. At that time, when I was \nseeking my party's nomination to be the candidate for President, I had \ncome up with sort of a blueprint for America. But one of the \ncornerstones was the need to invest in the infrastructure of our \ncountry. In that infrastructure, aside from water and power generation \nand transportation, communications, one of the elements of the proposal \nwas for the Federal Government to provide for meaningful funds for the \nrenovation and reconstruction of schools throughout the country. I had \npicked up on this after reading ``Savage Inequalities'' by Jonathan \nKozol from which it became clear to me that Mr. Kozol had provided a \ngreat service to our country by pointing out that all over America, the \npoorest schools--the worst schools, I should say--the schools that are \nthe most rundown and in the most need of repair were those located in \nvery low-income areas.\n  It became obvious the reason they did is because they were in low-\nincome areas where they had low property tax values, and they simply \ndidn't have the wherewithal to fix up the schools. However, the schools \nthat were in high-income areas basically were in pretty good shape. \nThus he termed it ``Savage Inequalities.''\n  Based upon that, I said: We ought to embark upon an effort to get the \nFederal Government involved in reconstructing schools. One of the \nreasons I proposed that and have been proposing it for the last 12 \nyears is that I do firmly believe in local control of schools, local \ncontrol in terms of curriculum, teachers, hiring, the general sort of \nthrust of the schools, how they are operated. That has been one of the \ngeniuses of the American educational system. We have had this diverse \napproach to education in our country.\n  The fact is, giving construction money to the schools in no way takes \naway from local control. It just provides the funds they need. I also \nthought at the time that we would have a matching. We would have the \nStates then come up with funds. For example, a low-income area that has \nlow property tax values could take, let's say, a grant, a Federal grant \nof money that would lower the total cost of the bond or whatever is \nneeded to be passed to provide for new construction; thus they might \nnot only be more willing but at least able to build new schools or to \nreconstruct and renovate old schools.\n  Nothing happened on that in the early 1990s. Obviously, I did not get \nmy party's nomination. I tried to get the Clinton administration to \nprovide some of this. In fact, in 1994, we did get money for school \nrenovation and reconstruction. It was rescinded the next year. I then \nembarked upon an effort to test my theories in the State of Iowa.\n  So beginning about 1997-1998, I got some money to go to the State of \nIowa for school construction and renovation. And the State department \nof education handled that money and put out a requirement that there \nhad to be certain local matches to get this grant money.\n  Local communities, at least in my State, could match that money one \nof three ways: They could either pass a bond, raise money through \nfurther bonding, they could have a local option sales tax, which we \nhave in Iowa, or they could do it with what we call a plant and \nequipment levy. In the State of Iowa local jurisdictions are allowed to \ndo that.\n  When we first put out several millions of dollars for this to test \nthis theory, it turned out that the leveraging was incredible. The \nleveraging was over almost 20 times. In other words, for every Federal \ndollar we put out, we got about 20 times that in local moneys coming in \nto help. That is because they got the grant money, and they could see \nthey could get maybe $100,000 or $200,000. And if they matched that \nwith a local option sales tax or something or a bonding, then they get \nit. Many of these jurisdictions that had trouble passing bonds in the \npast found that with this carrot approach they were able to get the \nbond passed because obviously they didn't have to pass as big a bond as \nwhat they had in the past. Therefore, their local property tax levees \nwould not be that great.\n  So it worked very well. In fact, there are schools all over the State \nof Iowa that have gotten these Federal grants now going back almost 5, \n6 years. There are new classrooms; there are new schools; there are \nrenovated buildings all over the State of Iowa that are testament to \nthe fact that the theory I had actually does work.\n  So in 1991, we had $1 billion we had put into this program \nnationwide. That $1 billion was cut down to about $800 million in \nconference, but we got about $800 million out for school construction \nand renovation all over the United States. Every State has participated \nin this. Again, not all that money has been spent because it took some \ntime to get the money out. People had to make contracts for \nconstruction, things such as that. But the reports we are getting back \nare that this has been something the States have found they can use \nand, as I said, multiply the amount of money. There is a multiplier \neffect to every Federal dollar that goes out.\n\n  It is estimated 14 million children in this country attend schools \nthat are deteriorated. Just this morning, the American Society of Civil \nEngineers, a decidedly nonpartisan group, issued one of its periodic \nreport cards which assess the condition of the Nation's physical \ninfrastructure. In 2001, the ASCE awarded the Nation's schools a grade \nof D minus, the lowest grade for any individual category. That is \nbridges, water systems, sewage disposal systems, of all the \ninfrastructure of America, schools got D minus, the lowest grade.\n  This morning, the American Society of Civil Engineers concluded there \nhad been no progress in the condition of our schools. The report \nstates: Due to aging, outdated facilities, severe overcrowding, or new \nclass sizes, 75 percent of our Nation's school buildings remain \ninadequate to meet the needs of schoolchildren.\n  The ASCE also found that the average cost of capital investments \nneeded to upgrade and replace our schools is $3,800 per student. That \nis more than half the average cost to educate that student for 1 year. \nThey estimate the total cost to fix our schools at more than $127 \nbillion nationwide.\n  I have said many times, it is a national disgrace that the nicest \nplaces that our children see are shopping malls, sports arenas, and \nmovie theaters. The most rundown place they see is their public school. \nWhat kind of signal, what kind of message are we sending to our kids \nwhen the nicest things they see are shopping malls and movie theaters \nand sports arenas, and one of the most rundown places is the public \nschool they attend every day?\n  What message does that say about the value we place on their \neducation and their future? It is not just a matter of appearances. \nNumerous studies demonstrate the link between safe and healthy school \nbuildings and student performance. That is basic common\n\n[[Page S11089]]\n\nsense. If buildings are making teachers and students sick, obviously, \nthey will not learn as well.\n  The Healthy Schools Network has reported many such problems around \nthe Nation. For example, several parents have complained that their \nchildren were getting sick at a large city school near Albany, NY. The \ncounty inspected the school and found unsafe levels of lead and mold. \nThe school has not been able to correct the problem, citing a lack of \nfunding for repairs, but children are still attending the school.\n  A child in North Carolina missed several days of school suffering \nfrom headaches and stomachaches. During the summer break, the child's \nillnesses abate but come back when school resumes in the fall. The \nchild attends class in an old trailer that has a musty odor and poor \nventilation and mold.\n  A Virginia parent said her son felt sick at school and was doing poor \nin social studies. An inspector found nonfunctioning ventilators and \nseveral water-stained ceiling tiles.\n  We talk a lot about leaving no child behind but children such as \nthese are being left behind all over the country today in bad school \nbuildings. It doesn't have to be this way.\n  Last year I visited Longfellow Elementary School in Council Bluffs, \nIA. Longfellow school was built in 1939, the year I was born. Now you \nknow how old I am. That was the year the school was built.\n  Basically, in the 2001-2002 school year, Longfellow recorded 4,893 \nstudent absences. The next year, after all the modifications and \nchanges and everything, absences dropped by more than a half, to \n2,357--cut in half in 1 year. Why? Well, that school received this \nFederal grant to make improvements to the school. Before this, they had \nan old boiler in the basement, an old water heating system. It was \nalways leaking and it was many years old. There was mold all over the \nbasement and mold on the ceilings. Kids were getting sick, plus there \nwas poor ventilation. When you have these hot radiators in the middle \nof the winter, if you have a mild day, they are still hot. They just \nhad all these problems, so they put in a new geothermal heating and \ncooling system. They put in better plumbing. They put in new window \nglazing with double-paned windows. They cleaned up everything. The mold \nand mildew has disappeared. The indoor air quality has risen \ndramatically. The building is not just a nicer place; it is a healthier \nplace. In 1 year, they cut absences in half just by putting in this new \nsystem.\n  Another bonus came with the school's utility bill. As I said, they \nput in a new geothermal system. I looked at all the wells they drilled \nfor this new system. Last winter the custodian at the school told me \nthat when they first fired up this system on one of the coldest days of \nthe year, the gas company called him to report what they thought was a \nbroken meter in their school because they weren't using very much gas. \nThe meter wasn't broken; it was just that the new system was so \nefficient. So this school district is now going to save money every \nsingle year because it won't be paying the high utility bills.\n  Here is a story of another school from a recent report by the Rural \nSchool and Community Trust, titled ``Save a Penny, Lose a School: The \nReal Cost of Deferred Maintenance.''\n  This report cited a 1998 incident in which the failure of a $12 \ngasket caused the flooding of a 6-year-old gymnasium, as well as the \nmain building of the school. The problem might have been prevented by \nsome routine maintenance. Instead, classes were canceled for 2 days and \nthe gymnasium closed for 5 weeks. The total bill was nearly $200,000--\n$26,000 for emergency response and $160,000 for repairs.\n  Now, compare that with what happened in Waterloo, IA, where the \nschool district in 1999 received another one of these Federal grants to \nupgrade their fire alarm system at West High School. A few months after \nthey had put this new system in, an incident at the school one evening \ncaused the water pipes to burst. But the upgraded alarm alerted \nauthorities of the problem and an immediate response was taken to \ncontain the damage. Without this early warning, the problem would not \nhave been discovered until the next morning. Not a single day of \ninstruction was lost. In addition, the new alarm saved the district \nmoney. The district officials estimated if the water had not been \ncontained immediately, large areas of the school would have been \nflooded and over $400,000 in damages sustained.\n  I wish more schools could see results such as these. Unfortunately, \nthe Federal Government is doing virtually nothing to help school \ndistricts address this critical problem.\n  As I said, in fiscal 2001, we provided $800 million for school \nrepair. This program was extremely well received all over the country.\n  Unfortunately, President Bush zeroed out the program in his fiscal \nyear 2002 budget, and we never have been able to restore it. That is \nwhy Senator Clinton and I are introducing an amendment today to provide \n$1 billion, as we did in 2001, for a national school repair program. \nGrants would be made to school districts to make urgent repairs to fix \na leaky roof, replace faulty wiring, or make repairs to bring schools \nup to local safety and fire codes. Funds could also be used to expand \nexisting structures to alleviate overcrowding or make the school more \naccessible to students with disabilities.\n  Under this program, my own State would receive about $5.2 million, \nenough to create 125 jobs. Now, the amendment was fully offset and \nachieves this by rescinding the fiscal year 2004 advance appropriations \nand reappropriating those moneys in 2003. This is the exact same \nmechanism that the committee used in adding $2.2 billion to the base \nbill. The Harkin-Clinton amendment builds upon this and adds a billion \ndollars more for school renovation.\n  Let me also add a couple of other items I wanted to mention. I \nmentioned Longfellow school that was built in 1939 and the problems the \nkids were having and how sick they were getting with the mold and \nmildew and old heating system, and how absences were cut in half after \nthey got the new system in and how the utility bills are lower. There \nis one other thing about that school I found. When I went into the \nschool, I noted that it had been built in 1939 because it says so on \nthe cornerstone. The principal of the school showed me the actual bill \nfor the new school--how much it cost and everything.\n  The interesting thing was, guess who built the school. It was called \nthe WPA, the Work Project Administration, instituted under President \nFranklin Roosevelt, supported by Congress. So it was a Federal \nGovernment project. They built that school in 1939.\n  Imagine that. It is still being operated today, with these \nmodifications made with the new Federal grant. So this idea that \nsomehow it is unheard of for the Federal Government to provide \nconstruction money or renovation money to local public schools is not \nso. It may have been unheard of in the recent past, in the last few \nyears; but back in the 1930s and 1940s, we put a lot of Federal dollars \ninto building new schools around the United States. So we have \nprecedents for this. Many of the schools that are still being operated \ntoday were built by the WPA in the 1930s and early 1940s.\n  Secondly, this grant money that goes out to the schools, as I said, \nis money that would be used to reconstruct, renovate, make sure it is \nhealthier and safer, and the results we have had back not only from \nIowa but from around the country that this is not only needed but the \namount of multiplier effect we get from this is much more than 10 to 1 \nnationally. In fact, it is approaching, if I am not mistaken, probably \ncloser to 15 to 1 nationally for every dollar we put out.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to support this amendment with my colleague \nfrom New York. I will refrain from offering it until the Senator can be \non the floor. I know Senator Clinton is tied up, and I know she wants \nto speak on this amendment.\n  I will go ahead and send the amendment to the desk on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Clinton, Senator Corzine, Senator Kerry, Senator \nBingaman, and Senator Murray.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to laying aside the pending \namendments? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself, Mrs. \n     Clinton, Mr. Corzine, Mr.\n\n[[Page S11090]]\n\n     Kerry, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Murray, and Ms. Stabenow, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 1575 to amendment No. 1542.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To provide additional funding for the Fund for the \n                       Improvement of Education)\n\n       On page 76, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n       Sec.__. (a) Additional Funds.--\n       (1) In general.--In addition to any amounts otherwise \n     appropriated under this Act for the Fund for the Improvement \n     of Education under part D of title V of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7241 et seq.), \n     there are appropriated an additional $1,000,000,000 for such \n     fund that shall be used by the Secretary of Education to \n     award formula grants to State educational agencies to enable \n     such State educational agencies--\n       (A) to expand existing structures to alleviate overcrowding \n     in public schools;\n       (B) to make renovations or modifications to existing \n     structures necessary to support alignment of curriculum with \n     State standards in mathematics, reading or language arts, or \n     science in public schools served by such agencies;\n       (C) to make emergency repairs or renovations necessary to \n     ensure the safety of students and staff and to bring public \n     schools into compliance with fire and safety codes;\n       (D) to make modifications necessary to render public \n     schools in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities \n     Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) and section 504 of the \n     Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794);\n       (E) to abate or remove asbestos, lead, mold, and other \n     environmental factors in public schools that are associated \n     with poor cognitive outcomes in children; and\n       (F) to renovate, repair, and acquire needs related to \n     infrastructure of charter schools.\n       (2) Amount of grants.--The Secretary shall allocate amounts \n     available for grants under this subsection to States in \n     proportion to the funds received by the States, respectively, \n     for the previous fiscal year under part A of title I of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     6311 et seq).\n       (b) Offset.--Of the funds appropriated in this Act for the \n     National Institutes of Health, $352,000,000 shall not be \n     available for obligation until September 30, 2004: Provided, \n     That the amount $6,895,199,000 in section 305(a)(1) of this \n     Act shall be deemed to be $7,895,199,000, and the amount \n     $6,783,301,000 in section 305(a)(2) of this Act shall be \n     deemed to be $5,783,301,000.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I see my colleague from Michigan on the \nfloor. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add my name \nas a cosponsor to the Harkin-Clinton amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Iowa for his \nstalwart commitment year after year and month after month as it relates \nto education. I thank Senator Harkin for his leadership particularly on \nthis issue, as well as special education, as well as other critical \nneeds for our children and our communities.\n  I rise today to lend my support--and it is a pleasure being a \ncosponsor--to the Harkin-Clinton amendment and to indicate my support \nfor and cosponsorship of the Dodd-Jeffords amendment supporting special \neducation which is long overdue. If we can do one thing to help our \nschools increase operating dollars, it would be to keep a commitment \nthat was made over 25 years ago for 40 percent of the cost of special \neducation to be borne by the Federal Government. That has never \nactually happened. If we were to do that, in 1 year alone, it would be \nclose to $500 million additional resources coming in for Michigan \nchildren, not only to help special education but to help general \neducation students as well. This is critical, as is the Harkin \namendment.\n  I also wish to speak as a cosponsor to an additional amendment, the \nKennedy-Collins amendment, to increase Pell grants.\n  First, as in anything else we do in this Senate or in the Congress, \nthis is an issue of priorities. It is an issue always of values. I am a \nmember of the Budget Committee, and this week we heard a midterm review \nof where we are in terms of the budget, with huge looming budget \ndeficits. In fact, we are paying this year $322 billion in interest. \nThat does not fix one school. It does not send one more young person to \ncollege. It does not fix a road. It does not help pay for Medicare \nprescription drugs. It is $322 billion in interest which, by the way, \nis almost as much as the entire--if you take away defense--nondefense \ndiscretionary budget of our country. It is amazing, astounding, that \nthe interest on the publicly held debt now almost equals the entire \nspending on health, education, the environment, law enforcement, and \nmost of the homeland security efforts.\n\n  Why do I mention that in the context of these amendments? Because it \nis an issue of values and priorities, and in the Budget Committee--and \nwe hear over and over from esteemed witnesses, from the Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve to the head of the CBO, from whom we heard this week--\nwe hear over and over talk about what drives the economy. It is \nincreased productivity, which is education and innovation. It is being \nable to have more technology, more people who have the skills, the \nbrain power, and the training to create that innovation in technology. \nIt means more opportunity for children to receive a quality education \nand for people to be able to afford higher education. That is how we \nget to increased productivity which drives the economy.\n  Instead of the policies that have been used in this administration of \nfocusing on supply-side economics--in other words, you give to a few at \nthe top; you give tax breaks to a few at the top; you focus only on the \nneeds of a few at the top of our income levels in our country, which, \nby the way, is a policy that has now created the largest single-year \ndeficit in the history of the country and an interest payment of $322 \nbillion this year. Instead of that, if we were to focus and invest very \nsmall amounts of money, relatively speaking, in educating our children \nin safe, quality schools where they do not have buckets in the corner \nto catch the water, that have the latest technology at each and every \ndesk, if we make sure the funds that have been committed through \nspecial education, through Leave No Child Behind, through the \ncommitments of the Government that are actually kept, small amounts of \nmoney, comparatively speaking, with huge results in increasing \nopportunities for everyone, increasing productivity, increasing jobs, \nlowering the Federal deficit--all of these things happen by focusing on \nopportunity and education and innovation, and that is what these \nimportant amendments do.\n  Think of the comparison now: $322 billion paid in interest on the \ndebt this year versus $1 billion for more school construction so that \nchildren not only hear us say education is important, but they see it \nwhen they walk into a quality school building with technology, with the \ninfrastructure they need, or special education.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the amendment Senators Kennedy and \nCollins offered, to give more opportunities for young people to go to \ncollege and to receive something called a Pell grant. Right now there \nare 145,151 students in Michigan who have the opportunity to receive \nsome assistance to get a higher education, to go to college. It is an \ninvestment not only in the students but it is an investment in us, in \nour country, in our future.\n  Under the amendment proposed by Senator Kennedy and Senator Collins, \nin Michigan another 5,371 students would be able to afford to go to \ncollege--5,371 new opportunities for people to receive Pell grant \nassistance, and we would increase the average amount from $4,050 to \n$4,500 just to keep pace with the rising cost of higher education. We \nraise the amount a little less than $500 per grant per student, and we \ngive more people an opportunity to go to college.\n  What would that do and what would that cost? That would cost $2.2 \nbillion. I would say that is a very small investment for a very huge \nimpact in terms of opportunity, growth, and productivity in the economy \nand strengthening our country.\n  Let me make one other comparison because right now, again, focusing \non values and priorities, as we look at putting together this budget, \nwe know that, in fact, $1 billion a week is being spent in Iraq to \nrebuild their infrastructure, to help them have health care, to help \nrebuild their schools.\n  While I certainly hope and pray that we will be successful in helping \nto rebuild Iraq and creating the climate for a Democratic process and \nan economy that can work in Iraq, should we do less at home? If we can \nspend a billion\n\n[[Page S11091]]\n\ndollars a week in Iraq, and we are asking for a little over $2 billion \nfor a year to increase the opportunity for Americans to be able to get \nhigher skills, to get higher paid jobs, to increase that productivity \nwe are hearing about from the experts that drives the economy and \nhopefully helps to lower this debt, is that not a small investment to \nmake?\n  Two weeks in Iraq would address the funding needs in this amendment \nfor students to be able to have Pell grant opportunities to be able to \ngo to college.\n  One week in Iraq would fund the Harkin-Clinton amendment on school \nconstruction that is so critical. We can go right on down the line. We \nare talking about small investments, relatively speaking, for major \nimpacts on real people. In the end it is, in fact, education and \ninnovation that increases productivity and drives this economy and \ncreates jobs that all of us want to make sure are there for ourselves \nand our families.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support these amendments, to advocate with \nus for a set of priorities to say to the American people we want to put \nopportunities for you and your children first; that we understand that \ncreating opportunities for everyone to be successful through \nopportunities to go to college, through quality schools, through full \nfunding of special education that guarantees the full range of \nopportunities to every child in our school, those things are an \nimportant part of making sure that everybody has a chance for the \nAmerican dream.\n  We fight for that abroad. We need to make sure it is available at \nhome, for every single young person who works hard, goes to school, \nplays by the rules, and wants to make it. They deserve a chance. We \nneed them to succeed in order to be successful as a country.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at these amendments as important \ninvestments in the future for all of us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I want to echo and support the eloquent \ncomments of my colleague from Michigan about the values and priorities \nof our Nation at this point in our history. I particularly wish to \nreinforce her strong statement of support for the Kennedy-Collins \namendment concerning higher education and its affordability. This \namendment that will increase access to higher education would invest \n$2.2 billion in Pell grants and other critical programs.\n  I think all of us know that investing in higher education pays off, \nbut we also know we have put our students into a difficult dilemma. \nThey understand the importance of going to college. That is why in the \nlast week they have packed up; they have moved to campuses; they have \nenrolled in courses; they are prepared to do their part to acquire the \nskills and credentials they need to make a contribution to our country. \nYet at the very time they are doing their part, accepting their \nresponsibility, the costs of higher education are dramatically \nincreasing.\n  States are reducing their support, increasing tuition, and other \nrelated costs. As a result, many qualified students from middle-income \nand low-income families, sometimes the first in their families to even \ndream of going to college, the first to apply, the first to believe \nthey could put together the financial resources to attend and graduate \nfrom college, are coming up against the reality of not being able to \nfund their education. We know that on average each year a postsecondary \neducation increases earnings by 6 to 12 percent.\n  Research also points out what many of us know from personal \nexperience; that postsecondary education leads low-income citizens to \nbecome more self-sufficient, to lead productive lives. Clearly, this is \na time when we cannot ignore the importance of preparing our workforce, \nmaking it as productive as possible, and providing programs such as \nGEAR UP and TRIO which have helped change the expectations and raise \nthe vision of many children from families for whom college was not a \nreality.\n  I recently heard from Melissa Santos, a tenth grade GEAR UP student \nat Hempstead High School in my State of New York. She wrote to tell me \nsomething that sometimes young people do not realize until it is too \nlate.\n  She writes: Life can take you many places. It all depends on the \nchoices you make. I feel that life could be good, but it all depends on \nhow you live it. For instance, if you decide to go to college and get \nyour education, you will most likely live a good life. GEAR UP has a \nlot of benefits like helping students get into college, which is \nessential to making it in today's world. My philosophy is that \neducation can break many boundaries.\n  Well, Melissa Santos is a young woman who is wise beyond her years, \nbut she is taking advantage of a program that is giving her the \nstructure, the incentive, and the motivation to dream about going to \ncollege. She is preparing herself to take advantage of that.\n  The Kennedy-Collins amendment will increase access to college for \neligible students in all States, and it will be particularly important \nto students in New York where tuition at the State University of New \nYork at our various campuses jumped by 28 percent. Students attending \nthe city University of New York are now faced with a 25-percent tuition \nincrease. Last year, 404,181 students received Pell grants in New York. \nThis amendment will expand grant aid to additional students, but it \nwill also make sure the grant amount is sufficient to keep students in \nschool.\n\n  So I am hopeful, along with my friend and colleague from Michigan, \nthat we will do something to invest in our own students, make it \npossible for these bright young men and women from all corners of our \ncountry to have an educational opportunity, not feel that they have to \npostpone it or drop out because of financial pressures.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1575\n\n  Similarly, I join with my colleague, Senator Harkin from Iowa, in \nworking to amend the appropriations to provide critical relief to \nschools that are overcrowded and worn down and, as a side benefit, \ncreate much needed jobs in the economy. The Harkin-Clinton amendment \nwould provide $1 billion to help needy schools make those critical \nrepairs and renovations and relieve overcrowding.\n  For New York alone, this amendment would mean more than $100 million \nwhich, believe me, is money that is sorely needed. It is particularly \nneeded because of the requirements of No Child Left Behind.\n  We promised that we would put a qualified teacher in every classroom. \nWe led teachers, parents, and students to believe that a qualified \nteacher would be able to teach because the number of students sitting \nbefore him or her would be low enough that you could actually do the \nhard work of helping these students meet the new accountability \nstandards.\n  Unfortunately, because of the deterioration in our public school \nstock, because at least one-third of our schools need extensive repair, \nwe know that we have all kinds of learning and educational problems \nthat we could help alleviate.\n  It is impossible for most of our communities to even think about \nraising property taxes to fix these schools.\n  On the other hand, because of the State, county, city, and school \ndistrict budget crunches, we have schools that were contracted for and \nbuilt a few years ago and we cannot even fill the classrooms with \nteachers because they do not have the money. We are creating a recipe \nfor failure.\n  For many who voted for No Child Left Behind, we did so with the \nunderstanding there would be the resources, that the Government would \ndo its part so our students, teachers, and parents would do their part. \nThe net result would be better outcomes on learning measurements for \nour kids.\n  This amendment, the Harkin-Clinton amendment, is sponsored by a \nnumber of our colleagues. Senator Bob Graham asked to be added as a \ncosponsor. I appreciate the support it has received. Clearly, we have \nto do more than just introduce amendments and talk about them. We need \naction.\n  We estimate 14 million American children are attending these \ndeteriorating schools. Think if it were your child, your grandchild, \nyour niece, or your nephew. Think what that would mean to you and what \nkind of confidence you would be able to instill in the future of that \nyoung boy or girl.\n  According to the General Accounting Office, one-fifth of all children \nattend\n\n[[Page S11092]]\n\nschools with unhealthy air quality. I know a little bit about this now \nbecause of our work in lower Manhattan after 9/11. It is absolutely \nclear that air quality is associated with absenteeism. In fact, \nAmerican children miss 10 million schooldays a year because of asthma \nexacerbated by indoor air quality. Poor indoor air quality has a \ndisproportionate impact on racial minorities and students from low-\nincome families. Black and Hispanic students have a much higher \nlikelihood of living in neighborhoods with toxic waste facilities. \nEighty percent of Hispanic children live in neighborhoods where quality \ndoes not meet EPA standards. According to the GAO, schools with at \nleast 40 percent of students eligible to receive free or reduced-price \nlunch are more likely to have unsatisfactory air quality.\n  We are putting our children who need help and encouragement the most \ninto the environments that are least likely to produce the kind of \npositive results we all hoped for from the unprecedented Federal \nmandate under No Child Left Behind.\n  These Federal requirements which we have imposed on our school \ndistricts are really a two-edged sword. On the one hand, we hope these \nrequirements will inspire school districts to do things that maybe they \nshould have done on their own but have not in the past; on the other \nhand, they may set up impossible barriers to any school district being \nable to achieve what is expected because we have not funded the \nresources that were called for in the authorization of No Child Left \nBehind.\n  I know many of my colleagues argue there is no Federal role for \nbuilding and repairing schools. The reality is that we made an explicit \nFederal priority to close the achievement gap, to say my daughter and \nthe sons and daughters and grandchildren of my colleagues would not \nhave an unfair advantage by dint of birth and genetics and environment; \nthey would be given all the opportunities we could give as their \nparents and grandparents, but we would do more to help those children \nwho, through no fault of their own, might not have been provided all of \nthe benefits we take for granted.\n  When we think about how we are going to achieve the standards put \nforth in No Child Left Behind and what our dearest hopes and dreams are \nfor all children, I don't think we can ignore the compelling body of \nevidence that unhealthy school buildings are a detriment to \nperformance.\n\n  If our goal is to leave no child behind, we must first start by \nleaving no school behind. The Harkin-Clinton amendment would help \nStates and schools comply with the requirements of No Child Left \nBehind. I hope we will look seriously at this amendment that gives us \nthe opportunity to put our money where our mouths have been about \nhigher education standards.\n  We were ahead of the curve in New York. The New York regents already \nestablished standards for science, but many of our districts did not \nhave the financial wherewithal to make sure their facilities were \nadequate. New York City lacks science labs in its junior high schools \nand has insufficient funds to construct then. We are still recovering \nfrom 9/11. We still have higher than 8 percent unemployment. Is it fair \nto say to the million children in the New York school district: You are \nnot meeting the standards because we have not given you the basic \nequipment to be able to do that? I don't think so.\n  The city also lacks the funding to build or modernize science labs \nand high schools. Chancellor Joel Klein wrote in a letter to me in \nsupport of this amendment:\n\n       [W]ithout the necessary resources to meet our acute needs \n     in this area, our students are in danger of falling short of \n     meeting these requirements.\n\n  The Harkin-Clinton amendment will also help alleviate overcrowding. \nToday, school enrollments are at their highest level in history, even \nmore than the baby boomers. We filled up the classrooms, but the \nchildren of the baby boomers are even in greater numbers. A record 47.7 \nmillion children are enrolled in elementary and secondary schools \ntoday. The number will climb to 53.7 million by 2008. Between 1990 and \n2000, school enrollments increased by 14 percent.\n  Anyone who has driven by a school recently often sees trailers parked \non the grounds because that is the only way the children can be \naccommodated. The temporary facilities sometimes last years because \nthere are not sufficient resources to do what needs to be done in terms \nof facilities.\n  We have a very big overcrowding problem in New York City. We have \n30,000 more children than we have seats. We know we have to figure out \nwhat to do for those children, especially with the new standards and \nthe testing requirements. But it is very hard to figure out how we are \ngoing to build the classrooms we need to seat those 30,000 children \nwithout some help.\n  Where does the help, such as it is, come from? We know it comes from \nlocal tax bases, local taxpayers, and we know that in the last several \nyears, according to a survey conducted by the National League of \nCities, virtually every State that provides aid to local communities is \ncutting back on that aid because of the current fiscal problems. Local \ntaxpayers cannot be expected to bear the brunt of every education cut \noccurring at the local level. There is no way it can be done.\n  What administrators do is postpone costs, postpone repairs, postpone \nrenovations, and even routine maintenance. Deferring the costs does not \nmake them go away. Oftentimes it just leads to increased costs because \nsomething fails and then there is a bigger problem that is more \nexpensive. There were $12 gaskets that failed at a school in New York \ncosting $186,000 and forcing a gym to be closed for 5 weeks. Those are \nthe things that happen as a matter of course through the country.\n  There are many educationally compelling reasons to vote for this \nHarkin-Clinton amendment. There are many benefits that would flow to \nour children, our teachers, to the enterprise we have committed \nourselves to as a nation to improve educational outcomes among all \nchildren, leaving no child behind.\n  But there is another benefit, an ancillary benefit, and that is this \nwould create jobs. We are in the worst, heightening slump since the \nGreat Depression. More than 3.2 million private sector jobs have been \nlost since February of 2001; 1.4 million people have fallen back into \npoverty in the last 2 years. We have an unemployment problem. It is not \ngoing away. Some people say the economy is recovering, but even the \nmost optimistic call it a jobless recovery. We know many people have \neven given up looking for work.\n  This is a way to stimulate the economy. I don't think it is the \nprimary reason. The primary reasons are the reasons to which I have \nalluded. It would not hurt to put some people to work. Spending $1 \nbillion on school construction would generate 23,765 jobs. In New York \nalone, it is estimated it would put 2,434 people back to work.\n  So this commonsense amendment, the Harkin-Clinton amendment, is \nreally central to our achieving the purposes we claim to be supporting. \nI hope my colleagues will recognize the merit in this amendment and \nsupport it because I believe it has a tremendous amount of positive \nimpact across the board. I further believe it would be affordable and, \nin comparison to the other challenges we are facing in Iraq and \nelsewhere, it would be a demonstration of real commitment to our goals.\n  I hope on the Kennedy-Collins amendment concerning Pell grants and \nother related support for higher education, and on the Harkin-Clinton \namendment with respect to school construction, modernization, repair, \nand renovation, that this body will cast a vote that really puts our \nchildren first--not just in rhetoric but in resources.\n  Mr. DODD. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Certainly.\n  Mr. DODD. I wish to ask the distinguished Senator from New York; she \nhas raised a tremendously important amendment here. I don't recall the \nnumbers exactly. Maybe my colleague from New York does. What I have \nbeen told over the years is, back towards the turn of the 20th century, \nwe were in this country building a new high school every week in order \nto provide for the challenges of the 20th century. We understood that \ncreating places that were conducive to learning was critically \nimportant to take advantage of the technologies that were emerging at\n\n[[Page S11093]]\n\nthat time. Obviously, we are now in a new century, but the technologies \nand ability to provide students with access to education are \nunprecedented historically.\n  I wonder, from a historical standpoint, if the Senator might share \nher own thoughts on what has been the history of our Nation regarding \nthe commitment to education, going back to the Northwest Ordinance, the \nGI bill even before the end of World War II. At times of great national \ncrises, Congress and Presidents always found time, in the midst of \nother issues, to commit themselves to education. I wonder if she might \nshare some comments and thoughts on that point.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. The Senator is absolutely correct. If one looks \nthroughout our history, one sees the commitment to education is a \nconstant. In the midst of the Civil War--hardly a moment one would \nthink where any attention would be focused on any matter other than \nwinning the war--President Lincoln forged ahead on land grant colleges \nbecause he understood that the war itself was not the only goal he had \nto keep in mind. He had to be constantly focused on what kind of \ncountry he was trying to save, what sort of union we would have. He \nunderstood that a citizenry committed to education, just as Thomas \nJefferson understood and his successors after President Lincoln \nunderstood, was the kind of country he wanted to help create and make \nsure continued.\n  If we go into the 20th century, at the turn of the 19th to the 20th \ncentury when we had so many immigrants coming to our shores, looking \nfor hope and work and opportunity, we invested in schools. In fact, New \nYork State still has some of those schools. I have been in schools \nbuilt in 1894 and 1910. I have been to schools that are so old, they \ncan't figure out how to get through that thick brick exterior to wire \nthe schools.\n  But all the way through the period, whether it was the Progressive \nperiod under President Roosevelt, the World War I era under President \nWilson, and on to President Roosevelt and others, going forward, \ninvesting in schools was always key.\n  I would make identity with my good friend from Connecticut that \ncertainly, given our, sort of, age at this time in our lives, we know \nthe generation of our parents invested in education. The veterans who \nwent off and saved freedom in World War II came home and made it clear \nthey wanted to build schools for the children they wanted to see grow \nup in peace. I know the father of the Senator from Connecticut was a \ngreat champion of that.\n\n  I find it hard to understand how, here we are, a generation later, \nturning our back on the kind of facilities that are needed to \ndemonstrate the public commitment we should be making to our children.\n  I thank the Senator from Connecticut for a very timely and \nhistorically important inquiry.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank our colleague for her observations. \nShe is absolutely correct about Senator Morrill from Vermont, for whom \nit was named. The University of Connecticut is a land grant college \nestablished as a result of those efforts. Our colleague from New York \nis absolutely correct in pointing out, even prior--she mentioned during \nthe Civil War--our predecessor body, in the midst of that conflict, \nfound the resources to commit ourselves to higher education.\n  At the end of World War II, in the earliest days of 1945, the GI bill \nwas adopted. There were a few weeks to go, months to go, but \nnonetheless that act was debated and discussed. It was debated because \nit was a lot of money in its day, to say to GIs coming back, we want to \nprovide you with an educational opportunity.\n  You hear it over and over and over again, Mr. President, when you \nhear from our veterans, those who never, ever could have dreamed of \ngetting a higher education but for the GI bill. Yet in the midst of the \ngreatest conflict of the 20th century, the Congress of the United \nStates and an American President said: We are going to be prepared for \nthe tremendous opportunities that will come after this conflict. We \nhave benefited a thousandfold, a millionfold for every dollar we spent, \nI believe. I think my colleagues would admit that for every dollar we \nspent, in 1945, investing, in the GI bill, the returns to this country \nand the world have been phenomenal.\n  So I am deeply grateful to my colleague from New York for her \nrecollection of history and the importance this issue has been given \nthroughout our Nation's seamless history, more than 200 years, of \nproviding for the educational needs of our people. I thank her \nimmensely for this amendment which she has offered to us. I join her in \nhoping our colleagues will support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the objective of school construction is a \nvery laudable one. I have supported Federal intervention and assistance \non school construction. This was a cause championed by former Senator \nCarol Moseley-Braun.\n  The grave difficulty with the amendment is that there is no money in \nthe budget resolution to pay for it. In the budget resolution which was \nvoted on in the 105th Congress, there was a resolution relating to \npublic school construction. It was supported by only three Republicans \nat that time--Senator Campbell, Senator D'Amato, and myself. \nRegrettably, the resolution did not pass. But at that time I recorded \nmy support for the principle of construction which would be assisted in \nthe Federal budget.\n  A similar matter arose on April 1, 1998, when the issue in the budget \nresolution was building schools. On that occasion, Senator D'Amato and \nI supported the resolution, which regrettably was tabled on a vote of \n54 to 46.\n  So the issue with which we are confronted now, in a very practical \nsense, much as we want to support education--and this bill has $53.5 \nbillion in education funding--it is at an all-time high. On other \namendments, we have analysed the increases which have occurred during \nthe budget requests by President Bush, who has asked the Congress to \nincrease the Education budget from $40 billion to $53 billion, on the \nthree budget requests which he has made, an increase of 33 percent, \nwhich compares very favorably with the budget requests made by \nPresident Bush's predecessor, President Clinton.\n  On the statistics I had outlined before, in one 3-year period \nPresident Clinton had asked for increases over 26 percent and in \nanother 3-year period had asked for budget increases of 33 percent, \nmoving from $30 billion to $40 billion.\n  The issue is not really with the broad brush the Senator from \nConnecticut talks about, the good old days when we supported education, \nnotwithstanding a war being fought, the Civil War. On the issue of \neducation, there has been very considerable funding. Not as much, \nfrankly, as I would like. And I have tried hard to get a larger \nallocation for education, a larger allocation for health and human \nservices, and a larger allocation for workers' safety. Those are the \ncompeting items in the appropriations bill which this subcommittee has \nbrought forward.\n\n  Our colleague, Senator Harkin, has come to the floor. He and I have \nworked on a cooperative basis on this and on a bipartisan basis. I \nshould add that Senator Harkin has been a champion for school \nconstruction. I mentioned Senator Carol Moseley-Braun was a champion as \nwell as Senator Harkin in reference to a couple of votes in which I \njoined.\n  Mr. President, we need 10 minutes of debate starting at 5:30, I \nbelieve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. Under the previous order, at \n5:30 there will 10 minutes of debate on the Daschle amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in the absence of Senator Daschle, I ask \nunanimous consent that we may proceed for up to 4 minutes, or until \nSenator Daschle arrives, whichever occurs first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, will the Senator from Pennsylvania yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, the Senator from Pennsylvania is correct \nin his statement of his own record and the record with respect to \nincreasing the Federal commitment to education. The Senator from \nPennsylvania knows very well because of the complex State he represents \nthe importance of supporting education and also supporting construction \nfor the kind of old school\n\n[[Page S11094]]\n\nstock we have in cities in New York and Pennsylvania.\n  But would the Senator agree that with the No Child Left Behind Act \nthe consequences for students and school districts under federally \nmandated accountability standards are considerably greater than they \nhave ever been at any point in our history where for the first time the \nFederal Government has assumed a leadership role and accountability \nrole with respect to public education?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in response to the question from the \nSenator from New York, I believe it is true that the Federal Government \nhas assumed a greater responsibility; that the No Child Left Behind Act \nhas targeted program standards and very specific efforts to improve the \nquality of education in the United States. But I do not believe the \nFederal Government has taken over the financing responsibilities. I \ntook a look at the statistics as to where we stand now. The Federal \nGovernment still only contributes 8.4 percent of the total education \nbudget. We don't have time to go into all of the statistics on \nconstruction, but construction is still left largely to the States. \nHere we have a targeted effort with the President spearheading the way \nand identifying a goal and using the power of his bully pulpit to focus \nattention. But I do not believe it has a corollary obligation to \nprovide all the money to do all the things to be sure no child is left \nbehind, much as I would like that. I didn't like voting against the \nDaschle amendment for rural schools. I come from a rural area \noriginally myself--a small town in Kansas. I didn't like voting against \nthe Murray amendment on workforce. I am not going to like voting \nagainst other education amendments. This is a very heavy \nresponsibility. Maybe one day the Senator from New York will be the \nchairman of this subcommittee, and when she is chairman of the \nsubcommittee and she has a budget resolution and a 302(b) allocation, \nshe is going to have to defend it. She might not like to defend it. I \ndon't care much for defending it. I have cast more bad votes in 2 days \nthan I cast in the balance of the year. I should say ``controversial \nvotes''--not bad votes. There is no such thing as a bad vote, or a bad \nchild. They are controversial votes on both sides.\n  But I would like to see a bigger pot. If there were a bigger pot, I \nwould like to see it.\n  Senator Harkin and I referenced two budget resolutions in 1997 and \n1998 when in one year Senator Campbell and Senator D'Amato and I were \nalone among Republicans voting for school construction, and another \nyear when Senator D'Amato and I were alone. Senator Moseley-Braun and \nSenator Harkin fought the good fight. Senator Clinton is now here to \nassist in that.\n  But I am constrained to offer the other considerations as to what the \nlimitations are because of the budget resolution and because of the \nallocation which this subcommittee has. Much as I would like to see my \npartner, Senator Harkin, get $1 billion here, I just have to say no.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Certainly.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from New York for her remarks. I just \nappreciate her eloquence and her strength in supporting this proposal \nto rebuild and modernize our schools.\n  I wonder if the Senator from New York is aware of the number of jobs \nbeing created. I understand there is an estimate that this $1 billion \nwould create about 24,000 jobs in the entire United States.\n  There is an article in this morning's paper which said the President \nis going to come up with a new budget request for Iraq of between $60 \nbillion and $70 billion--twice what we were told about two months ago.\n  In July, we had a briefing by Mr. Bremer, who is our counsel over \nthere. He gets to write all these checks for money in Iraq. He said \nsomething I couldn't believe I heard, so I wrote it down. He said they \nwere putting a lot of money into rebuilding infrastructure in Baghdad--\nthe streets, the sewers, and rebuilding schools because they found they \ngot more bang for the buck when they put it in that.\n  I can't understand why we can do that in Iraq but we can't do the \nsame here in the United States.\n  The leveraging of money has been great in the past with what we have \ndone for schools.\n  I might ask again if the Senator will yield for a question. I am sure \nthe Senator is aware the offset we are using we already used before to \nget an additional $2.2 billion for the bill. I am told there is about \n$13 million that could be used as an offset. I am wondering why we \ncan't use this offset to get money to help rebuild and modernize our \nschools.\n  I am sort of at a loss. I wonder if maybe the Senator might know why \nwe can't use this money. Since we have already used some of it before \nin the bill, why we can't use it for this?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I share my colleague's bewilderment. It does appear to \nme that the offsets are certainly adequate for the money we believe \nshould go into school construction. The Senator's reference to Iraq \nraises an additional question. I, too, am aware of the statement by the \nadministration, by Mr. Bremer and others that we--the American \ntaxpayers--were committed to rebuilding schools, hospitals, health \nclinics, roads, and powerplants. I don't think one would argue with \nthat. It is our responsibility. Once we make the decision to pursue \nmilitary action and change the regime, we inherit those \nresponsibilities.\n  But not only does it seem fair and equitable to do the same for our \nown citizenry--particularly our students in rural areas and in \nunderserved urban areas which both of us represent in our respective \nStates--I would note a cautionary comment: that if we expect to have \nthe broad population of this country support the long-term commitment \nwe have taken upon ourselves, which is costing at least $1 billion a \nweek--and we know the President is going to come and ask for between \n$60 billion and $70 billion more to support both the military mission \nand the reconstruction costs of Iraq--I think if we are serious about \nsustaining public support for what is a costly endeavor in terms of \nlife and, much more important than money, the soldiers we are losing, \nthe casualties, the injuries that are being incurred, it is important \nwe support things here in our own country.\n  It will be impossible to go to this Nation and say keep spending \nmoney in Iraq when you do not have jobs, when your schools are \ncrumbling, when your bridges, your wastewater treatment centers, and \nyour electricity grid is crumbling. Who are we kidding? How do you \nsustain the broad American public support for this kind of endeavor \nthat costs us blood and fortune without doing things here at home? This \nis a tangible way to demonstrate we care about what happens in America \nas well.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1568\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour of 5:40 having arrived, the question \nis now on Daschle amendment No. 1568.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I raise a point of order under section \n504 of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2004 \nthat the amendment exceeds discretionary spending limits specified in \nthis section and, therefore, is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, pursuant to section 504(b)(2) of H. Con. \nRes. 95, the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2004, \nI move to waive section 504 of that concurrent resolution for purposes \nof the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

COLLOTON, OF IOWA, TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT \n                      JUDGE FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the nomination of Steven \nColloton, to be United States Circuit Judge. The clerk will report the \nnomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Steven M. Colloton, of \nIowa, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 2 minutes of debate evenly \ndivided. Who yields time? The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today to express my unqualified \nsupport for the nomination of Steven Colloton to the Eighth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals and to urge my colleagues to confirm this fine \nnominee.\n  Mr. Colloton has excellent academic and professional qualifications \nfor the Federal bench. A graduate of the prestigious Yale Law School, \nMr. Colloton clerked for two distinguished judges, D.C. Circuit Judge \nLaurence H. Silberman and U.S. Supreme Court Justice William H. \nRehnquist. Mr. Colloton then worked as an attorney with the White \nHouse's Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice for a year \nand then, eager to return to his Midwestern roots, accepted a position \nas an assistant U.S. attorney in the Northern District of Iowa.\n  Mr. Colloton has impressive courtroom experience. He has argued 18 \ncases in the Federal courts of appeals, and has briefed several other \ncases. He has tried approximately 13 criminal cases to verdict. In \naddition, as an assistant U.S. attorney, Mr. Colloton was in the \ncourtroom regularly to argue motions or evidentiary matters. He \noversees an office which includes 25 attorneys.\n  Twenty-seven past presidents of the Iowa State Bar have written of \nMr. Colloton, ``[W]e submit that the exceptional quality of Mr. \nColloton's experience, together with its relevance to this position, \nuniquely qualifies him to represent Iowa on the United States Court of \nAppeals.''\n  I could not agree more. Mr. Colloton has demonstrated his capacity to \nexcel on the Federal court bench. He possesses the qualifications, the \ncapacity, and the temperament a judge needs to serve on the Eighth \nCircuit.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, today, we vote to confirm Steven Colloton \nto a lifetime appointment on the United States Court of Appeals for the \nEighth Circuit. Mr. Colloton comes to us with bipartisan support from \nboth his home-state Senators, for whom I have great respect. Steven \nColloton currently serves as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern \nDistrict of Iowa. While I continue to remain concerned that, at 40 \nyears old, Mr. Colloton received a partial not qualified rating from \nthe ABA, he has a good academic record and has a record of public \nservice in the state of Iowa.\n  I note that Mr. Colloton is the ninth confirmed circuit court judge \nwho is a member of the Federalist Society and the third former member \nof Whitewater prosecutor Ken Starr's office to be confirmed to a \nFederal judgeship. I would like to take this opportunity to express my \nhope that Mr. Colloton acts as a fair and impartial judge, despite his \nactive role in conservative political causes and groups. It was very \ntroubling that another former Starr prosecutor confirmed to the Federal \nbench overlooked years of precedent to rule in favor of Vice President \nCheney and against the American people's interest in open access to who \nwas advising the administration on energy policy, a special concern in \nthe aftermath of the blackouts in the Northeast this August.\n  Mr. Colloton's confirmation process stands in stark contrast to what \noccurred with judicial nominees during the Clinton administration. His \nconfirmation process has been expeditious and smooth. In contrast, an \nearlier nominee to the Eighth Circuit from Iowa, Bonnie Campbell, never \neven received a vote before the Judiciary Committee following the \nhearing on her nomination. Ms. Campbell was a former attorney general \nof Iowa, a former head of the Department of Justice's Office on \nViolence Against Women, and a nominee who also had the support of both \nof her home-state Senators including a senior Republican Senator. \nNeither the nominee nor the Judiciary Committee members were ever told \nwhy the Republican majority refused to accord her nomination a \nCommittee vote and, when given the chance to do right by her, President \nBush instead decided to withdraw her nomination.\n  Another contrast exemplified by Mr. Colloton's confirmation process \nis the pace of confirming circuit court judges. Steven Colloton will be \nthe 28th circuit court judge confirmed since President Bush has taken \noffice. Again, this stands in strong contrast to what occurred during \nPresident Clinton's second term in office. More than 3 years passed in \nPresident Clinton's second term before the 28th circuit court judge was \nconfirmed. And, we have already confirmed more circuit court nominees \nof this President, since July of 2001, than were confirmed at this time \nin the third year of President Reagan's first term, President George \nH.W. Bush's term, or either of President Clinton's terms.\n  Finally, I point out that with Mr. Colloton's confirmation, there \nwill be as many active George W. Bush appointees on the bench as there \nare active George Herbert Walker Bush appointees. The President's \nfather served 4 full years. This President has served less than three \nand already has made as much impact on the Federal courts across the \ncountry.\n  I congratulate Steven Colloton, his family, and the Senators from \nIowa on his confirmation.\n  Madam President, to reiterate this will be the 28th circuit court \njudge confirmed since President Bush has taken office. For those who \nare wondering, that is more circuit court nominees confirmed than in \nthe third year of President Reagan's first term or President George H. \nBush's term or either of President Clinton's terms. We have done far \nbetter, I might say, for President George Bush than we have his three \npredecessors.\n  I will also note a contrast. Mr. Colloton's nomination moved very \nquickly, as contrasted to President Clinton's nominee for the same \nseat, Bonnie Campbell, who was never given a vote before the Judiciary \nCommittee. Even though she had been a former attorney general of Iowa, \nshe was the former head of the Department of Justice's Office of \nViolence Against Women, and she had the support of\n\n[[Page S11096]]\n\nboth of her home State Senators, she was never given a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will support Steven Colloton.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I urge my colleagues to support an \nexcellent judicial nominee for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth \nCircuit. Steven Colloton is an outstanding individual with an extensive \nrecord of public service and impressive legal career. I am glad that \nthe Senate is finally voting on this nomination.\n  Steve Colloton is an Iowan, born in Iowa City. He graduated from \nPrinceton University and Yale Law School. He served as a law clerk to \nJudge Laurence Silberman on U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, \nand then as a law clerk to the Honorable William Rehnquist, Chief \nJustice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Subsequently, Steve Colloton worked \nas an attorney with the Office of legal Counsel at the Justice \nDepartment and than as an assistance U.S. attorney in the Northern \nDistrict of Iowa for 8 years, with a brief detail as an associate \nindependent counsel in the Office of Independent Counsel. From 1991 to \n2001, he was partner at a law firm in Des Moines, IA.\n  After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Steve Colloton returned to \ngovernment service and was unanimously confirmed by the Senate to the \nposition of U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Iowa. There he \nhas focused his efforts on combating crime and enforcing drug laws, as \nwell as fighting terrorism. He has done a great job serving our country \nas an Iowa U.S. Attorney.\n  In addition, Steve Colloton has many strong supporters. Twenty-seven \npast presidents of the Iowa State Bar wrote that ``the exceptional \nquality of Mr. Colloton's experience, together with its relevance to \nthis position, uniquely qualifies him to represent Iowa on the United \nStates Court of Appeals.''\n  Members of the Polk County Chiefs of Police and Sheriff's Association \nwrote, ``Steve Colloton is the right choice for the Eighth Circuit \nCourt Judge position, and we fully endorse President Bush's \nnomination.'' Even people who have worked on the other side of Steve \nColloton think very highly of him. George Collins, the attorney for Jim \nGuy Tucker, wrote, ``I am convinced Steve Colloton is an honorable man, \nand that, when cases come before him, he will call them as he sees \nthem. . . . I believe that his case will be decided on the law, and, to \nthe extent applicable, the facts. . . .'' These quotes show just how \nmuch confidence people have that Steve Colloton will make a good Eighth \nCircuit judge.\n  Steve Colloton has all the right qualifications to be a Federal \njudge. He is a bright lawyer with tremendous legal experience and who \nis well respected by his peers. He is a man who will follow the law and \nhave a healthy respect for case precedent. He understands that the role \nof a judge is to interpret the law, rather than create it. Steve \nColloton will make an excellent judge on the Eighth Circuit, and I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting his nomination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Steven M. Colloton, of Iowa, to be United States Circuit Judge for \nthe Eighth Circuit? The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I congratulate our friend and \ncolleague, Frank Lautenberg, on reaching a historic milestone: With the \nlast vote, Senator Lautenberg became only the fourth New Jersey Senator \nin history to cast 6,500 votes in the Senate. Not bad for a freshman.\n  That incredible accomplishment is a reflection of Senator \nLautenberg's deep commitment to his State, to his Nation, and to this \nSenate. One of the many reasons we are grateful he decided to end his \nretirement and return to the Senate is, over one 3-year period, \ncovering the second session of the 101st Congress and both sessions of \nthe 102nd Congress, Senator Lautenberg did not miss one vote. Out of \n876 cast, he did not miss 1 single vote. The following year, he missed \nonly 1 of 394 votes cast. He is what we all know to be a workhorse.\n  I am not sure if we should call him New Jersey's senior Senator or \nNew Jersey's junior Senator, but there is no doubt he is a remarkable \nSenator.\n  I congratulate him again on this milestone. I look forward to seeing \nhim cast many more votes in this Chamber. Congratulations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Lautenberg be recognized for a \ncouple of minutes to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank our leader, the Democrat leader, for the kind \ncomments, and my colleagues, some of whom are more accustomed to \ndiffering with me than applauding for me, but I respect their views \nwhen they register a vote and I am sure the feeling would be returned.\n  I thank all of my colleagues for their many indulgences and their \nencouragement and willingness to take me back because here I stand in \nprobably another record, maybe the oldest freshman who ever served in \nthe Senate. I feel fresh, and I am glad to be here. I thank all of my \ncolleagues for their friendship.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I compliment my colleague from New Jersey and am very \nproud of him for having cast those many votes.\n  I ask that my remarks be as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to speak on the unfortunate\n\n[[Page S11097]]\n\nwithdrawal of the nomination of Miguel Estrada for the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. It is truly a \nsad record that the Senate, for the first time ever, has terminated a \ncircuit court nomination by filibuster rather than by an up-or-down \nvote. It is particularly troubling that political tactics were used to \ndestroy this extremely qualified nominee.\n  Let me state that a clear majority of this body supported this \nnomination, as has been demonstrated in the unprecedented seven cloture \nvotes which have taken place. So it is regrettable that a minority of \nSenators followed their script of extraordinary obstructionism to \nprevent the Senate from concluding the debate on this nomination and \nproceeding to a final vote. It goes against all the honorable \ntraditions of this body for Senators to rest behind a veil of \nprocedural votes rather than taking a public stand on the merits of \nthis outstanding nominee.\n  After all, all he or any of us wanted was an up-or-down vote, \nsomething we have always given every nominee who has come to the Senate \nfloor and has been called up on the Senate floor.\n  While it is shameful that Miguel Estrada was subjugated to political \nwhims, it is not entirely surprising. Opponents from the very outset, \nfor their own ideological purposes, have been determined to defeat this \nnomination. Last fall, a Democratic staffer on the Judiciary Committee \nwas quoted in the Nation magazine as saying:\n\n       Estrada is 40 and if he makes it to the circuit then he \n     will be Bush's first Supreme Court nominee. He could be on \n     the Supreme Court for 30 years and do a lot of damage. We \n     have to stop him now.\n\n  So it appears that the real reason for the filibuster against Miguel \nEstrada was the concern by opponents of a possible Justice Estrada on \nthe U.S. Supreme Court.\n  An editorial appearing in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution said it \nbest:\n\n       The fear with Owen and Estrada is that one or both will be \n     nominated to the United States Supreme Court should a vacancy \n     occur. Senate Democrats are determined to keep off the \n     circuit court bench any perceived conservative who has the \n     credentials to serve on the United States Supreme Court.\n\n  There is an additional factor not based on any substantive objection \nto his nomination. I believe some Senate Democrats do not want the \ncurrent President, a Republican President, to appoint the first \nHispanic as the U.S. Circuit Court Judge for the District of Columbia \nCircuit. Let me read from an editorial published by the Dallas Morning \nNews addressing this point. On February 17, 2003, the News wrote:\n\n       Democrats haven't liked Mr. Estrada from the beginning. \n     Part of that is due to his ideology--which is decidedly not \n     Democratic.\n\n      But part of it also has to do with the fellow who nominated \nhim. Democrats don't relish giving President Bush one more thing to \nbrag about when he goes into Hispanic neighborhoods when he goes into \nhis reelection campaign next year. They are even less interested in \nputting a conservative Republican in line to become the first Hispanic \nJustice on the Supreme Court.\n\n  In an effort to prevent Mr. Estrada's confirmation, his opponents \nresorted to a number of troubling tactics. During his hearing there \nwere frequent attempts to inject political ideology into the judicial \nnomination process. This was most evident as related to questions about \nhis views on Roe v. Wade, the apparent litmus test for many Senate \nDemocrats.\n  In response to this concern, he offered cases he had taken on as an \nattorney to illustrate his commitment to following the law instead of \nimposing any political agenda. He also testified under oath that he \nwould follow Roe and Casey if he were confirmed. But even his \noutstanding record and testimony before the committee was apparently \nnot enough to satisfy those determined to destroy his nomination.\n  Opponents repeatedly raised red herring issues with two additional \ndemands. One was that Mr. Estrada answer their questions, though the \nrecord is clear that his responses were complete. Mr. Estrada spent \nhours during a day-long hearing answering my Democratic colleagues' \nquestions. He answered written questions submitted after the hearing, \nalthough only two, only two committee Democrats bothered to ask him \nwritten questions.\n  He gave answers to questions that were substantially similar to \nanswers given by Clinton nominees who were confirmed. Yet my Democratic \ncolleagues continue to complain that he had not answered their \nquestions. Really, their complaint is that in answering their \nquestions, Mr. Estrada did not say anything that gave them a reason to \nvote against him. Simply put, they were not really interested in his \nanswers to their questions. They were interested only in defeating his \nnomination.\n  This is why every effort to make Mr. Estrada available to answer \nadditional questions has gone virtually unacknowledged. Only one \nDemocratic Senator met with Mr. Estrada and only one submitted written \nquestions to Mr. Estrada after the floor debate on his nomination \nbegan.\n  Their second demand was the unreasonable request that the \nadministration release confidential internal memoranda he authored at \nthe Solicitor General's office. This issue has been fully debated. The \nshort response is that never before has a Presidential administration \nreleased confidential appeal, certiorari and amicus recommendations on \nthe scale that my Democratic colleagues sought from Mr. Estrada. They \nattempted a full-scale fishing expedition, pure and simple, and the \nJustice Department was right to oppose it.\n  Furthermore, this demand constituted a double standard for Miguel \nEstrada. The Judiciary Committee confirmed numerous Clinton circuit \ncourt nominees who, like Miguel Estrada, had no prior judicial \nexperience. A number of these nominees had worked in the Justice \nDepartment or other branches of the Federal Government, but Senate \nDemocrats made no demands for their confidential memoranda or \nprivileged work product. Yet Senate Democrats persisted in this demand, \nknowing full well that for sound reasons the administration, with the \nsupport of all seven living former Solicitors General, both Democrat \nand Republican--four of them were Democrats--would not and could not \naccede to that request.\n\n  When all other tactics failed, opponents turned to their ultimate \nweapon, the filibuster. Filibusters of judicial nominees allow a vocal \nmajority to prevent the majority of Senators from voting on the \nconfirmation of a Federal judge, a prospective member of our third, \ncoequal branch of Government. It is tyranny of the minority and it is \nunfair to the nominee, to the judiciary, and to the majority of the \nMembers of this body, and to the President. The unprecedented \nfilibuster of Mr. Estrada was certainly unfair to a majority of \nSenators who stood ready to fulfill their constitutional responsibility \nby voting on Mr. Estrada's nomination.\n  It has been more than 2 years since Miguel Estrada was nominated by \nPresident Bush, on May 9, 2001, and nearly a year since his hearing \nbefore the committee. In all of that time, my Democratic colleagues had \nunlimited opportunities to make their case. Some of them opposed him. \nOthers supported him. But one thing remained clear through this whole \ndebate: There was no good reason to deny Mr. Estrada an up-or-down \nvote, the dignity of an up-or-down vote.\n  On the merits, Mr. Estrada was extremely qualified to serve on the \ncourt to which he was nominated. The qualifications of Miguel Estrada \nare well known to the Senate. He represents an American success story. \nAfter immigrating to the United States, after overcoming a language \nbarrier and speech impediment, he graduated magna cum laud and Phi Beta \nKappa in 1983 from Columbia College. At Harvard Law School he was an \neditor of the Harvard Law Review and graduated magna cum laude in 1986.\n  Mr. Estrada's professional career has been marked by one success \nafter another. After graduation, he clerked for Second Circuit Judge \nAmalya Kearse, a Carter appointee and then Supreme Court Justice \nAnthony Kennedy. He worked as an associate in the distinguished firm of \nWachtell Lipton in New York. He then worked as a Federal prosecutor in \nManhattan, rising to become deputy chief of the appellate division. In \nrecognition of his appellate skills, he was hired by the Solicitor \nGeneral's office during the first Bush administration. He stayed with \nthe Solicitor General's office for most of the Clinton administration. \nWhen he left\n\n[[Page S11098]]\n\nthe Solicitor General's office, he joined the DC office of Gibson, Dunn \n& Crutcher, one of the great law firms in this country, where he \ncontinued to excel as a partner and rose to the top of the ranks of \noral advocates nationwide, having argued 15 cases before the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n\n  The legal bar's wide regard for Mr. Estrada is reflected in his \nevaluation by the American Bar Association. The ABA evaluates judicial \nnominees based on their professional qualifications, their integrity, \ntheir professional competence, and their judicial temperament. Based on \nan assessment of all of those factors, the ABA bestowed upon Mr. \nEstrada its highest rating of ``unanimously well qualified.''\n  Yet despite the superb record of Miguel Estrada, opponents chose to \ndeny him a simple up-or-down vote, injecting politics into the judicial \nconfirmation process. Opponents have not only treated Miguel Estrada \nunfairly; they have further damaged this process.\n  One casualty is enough. I hope all Senators will consider the \ndangerous ramifications of the actions of the Senate in causing Miguel \nEstrada to withdraw his nomination through the use of the filibuster. \nThis should never happen again.\n  Just one other thing on this. He was asked to comply when he couldn't \ndo it, with a fishing expedition into the Solicitor General's most \nprivileged documents, documents that have never been given in toto as \nrequested by the Democrats, never before. Four Democrat former \nSolicitors General said they would never give these documents. Those \nDemocrat former Solicitors General and three others said they opposed \nthe release of these documents.\n  If this was a legitimate request, why didn't they ask for similar \ndocuments in the case of John Roberts? In other words, Miguel Estrada \nwas treated completely different from other people. Why didn't Senate \nDemocrats ask for these documents in the case of others through the \nyears who worked in the Solicitor General's office? It was just a red \nherring that some in the media bought off on, to prevent this man from \never having the dignity of an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor.\n  The reason they prevented that is because they knew he would have won \nand he would have won a bipartisan vote in the Senate.\n  Frankly, filibusters should never occur again. Yet more judicial \nnominees face continuing filibusters on the Senate floor. We will soon \nonce again put to the test the respect the Members of our body have for \nour constitutional duty to advise and consent on judicial nominations. \nWe will continue to file for cloture to end debate and to give \nPriscilla Owen, Bill Pryor, and other judicial nominees that the left \nis intent on blocking the up-or-down votes they deserve.\n  These are outstanding nominees. Priscilla Owen broke through the \nglass ceiling, becoming one of the great partners of a major law firm \nin this country, and broke through the glass ceiling for women, yet she \nis being treated like dirt on the Senate floor. Also, Bill Pryor, who \nhas more than shown his propensity to always follow the law, even \nthough the law may differ from his own personal, deeply held beliefs.\n  There are, no doubt, factions of far left interest groups that are \ndelighted to see Miguel Estrada has withdrawn his nomination. These \nsame groups no doubt will declare victory and mount even more vigorous \ncampaigns in an effort to ensure that other judicial nominees suffer \nthe same fate. From what I understand, some of my colleagues in the \nSenate share those sentiments. But let me tell you right now, this is \nno occasion for celebration. We should be embarrassed that Miguel \nEstrada, having had enough of serving as a political football instead \nof as a Federal judge, decided to end his nomination. And we should be \nembarrassed of the continued attempts to usurp the nomination function \nfrom the President and the consent function from the Senate majority.\n  We should not stand back and allow a minority of Senators to prevent \nan up-or-down vote on any judicial nominee and especially those once \nthey have come to the floor.\n  We should not inflict upon Priscilla Owen, Bill Pryor, or any others \nthe same shabby treatment that led Miguel Estrada to withdraw his \nnomination. These all deserve better. And nominees in the future \ndeserve better. The majority of the Senate that stands ready to confirm \nthe ones I have mentioned deserve better. Most importantly, the \nAmerican people expect their Senators to hold up-or-down votes on \njudicial nominees and deserve the opportunity to hold their Senators \naccountable for the votes they cast on the President's judicial \nnominees.\n  I have been around here a long time. Both sides have committed errors \nwith regard to judicial nominees over the years. But nothing has ever \nreached the dimensions of what has been done to Miguel Estrada. Nothing \nhas even come close. He has been treated in an especially onerous way \nthat no other nominee I know of in the history of the Senate has been \ntreated. He has been singled out primarily because he was viewed as \nbeing on the fast track to the Supreme Court, and because he is a \nconservative Republican Hispanic who might be pro-life and who is on \nthe fast track to the Supreme Court. I don't think anybody who is \nhonest can refute that statement.\n  I think it is pitiful what has happened. I just hope we wake up in \nthis body and start treating people with fairness which the advise and \nconsent clause of the Constitution demands. I hope that works on both \nsides.\n  There were those who wanted to filibuster on our side during the \nClinton years. We stopped it. We were not going to set that precedent, \nnor were we going to do that type of activity. Frankly, everyone who \ncame to the floor had a vote, and only one, if I recall correctly, was \ndefeated by an up-and-down vote. But at least he had a vote. And Miguel \nEstrada deserved that just as much as any of the past nominees.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, I yield for a question.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask my friend from Utah, the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, if it is the case that the President's nominee, \nJohn Roberts, and the President's nominee, Miguel Estrada, both served \nin the Solicitor's Office at some point in their careers?\n  Mr. HATCH. They both did, and both were nominated at the same time, \nover 2 years ago.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask my friend from Utah, the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, if it is also true that the internal work product \ndocuments that were requested of nominee Miguel Estrada were not \nrequested of nominee John Roberts.\n  Mr. HATCH. Absolutely right. They were not requested. There was a \ndifferent standard used with regard to Mr. Estrada--a very unfair \nstandard knowing that the Solicitor General's Office could not allow a \nfishing expedition into those documents.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is it not the case that every former Solicitor--most \nof whom are Democrats--had the view that these internal working \ndocuments should not be shared?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is correct. Four of the seven former Solicitors \nGeneral who are living today are Democrats, and all seven of them came \nout and said that these documents should not be given to the Senators \nof the United States because of their sensitivity and their privileged \nnature.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is it also not true that nominee John Roberts was \nconfirmed unanimously?\n  Mr. HATCH. It is true that he was confirmed unanimously.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We all know that Miguel Estrada was filibustered to \nthe point where he subsequently withdrew today.\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, will my friend from Utah yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. HATCH. If my friend from Kentucky has concluded.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the chairman of the committee for yielding so \nwe could point out the differences in treatment between these two \nnominees with very similar backgrounds and who were nominated for the \nsame court at the same time.\n  Mr. HATCH. The illustration should not be limited to just John \nRoberts and Miguel Estrada. There are a number of people who are on the \nFederal bench and who have served on the Federal bench who also served \nin the Solicitor's Office who were never asked those questions, and \nrightly so. They should\n\n[[Page S11099]]\n\nnever have been asked. It was a red herring that many of my colleagues \nhid behind to justify this outrageous and, I think, shabby treatment of \nMiguel Estrada.\n  I yield to my friend for a question.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I understand the strength and feeling of \nthe Senator from Utah and the Senator from Kentucky. The record has \nbeen spread with that for many months now. I would only say if the \nSenator wants to speak more, we have no problem.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I draw the attention of my colleagues to \nthe same statement which I made earlier today in response to the \nremarks of Senator Frist about Miguel Estrada.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a Congressional Record \nstatement made by Senator Feinstein on February 13, 2003, on the \nnomination of Miguel Estrada be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I had an opportunity to come \n     to the floor once before and express my views about the \n     nominee who is before the Senate for confirmation, Miguel \n     Estrada. But I want to make a few additional points at this \n     time, and I hope I don't repeat myself.\n       I want to say for my part and for the part of many others \n     in the body that this is not a debate we were eager to begin; \n     this is not a debate we are eager to continue; but this is a \n     debate that really goes to the heart of the separation of \n     powers and the checks and balances that the Founders of this \n     Nation so carefully crafted more than 200 years ago.\n       The President makes nominations to the Federal judiciary. \n     This is true. But it is a judiciary that Congress fashioned, \n     and it is a judiciary that the Senate has been given the \n     constitutional responsibility to help fill, through our \n     advice and consent role.\n       I am one who has always believed that every nominee should \n     get a full and fair hearing and that every nominee should \n     then get an up-or-down vote. For too long, I watched one \n     after another Clinton nominee languish without any such \n     courtesy, and with no explanation as to why. Many of his \n     nominees were minorities who never even got the chance to \n     speak to the Committee.\n       Chairman Hatch and I had many conversations during that \n     time about moving more nominees through the committee. And I \n     know he did more than many in his caucus would have liked him \n     to do to move nominees. For that, I thank him. I believe deep \n     in his heart he also believes nominees should move through \n     and get a hearing. But still, too many nominees were stopped \n     from even the most basic of rights during the nomination \n     process--a hearing--a basic right for someone who is \n     nominated to the Judiciary Committee. They should have a \n     right to have a hearing, in my view.\n       In this case, the Democrat-controlled Senate gave Miguel \n     Estrada a full and fair hearing and every opportunity to show \n     the committee what kind of judge he would be. But he did not \n     use that opportunity well.\n       Although I believe that every nominee deserves an up-or-\n     down vote, an up-or-down vote on final confirmation should \n     only occur after the Senate has had a full opportunity to \n     learn about the nominee and to properly judge whether or not \n     that nominee can serve impartially in the Federal judiciary. \n     In this case, I don't believe we have enough information to \n     make such a decision, as a direct result of the lack of \n     cooperation by this nominee and by the White House. As a \n     result, we should not be asked to make such an important \n     decision.\n       I want to clearly state this is not an issue of \n     retaliation, as some have suggested. It is true that the \n     Republican Senate did block a number of very qualified \n     Hispanic nominees--female nominees, and so on--under \n     President Clinton.\n       And it is true that many on this floor have mentioned those \n     nominees--Enrique Moreno, for instance. But they were \n     mentioned not to begin some tit-for-tat exchange of blocked \n     nominations. Quite the contrary. Under Chairman Leahy, the \n     Judiciary Committee and the Democrat-controlled Senate \n     confirmed 100 nominees in just over a year.\n       Mr. Estrada has already been given far better treatment \n     than many were given by the other side in the recent past. \n     All we ask for is some basic answers to the most basic of \n     questions. Think about this: Before us now, we have a 41-\n     year-old nominee about whom we know little. He has been \n     nominated to a crucial appellate court, the DC Circuit, which \n     is, at present, evenly split. That raises the question, Do we \n     have a right to know if this judicial nominee can be \n     impartial? I believe we do.\n       In this case, this nominee, for some reason, has been very \n     controversial from the beginning. We have heard from many who \n     have worked with Mr. Estrada or even supervised him, and many \n     who have watched him work throughout the years.\n       Without exception, all of these individuals believe Mr. \n     Estrada is bright. And I am confident that every Democrat in \n     this body agrees with that assessment. But that is not the \n     problem. And that is not the question today.\n       Without exception, all these individuals believe Mr. \n     Estrada to be well educated, as my colleagues on the other \n     side of the aisle have indicated throughout the last few \n     days. But that, too, is an issue that is not in doubt, and it \n     is not the problem.\n       And essentially, without exception, all of these \n     individuals believe Mr. Estrada is conservative. Some believe \n     him to be very conservative, some less so, but all recognize \n     him to be a conservative. Even Mr. Estrada himself, as I \n     understand it, would likely describe himself in this manner. \n     But make no mistake, this is not about whether or not Miguel \n     Estrada is conservative.\n       I have already voted for nominees whom I know to be \n     conservative, as have most, if not all, of my Democratic \n     colleagues.\n       At the present time, I have just given my proxy to the \n     Judiciary Committee that is considering three nominees to \n     appellate courts who are, in fact, conservative. And I will \n     vote yes on those nominees.\n       So the question is not whether this nominee--or any \n     nominee--is liberal or conservative, White or Hispanic, \n     Jewish or Catholic, or any other group or inclination. The \n     question with this nominee--and with every nominee--is \n     whether the nominee can put aside personal beliefs to rule \n     fairly and impartially on the cases that come before him or \n     her.\n       In some cases, we can get a clear idea of how a nominee \n     would handle the responsibilities of a Federal judgeship. But \n     in this case, as we tried to get a clear idea of how this \n     nominee would handle these responsibilities, we were really \n     stymied at every turn.\n       On the one hand, we have letters, phone calls. To my \n     office, we have received almost 8,000 phone calls in \n     opposition to this nominee; and less than 400 in favor. All \n     these phone calls seem to indicate the belief that Mr. \n     Estrada is an ideologue who cannot be trusted with a circuit \n     court judgeship.\n       We have Professor Paul Bender, Mr. Estrada's direct \n     supervisor at the Department of Justice, who said to the \n     press that he believed Estrada to be so ``ideologically \n     driven that he couldn't be trusted to state the law in a \n     fair, neutral way.'' Mr. Bender recently sent a letter to the \n     chairman of the Judiciary Committee essentially reaffirming \n     this statement.\n       We have major Hispanic organizations--just those groups one \n     might expect to most strongly support Mr. Estrada--strongly \n     opposing him instead.\n       On the other hand, as we look for facts to counteract such \n     serious concerns, we have almost nothing.\n       Miguel Estrada has never been a judge, so we have no record \n     of judicial decisionmaking to examine. This in itself is not \n     dispositive, but it is the first area where we find no record \n     to help us in our decisions.\n       Mr. Estrada is not a prolific writer, so again, unlike \n     many, we have no real record of writings or speeches to \n     examine. Again, this alone would not be dispositive, but, as \n     I said earlier this week, in a sense, it is strike two in \n     terms of where we can get information about this nominee.\n       We have not been granted access to the memos he wrote at \n     the Department of Justice, so we can only take the word of \n     the man who supervised him that those memos were \n     ideologically driven and could not be trusted. That is strike \n     three.\n       Mr. Estrada refused to adequately participate in his own \n     confirmation hearing, so we have no real answers to these \n     questions. And the questions are legitimate.\n       Even when given time to think about his answers, even when \n     he was given questions in written form, he refused to answer \n     those questions, using precisely the same language he used to \n     refuse to answer at his hearing.\n       For instance, when Senator Durbin asked this nominee, in \n     writing: ``Do you have an opinion on the merits of Roe v. \n     Wade?'' Mr. Estrada responded, as he did to me in committee, \n     ``it would not be appropriate for me to express such a view \n     without doing the intensive work that a judge hearing the \n     case would have to undertake--not only reading briefs and \n     hearing the arguments of counsel, but also independently \n     investigating the relevant constitutional text, case law, and \n     history.''\n       In the hearing, I asked him: Do you believe Roe was \n     correctly decided? And he said he could not answer that \n     question.\n       When Senator Kennedy asked Mr. Estrada, in writing, how he \n     would have resolved a case that came before the DC Circuit \n     and was then decided by the Supreme Court--Hoffman Plastics--\n     Mr. Estrada again answered that because he had not read the \n     briefs and was not present at oral argument, he could not \n     answer.\n       When Senator Kennedy asked him about the Maryland/DC/\n     Delaware Broadcasters case, again Mr. Estrada said he could \n     not, or would not, answer.\n       When Senator Durbin asked Mr. Estrada to name any judge, \n     living or dead, whom he would seek to emulate, Mr. Estrada \n     said he could name not one judge he would emulate.\n       In contrast, let me take a moment to talk about Judge \n     Richard Paez, a well-qualified Hispanic nominee sent to the \n     Senate by President Clinton and eventually confirmed to the \n     Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       Judge Paez spent more than 1,500 days before this Senate \n     before he finally got a vote. And this came despite the fact \n     that he answered every question put to him.\n       For instance, Senator Sessions asked him: ``Which Supreme \n     Court Justice or federal judge has most influenced your \n     judicial philosophy?'' Judge Paez named Judge Harry Hupp, a \n     man he appeared before as a litigator, and a colleague of his \n     on the district court bench.\n\n[[Page S11100]]\n\n       Senator Sessions asked Richard Paez: ``In your opinion what \n     is the greatest Supreme Court decision in American history?'' \n     Judge Paez did not refuse to answer, or claim that he could \n     not give an answer because he had not been present at oral \n     arguments. Instead, he simply named Brown v. Board of \n     Education.\n       Senator Sessions then asked: ``What is the worst Supreme \n     Court decision?'' Judge Paez answered: ``Dred Scott.'' This \n     is the decision where the Supreme Court ruled, essentially, \n     ``once a slave, always a slave.''\n       Miguel Estrada, on the other hand, would not answer these \n     types of questions.\n       Senator Schumer asked him to name any Supreme Court case he \n     thought was wrongly decided.\n       He did not simply say he thinks Plessy v. Ferguson was \n     wrongly decided. That is the case that upheld the concept of \n     separate but equal. And even the Supreme Court has since \n     overturned it. I know of few people who would claim Plessy \n     was correctly decided. But Miguel Estrada apparently thinks \n     he could not say so without having heard the oral arguments. \n     He did not say he disagreed with the Dred Scott decision, \n     which upheld slavery. He did not say he believed Korematsu, \n     which upheld the right of the United States to put American \n     citizens of Japanese descent into internment camps. He named \n     none of these cases. He simply said he could not answer the \n     question.\n       This is in direct contrast to a recent experience with \n     Jeffrey Sutton during his hearing less than 2 weeks ago. Mr. \n     Sutton is also a controversial nominee, but he answered every \n     question put to him. We got a good sense of how he would \n     think and act as a judge. I, myself, who was concerned about \n     him initially, felt he was a strong advocate, but he knew the \n     difference. He could separate himself from the positions of \n     advocacy and become a fair and impartial judge. So I have \n     given my proxy right now to be carried out to vote yes for \n     Judge Sutton. Mr. Estrada, on the other hand, did his best to \n     keep from putting himself on record on any issue of real \n     substance.\n       Quite frankly, there are options. One, return this nominee \n     to the Judiciary Committee for answers. The Senate deserves \n     the answers. Democratic nominees were asked by distinguished \n     Republican Senators to answer questions such as this, and \n     they did. Even of those, many had judicial records. Many had \n     prolific writings. Many had speeches so that there were tools \n     we could go to to understand what their thinking was. But in \n     this case we have no speeches. We have no writings. We have \n     no record. Therefore, the answers to the questions become \n     extraordinarily dispositive. They also become meaningful to \n     any Senator who wants to cast an informed vote.\n       It is that simple. That is what this debate is about. We \n     cannot possibly fulfill our constitutional duty to advise and \n     consent to nominees if we are not given the necessary \n     information about the nominee.\n       In a case where you have a critical circuit such as the DC \n     Circuit, not only the plumbing grounds for the U.S. Supreme \n     Court, but handling environmental appeals, Superfund appeals, \n     wetlands appeals, OSHA appeals, all kinds of administrative \n     case law appeals, how this court is tilted becomes important \n     to us, particularly if we take this job of confirmation of \n     nominees seriously.\n       There is another option. That option is appoint Miguel \n     Estrada to a district court. Give him an opportunity to gain \n     that record. He is 41 years old. He is younger than my \n     daughter. Give him an opportunity to gain that record. \n     Remember, this is a man who will serve for 30, 40, possibly \n     even 50 years. It is a lifetime appointment. We are entitled \n     to answers to these questions.\n       In Miguel Estrada's questionnaire, he admitted to having \n     written no books, articles, or reports of any kind, save one \n     Law Review article in law school. That was titled ``The \n     Policies Behind Lending Limits.'' He wrote that in 1985. At \n     Miguel Estrada's hearing, he would not comment on whether any \n     case had ever been wrongly decided, even cases that have been \n     overturned. He would not name any single judge he would want \n     to emulate on the bench in any way. He would not answer \n     written questions put to him that would help us learn more \n     about how he thinks about cases and how he would judge them. \n     He would not even try to convince the Justice Department to \n     turn over some of the memos he wrote for the Solicitor \n     General's Office, nor would he himself turn them over.\n       If this nominee is confirmed, we believe we would be \n     sending a signal that stonewalling the Judiciary Committee \n     and the full Senate is the way to succeed on the way to a \n     judgeship. That is the wrong signal and the wrong message.\n       In effect, we would be abdicating our constitutional role, \n     our constitutional duty to advise and consent to nominees, \n     because we would never again be able to learn enough about a \n     nominee to make reasoned decisions.\n       Nominees could become increasingly young, increasingly \n     ideological, and increasingly silent. The courts would soon \n     be packed with judges of unknown disposition, unknown \n     temperament, and unknown proclivities to judge fairly and \n     impartially.\n       We should take our constitutional duties more seriously \n     than that. We simply are determined not to let that happen.\n       I would like to read the concluding sentence from the \n     editorial in today's New York Times: 6\n       The White House can call this politics or obstruction. But \n     in fact it is Senators doing their jobs.\n       I yield the floor.\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the reason I am not going to give a \nstatement is because we have Members here on the Senate floor today who \ncould give a long statement on the misfortune of Miguel Estrada. But we \nhave been asked by the two leaders to try to get some votes lined up \nfor tomorrow. We have a manager of the bill who has been waiting. We \nhave a Senator from New York who has been waiting.\n  I just simply say before we go to the Senator from Ohio and the \nSenator from New York, who have amendments to offer, that we have \ndebated Miguel Estrada a lot. I don't know how many votes we have had--\n10 or 12--and not a single vote was changed.\n  We can debate this ad infinitum. The fact is, Miguel Estrada didn't \nrespond to questions that we thought appropriate and didn't divulge \ninformation in the form of memos from the Solicitor's Office. The \nreason he is different than some others who worked in that same office \nis because we got the full information.\n  For example, we reviewed Judge Roberts off and on for more than 10 \nyears. So he and Miguel Estrada are totally different.\n  The real victim in all of this is Miguel Estrada.

We will have stacked votes in the \nmorning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1561 to Amendment No. 1542\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I call up my amendment numbered 1561.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments will \nbe set aside and the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1561 to amendment No. 1542.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide funds to support graduate medical education \n                   programs in children's hospitals)\n\n       On page 61, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) In General.--To carry out programs to support \n     graduate medical education programs in children's hospitals \n     under section 340E of the Public Health Service Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 256e et seq.), there are appropriated a total of \n     $305,000,000, including amounts otherwise made available in \n     this Act for such programs.\n       (b) Offset.--Amounts appropriated under title III under the \n     heading ``Program Administration'' shall be reduced by \n     $15,000,000.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, this amendment would increase the amount \nof pediatric graduate medical education funding to $305 million--up \nfrom the $290 million currently in the bill.\n  I remind my colleagues that a sense-of-the-Senate amendment was \nattached to this year's budget resolution which indicated that \nchildren's graduate medical education should be funded at $305 million.\n\n[[Page S11101]]\n\n  This amendment would mirror the sense-of-the-Senate resolution which \nwe have already adopted. That is all it would do. But I believe it is \nimportant that we provide these additional dollars.\n  This funding for pediatric graduate medical education is truly a \nvital part of our efforts to protect children's health in this country.\n  To date, children's hospitals, though they represent only 1 percent \nof all hospitals in the country, train 30 percent of all pediatricians \nand 50 percent of all pediatric specialists. They also provide hospital \ncare to almost 50 percent of all seriously ill children in this \ncountry.\n  Furthermore, children's hospitals serve as the health care safety net \nfor low-income children in their respective communities and are often \nthe sole regional providers of many critical pediatric services.\n  These children's hospitals are often the only source of many \npediatric specialty services, and it is their graduate training \nprograms that make these services possible. Funding for pediatric \ngraduate medical education helps provide our Nation with highly \nqualified pediatricians, pediatricians who can properly treat and care \nfor our children when they are sick.\n  Clearly, funding for GME in children's hospitals is a sound \ninvestment in children's health and provides stability for the future \nof the pediatric workforce. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nproviding this additional $15 million in funding for graduate medical \neducation in children's hospitals.\n  Anyone who has had the occasion to take their child to a children's \nhospital, as I have, and to see the magical work these children's \nhospitals do, I think can appreciate the need for this amendment. To \nsee the specialists descend on your child when you are concerned about \nthat child's safety, maybe that child's life, is just something you \nreally cannot describe.\n  The children's hospitals will tell you that this graduate medical \neducation money has been a lifesaver for them. It is essential that we \nprovide this money through the appropriations process, frankly, because \nof a quirk in the law. It is a quirk in the law that we have to do it \nthrough the appropriations process because they do not automatically \nget the money through the entitlement process because, obviously, they \ndo not serve many Medicare patients. So it does not come to them \nautomatically, as it does all the other hospitals in the country. So \nevery year we have to go through this process.\n  I am simply asking that the funds be increased to $305 million. It is \nthe right thing to do. It is the proper thing to do. I ask my \ncolleagues to support this very simple amendment.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that this amendment be set \naside for the time being.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1560 To Amendment No. 1542\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I now call up amendment No. 1560.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1560 to amendment No. 1542.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To provide funds to support poison control centers)\n\n       On page 61, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) In General.--To provide funding for poison \n     control centers under the Poison Control Enhancement and \n     Awareness Act (42 U.S.C. 14801 et seq.), there are \n     appropriated a total of $27,600,000, including amounts \n     otherwise made available in this Act for such centers.\n       (b) Offset.--Amounts appropriated under title III under the \n     heading ``Program Administration'' for building alterations \n     and related expenses for relocation shall be reduced by \n     $5,300,000.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, the amendment I am now offering would \nfully fund poison control centers at $27.6 million. That is an increase \nof $5 million from what the bill currently funds at $22.3 million.\n  Members of the Senate, there are currently over 70 poison control \ncenters nationwide. These centers have fielded over 1 million phone \ncalls since January 2002, answering questions about poisonings, drug \nabuse, product contents, substance identification interactions, and \nadverse reactions. They can answer questions and concerns about what \nwould typically be called poison products--things such as cleaners, \nbleaches, anything you would find in your home, any emergency a family \nmight face. This is the most common poison exposure for children, \nchildren who typically ingest household products such as cosmetics and \npersonal care products, cleaning substances, pain relievers, foreign \nbodies, and plants.\n  Our Nation's poison control centers handle an average of one poison \ncall every 15 seconds. Clearly, these centers provide a vital service \nto the parents and family members.\n  The money we provide in this bill will go toward the continuation of \nthe centers' work, as well as the maintenance of the toll-free \nnationwide poison control hotline. That number, of course, is 1-800-\n222-1222. Let me repeat that: 1-800-222-1222. That is a number that \nanybody in this country now can call. Wherever you are, if you are on \nvacation, if you are in your own home, if you are visiting someone, you \ncan pick up the phone and call that number, and you will go onto a \npoison control hotline.\n  I have used it. My daughter has used it for her children. It is \nsomething that is so very valuable for a parent, anyone who has \nchildren. And certainly it is not just for somebody with children. It \nis for anybody who is in a position to be around someone who has \ningested something and they don't know what it is.\n  As anyone who has visited poison control centers can tell you, it is \nalso now particularly important in a day and age when we worry about \nterrorism. Poison control centers have a particular meaning for us \ntoday.\n  With the funding in the bill, and with the additional funding that \nwould be provided by my amendment, we are not just making an investment \nin poison control; rather, we are making it easier to keep our \nchildren, our friends, and ourselves safe and healthier.\n  I therefore urge my colleagues to support this very modest investment \nin our health. And I might say, the Federal Government is only a small \npartner in the poison control centers. When you go and visit the poison \ncontrol centers around the country, what you will find is that they are \nfunded many times by the local hospitals that pay for them themselves. \nThey are funded by State and local government units. The money we \nprovide is a small part of the overall money, but it is a very crucial \nand very important part of that contribution to keep these poison \ncontrol centers going.\n  This is a very modest amendment, but it is a very important \namendment. I urge my colleagues to support it when we do, in fact, vote \non the amendment.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that this amendment be set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1555 To Amendment No. 1542\n\n  Mr. DeWine. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 1555.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate concerning the Pediatric \n                          Research Initiative)\n\n       On page 61, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.

Madam President, further, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe amendment be modified on page 2, line 8, to include the Senate and \nHouse Appropriations Committees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 61, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.

Madam President, this amendment is a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment expressing the importance of pediatric research at NIH. \nSpecifically, this amendment says we should continue the work of the \nPediatric Research Initiative. This is an effort I worked on with \nseveral of my colleagues and was included in the Children's Public \nHealth Act of the year 2000.\n  This initiative helps ensure that more funds can be dedicated to \nchildren's health research within the National Institutes of Health.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I yield.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator from Ohio be willing to take a voice \nvote, at this point, accepting this amendment?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I would be more than happy to do that.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, without \nobjection, the amendment, as modified, is adopted.\n  The amendment (No. 1555), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my distinguished colleague from Ohio and I thank \nthe Chair.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1578 To Amendment No. 1542\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, at this point I call up amendment No. \n1578.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine], for himself, Mr. \n     Alexander, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. Voinovich, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1578 to amendment No. 1542.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide funding for the Underground Railroad Education and \n                           Cultural Program)\n\n       On page 74, line 1, strike ``$409,863,000, of which \n     $13,644,000'' and insert ``$406,863,000, of which \n     $10,644,000''.\n       On page 76, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. For necessary expenses for the Underground \n     Railroad Education and Cultural Program, there are \n     appropriated $3,000,000.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, the amendment I offer now, along with \nSenators Alexander, Stabenow, Grassley, and Voinovich, will provide $3 \nmillion in funding for the Underground Railroad Education and Cultural \nAct, a 1998 law that Senator Collins and I wrote together. The \nUnderground Railroad Education and Cultural Act was designed to assist \nin establishing programs to research, display, interpret, and collect \nartifacts and other items relating to the history of the underground \nrailroad. The bill before us now has unfortunately zero-funded this \nprogram. I believe we must correct that.\n  Our amendment would provide $3 million for this program. As my \ncolleagues know, the history of the underground railroad is a vital \npart of the history of our great country. In the 20 years or so prior \nto the Civil War, it is estimated--of course, no one will ever know \nwhat the true figure is--that more than 40,000 slaves used this \nunderground railroad, as we refer to it, as a pathway to their ultimate \nfreedom. It is a great story in the history of our country. It is a \ngreat story every schoolchild in America should know about.\n  More than 150 underground railroad sites have been identified in my \nState of Ohio alone. But Ohio is not unique. All the States that border \nalong the Ohio River and were actually considered to be border States \nhave sites on the underground railroad. There were people all along on \nboth sides who helped slaves escape. African Americans helped slaves \nescape. White Americans helped slaves escape. There were so many \nheroes.\n  Their stories need to be told. There are many more other sites out \nthere that frankly need to be identified, and their stories need to be \ntold as well. These sites symbolize freedom for thousands and thousands \nof enslaved Americans. When I visit these sites, as I have with my \nfamily--in fact, I had the opportunity this August during our recess to \nvisit several of them--it makes me pause and think about the sacrifice \nthat was made by so many people. It reminds us of the history of this \ncountry. It reminds us of the horror of slavery, a part of our history \nthat simply has to be told. But it also reminds us of the good part of \nthat history; that is, the sacrifice made by so many people so others \ncould be free.\n  This program is very important. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupport of this funding request. This funding request will enable this \nstory to be told and told in a better way.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent at this point that the \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      International HIV Initiative\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I will at some point, as I indicated \nthis morning, be coming to the floor and offering an amendment \nconcerning President Bush's International Mother and Child Prevention \nof HIV initiative. As I indicated this morning, unfortunately the bill \nbefore us does fall short by $60 million what the President requested.\n\n[[Page S11103]]\n\nThe President requested $150 million in regard to the amount of money \nto be provided for this initiative. I will be talking about this later \nand will be offering an amendment concerning it. This is the most cost-\neffective way to save lives.\n  A number of my colleagues went with Senator Bill Frist to Africa. We \nreturned just last week. We saw firsthand the good this program is \nalready doing. For as little as $3, a pregnant woman can be given the \nhelp, the drugs she needs to ensure that her child will not be born HIV \npositive.\n  The statistics are staggering. For a mother who is HIV positive, the \nodds are approximately 30 percent that she, untreated, will give birth \nto a child who will be HIV positive. We all know what that means, what \nhorrible tragedy that is. In countries we visited such as Namibia and \nSouth Africa, there are now ongoing programs. Many of them, because of \nthe initiative of President Bush and this Congress, are good people \nworking, reaching out to these pregnant mothers who are HIV positive. \nThey have reduced that percentage now down to 5 or 10 percent. If that \nmother can be given a drug prior to the birth of that child--as I said, \nit now costs as little as $2, $3, maybe $4--we can reduce the odds from \n30 percent to giving birth to a child who is HIV positive down to as \nlittle as 10 percent and possibly as low as 5 percent.\n  That is why it is so very important that we restore the funding in \nthis bill to the $150 million requested by President Bush. I will be \ncoming to the floor later on as we debate this bill and offering an \namendment to restore the funding to the level President Bush requested. \nI will be back on the floor later on to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I commend and thank my colleague from \nOhio who is always looking out for the children. This has been a \nmission of his, year in and year out. I thank him for the amendments he \nhas just discussed because every one of them concerns the well-being of \nour children. I look forward to supporting these amendments. I \nparticularly thank the Senator for amendment 1561 to restore the money \nfor pediatric graduate medical education.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1565 To Amendment No. 1542\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment \n1565 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mrs. Clinton] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1565 to amendment No. 1542.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, this amendment is intended to provide \nthe money that is needed to ensure that at the Federal, State, and \nlocal levels, we have an adequate bioterrorism workforce. In order to \ndo that, we have to fund the pipeline.\n  This summer the Partnership for Public Service issued a report \nstating that 50 percent of our experts trained to respond to a \nbiological or chemical attack will retire over the next 5 years. That \nputs our country and our public health at risk.\n  Obviously, every one of us in this body is committed to making our \ncountry safer and providing the bioterrorism funding we have fought for \nsince 9/11. And I appreciate the great support the Senate has given to \nincreasing dollars to combat the threat of bioterrorism. But, \nunfortunately, our frontline defenders, who are our health \nprofessionals, are decreasing in number when we need them more than \never.\n\n  According to the Office of Personnel Management, more than 2,600 \npublic health professionals in the Federal Government are eligible to \nretire in 2008, and that number could soar to more than 8,000 in just \nthe next few years.\n  Unfortunately, the shortage in personnel is not just Federal. It is \nalready being felt at the State and county levels. In county after \ncounty in the public health departments, I have been given reports that \nso many of the staff members are being stretched thin and they are \nunable to do the work that is required. If we don't find ways to \nprovide the resources to attract and pay for these professionals, we \nare going to be in a terrible dilemma not only if a horrible event or \nsome kind of biological or chemical attack were to occur, but even with \nthe outbreak of something like SARS, or something unpredictable that we \nmay have never encountered before.\n  The Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act that we passed in 2002 \ndoes help with workforce training, recruitment and development. But \nwith respect to what has occurred since 2002, we already know we have \nhad increased demands on our public health system, and we have \ninsufficient resources to expand personnel or, as these recent reports \nI have referenced indicate, keep pace at current levels.\n  The CDC and other agencies need to do strategic planning. My \namendment includes $5 million to fund an annual needs assessment, with \na report to Congress, of Federal, State, and local bioterrorism \npersonnel, conducted by the Institute of Medicine or another competent \nand independent authority.\n  But even while we are looking longer term, we have immediate public \nhealth needs right now. I know that, for example, in New York, two \nCenters for Public Health Preparedness are located at SUNY Albany and \nColumbia University. They have already trained 10,000 people each year \nin bioterrorism preparedness. Many regions don't have these centers of \nexcellence, and we have to figure out how we can get the resources and \npersonnel to every part of our country.\n  According to the Association of Schools of Public Health Preparedness \nand Prevention, the 19 nationwide Centers of Public Health Preparedness \nhave asked the administration for $50 million--nearly double what the \nPresident's budget proposes. I think we should meet those requests, and \nmy amendment would provide the funds to do that.\n  My amendment also provides funds, in accordance with the \nrecommendation of CDC's own National Advisory Committee on Children and \nTerrorism, to double the number of outbreak specialists in the Epidemic \nIntelligence Service. These EIS specialists are dispatched to respond \nto epidemics and bioterrorism.\n  The resident expertise that we need in State and local public health \ndepartments is also crucial. My amendment would provide $25 million to \nthe Epidemiology Program Office, the National Center for Infectious \nDiseases, and the Public Health Practice Program Office of the CDC to \nrecruit and train 1,600 epidemiologists, 800 laboratory personnel, 800 \npublic health nurses, and 800 other public health professionals to work \nin State and local public health departments nationwide.\n\n  The Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists estimates that \nState and local public health departments need to hire 1,600 \nepidemiologists over the next 10 years to prevent worsening shortages \nof State and local epidemiologists. It costs about $60,000 to train a \npublic health professional. This proposal would spread that investment \nover 10 years.\n  Finally, the amendment also provides $20 million for carrying out \nsections 765 through 769 of the Public\n\n[[Page S11104]]\n\nHealth Service Act to title VII to encourage personnel to enter \nepidemiology and bioterrorism detection careers.\n  Title VII has been decimated each of the last 3 years. It has been a \nstruggle to keep it even flat-funded from year to year. Unfortunately, \nthe pipeline for epidemiologists and bioterrorism experts has suffered \nas a result.\n  I hope to be able to work this out without the manager of the bill. I \nunderstand completely the many competing considerations he has to \nbalance, but it is imperative that we start to meet these needs. If we \npass this amendment today and get the money in the pipeline, we can \nbegin to train and hire the doctors, nurses, and other public health \nprofessionals who are going to be necessary for us to deal with \nwhatever we face in the future.\n  Unfortunately, terrorists or epidemics like SARS don't wait while the \nretirement notices are stacking up. I don't think we should either. \nThis $93 million would be money well spent that would make us better \nprepared to deal with the incredible challenges that we confront as we \ntry to ensure that our vigilance and our concern is matched by the \nexpertise we need to actually deal with any problem that we may \nconfront.\n  Madam President, I ask that this amendment be supported, but I ask, \ntoo, that we look for a way to deal with this pipeline problem that is \nso critical to actually putting teeth into the preparedness that we \nhave passed in this body and funded since September 11.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, there is no doubt of the tremendous \nneed for preparation for bioterrorism. During the recess month, I spent \nmost of it traveling through my State visiting first responders--\nessentially fire departments, in conjunction with police departments \nand other county organizations that are being set up for response to \npotential bioterrorist attacks.\n  When 9/11 struck, obviously, the U.S. was totally unprepared. I think \nthe ranking member will recall that we had to have the hearing in the \nbowels of this building because we were kicked out of the other hearing \nrooms. We brought in the Centers for Disease Control and insisted that \nthey give us an itemization of the various types of biological attack, \nwhat resources were currently available, and what additional resources \nwe would need.\n  We had a very tough time getting information from the Centers for \nDisease Control by the time they went through the alphabet soup. They \nhad to get permission from HHS, and then Health and Human Services had \nto get permission from the Office of Management and Budget. Finally, we \ngot the information informally. We could not get it formally. We got it \ninformally.\n  I have just been handed talking points and information and facts by \nmy staff. The way the Senate functions is that these amendments come \nwithout any significant advanced notice. The Senator from New York was \nhalfway through her argument before I got a copy of her amendment. I \nchallenge anybody to read the amendment and follow it.\n  Well, people can't hear me on C-SPAN because my microphone wasn't on.\n  The point was that we did get a supplemental appropriations bill for \napproximately $3 billion. We had quite an extended discussion in the \nliving quarters of the White House--something I probably ought not to \ntalk about. But the President invited a group of us over and we got \ninto a long discussion. There were those in the administration, \naccording to an article published a day after Thanksgiving, that wanted \nto put it in next year's budget. They wanted to wait until 2002 to put \nit in 2003.\n  Talking directly to the President, a number of us prevailed and put \n$3 billion into the budget at that time.\n  We now have a very extensive itemization of funding. The CDC has $940 \nmillion for State and local preparedness. Upgrading CDC capacity: \n$143,700,000. Pharmaceutical stockpile: $300 million. Smallpox \nvaccine--and it goes down to a full page. I ask unanimous consent that \nlist be printed in the Record so I need not read it all.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  FY03                      Transfers       FY

Bioterrorism--PHSSEF.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, then the Department of Homeland \nSecurity bill was passed by this body with some $29 million, which \ncovers a great deal more funding.\n  I appreciate the initiative taken by the Senator from New York and \nher diligence in coming up with this\n\n[[Page S11105]]\n\namendment in an area which, beyond any question, is of overwhelming \nimportance, critical importance. I, frankly, do not know how to \nevaluate her request for $93 million additional in the context of all \nof the programs which are in existence.\n  I think it is fair to state, and I think the Senator from New York \nhas an abundance of experience in the executive branch, that the \nexecutive branch has better planning capabilities in integrating these \nitems in the overall program. Not that the $93 million might not be \nwell placed, well positioned and critical. It might be, I just cannot \nsay. But I do know there has been extensive consideration by the \nexecutive branch, and I also know that the $93 million is not within \nthe 302(b) allocation.\n  I come back to this again and again on items which I concede are \nimportant, but we do not have the funds within the budget resolution \nand within the allocation.\n  I know the Senator from New York will not be surprised that there \nwill be opposition to it. We will raise a point of order. But I do \nthink the amendment serves a very useful function in identifying what \nthe Senator from New York thinks are critical points that ought to be \nfunded.\n  I commit this to the Senator from New York--to have a hearing on the \nsubject and to include the precise items which she has raised so that \nwe will take them into account in our funding stream as we move into \nthe next fiscal year.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, will the Senator from Pennsylvania \nyield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I wish to express my appreciation to \nthe chairman for that offer. Perhaps even before the bill is totally \nwrapped up we could take a look at some of those categories of funding \nbecause what I am concerned about, as the Senator rightly referenced, \nis in all of the funding categories, these requests I have put in this \namendment are coming from constituent agencies, such as CDC, that at \nleast believe at this point in time that the money available for \nbioterrorism has not been sufficiently targeted to this personnel \nissue.\n  I appreciate not only the kind offer of a hearing, because I think \nthis is an issue that is going to go on for quite some time--it is not \ngoing to be resolved one way or another even if this amendment were \nsuccessful--but also perhaps in the next several days if our staffs can \nlook to see if there is a better opportunity to better target some of \nthis funding to deal with this pipeline professional problem that is \nnot only at the Federal Government level, but State and local as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I would be delighted to follow the \nsuggestion made by the Senator from New York to take a look at them \nregardless of the outcome of the vote. It may be that the executive \nbranch can learn from what the Senator from New York has found on her \ninquiries and can redirect some of the existing funds, or it is \npossible we could find some accommodation to this in the course of the \nconference.\n  We will look very closely at the suggestions which the Senator from \nNew York has made and see if we can find a way to accommodate them.\n\n\n                  Amendment Nos. 1561, 1560, and 1578\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I wish to turn for a few moments to the \namendments offered by the Senator from Ohio. I did not take time to \nrespond before the Senator from New York offered her amendment. She was \nvery patient in waiting while the Senator from Ohio went through quite \na long list of his amendments.\n  He has offered three amendments which are well directed and I think \nmeritorious when he talks about the historical impact of the \nunderground railroad. That is a matter of importance in education and \nit comes right into Pennsylvania where currently the development \nproject in Lancaster has found remnants of the underground railroad. \nThe House of Representatives has put in $2.235 million.\n  When the Senator from Ohio talks about poison control centers for $5 \nmillion, again he is on a good point. And when he talks about graduate \nmedical education, he is not bringing it up to last year's level, he is \nadding money. This is an item which this Senator spent a lot of time \non, as did Senator Harkin. There was no funding for this in 1999, and \nin the year 2000, to start, it was slightly under $40 million, and then \nwhen I chaired the subcommittee, with the concurrence of Senator \nHarkin, we made an enormous increase to $234 million for fiscal year \n2001.\n  We then added $50 million in 2002 to $284 million, and it was at $290 \nmillion in 2003. The administration made a request for slightly under \n$200 million, and in a tough way we found $90 million more.\n  When you take them out of administration, there are going to be a lot \nof people unemployed, and I do not know that we can direct that \nunemployment solely to Ohio--I wish the Senator from Ohio were here--if \nit would be possible to target that unemployment to the Senator's \nState. But if you take out $22 million from administration--that is a \nnice fat target to say take it out from administration. But there are \nvery substantial impacts when that money is taken out.\n  I am going to confer with the Secretary of the Department of \nEducation to see exactly what will happen, how many people will be \naffected, specifying perhaps how many people from Ohio will be \naffected.\n  When the Senator from Ohio wants to add $60 million to the mother-to-\nchild transmission, I think that is a very important item, but the fact \nis we now have a grand total in the Labor-HHS bill directed toward AIDS \nin excess of $14 billion. When the statement is made we are just going \nto bring it back up to the President's request, in fiscal year 2003, \nthis was a $40 million item. The President asked for $150 million for \nthis year, and we found $90 million to accommodate.\n  Bear in mind that we do this in a context where the administration \nhas come in on many items far under what they were last year. For \nexample, graduate medical education, to which the Senator from Ohio \nwants to add $15 million, we added $90 million over what the President \nrequested. So perhaps the Senator from Ohio would like us to go back to \nthe President's request on graduate medical education, and we would \nhave ample money to put in $60 million more to bring it up to the \nPresident's request on the mother-to-child transmission.\n  I say that only by way of demonstrating that it is just not so easy \nto come up to the President's request on a given item when many times \nthe President's request was far under what we are at the present time. \nThe idea of level funding is very important in the appropriations \nprocess so you do not make drastic changes. People can live with what \nthey got last year without accounting for inflation, but if you want to \ndrop, as the President's budget did on graduate medical education, from \n$290 million to $199 million, that is going to be very tough to absorb. \nWe took that into account.\n  The Constitution places the appropriations process in the Congress. \nThat is something which is frequently overlooked.\n  The President obviously has an important role because he has to sign \nthe bill, or we have to pass them without his signature, if we can do \nthat.\n  This bill is very carefully crafted. Perhaps it is easy to see that I \nhave to oppose the amendments by the Senator from Ohio. Perhaps there \ncan be some accommodation to some of the smaller amounts but that, too, \nis difficult. Although the Senator from Wisconsin said a million \ndollars was not very much money, quoting Everett Dirksen, a million \nhere and million there--maybe Everett Dirksen said a billion here or a \nbillion there, but if for Dirksen it was a billion here and a billion \nthere, then make it Arlen Specter, a million here and a million there, \nit all adds up.\n  I yield to my colleague from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my chairman, friend and able leader on this \nappropriations bill. I think we all wish we had a little bit more \n302(b) allocation but that is for another time and place.\n  Earlier today I spoke about offering an amendment that would \nbasically prohibit the administration from moving ahead on implementing \na proposed rule that would basically undermine and do away with the 40-\nhour workweek that we have had in the Fair\n\n[[Page S11106]]\n\nLabor Standards Act since 1938. Earlier this spring, the administration \nproposed some rule changes. Not one hearing was held on it.\n  As we looked through these proposed rules this summer and dug into \nthem, it would drastically undermine the ability of working families, \nworking men and women in America, to get justly compensated for \novertime work in the future.\n  I was talking to one of my colleagues today about this, and he said \nto me, I have not really had a big clamor in my State for these \nchanges. I got to thinking about it. I got to thinking I really have \nnot had anybody in the past year or 2 years ago, or earlier this year--\nI have seen no real groundswell or anything about the fact that these \nrules as they exist now need to be changed. I do not know where this \ncomes from. All of a sudden they are proposing this massive change in \nthe way people's work is defined in this country and whether they are \nexempted from overtime pay or not.\n  So I have an amendment that I drafted that basically is just very \nsimple. It says:\n\n       None of the funds provided under this Act shall be used to \n     promulgate or implement any regulation that exempts from the \n     requirements of section 7 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of \n     1938 (29 U.S.C. 207) any employee who is not otherwise \n     exempted pursuant to regulations under section 13 of such \n     act (29 U.S.C. 213) that were in effect as of September 3, \n     2003.\n\n  So this is an amendment that I will be laying down sometime tomorrow. \nI mention again that this proposed rule change could affect up to 8 \nmillion workers, but the first wave of people that will be affected by \nthis rule change will be women who are working in salaried positions \nthat today would be paid overtime if they worked more than 40 hours a \nweek. These would be women who work as bookkeepers, accountants, \nsecretaries, nurses, nurse's aides, a whole host of different \noccupations. I say women because the way that theworkforce is \nstructured, where the salary level is, they will fall in that lower \nspectrum of salary level where it will be above the minimum but it will \nbe in the range where they will now be exempted from overtime work. \nThat will be the first wave. That is just the first people who would be \naffected by it.\n  After that, there would be many other people affected by it--police \nofficers, firefighters, first responders, and others.\n  There is no carve-out in the proposed rules and regulations for \npolice, firefighters, and emergency personnel. They are thrown in with \neverybody else. So somehow I keep hearing this kind of a rumor or \nstatement that keeps floating around that, oh, police officers will not \nbe affected.\n  Well, would someone show me in the proposed rules where it says that \npolice officers will not be affected? It is nowhere in there. So I do \nnot know what they are talking about. They are thrown in with everybody \nelse.\n  Again, I do not want to take too much more time. I will lay down the \namendment tomorrow morning at the appropriate time. For the life of me, \nthough, I cannot understand why the administration is proposing this \ndrastic change when there has been no big groundswell for the change.\n  I have heard some people in this room say we have to change it \nbecause it has not been changed since 1938. That is nonsense. We have \nchanged the Fair Labor Standards Act several times since 1938. In fact, \na number of times this has been changed without taking away overtime \nfor people in our country. So to say it has not been changed since 1938 \nis simply erroneous. A number of times we have addressed ourselves to \nnew types of work, new definitions, new people in the workforce, by \nchanging some of the definitions. In every case in which these \ndefinitions were changed they were changed to make it easier, to \ninclude more people in the overtime provisions, not to exclude people.\n  For example, the Department of Labor revised the overtime regulations \nin 1940, 1949, 1954, 1958, 1959, 1961, 1963, 1967, 1970, 1973, 1975, \nand 1981. In not one of those instances was the framework narrowed to \nexclude more people from overtime protections. These changes were made \nbasically to enlarge, enhance, and to better define who was covered, \nand that is why it never really invoked much debate or consternation \nbecause we recognized that we wanted to protect people for overtime \npay.\n  The minimum salary threshold has been raised seven times since 1938. \nSo to say that somehow we have never touched this since 1938 is \nabsolutely wrong. What is correct is that since 1938 we have not \ncircumscribed, we have not narrowed, the definitional framework to \nexclude more people from overtime pay.\n  That is what these proposed regulations would do, and that is why the \nSenate has to speak strongly, I hope next week sometime, in supporting \nthis amendment that would basically prohibit them from moving ahead \nwith this kind of a regulation.\n  I would point out that the House of Representatives narrowly defeated \nthis 213 to 210, with a number of Republicans supporting not allowing \nthe administration to proceed with these changes in rules. So, again, I \nhope next week we can have a further debate. I intend either tomorrow \nor Monday to again point out the people who are going to be affected, \nwhat it means for their families and their income. What it basically \nmeans is that we are going to have people working longer hours but they \nare not going to be compensated for it.\n  As I said, many of them are women who are now paying for childcare. \nWell, now they have to pay to keep their children in daycare maybe \nlonger but they do not get any extra pay for that.\n  So that is why this proposed change in rules and regulations is one \nthat we have to say no to. We have to make sure we continue to protect \nand enhance the 40-hour workweek and make sure people who work over 40 \nhours, if they want to work over 40 hours or if they are compelled to \nwork over 40 hours, are justly compensated with it for time and a half \nover 40 hours.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I plan to offer an amendment to the \nfiscal year 2004 Labor-HHS appropriations bill that seeks to offer \nStates an alternative Medicaid FMAP formula while allowing States to \nremain in the current formula structure if they choose. This amendment \nis vital to providing some relief to States who have been shortchanged \nby hundreds of millions of dollars under the current FMAP formula for \nthe cost of providing Medicaid services. The amendment will not \npenalize any State who wishes to remain under the current formula. It \nsimply allows States to opt into a new formula that better reflects \nStates' need. This new FMAP is only for Medicaid expenditures in excess \nof fiscal year 2003 Medicaid expenditure levels.\n  For States who opt to go with the new formula, per capita income is \nreplaced with a ratio of the most recent 3-year averages of total \ntaxable resources, TTR, as determined by the U.S. Department of the \nTreasury, and persons below the poverty level. The multiplier is also \nlowered from 0.45, used in the current FMAP formula, to 0.40. For the \nperiod 2004-2013, the new formula has a maximum increase of one \npercentage point per fiscal year above the current FMAP formula for the \nprior year. Once a State opts to go with the new formula, they will not \nbe able to switch back to the current FMAP formula. However, they will \nbe held harmless at the FMAP rate they would have gotten under the \ncurrent formula, prior to the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation \nAct of 2003, for the current year. States opting for the new formula \nwill have Medicaid expenditures, up to the fiscal 2003 levels, matched \nat the current FMAP formula and with expenditures above the fiscal 2003 \nlevels matched at the new formula FMAP.\n  In a study released in July 2003, GAO found that the formula used to \ncalculate the portion of each State's Medicaid expenditures that the \nFederal Government will pay--the FMAP--often widens the gap between \nindividual States and the national average. Under the current formula, \n21 States move farther from the average State's funding ability after \nthe Federal match is added. In fact, 4 of the 21 States--California, \nFlorida, Hawaii, and New York--have below-average funding ability \nbefore Federal matching is added and move farther below the average \nafter Federal matching aid is added.\n  Since Medicaid was enacted in 1965, the Federal match rate has been \ndetermined by a State's per capital income. In its study, GAO found \nthat per capita\n\n[[Page S11107]]\n\nincome is a poor proxy for determining both State resources and the \nlow-income population. The Feinstein amendment will give States the \noption to choose a formula that is based on a combination of the \nState's total taxable resources and population below the poverty level.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/04/senate-section/article/S11107-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11107-S11109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             MIGUEL ESTRADA\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, it is a sad day for the Senate today. \nMiguel Estrada, after having been nominated by the President to the \nCourt of Appeals of the DC Circuit, after having waited 28 months, \nalmost 2\\1/2\\ years, felt it imperative that he get on about his \nprivate business, his law practice. He has asked the President to \nwithdraw his name. It is with great sadness that occurred.\n  For many in this body, Miguel Estrada is one of the finest nominees \nto come before this Senate. The American Bar Association evaluated him. \nThis is certainly no rightwing group. They evaluated him and \nunanimously concluded he was well qualified for the Court of Appeals. \nIndeed, he is.\n  The sad thing about it was the ground rules of Senate confirmation \nhave been changed. Miguel Estrada was a victim of a sustained \nfilibuster. It was for the first time in history that a sustained \nfilibuster had defeated a circuit or district court judge. He was the \nfirst one subjected to a filibuster in this Congress. He is the first \none to be forced to withdraw because he has to get on with his life. \nAnd he had 55 votes in the Senate for an up-or-down vote and a like \nnumber, I am sure, for confirmation.\n  For the first time, 45 Senators have blocked and defeated a nominee. \nThis is an unprecedented change in our Senate policy. It is something \nthat is not good for this Senate. It has diminished the independence of \nthe judiciary. It has diminished the power of the executive branch to \nnominate and it has harmed the Senate when we change the historical \nrule from 50 votes to 60 votes for a confirmation. It is not good \npublic policy.\n  I ask why it is that this Senate, for all these years since the \nfounding of this Republic, has not had a filibuster for one of these \nnominees? The reason is pretty clear. The Senators believe the \nConstitution suggests confirmation should be by majority vote. For \nexample, the Constitution says the Senate shall advise and consent on \ntreaties provided two-thirds agree and shall advise and consent on \ncertain nominees, including judges. From that implication it is clear \nthat two-thirds were required for advice and consent on treaties but \nonly a majority for the judicial nominees. That is what we have done \nuntil this year. This plan to block nominees was designed after \nPresident Bush was elected and the Democrat Senators had a retreat with \na number of liberal law professors, including Lawrence Tribe, Cass \nSunstein, Marcia Greenberg. These liberal professors they talked of \nchanging the ground rules for confirmation and Democrat Senators \ndecided to change the historic rules of this Senate and block more \nnominees.\n  Of course, President Bush nominated nine judicial candidates when he \ntook office. Two were Democrats. One was a renomination of a Clinton \nnominee, a Democrat, and the renominated Clinton nominee was promptly \nconfirmed. Nine out of the 11 sat. The Democrats had the majority in \nthe Senate and they refused to bring those candidates up for hearing in \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  Finally, when the election occurred and one of the issues in the \nelection was the obstructionism in the Senate by the Democratic \nmajority and a new majority was constituted with the Republicans in the \nmajority, they moved some of these nominees forward. Estrada was moved \nout of committee, Priscilla Owen and others were moved forward. We then \nfound ourselves facing for the first time in history a filibuster of \nMiguel Estrada.\n  Let me mention some things about this extraordinary nominee. He was \nborn in Honduras and came here as a teenager. He struggled with \nthe language. He was able to get himself into Columbia University where \nhe finished and graduated with honors. He then went to Harvard Law \nSchool where he was an editor of the Harvard Law Review, one of the \nhighest honors for any graduating law senior. He then clerked for the \nCourt of Appeals, the same level court he was nominated to. He served \nas a law clerk to a Court of Appeals judge in New York, as I recall, \nand then clerked for the Supreme Court. Very few lawyers ever get \nselected to clerk for a Justice of the United States Supreme Court. \nWhat a great honor. He was selected by Justice Anthony Kennedy, one of \nthe moderate swing justices in the Supreme Court, as he is viewed.\n\n  After that, he took a position with the Department of Justice and he \nwas in the Solicitor General's Office of the Department of Justice. The \nSolicitor General's Office is where the Department of Justice has the \ntop appellate lawyers arguing the position of the United States of \nAmerica in circuit courts and in the United States Supreme Court. What \na great position. Most lawyers say the Solicitor General of the United \nStates is the greatest lawyer position in the world. Every day you go \nto court and represent the United States of America in the highest \ncourt in the land.\n  Miguel Estrada was there for 6 years. Every year he was there he got \nthe highest possible rating the Department of Justice evaluators give \nto an employee. This is particularly important to note. In 5 of the 6 \nyears he was in the Solicitor General's Office, it was in the Clinton \nDepartment of Justice. He served by far the great majority of his time \nin the Clinton Department of Justice and was given each year the \nhighest possible ratings. Since then, he has been highly successful in \nlaw practice. He has argued as many as 10 or 15 cases before the \nSupreme Court. Most lawyers in America will never argue a case before \nthe United States Court of Appeals, much less have 15 cases before the \nSupreme Court. He was selected for those arguments because he was known \nto be an extraordinarily skilled appellate lawyer.\n  I saw his testimony. He was open and candid and brilliant in his \nanswers. I remember one Senator tried to pin him down and said, you are \na strict constructionist, aren't you? Mr. Estrada said, I am not sure I \nwould call myself that. And he said, the President wants to nominate \nstrict constructionists and President Bush has nominated you so you \nmust be one. First, he said, the President didn't say anything to me \nabout that, but I would call myself a fair constructionist. I believe \nwe ought to fairly construe the law as it comes before us. I don't use \nthe word strict constructionist. He was open and candid with the people \nasking questions.\n  Then there was constructed an event and a circumstance that put Mr. \nEstrada in a bad light. It was deliberate and premeditated and \ncalculated, in my view. The Democrat said, well, you served on the \nstaff of the Solicitor General and you wrote all kinds of memoranda \nthat were relevant to important issues before America. We demand you \nproduce every memoranda you wrote while you were in the Solicitor \nGeneral's Office. And he answered this exactly correctly, but I am not \nsure the American people and the press and those who asked questions \npaid attention to his answer. His answer was, Senator, those are not my \npapers. I was a lawyer in a law firm of the Department of Justice. The \npapers I prepared belong to the Department of Justice. I do not have \nthe power to reveal to the public such private, legal memorandum from \nmy client, the United States of America.\n  So the question was, then, well, let's have the Department of Justice \nproduce them. And the Department of Justice was absolutely correct in \nsaying unequivocally, no, we are not going to produce those \ndocuments. The reason is that those are confidential, internal \nmemoranda of the U.S. Government involving litigation in cases in the \nUnited States.\n\n  In fact, it outraged former Solicitors General of the United States \nof both parties. All four former Solicitors General of the United \nStates who had served under Democrat administrations wrote a letter \nthat the Department of Justice should not reveal those memoranda, that \nit was work product and would chill free debate by young lawyers who \nwere asked to submit written memoranda. And every other Solicitor \nGeneral I know of, who is alive, Republican and Democrat,\n\n[[Page S11108]]\n\nagreed that the Department of Justice should not produce them.\n  So now we have this viewed as Mr. Estrada wasn't open with the \ncommittee because he wouldn't produce all these documents. How bogus \ncan that be? That is really unfortunate, that Members of this Senate \nwould actually suggest that Mr. Estrada somehow has the authority and \nshould, even if he did have the authority, produce and turn over to the \npublic documents that remain part of the work product of the Department \nof Justice. It would be unethical for him to do so. He should not do \nso.\n  So that is how we got into this, I suppose. But surely that is not a \nbasis to turn down a nominee of this extraordinary ability. Why would \nthey pick on him? Why would they construct this idea that he is somehow \nunqualified? It really baffles me. It is a matter I find difficult to \nfathom.\n  But I would just share a few things that strike me. Yes, he was a \nHispanic. Does that mean Democratic Members of this body are prejudiced \nagainst Hispanics? I hope not. I would never accuse them of that and \ndon't believe that is so. What I do believe is that President Bush had \nmade clear that he would like to give Hispanics an opportunity to be \njudges and he would like to see a Hispanic on the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States. He made that clear. Everybody knows he would like to see \nthat occur, if possible.\n  Here we were, 2\\1/2\\ years ago, nominating one of the most brilliant \nHispanic lawyers, one of the most brilliant lawyers in America of any \nbackground, Miguel Estrada. He was nominated, and had he been confirmed \nback then as he should have been according to the American Bar \nAssociation, rating him unanimously well qualified, their highest \nqualifications, well qualified; he would had already had 2\\1/2\\ years \nof experience writing opinions, proving his skill and ability. At that \npoint, I submit, he would clearly be one of the preeminent nominees \nunder consideration for appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court. This is \nthe quality of this man.\n  So, he has been denied an opportunity to achieve a prestigious \nappointment to the court of appeals, and that has in fact denied him \nthe opportunity to again prove his excellent integrity, legal skill, \nand ability on that bench. And, who knows, maybe that is why some of \nthose thought he would be a perfect nominee for the bench and they \nwould just block him now. If that is so, that is wrong and should not \nhave occurred. I am very frustrated about it.\n  I would also, just one more time, note that he had a majority of the \nMembers of this Senate prepared to vote to confirm him--55 votes he \nhad. Prior to this year, throughout the history of this country, that \nwould have confirmed him easily to this position. So it was by a \nfilibuster. We voted cloture I think six, seven, eight times to try to \nget him up for an up-or-down vote, blocked each time by the procedural \ntechnique of a filibuster that was never before used on a circuit judge \nin the history of this country. It is just really sad that that has \noccurred.\n\n  Let me just say this finally. President Bush wants judges on the \nbench who follow the law. He wants judges on the bench who care about \nthe law, who believe they are not postmodernist relativists. He \nbelieves we have judges who can read words and give those words plain \nmeaning and follow those words. That is what a judge should do. A judge \nis not empowered to make law. A judge is not empowered to impose their \npolitical views or to set public policy. That is not what a judge does. \nA judge rules on the law.\n  Make no mistake, a Federal judge is a lifetime appointment. They are \nnot able to be voted out of office, as we can if we pass a bad law. We \ncan be voted out of office. We are subject to the will of the public. \nBut a judge is not. So what we want in a judge is one who follows the \nlaw and has the history and the discipline to show that he or she will \nfollow the law. Miguel Estrada has that. In fact, that is his guiding \nlegal philosophy, that a judge should show restraint, should follow the \nlaw and do the right thing, whether they agree with it or not. That is \nwhat we need.\n  Now we have judges who have declared the California three strikes law \nunconstitutional. They have been in effect for 20 years and no doubt \nare a major factor in the plummeting of crime rates in California and \nother States that had those laws. They are helping to reduce crime \nthere. So we have Federal judges saying that is unconstitutional.\n  We have a Federal judge in the Ninth Circuit saying the Pledge of \nAllegiance is unconstitutional.\n  We have Federal judges just recently overturning 170 death penalty \nmatters after juries and judges and appellate courts have ruled on \nthem. They just blithely come in and say: We don't like the way you do \nthis now, and we are just going to wipe out those death penalty \ndecisions.\n  We have bizarre verdicts on litigation. Everybody knows about the \ncoffee case and other things.\n  We are having hearings now on asbestos. The litigation over asbestos \nhas gotten completely out of hand. What is occurring there is one of \nthe saddest eras in legal history, in my view. Only 40 percent of the \nmoney paid out by the asbestos companies is getting to the victims. \nWhat a horrible stain on the legal system in America. We cannot defend \nthat. These kinds of things impact the American economy. They drive up \nthe cost of insurance. They drive up the cost of doing business. No \nnation in the world has the legal costs on their economy that this \ncountry has.\n  So we need judges with common sense. We need judges who will follow \nthe law. We need judges who show fidelity to the rule of law. That is \nwhat President Bush wants. That is what Miguel Estrada is. That is what \nhe has committed his life to. And that is why they don't like him. It \nwill mess up the game where people want the courts to do for them what \nthey cannot win at the ballot box with elected representatives.\n  Now we have Priscilla Owen, also under filibuster. She made the \nhighest possible score on the Texas bar exam, was one of the greatest \nlawyers in Texas, was elected this last time to the Texas Supreme Court \nwith 87 percent of the vote, and is serving her second term, endorsed \nby every major newspaper in the State of Texas. She was rated \nunanimously well qualified by the American Bar Association. And they \nare filibustering her?\n  I will tell you something else. Priscilla Owen is quite capable of \nserving on the U.S. Supreme Court. Is that why they are picking on her? \nAnd Bill Pryor, the attorney general of Alabama, whom I know and have \nseen operate, one of the finest, most brilliant people I have known. I \nhave never met a person who has more commitment to the rule of law, \ndoing the right thing, evaluating matters on a legal basis, and doing \nwhat the law says regardless of politics, which is why he has, for \nexample, the support of most of the Democrats in leadership in the \nState.\n  He has the support of four of the very top African-American leaders \nin the State, including Joe Reed, a member of the Democratic National \nCommittee and vice president of the Teachers Union, Alvin Holmes, one \nof the most outspoken African Americans in the State legislature, \nCongressman Artur Davis, and Chris McNair, former county commissioner \nin the State's largest county and whose daughter was killed in that \ntragic church bombing event many years ago.\n  Those are the kinds of people who support Bill Pryor. He was editor \nin chief of the Tulane Law Review--a brilliant lawyer of the highest \npossible ethics and integrity, a man of deep religious faith, a man who \nhas proven that he will follow the law regardless of what his personal \nbeliefs are and has handled himself again in recent days in a very \ndifficult situation involving the chief justice of the State of Alabama \nand the Ten Commandants. He has agonized over it. I know.\n  He has studied the law and he simply has done what Bill Pryor has \nalways done. He has followed the law regardless of what people may say \nabout it. That is his life. That is what he believes in. And that is \nwhat he will do if he is put on the bench. You can't find a person in \nAmerica better qualified.\n  These filibusters unprecedented in the history of this Senate.\n  It is a very sad day that we are here today to see the success of the \nfirst filibuster of a circuit judge in history--to be successful with \nthe withdrawal of Miguel Estrada. What a sad, sad day.\n  This Senate needs to think through what we have done. This knife can \ncut both ways. We do not need to establish this as a policy of this \nSenate.\n\n[[Page S11109]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to reevaluate what they have been doing and not \nto continue down this road because it is not going to go away lightly. \nThose on this side will use that same knife and use those same tactics \nin the future. We are not going to go away quietly on this when we see \nnominees of this ability and of this character and integrity--with \nsound judicial philosophies that believe in following the law and not \nusing the bench as a forum for a personal agenda.\n  I conclude by expressing my appreciation to Miguel Estrada for \noffering himself in service. I hope he will have an opportunity in the \nfuture to serve this country which he has adopted in some other \ncapacity--maybe even in this capacity in the future. He certainly is \nqualified. He would make a great judge at any number of levels. My \nrespect for him after watching him testify and after seeing how he \nhandled this difficult time has only increased.\n  I thank the President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I echo the statement I made earlier today \nfollowing the statement by Senator Allen with simply this caveat: I \nwould say that statement is totally accurate with the exception of the \nfact that we now have approved an additional judge.\n  Now the record stands at 146 judges approved during President Bush's \nPresidency, and 3 have been rejected. One-hundred and forty-six to \nthree is not a bad record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I would add that during the 8 years \nPresident Clinton was President, 377 judges were confirmed. This Senate \nvoted down only one. Most of the time the Republicans were in the \nmajority and we did not vote down his nominees. Forty-one were left \npending when President Clinton left office. There were 54 left pending \nwhen former President Bush left office.\n  But anyway, I know we can talk about that off and on. But I did want \nto make that point.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/04/senate-section/article/S11109-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

DAVIS\n\n  Mr. MILLER. Madam President, I rise today to reflect on the life of a \ngreat American, a legendary marine, and a native Georgian. I refer to \nGEN Raymond G. Davis, who passed away yesterday in Georgia at the age \nof 88.\n  General Davis was one of this country's greatest military heroes. He \ncourageously served his country as a marine in World War II, in Korea, \nand in Vietnam during his 33 years of military service. General Davis \nwas a noble veteran, tireless advocate, and distinguished recipient of \nthe Medal of Honor.\n  I know we have a lot of very important things going on in this \nChamber today, but I don't think it is too much to take 3 or 4 minutes \nto remember one of the great battles in military history and the role \nthis man played in it. I refer to the Chosin Reservoir in Korea, known \nas the Frozen Chosin. In the biggest shock of the war, 300,000 Chinese \nCommunist soldiers crossed the Yalu River from China into North Korea \nand trapped 8,000 members of the first marine division at the Chosin \nReservoir. There was only one way out, an icy road that twisted around \nsteep mountains. If the Chinese gained control of it, all of the \nmarines would be annihilated.\n  Then LTC Raymond Davis was a 35-year-old Georgia Tech graduate with \nalready two Silver Stars for heroism in Korea, and the Navy Cross, our \nsecond highest award, for gallantry at Peleiu.\n  He commanded a battalion of marines faced with an impossible task: to \nget the marines on Fox Hill linked up with them or the thousands would \nbe trapped at the reservoir and would be doomed.\n  That afternoon, at 24-below-zero weather, the battalion began \nstruggling up the side of a steep ridge. Davis's men climbed 1,000 \nyards before the Chinese opened up. The marines kept clawing their way, \ninch by inch, up the icy slopes. They battled enemy soldiers who seemed \ntucked into every crevice. Atop the first ridge, the men's sweat froze \non their eyebrows and beards. They put their wounded on stretchers and \npushed on. The men rose and trudged toward still another ridge. All \nalong, snipers picked at the slow exposed line, but there was no time \nfor the marines to stop and fire back. They went downhill by sliding on \nthe ice. Davis was so numb that three times he forgot a compass reading \ntaken only moments before.\n  At 4 a.m. this great Georgian halted his unit. The battalion was \nclose to Fox Company, but it lost radio contact. Trying to reach that \nunit in the darkness without communication might get them caught in a \ncrossfire. They would rest until daybreak. As Davis started to nap, a \nsniper's bullet pierced his sleeping bag and grazed his head. He tried \nagain to sleep.\n  By first light there was still no radio contact with Fox Company and \nDavis feared the unit had been overrun. Then came word from his radio \noperator: Colonel, he announced, we have Captain Barber on the radio.\n  As the two officers talked, still hundreds of yards apart, both \nfought back tears. Late in the morning, Davis's battalion arrived atop \nFox Hill. The Chinese had lost the battle for Toktong Pass.\n  Within hours, two marine battalions were moving through the pass away \nfrom the Frozen Chosin. Many icy miles and more bitter fighting lay \nahead before the marines reached the port, but the stand at Toktong \nPass had opened the way.\n\n  In 5 days, Fox Company had killed 1,000 of the enemy. Only 82 of the \n220 marines were able to walk off that hill. In 2 weeks, the first \nmarine division moved over icy roads and ridges through eight Chinese \ndivisions. The Americans brought out all their wounded, their dead, and \nthe equipment. On the way, they killed 25,000 of the enemy. The marines \nlost 730 of their numbers.\n  Such is the legacy of GEN Raymond Davis and those brave marines. \nGeneral Davis received the Medal of Honor, a symbol of unusual human \ncourage above and beyond the call of duty for his valiant efforts \nduring the war. Over 1 million Americans served in Korea, and 131 of \nthose were named recipients of the Medal of Honor. After the general's \npassing, only 36 of them live to wear it today. That medal is a tribute \nto perhaps the only thing truly noble in the horror of war.\n  Although General Davis earned this Nation's highest military honor \nfor valor while on active duty, his service to the country was far from \nover. Over the last 30 years, in a civilian capacity, General Davis has \ncontinued to lead in ways that few other Americans could match. Since \nhis retirement, General Davis became a pillar of the community, working \ndiligently on behalf of all of our Nation's veterans.\n  Beginning in 1987, first as vice chairman and then later as chairman, \nGeneral Davis was the one who directed the efforts of the Korean War \nVeterans Memorial Advisory Board, and it was his determination and \npersonal initiative that led to the approval of the Korean War Veterans \nMemorial design and its construction and finally its dedication in July \nof 1995.\n  The Nation's citizens, and in particular all Korean war veterans and \nmarines and their families, are indebted to Raymond G.

DAVIS\n\n  Mr. MILLER. Madam President, I rise today to reflect on the life of a \ngreat American, a legendary marine, and a native Georgian. I refer to \nGEN Raymond G. Davis, who passed away yesterday in Georgia at the age \nof 88.\n  General Davis was one of this country's greatest military heroes. He \ncourageously served his country as a marine in World War II, in Korea, \nand in Vietnam during his 33 years of military service. General Davis \nwas a noble veteran, tireless advocate, and distinguished recipient of \nthe Medal of Honor.\n  I know we have a lot of very important things going on in this \nChamber today, but I don't think it is too much to take 3 or 4 minutes \nto remember one of the great battles in military history and the role \nthis man played in it. I refer to the Chosin Reservoir in Korea, known \nas the Frozen Chosin. In the biggest shock of the war, 300,000 Chinese \nCommunist soldiers crossed the Yalu River from China into North Korea \nand trapped 8,000 members of the first marine division at the Chosin \nReservoir. There was only one way out, an icy road that twisted around \nsteep mountains. If the Chinese gained control of it, all of the \nmarines would be annihilated.\n  Then LTC Raymond Davis was a 35-year-old Georgia Tech graduate with \nalready two Silver Stars for heroism in Korea, and the Navy Cross, our \nsecond highest award, for gallantry at Peleiu.\n  He commanded a battalion of marines faced with an impossible task: to \nget the marines on Fox Hill linked up with them or the thousands would \nbe trapped at the reservoir and would be doomed.\n  That afternoon, at 24-below-zero weather, the battalion began \nstruggling up the side of a steep ridge. Davis's men climbed 1,000 \nyards before the Chinese opened up. The marines kept clawing their way, \ninch by inch, up the icy slopes. They battled enemy soldiers who seemed \ntucked into every crevice. Atop the first ridge, the men's sweat froze \non their eyebrows and beards. They put their wounded on stretchers and \npushed on. The men rose and trudged toward still another ridge. All \nalong, snipers picked at the slow exposed line, but there was no time \nfor the marines to stop and fire back. They went downhill by sliding on \nthe ice. Davis was so numb that three times he forgot a compass reading \ntaken only moments before.\n  At 4 a.m. this great Georgian halted his unit. The battalion was \nclose to Fox Company, but it lost radio contact. Trying to reach that \nunit in the darkness without communication might get them caught in a \ncrossfire. They would rest until daybreak. As Davis started to nap, a \nsniper's bullet pierced his sleeping bag and grazed his head. He tried \nagain to sleep.\n  By first light there was still no radio contact with Fox Company and \nDavis feared the unit had been overrun. Then came word from his radio \noperator: Colonel, he announced, we have Captain Barber on the radio.\n  As the two officers talked, still hundreds of yards apart, both \nfought back tears. Late in the morning, Davis's battalion arrived atop \nFox Hill. The Chinese had lost the battle for Toktong Pass.\n  Within hours, two marine battalions were moving through the pass away \nfrom the Frozen Chosin. Many icy miles and more bitter fighting lay \nahead before the marines reached the port, but the stand at Toktong \nPass had opened the way.\n\n  In 5 days, Fox Company had killed 1,000 of the enemy. Only 82 of the \n220 marines were able to walk off that hill. In 2 weeks, the first \nmarine division moved over icy roads and ridges through eight Chinese \ndivisions. The Americans brought out all their wounded, their dead, and \nthe equipment. On the way, they killed 25,000 of the enemy. The marines \nlost 730 of their numbers.\n  Such is the legacy of GEN Raymond Davis and those brave marines. \nGeneral Davis received the Medal of Honor, a symbol of unusual human \ncourage above and beyond the call of duty for his valiant efforts \nduring the war. Over 1 million Americans served in Korea, and 131 of \nthose were named recipients of the Medal of Honor. After the general's \npassing, only 36 of them live to wear it today. That medal is a tribute \nto perhaps the only thing truly noble in the horror of war.\n  Although General Davis earned this Nation's highest military honor \nfor valor while on active duty, his service to the country was far from \nover. Over the last 30 years, in a civilian capacity, General Davis has \ncontinued to lead in ways that few other Americans could match. Since \nhis retirement, General Davis became a pillar of the community, working \ndiligently on behalf of all of our Nation's veterans.\n  Beginning in 1987, first as vice chairman and then later as chairman, \nGeneral Davis was the one who directed the efforts of the Korean War \nVeterans Memorial Advisory Board, and it was his determination and \npersonal initiative that led to the approval of the Korean War Veterans \nMemorial design and its construction and finally its dedication in July \nof 1995.\n  The Nation's citizens, and in particular all Korean war veterans and \nmarines and their families, are indebted to Raymond G. Davis for his \ninspired leadership and service. In war and in peace, as an active duty \nmarine and as a private citizen, GEN Raymond Davis' outstanding \ncourage, unswerving devotion to duty, inspiring leadership, and sound \njudgment have represented the highest traditions of military service \nand citizenship. This man was a true American hero.\n\n[[Page S11110]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/04/senate-section/article/S11110-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11110-S11112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          NOTICE OF PROPOSED PROCEDURAL RULEMAKING REGULATIONS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

The CAA applies the rights and protections of 11 \n     federal labor and employment statutes to covered employees \n     and employing offices within the Legislative Branch of \n     Government. Section 301 of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1383) \n     establishes the Office of Compliance as an independent office \n     within that Branch. Section 303 (2 U.S.C. 1383) directs that \n     the Executive Director, as the Chief Operating Officer of the \n     agency, adopt rules of procedure governing the Office of \n     Compliance, subject to approval by the Board of Directors of \n     the Office of Compliance. The rules of procedure establish \n     the process by which alleged violations of the 11 laws made \n     applicable to the Legislative Branch under the CAA will be \n     considered and resolved. The rules include procedures for \n     counseling, mediation, and election between filing an \n     administrative complaint with the Office of Compliance or \n     filing a civil action in U.S. District Court. The rules also \n     include the process for the conduct of administrative \n     hearings held as the result of the filing of an \n     administrative complaint, and for appeals of a decision by a \n     hearing officer to the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance, and for an appeal of a decision by the Board of \n     Directors to the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     Federal Circuit. The rules also contain other matters of \n     general applicability to the dispute resolution process and \n     to the operation of the Office of Compliance.\n       These proposed amendments to the Rules of Procedure are the \n     result of the experience of the Office in processing disputes \n     under the CAA during the period since the original adoption \n     of these rules in 1995.\n       Explanation regarding the text of the proposed amendments: \n     The text of the proposed amendments shows deletions within \n     italicized brackets, and added text in italicized bold. Only \n     subsections of the rules which include proposed amendments \n     are reproduced in this Notice. The insertion of a series of \n     small dots (. . . . .) indicates additional, unamended text \n     within a section has not been reproduced in this document. \n     The insertion of a series of asterisk (* * * * *) indicates \n     that the unamended text of entire sections of the Rules have \n     not been\n     reproduced in this document.

In \nfact, he hitchhiked to Nevada the day after he graduated from high \nschool.\n  Blackie used to spend time at the Henderson Boys Club. He was a \nGolden Gloves boxer, and he fought in the ring there.\n  He also was a fighter out of the ring--he fought for his union \nbrothers, and for all the working men and women of Nevada.\n  A few months after Blackie came to Henderson, his high school \nsweetheart followed him. Blackie had played football in high school and \nCarolyn was a cheerleader, and they made a great couple. On September \n7, 1953, they were married in Las Vegas.\n  Blackie went to work at Titanium Metal Corp., and he and Carolyn \nstarted to raise a family. Over the next few years they would have four \nwonderful children: Steve, Sheree, Seanna, and Lisa.\n  They raised their kids and worked hard. After Blackie had been at the \nTimet factory for about 5 years, he was elected vice president of \nUnited Steelworkers Local 4856. Three weeks later, at age 23, he became \nthe local's youngest president ever. He held that position for 12 years \nwhile also working in the plant.\n  In 1971, my former high school teacher Mike O'Callaghan, who had \nbecome Governor of Nevada, appointed Blackie as the Commissioner \nrepresenting labor on the old Nevada Industrial Commission. The Evans \nfamily moved to Carson City, where Carolyn narrated tours through the \nGovernor's Mansion in her spare time from raising four children.\n  In 1978, Blackie was elected secretary treasurer of the Nevada AFL-\nCIO, a position he held until his retirement in July 1999. He also \nserved as a national vice president of the AFL-CIO. During this time, I \noften crossed paths with Blackie. Together, we worked to help the \nworking families of Nevada.\n  Today, Blackie and Carolyn still live in Henderson, NV, the town he \nhitchhiked to some 50 years ago. Carolyn's mother Nadine Qualls, who \nturns 91 in November, lives with them.\n  They are blessed to have two grandchildren living in Henderson--Alex \nBacon, 12, and Geena German, 7--and two grandchildren in Reno--Brittany \nCassingham, 20, a student at UNR, and Cierra Cassingham, 16, a junior \nin high school.\n  On September 7, 2003, Blackie and Carolyn will celebrate 50 years of \nmarriage. The celebration will be a tribute to their love of each \nother, and to the rich, productive life they have enjoyed together.\n  I congratulate Carolyn and Blackie on their wonderful marriage and \nfamily, and I wish them many more years of happiness together.\n\n[[Page S11113]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/04/senate-section/article/S11112-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11112-S11113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY OF CAROLYN AND BLACKIE EVANS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I speak today about the need for hate \ncrimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I introduced \nthe Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in Newark, \nCA. On October 3, 2002, several men became enraged after learning that \na young woman was actually a 17-year-old boy at their party. The men \npunched Eddie ``Gwen'' Araujo, dragged him into the garage and \nstrangled him with a piece of rope. Eddie's body was then wrapped in a \nsheet and buried in a shallow grave near Placerville, about 150 miles \nfrom his family's home in Newark.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/04/senate-section/article/S11113-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUNG SAN SUU KYI'S HUNGER STRIKE\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, this weekend we heard extremely \ntroubling news from the State Department. Aung San Suu Kyi, leader of \nthe democratically elected National League for Democracy and Nobel \nPeace Prize laureate, is on a hunger strike to protest her detention by \nthe military government in Burma.\n  Aung San Suu Kyi has been held in an unknown location without the \nability to communicate with the outside world since May 30, 2003. Many \nof us in Congress have demanded her release. Sadly, her detention is \nsimply the latest installment in the country's 40-year history of \nsuffering and oppression. I have consistently criticized the government \nfor its political repression and human rights violations. Reports of \nrape, forced labor, human trafficking, suppression of civil liberties, \nand torture of political dissidents have caused me and my constituents \ngreat concern. I supported the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of \n2003, which imposes sanctions on the Burmese military junta, \nstrengthens Burma's democratic forces and supports and recognizes the \nNational League for Democracy as the legitimate representative of the \nBurmese people. I encourage other countries to join the United States \nin adopting similar measures toward Burma.\n  The Burmese Government must release Aung San Suu Kyi and all \npolitical prisoners from detention. I also urge our administration, the \nUnited Nations, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN, and \nthe international community to continue to exert pressure on the \nBurmese junta to respect human rights and political freedoms. I ask \nPresident Bush to make Burma a high priority as he travels to the Asia \nPacific Economic Cooperation Summit in Bangkok in early October. As \nrecommended by the Council on Foreign Relations, we should press for a \nUnited Nations Security Council resolution condemning Aung San Suu \nKyi's detention, the junta's human rights violations and their refusal \nto engage in dialogue with the democratic opposition. We should also \nencourage the Security Council to hold an emergency session on Burma to \ndiscuss implementing targeted sanctions on the regime.\n  Aung San Suu Kyi's hunger strike adds urgency to the dire predicament \nof the Burmese people. The Burmese military junta must realize that \ntheir egregious offences against their own population can no longer \nstand.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/04/senate-section/article/S11113-3", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ORGANIC AGRICULTURE\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to talk briefly about organic \nagriculture and to recognize the many thousands of organic farmers from \naround the Nation who have helped transform this once nascent industry \ninto a thriving and innovative sector of our economy. Today, in \nparticular, I extend my greetings to the many organic producers and \nretailers who have gathered in Washington, D.C. this week to \nparticipate in the annual organic conference.\n  Organic agriculture has come a long way over the past 20 years \nlargely because of the determination and hard work of our Nation's many \norganic producers. To put this issue in perspective, the amount of \norganic cropland in the United States has more than doubled in the \n1990s, and the annual growth rate of the organic industry in the United \nStates has been greater than 20 percent for the past decade. Sales of \norganic food and beverages accounted for over $9 billion in 2002 and \nare expected to exceed $20 billion by 2005. The increase in organic \nproduction and sales is a reflection of the profitability and high \nconsumer demand for organic food.\n  While the organic industry would not be where it is today without the \nefforts of its growers and retailers, Congress has an integral role in \nensuring that consumers have confidence in the products they are \nbuying. Many of my colleagues remember that the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture helped to usher in a new era for the organic industry with \nthe implementation last November of the first ever national organic \nstandards. With these new standards, farmers in my home State of Maine \nwere able to sell their organic products to retailers in other States \nwith confidence that the organic label will be recognized by consumers \nin those States. Consumers now know that when they buy an organically \nlabeled product, it was produced in a healthy and environmentally \nfriendly manner.\n  From what I heard from farmers in my State over the August recess, I \ncan say that the organic rule has been a tremendous benefit to growers \nboth small and large. In Maine, organic agriculture accounts for an \nimportant part of the State's $673 million agriculture-related sales. \nSeveral blueberry growers in Downeast Maine have recognized the \nprofitability of organic agriculture and have begun to add organic \nproduction. Consumer interest in organic milk has led many dairy \nfarmers to switch to organic milk. Six years ago, only one dairy farmer \nin Maine produced organic milk--now, such milk accounts for over 10 \npercent of the State's entire dairy production. These are but a few \nexamples of the success of organic agriculture from my State, \ndemonstrating the enormous potential for growth in the organic sector.\n  Here in Congress, we must continue to help the organic agriculture \nsector grow. The organic community celebrated the implementation of the \nnational organic rule; however, the continuing success of this rule \nwill depend on Congress' commitment to fund the USDA's National Organic \nProgram. The modest increase for the National Organic Program in the \nSenate Fiscal Year 2004 Agriculture appropriations bill is a step in \nthe right direction. Likewise, investments in organic research and \ndevelopment through the Organic Production and Marketing Data \nCollection will help the organic industry move forward by leaps and \nbounds.\n  With organic producers visiting from nearly all 50 States, I hope \nmany of my colleagues will have an opportunity to hear from an organic \nfarmer, rancher, or retailer in their home State. Again, I extend my \nwelcome to all those involved in the national organic conference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/04/senate-section/article/S11113-4", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11113-S11114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            65TH ANNIVERSARY OF INTERIOR'S INDIAN CRAFT SHOP\n\n Mr. CAMPBELL.

The shop assists in \nefforts to protect Indian cultural heritage and strives to ensure that \nNative-made goods are recognized for their artistic tradition and fine \ncraftsmanship.\n  The Indian Craft Shop has 65 successful years behind it, and I look \nforward to its continuing success in supporting Native artists and \npeople nationwide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/04/senate-section/article/S11114-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN REMEMBRANCE OF JOE GARTON\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nJoe Garton, a champion of the arts in the State of Wisconsin, and a \ndear friend who passed away August 2.\n  Joseph Walter Garton was born August 17, 1946, in Sheboygan, WI. \nAfter attending Amherst College in Massachusetts, serving as a VISTA \nvolunteer in the Harlem section of New York City, receiving his \ndoctorate from NYU in film studies, and marrying his beloved wife, \nDierdre, Joe returned to Wisconsin to teach film history.\n  In 1996, Joe demonstrated his love for the arts by rescuing and \nrestoring Ten Chimneys, the one-time summer home of Broadway legends \nAlfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne. Thanks to Joe's efforts, Ten Chimneys is \nnow a national center for theater studies and a tourist destination for \nfans and artists from all over the world.\n  A husband, father, son, and brother--and soon to be grandfather--Joe \nGarton was an extraordinary man and I am lucky to have called him a \ngood friend. In addition to restoring Ten Chimneys, Joe also \ntransformed an 1856 farmhouse into Quigley Grove, a popular restaurant \nin Fitchburg, WI. Our community and our State have been greatly \nenriched by his work.\n  His love for the arts and architecture was only surpassed by his love \nfor and dedication to his family. Their kindness to me over the past 20 \nyears means a great deal to me personally. Both through his work and \nthrough his family, Joe leaves behind a tremendous legacy.\n  Joe was my friend and someone who was always there for me over the \nyears. I am forever indebted to him. Mary and I will always remember \nJoe and have a particularly fond recollection of an incredible evening \nat Ten Chimneys several years ago. At a very challenging time in my \ncareer, Joe and Dierdre welcomed us with tremendous hospitality and \nMary and I remain extremely grateful.\n  He was taken from us too soon, and we will always treasure his memory \nand his dedication to his family and friends. Joe, Dierdre and their \nentire family are in our thoughts and prayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/04/senate-section/article/S11114-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RECOGNIZING THE LIFELONG SERVICE OF MARTIN BEGIEN\n\n Mr. BOND. Madam President, I join with friends and family in \nrecognizing the efforts and dedication of Mr. Martin Begien, an \noutstanding American, and a true patriot to American democracy on what \nwill be his 75th birthday, November 15. Martin, since joining the \nRepublican Party, has helped bring quality candidates to run for \npolitical office and in turn continues to participate in the American \npolitical process. Martin's successful political participation is \nindicative of his career as a whole.\n  Martin Begien's impressive educational career began at the exclusive \nAndover Academy in Andover, MA, and Yale University in New Haven, CT, \nand continued with his service in the U.S. Army. Martin went on to \nmaintain an illustrious professional career that ultimately lead to his \nserving as senior partner at David L. Babson and Company, Inc., one of \nthe oldest investment counseling firms in the United States.\n  Martin has always combined exceptional professional and \norganizational skills, untiring initiative, and unlimited compassion to \naccomplish both major, and simply thoughtful, tasks for the Republican \nParty. Martin has always generously given of himself a genuine love and \nconcern of others without hesitation or expectation of reward. Martin's \nendearing attitude and hard work earned him the respect and admiration \nof Mitt Romney, Governor of the State of Massachusetts.\n  I stand with Martin's wife Kate, his friends and family, and all \nthose whose lives are richer for having known Martin Begien to \ncommemorate and recognize his 75th birthday on the 15th day of \nNovember, 2003.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/04/senate-section/article/S11114-3", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     HONORING THE IDAHO MINING ASSOCIATION ON ITS 100TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I offer congratulations to the \nIdaho Mining Association on its 100th anniversary. The mining industry \nhas long been an economic force in Idaho, which is nicknamed the Gem \nState, and the association has been a strong advocate for that \nindustry.\n  The association held its first meeting in the summer of 1903, and was \nfirst known as the Idaho Prospectors and Operators. The occasion of the \nmeeting was an urgent invitation from the Governor of Missouri to Idaho \nGovernor Frank R. Gooding that Idaho furnish a display of mineral \nproducts for the 1904 International Exposition in St. Louis. Ten years \nlater, this group changed its name to the Idaho Mining Association and \nhas operated continuously since.\n  Early records of the group clearly state its original purpose:\n\n       It is imperative that there be a better understanding on \n     the part of the people generally, and of those who enact and \n     administer our laws particularly; that the economy of our \n     nation, the happiness and welfare of our people, the safety \n     of the Republic itself depend upon a healthy mineral \n     industry.\n\n  The importance of minerals in our lives and to our economy has not \ndiminished over the past century. The price and availability of raw \nmaterials are critically important to our manufacturing industries. The \ncomputer, telecommunication and electronic industries that represent an \never-growing share of our economic output, and dominate our daily \nlives, wouldn't be possible without the vast array of minerals produced \nin this country. We even rely on minerals to produce the new equipment \nthat enhances the productivity of the nation's workers. It remains \nessential that we, as ``those who enact and administer our laws,'' \ncontinue to recognize the importance of our domestic mining industry.\n  Once again, my congratulations to the Idaho Mining Association and \nits members as they mark this important milestone. I send my very best \nwishes for its continued success in serving the best interests of the \nState of Idaho and the nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/04/senate-section/article/S11114-4", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL ASSISTED LIVING WEEK\n\nMr. WYDEN. Madam President, this year, National Assisted Living \nWeek begins September 7 and continues through September 13. Since 1995, \nthe National Center for Assisted Living has sponsored National Assisted \nLiving Week to emphasize the importance of the options assisted living \nprovides seniors and persons with disabilities.\n  Assisted living is a long-term care alternative for seniors who need \nmore assistance than is available in general retirement communities but \ndo not require the heavy medical and nursing care provided by nursing \nhomes.\n  This year's theme for National Assisted Living Week is ``Sharing \nLife's Treasures'' which highlights the need for all of us, no matter \nwhat our age, to take time to appreciate the treasures we find along \nlife's pathway.\n  My State, Oregon, helped to pioneer the assisted-living concept \nbecause it could help promote security, dignity, and independence for \nseniors. While assisted living varies from State to State, it remains a \nconsumer-oriented option for long-term care needs, and highlights the \nneed to support options for long-term care as our population \nages.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/04/senate-section/article/S11114-5", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11114-S11115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO PAUL WALLACE-BRODEUR\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nPaul Wallace-Brodeur, an outstanding Vermonter and a national leader in \nthe area of health care reform. As he prepares to retire from his \nposition as Director of the Office of Vermont Health\n\n[[Page S11115]]\n\nAccess in Waterbury, VT, it is important to reflect on how much one \nperson can accomplish in serving others.\n  Paul has been on the forefront of significant and timely health care \nconcerns. As Medicaid director, which is Vermont's second largest \ninsurance program, Paul has ensured service for 130,000 people and \nhelped Vermont obtain the distinction of having one of the lowest \nuninsured rates in the country. Under Paul's leadership, Vermont \nbroadened its eligibility standards and was one of the first States in \nthe country to expand Medicaid services to children under the Dr. \nDynasaur program.\n  Paul began his career in Vermont as a social worker at the Brandon \nTraining School. He quickly rose to leadership positions as a direct \nprovider and then consultant in the field of mental health, followed by \nhis position as the Chief Social Worker for the Vermont State Hospital. \nIt came as no surprise to those of us who know Paul that he was \nselected in the mid-'80s to lead the State of Vermont's efforts in \ncreating universal access to health care as the Executive Director of \nthe Vermont Health Policy Council and through his work for the Vermont \nHealth Care Authority. Also during the mid-'80s he spearheaded the \ncreation of the Vermont Ethics Network, an organization dedicated to \nincreasing the understanding of ethical issues, values and choices in \nhealth and health care.\n  Over the course of 40 years, Paul has been involved with virtually \nevery health policy initiative in Vermont, particularly the State's \nefforts to expand health coverage. He is personally responsible for \nauthoring Vermont's 1115 waiver, which over the years, and with many \namendments, has provided more expansive and flexible Medicaid services \nto Vermonters. In his quiet unassuming way, Paul is an integral part of \nthe health care delivery system in Vermont and has gained recognition \nfor being a national health policy leader and mentor. He has always \nbrought a steadfast commitment and institutional knowledge to solving \nthe problem at hand while maintaining a vision for improving Vermont's \nhealth care system.\n  Paul's unwavering commitment toward improving the health status of \nVermont and its citizens serves as a testament to us all. Vermont is \ntruly indebted to him. His deep commitment to the citizens of the Green \nMountain State has endeared him to us. He has our best wishes for the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/04/senate-section/article/S11115-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/04/senate-section/article/S11115-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and two withdrawals which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/04/senate-section/article/S11115-3", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:18 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1533.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:15 a.m., \nFriday, September 5. I further ask unanimous consent that following the \nprayer and pledge the morning hour be deemed expired.\n  I assume we will still be able to have a prayer and pledge in this \nbody and that the courts will not have struck it down sometime in the \ninterim.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the morning hour be deemed expired, the \nJournal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two \nleaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then \nresume consideration of H.R. 2660, the Labor-HHS-Education \nappropriations bill, with the time until 9:30 a.m. equally divided \nbetween the two bill managers or their designees; provided that at 9:30 \na.m. the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Clinton amendment \nNo. 1565, to be immediately followed by a vote in relation to the \nHarkin amendment No. 1575; provided further that no amendments be in \norder to either amendment prior to the vote, and there be 5 minutes for \ndebate equally divided in the usual form prior to the second vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I say \nthrough the Chair to the distinguished acting leader that as of this \nevening we have worked now for 2 days to come up with a finite list of \namendments on our side. My friend, the manager of the bill, the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, has asked me about this. If he has \nasked me once, he has asked me 15 times. We came up with a list. And \nnow\n\n[[Page S11125]]\n\ntonight we can't get approval from the majority that this is a finite \nlist. I really do not understand that. I hope it is just some clerical \nproblem or some Senator who maybe couldn't be contacted. But I hope \nafter all we have been through that we would have an agreement tomorrow \non a finite list of amendments on this most important bill.\n  I say that we are trying to help. We understand. I spoke to the two \nleaders today. As soon as we complete this bill, we will go to the \nenergy and water appropriations bill, which is an extremely important \nbill. It is a $25 billion bill which is all nondiscretionary money. It \nis money to fund the nuclear weapons program in addition to many other \nvery important programs that are important around our country, \nincluding the Bureau of Reclamation, the Corps of Engineers, and other \nmultibillion-dollar programs.\n  I hope we can move forward and conclude this legislation. It seems \nrather strange, as far as I am concerned, that the minority is talking \nabout moving an appropriations bill, but that is the way it is.\n  We have said all week that we have one issue that we had to vote on \nnext week for obvious reasons. We have to have four Democratic Senators \nwho are running for President. We want to make sure they are all here. \nThat has been recognized by Senator Specter and by the majority leader. \nWe had a tentative time set up to do that.\n  I hope before we adjourn tomorrow that we can get the agreement that \nhas been prepared by both staffs. I think it would move toward \nconcluding this legislation. But also I think it sets the proper tone \nfor what is going to be a most difficult remaining legislative session \nthis year.\n  I have no objection to the request by the Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I note that Senator Specter certainly \nhas been working our side to get that agreement. Without dispute, there \nwill certainly be far fewer amendments pursued to vote on from the \nDemocratic side. But that is all right. I know the Senator is close to \nhaving that done. I thank the Senator for working his side.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/04/senate-section/article/S11125-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.
