Madam President, today the Senate will continue the \nconsideration of the nomination of Miguel Estrada to be a DC Circuit \nCourt judge. The deliberations on the Senate floor yesterday were \nhearty and robust, and I believe many Senators have now had an \nopportunity to express their views. It is my objective to reach an \nagreement with the Democratic leader regarding a time for vote on this \nnominee.\n  The schedule for this week, and until the Estrada nomination is \ncompleted, is dependent upon reaching an agreement with respect to the \npending nomination. I will continue to discuss with the Democratic \nleader the options for completing work on this important nomination. In \nthe absence of any agreement, the Senate should expect very late \nevenings. My objective is to complete this nomination process with a \nvote this week.\n  The Senate also needs to complete action on the omnibus \nappropriations conference report when it becomes available. The \nconferees worked well into last night on the conference report, and I \nwill be speaking to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee as to \ntheir success in closing out that conference. These are two very \nimportant pieces of business which must be addressed this week.\n  As a reminder, the Senate will recess today from 12:30 to 2:15 in \norder to accommodate the weekly policy luncheons.\n  Finally, I would forewarn all Senators that the Senate will remain in \nsession in order to complete the Estrada nomination as well as the \nomnibus conference report.\n  I thank all Senators for their attention and look forward to the \ndebate over the course of today, and hopefully we can reach some \nagreement, either this morning or this afternoon, on a time certain for \na vote.\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, while the majority leader is on the floor \nand also the President pro tempore is seated in the Chamber, the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee--the same person--while one \nmay disagree with some of the policy stands the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee has taken, one has to admire the work he did \nlast night. It was really remarkable that he had every chair and \nranking member of the subcommittees there, including the chairs of the \nfull committees and ranking members, and was able to work through that \nmyriad of information. It is now down to where it is really close to \nsomething we can vote on this week.\n  While the chairman of the committee is here, I wanted to acknowledge \nin front of his leader the remarkable job he did last night. We look \nforward to some productive work this week. These are two most important \nmatters. I am sure the Senator and our leader will have a conversation \nin the immediate future about the Estrada nomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/11/senate-section/article/S2125-6", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Estrada, of \nVirginia, to be United States Circuit Judge for the District of \nColumbia Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I have heard so much misinformation\n\n[[Page S2126]]\n\nabout Mr. Estrada here on the floor of the Senate for the past few \ndays, I hardly know where to begin to correct the record. It is simply \namazing to me that some of my Democratic colleagues claim they cannot \nsupport Mr. Estrada because he lacks judicial experience or because he \nhasn't been a law professor or because he has not published \nextensively. Let me remind my colleagues there are more than a few \nnominees confirmed as circuit judges whose record did not include \njudicial experience or extensive scholarly writings but whom they \nmanaged to vote for and confirm anyway. Yesterday I listed 26 circuit \ncourt of appeals judges who had no judicial experience when they were \nnominated but were confirmed anyway. That is just a small fraction of \nall those who never had judicial experience before the last number of \nyears.\n  Don't get me wrong. Even though they have had no judicial experience, \nthese are all very qualified judges who deserved confirmation. But I \ndon't believe any of them clerked for a Supreme Court Justice or argued \n15 cases before the United States Supreme Court, as has Mr. Estrada.\n  Take, for example, Clinton Ninth Circuit nominee Sidney Thomas. He \ngraduated from the University of Montana Law School in 1978 and went \nstraight into private practice with a firm in Billings, where he \nremained for his entire pre-judicial career. Of the 10 writings or \nspeeches he listed in his questionnaire, four of them consisted of \noutlines of presentations. The fifth was copyrighted while he was still \nin college and so could not possibly present his legal views. Still \nanother appears to be a study guide for a college class he taught. \nGiven this record, I would not have expected a review of the hearings \ntranscript to reveal demands by my Democratic colleagues for access to \ninternal memoranda Judge Thomas prepared at his law firm, memoranda \nthat are commonly known as attorney work product. Instead, a review of \nhis hearing transcript reveals a grand total of less than two pages of \nquestions, all of them asked by a Republican committee member. The \nDemocratic committee member declined to ask Judge Thomas any questions, \ndespite a record that includes no judicial experience and limited \npublished writings.\n\n  Let me read you some of the exacting questions Judge Thomas was asked \nat his confirmation hearing and some of the answers he gave.\n  He was asked:\n\n       Would you state in detail your best independent legal \n     judgments with regard to existing Supreme Court precedent on \n     the constitutionality of capital punishment?\n\n  Judge Thomas replied:\n\n       Well, I believe that the Supreme Court has spoken, I think \n     quite appropriately, on the death penalty. I do not possess \n     any moral or religious convictions which would cause me to \n     not apply the death penalty in an appropriate case.\n\n  This answer was apparently sufficient to satisfy the members of the \ncommittee that Judge Thomas would follow the law regardless of his \npersonal convictions about the death penalty. But when Miguel Estrada \ngave similar answers to questions from Democratic committee members, he \nwas accused of not being forthcoming. That is a double standard: We \nwill treat President Clinton's nominees differently than we will treat \nPresident Bush's nominees.\n  Judge Thomas was also asked:\n\n       Do you believe the Federal Constitution contains . . . a \n     right to privacy?\n\n  He replied:\n\n       Well, the Supreme Court, again, has spoken on that. There \n     is no explicit right to privacy in the Federal Constitution. \n     Montana has a constitutional protection for privacy. That is \n     another area where I think the appellate courts have to \n     proceed very carefully in light of the Supreme Court \n     precedent in the area.\n\n  There were no followup questions demanding to know his personal \nopinion on whether there is a right to privacy in the Constitution. His \nacknowledgement of controlling Supreme Court precedent, coupled with \nhis statement that ``courts ought to move very cautiously'' in this \narea, were deemed sufficient to confirm him, as I think they should \nhave been.\n  I could go on to discuss other confirmed circuit judges with \nbackgrounds similar to Judge Thomas's, but I think the point is clear: \nMiguel Estrada is being held to a different standard, even though his \nqualifications are similar to--or exceed--those of other confirmed \ncircuit court of appeals judges.\n  Let me next turn to the allegation that Mr. Estrada was not \nsufficiently responsive to questions he was asked at his hearing.\n  Let's get to the heart of the matter. The real complaint of some of \nmy Democratic colleagues is that no plausible reason to oppose Mr. \nEstrada's nomination exists. But instead of saying this, they complain \nthat Mr. Estrada refused to criticize the reasoning of settled Supreme \nCourt precedent.\n  Of course, if Mr. Estrada is confirmed as a lower court judge, he \nwill be bound to follow Supreme Court precedent regardless of whether \nhe is critical of it. This was what he testified he would do if \nconfirmed, and this was the only responsible answer to the questions he \nwas asked about specific Supreme Court cases.\n  During the course of this debate, I have already mentioned the \nstatements Lloyd Cutler has made on this point, but I believe they are \nworth repeating because some of my Democratic colleagues keep \nresurrecting the spurious allegation that Mr. Estrada was not \nforthcoming at his hearing.\n\n  Mr. Cutler, as we all know, served this country well as counsel to \nPresidents Carter and Clinton. He also served on two national \ncommissions that addressed problems in the confirmation process.\n  This chart I have in the Chamber shows what he actually said:\n\n       Candidates should decline to reply when efforts are made to \n     find out how they would decide a particular case.\n\n  That is the leading Democrat lawyer in this town. He has been Chief \nCounsel to two Presidents, two Democratic Presidents. He is highly \nregarded as a constitutional expert and a great lawyer not only in the \narea of Washington, DC, but throughout the country. He is a fine man. I \nhave always respected him, and I do today.\n  So regarding judicial nominees, he stated, in unequivocal terms, \nthat:\n\n       Candidates should decline to reply when efforts are made to \n     find out how they would decide a particular case.\n\n  In his opinion:\n\n       What is most important is the appointment of judges who are \n     learned in the law, who are conscientious in their work \n     ethic, and who possess what lawyers describe as ``judicial \n     temperament.''\n\n  Mr. Estrada's academic achievement, his professional accomplishments, \nthe letters of support we have received from his colleagues--both \nDemocrat and Republican--and his unanimously well-qualified, highest \nrating by the American Bar Association, all indicate that Mr. Estrada \nfits this description and deserves our vote of confirmation.\n  At the same hearing at which Mr. Cutler made his statements about the \nappropriate scope of the inquiry for confirming judicial nominees, \nanother legal luminary, Boyden Gray, testified. Mr. Gray, of course, \nserved as White House Counsel in the first Bush administration. During \nhis testimony, he told us that two Democratic Senators, who are former \nJudiciary Committee chairmen, met with him very early in the \nadministration to let him know in no uncertain terms that if the White \nHouse were caught asking any potential nominee any questions about \nspecific cases, that nominee would be flatly rejected. Now, that is \narrogance at its height, to tell Boyden Gray that or to have that \nattitude. Surely, the White House should be able to talk to their \npotential nominees about what their viewpoints are before they nominate \nthem.\n  On the other hand, Mr. Gray, of course, is one of the most respected \npeople in Utah. Again, Boyden Gray is one of the great lawyers in \nWashington; like Mr. Cutler, he is highly respected, has been in very \nresponsible positions, and has fulfilled his service to the U.S. \nGovernment very well.\n  As Mr. Gray pointed out, that same philosophy is reflected in the \nJudiciary Committee questionnaire, which all judicial nominees must \ncomplete before the committee will act on their nominations. The \nquestionnaire asked the following:\n\n       Has anyone involved in the process of selecting you as a \n     judicial nominee discussed with you any specific case, legal \n     issue, or question in a manner that could reasonably be \n     interpreted as asking or seeking a commitment as to how you \n     would rule on such a case, issue or question?\n\n\n[[Page S2127]]\n\n\n  The clear goal of this question is to deter any White House from \ngetting commitments from potential nominees on how they would rule on \nspecific cases, or commitments that they would overrule certain Supreme \nCourt decisions.\n\n  I happen to know the Republican White Houses have acted honorably \nwith regard to this responsibility. I remember during the Reagan years, \nsome of our friends on the other side were constantly questioning \nwhether the White House was trying to influence its judicial nominees \nduring the Reagan administration to vote a certain way once they got on \nthe courts.\n  I happen to know that that was totally irresponsible on the part of \nour colleagues because the person who vetted all of these nominees \nhappened to be a former staffer of mine who is now on the Michigan \nState Supreme Court and one of the great jurists of this country. I \nknow he never asked or told people what they should be doing with \nregard to their future, after confirmation, on any particular court.\n  It now appears that some Senate Democrats want to forbid the White \nHouse from asking nominees how they would rule on specific issues while \nreserving that right for themselves. Call it what you will, but this is \na double standard if I have ever seen one. More fundamentally, it \nthreatens the very independence of the Federal judiciary that our \nconstitutional system of checks and balances was designed to preserve.\n  I cannot believe some of the questions that have been asked and some \nof the statements that have been made about how unresponsive Miguel \nEstrada was when they were asking him questions about how he would rule \nwhen he became a member of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia. Now, they might say, ``We did not directly ask \nthat,'' but that is what was behind it.\n  A number of Senators on the other side have indicated they need to \nknow the philosophy of these nominees. I think that is irrelevant, as \nlong as the philosophy is that they will uphold the precedents of the \ncourts above them. And to be honest with you, this is going way too far \nin some ways.\n  Let's face it, too many questions in the confirmation hearings of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees seem calculated politically to \nmanipulate the judicial selection process and to frustrate the \nappointment of judges who would refuse to follow a potentially popular \ncourse when the Constitution and settled judicial precedent provide \notherwise. Miguel Estrada was right not to fall into the trap of \ncriticizing particular Supreme Court cases that he may be called upon \nto rely upon as a sitting Federal judge.\n  My colleagues should be commending him for this, not proffering it as \na reason to vote against his confirmation. Unfortunately, that is \nbasically their argument, that they should vote against his \nconfirmation because he has abided by what really are rules that have \nlong been time honored in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this is a historic debate on the floor \nof the Senate. It is rare in our history that the Senate has considered \nthe nomination of the President of the United States for a circuit \njudgeship and at least the prospect of a filibuster is looming. It is \nan interesting issue historically that the Senate would reach this \npoint that the minority in the Senate--in this case, the Democratic \nside of the aisle with 49 Members--would suggest to the majority party \nthat we will stop this nomination by filibuster. I have asked my staff \nto take a look historically to find out how often that has occurred. It \nis extremely rare. Maybe the Senator from Utah can illuminate my \nknowledge. But I am told only in the case of Abe Fortas, who was being \nsuggested as Chief Justice, was a filibuster suggested. The obvious \nquestion by those observing the debate is, Why? Why at this moment in \ntime, with this nominee, is the Senate, maybe for the first or second \ntime in its history, considering a filibuster?\n  Many of us who serve on the Judiciary Committee believe this \nnomination and this debate is so historically significant that we must \nconsider an extraordinary response by the minority of the Senate. It \ncertainly goes beyond the question of Miguel Estrada, although I will \naddress what he has said and what he has testified during the course of \nour committee hearing. But it has been my good fortune to serve now for \nmy fifth year on the Senate Judiciary Committee, both under President \nClinton, a Democrat, and President Bush, a Republican; both under \nChairman Hatch as Republican chairman of the committee and Patrick \nLeahy of Vermont as the Democratic chairman. I have watched the ebb and \nflow of this process.\n  I think we have to stop and reflect for a moment about why we are at \nthis moment considering this nomination and taking it so seriously. It \ngoes to our oath of office. When each of us is sworn into the Senate, \nwe walk down this aisle and stand before the Vice President of the \nUnited States and swear to uphold the Constitution. And within that \nConstitution is an explicit delegation of authority to the Senate not \nto give blanket approval to any President's judicial nominees but to \nadvise and consent. It is natural that the President's party in \nCongress will always say forget the advice part, just consent, and let \nus get on with business. But, like it or not, we understand the \nresponsibility of the Senate is to ask the hard questions, to say if \nany nominee before you will receive a lifetime appointment to the \nFederal judiciary, particularly beyond the district level, the lower \ncourt level, to the circuit level where, in fact, many policy decisions \naffecting America are made, we want to know who you are. We want to \nknow what you think. We want to make certain we are putting a person in \nthis position of responsibility who can meet the challenge.\n\n  The obvious questions are there. We certainly ask whether a person \nhas a background and a knowledge of the law, whether they have a \nreputation for honesty, and whether they have appropriate temperament. \nBut other questions arise as well, questions as to whether this person \nseeking a policy- making position on the court who will stand in \njudgment of laws passed by the Congress is a person of moderation and \nis reasonable in their outlook. We cannot reach a conclusion on this \nsimply based on press reports. We have to ask the questions and seek \nthe answers. That has been done time and time again with nominees from \nDemocratic Presidents as well as Republican Presidents.\n  What is troubling to most of us who come to this floor and suggest \nthere is a problem with Miguel Estrada's nomination to the District of \nColumbia Circuit Court is he was so purposefully vague and so secretive \nin terms of his own point of view and his own philosophy. This is a man \nwho has academic and legal credentials. He is not a newcomer freshman \nfrom a bar exam coming before us. He is a man who, across the street \nfrom this building, sat as a clerk in the Supreme Court. He has advised \nthe Justices of the Supreme Court on some of the most important legal \nissues of our time.\n  Yet, when we asked him basic and fundamental questions, I was stunned \nby his efforts to really stonewall, to basically refuse to tell the \nSenate Judiciary Committee where he stands. In light of that, what is \nmy responsibility as a Senator? When this nominee refuses to disclose \nthe most basic information about who he is and what he believes and \nwhat is in his heart, am I at that point to step back and say let us \ngive him the benefit of the doubt; if he doesn't want to answer the \nquestions, so be it? I am not going to do that, and I will tell you \nwhy.\n  As a Member of the House of Representatives, I watched the Clarence \nThomas hearings for the Supreme Court. I was stunned when then-nominee \nClarence Thomas was asked his views on the issue of abortion, a major \nsocial policy and a major legal issue. He wasn't asked on a specific \nlaw whether he would rule one way or the other but just on the issue of \nabortion. Clarence Thomas said he had not really thought about that \nissue very much.\n\n[[Page S2128]]\n\n  That is an incredible statement for a man seeking a position on the \nSupreme Court in two respects. Clarence Thomas was a Catholic \nseminarian who went to a Conception monastery in Missouri known as \nConception Abbey. To think you could go through that training and never \nhave a view on the issue of abortion is absolutely incredible. To think \nyou can be a law student, as Clarence Thomas was when Roe v. Wade was \ndecided, and never have discussed the issue just defies any \ncredibility.\n\n  It, frankly, established a line of attack by those who want to go to \nthe highest courts of the land and avoid the tough and hard questions.\n  The Clarence Thomas tactic and strategy is being followed today by \nMiguel Estrada. Charles Schumer, Senator from New York, asked him a \nbasic open-ended question which you can ask any law student in their \nfirst or second year. When you look at the history of the Supreme Court \nof the United States and 200 years of decisions made by the men and \nwomen on the Supreme Court, is there one decision you would disagree \nwith? Is there one you could point to and say the Court made the wrong \ndecision? I hope most Americans would say some are fairly obvious; the \nDred Scott decision, which basically recognized slavery in this \ncountry; Plessey v. Ferguson, which said separate but equal is a fair \ncivil rights standard--the list goes on and on.\n  Yet, Miguel Estrada, with all of these academic decisions and all of \nhis experience before the Supreme Court, refused to name one decision \nby the Supreme Court he would disagree with. What does that tell you? \nThat this man is such a blank slate it has never crossed his mind that \na decision by the Supreme Court over time has been found to be wrong \nfor this United States, or a decision by the Supreme Court has been \nfound to be violative of constitutional values and principles?\n  What is going through his mind? The Clarence Thomas tactic--don't \nanswer anything, don't say a word.\n  I asked Mr. Estrada a question. I sent it in writing to give him a \nchance to think about it. I asked, In terms of judicial philosophy, \nplease name several judges, living or dead, whom you admire and would \nlike to emulate on the bench.\n  Listen. If that were a question in a constitutional law course, you \nwould breath a sigh of relief saying, Thank goodness, this is easy. I \nought to be able to find one Justice, either liberal or conservative, \nthat I agree with, and maybe one on each side.\n  He said there is no judge, living or dead, whom I would seek to \nemulate on the bench in terms of judicial philosophy, or otherwise.\n  It is breathtaking. This man wants to be taken into the Federal \njudiciary in the second highest court of the land for a lifetime \nappointment and is so cautious and so careful he can't name one Supreme \nCourt decision he disagrees with in the history of the United States, \nand can't name one judge, living or dead, whom he would seek to emulate \non the bench.\n  What does that tell you? It tells you the Estrada nomination is \nmaking a mockery of our constitutional responsibility in the Senate.\n  He has refused to disclose the legal memoranda he has written as a \nperson working at the Department of Justice and for the court. He has \nrefused to answer the most basic questions. And he comes to us and \nsays: Take it or leave it.\n  We hear that our opposition to him clearly must be because he is a \nHispanic, maybe conservative in his views. Excuse me. As a member of \nthe Judiciary Committee, I have repeatedly voted in favor of \nconservative nominees from the Bush White House. I understand this is \nthe President's prerogative, but I have tried to find in each of them a \nreasonable approach to the law and a reasonable understanding of the \nphilosophy of law which will give them a chance to be at least moderate \nin their approach on the bench. That is something all of us should seek \nto do.\n  I will have an opportunity later this morning to come to the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the Senator from Illinois, who had a long and \nimpressive record in the House of Representatives, is he aware of the \nstand that the Hispanic caucus has taken on Miguel Estrada?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am. It is instructive that this Hispanic nominee to \nsuch a high court is opposed by the Hispanic caucus. They have sat down \nwith Mr. Estrada in private and asked him questions about his views on \nissues, and they have come out in opposition to his nomination. There \nare many--myself included, and I have appointed Hispanics to the \nFederal bench in Chicago--who believe there should be more Hispanic \nnominees. Under the Clinton administration, quite a few nominees were \nbrought before the committee, and many were approved. That should \ncontinue. But doesn't it tell you something that this high level, high \nprofile appointment is opposed by the Hispanic caucus?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is the Senator aware that Republican Members of the \nHouse of Representatives who are not in that caucus because it is \npurely a Democratic caucus do support this nominee?\n  Mr. DURBIN. There are those who support this nominee.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I mean in the House of Representatives. The Senator is \ntrying to leave the impression that people of Spanish background in the \nHouse of Representatives all oppose this nominee.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I didn't say that. I said, if you check the record, that \nthe Hispanic caucus has come out in opposition.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Which is all Democrats.\n  Mr. DURBIN. At this point, the vast majority of those serving of \nHispanic origin are Democrats.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is all Democrats.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am sure the Senator from New York will catalog all the \nHispanic organizations that oppose this nominee. It is not just the \nDemocratic members of the Hispanic caucus. I see my colleague has come \nto the floor. I yield to the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I appreciate the many points made by my \ncolleagues with respect to this nomination. As I have listened to the \ndebate, not having been a member of the Judiciary Committee, I have \ntried to educate myself on what this is all about. I put myself into \nthe position of somebody at home who maybe just has turned on C-SPAN or \nis flipping channels and sees us talking about something. They are \ntrying to understand what this is all about.\n  I thought I would come to the Chamber and perhaps talk a few minutes \nabout what I think it is about and to try to answer some of the \nquestions that might be in the minds of New Yorkers and Americans.\n  First, it is about the nomination of a gentleman to become a judge on \nwhat everyone, regardless of what party you are or where you live in \nthe country or whether or not you are a lawyer, believes is the second \nmost important court in our land. Everybody knows under our system of \ngovernment the Supreme Court is the supreme court. It is the most \nimportant. But as we have gone through many decades of courts hearing \ncases, of new causes of action for people to be able to bring cases, \nwhat has emerged very clearly is that because the Supreme Court cannot \ntake every case that has to be finally resolved one way or the other, \nmany of the most important cases that are really significant to people \nliving from one end of our country to the other are finally decided in \nthe District of Columbia Court of Appeals.\n  This is the court that sits here, and it has some special \njurisdiction about environmental matters and labor matters and energy \nmatters. This is a really big deal court. This really matters. It is \nnot just any court. It is the DC Court of Appeals.\n  All of our courts of appeals are important and because as you go up \nthe Federal court system, you start with all of the district courts \nthat are in every State and sometimes, depending upon the size of the \nState and many parts of the State and decisions there, if you are not \nsatisfied with them, get appealed to the courts of appeal. It is like a \npyramid. It starts narrowing because the numbers of cases that can be \nheard, the kinds of issues that can be heard begin to narrow because, \nclearly, choices have to be made.\n\n[[Page S2129]]\n\n  Not everybody who starts a lawsuit in a Federal district court will \nbe able to get to the court of appeals. Even fewer will get to the \nSupreme Court.\n  When we face a decision of giving someone a lifetime job, we have to \ntake that seriously. We have to take it seriously whether it is a \ndistrict court or a court of appeals or the Supreme Court. Actually, \nthat is the way our Constitution set it up.\n  If the Constitution, which I think is, other than the Bible, the most \namazing document the world has ever seen, if the Constitution meant for \nthe President to say OK, this is who I want to sit on that bench, and \njust pick out any person who the President chose and just send them to \nthe bench, the Constitution would have said that. But that is not what \nthe Constitution says. The Constitution very clearly sets up what we \ncall a balance of power. That is an important concept. That is critical \nto how successful we have been as a nation. It is absolutely \nfundamental as to our democracy continuing to function over all these \nmany years because we have a balance of power.\n  We know human beings are fallible. We know that every one of us is \nflawed, and people get an idea that they are bigger than they should \nbe; they want more power. And we get this balance of power in our \nConstitution which has worked extremely well for our country.\n\n  Critical to that balance of power is the role that the Senate plays \nin advising and consenting with respect to the President's nominees for \nthe Federal court. It is right there in the Constitution. This is not \nsomething that Democrats or Republicans have made up for the purpose of \nthis debate. It is fundamental to our Constitution.\n  As a result, those of us who are honored to serve in the Senate--and \nthere haven't been very many over the course of our history; fewer than \n2,000 people have sat in this most important deliberative Chamber in \nthe history of the world--are bound by the Constitution. We take an \noath to the Constitution. We want to defend and protect the \nConstitution.\n  Therefore, when we look at our duties, among our most important \nduties are advising and consenting when it comes to judicial nominees \nfor lifetime positions on the courts established under our \nConstitution.\n  All of us take that responsibility seriously. But whether we are \nconfronted by a nominee to the DC Court of Appeals or certainly, if we \nare confronted by a nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court, maybe it keeps \nus up a little longer at night. It makes us feel even more strongly \nthat we have to make sure we are doing the right thing. We have to ask \nthe hard questions. We have to get the information. Because once we \nsign off on it, that person is there for life.\n  It would be like somebody hiring someone to do an important job. You \nwant to know that the person you are hiring to be a doctor or nurse in \nyour hospital, or to supervise the construction of your house, that \nthese are people qualified, able to answer your questions, that you \nconfidently believe can get the job done.\n  That brings us to what we are debating today, a very important court, \nlifetime appointment, second only to the Supreme Court in the number of \nimportant cases decided, rooted in our Constitution where we as \nSenators, representing the constituents we serve, are required, are \nduty bound under our Constitution to advise and consent with respect to \nthe President's nominations.\n  Now, I have voted for many judges since I have been in the Senate \nover the last 2 years, and those judges are not people, by and large, I \never knew personally or with whom I had any direct dealings. But the \nJudiciary Committee, which consists of Republicans and Democrats, is \ncharged with the responsibility of doing the work of trying to figure \nout whether somebody is qualified and whether they should get this \nlifetime appointment. They are the first of our colleagues to advise \nand consent, or advise and not consent. I know the members of the \nJudiciary Committee on both sides of the aisle, and they take that \nresponsibility very seriously.\n  With respect to Mr. Estrada, it has been a hard task to fulfill the \nresponsibilities entrusted to us in the Constitution to advise and \nconsent because there is no information. It is as though somebody walks \ninto the hospital and says: I want the very best doctor you can give me \nfor the condition that ails me, and I want to know where that person \nstands on the procedures he is going to use on me; I want to know what \nhe thinks about postoperative treatment, I want to know what drugs he \nbelieves are best, and I want to know where he ranks in terms of his \nbelief about whether or not I can be cured. Well, I am sorry we are not \ngoing to give you that information. Here is your doctor; you take him.\n  We are faced with a nominee who has thus far refused to answer \nlegitimate questions about what kind of a judge he would be, where he \nstands on the great issues of our time and of the past, what his \npositions are in thinking about these fundamental rights we cherish as \nAmericans, whom he respects or admires on the judiciary already, or \nwith whom he would compare and contrast himself. We cannot get answers \nto any of those questions. I don't necessarily hold Mr. Estrada \nresponsible for that. I know a little bit about the confirmation \nprocess. Having spent some time on the other end of Pennsylvania \nAvenue, I know he is doing what he has been told to do. He has been \ntold to sit there, don't say anything, don't answer the questions, \ndodge, duck, don't leave any record, don't let anybody pin you down, \nand, boy, we are just going to go right through the opening that is \ngiven to us and make up this case that will get you on the circuit \ncourt.\n  Well, I suppose that is a strategy, but it is an unconstitutional \nstrategy. It is a strategy that is absolutely contrary to what the \nFounders intended when they spent all those hot days in Philadelphia \nwriting the Constitution. They expected advise and consent to actually \nbe the responsibility of Senators. How can you advise and, certainly, \nconsent if you cannot even get basic information about where someone \nyou are going to give a lifetime job to stands on all these important \nissues?\n  It is not as though members of the Judiciary Committee didn't try. \nThey certainly tried. Led by my colleague and friend from New York, \nSenator Schumer, they tried every which way they knew. You have already \nheard this morning from Senator Durbin of Illinois how questions were \nphrased and, if he could not get an answer from Mr. Estrada, how they \nwould be rephrased, trying to get some information. It was a classic \nstonewall; there is no information, no record, nothing to which anybody \ncan point.\n  Now, that puts a Senator in a very difficult position. If you are \njust going to do what the White House tells you to do, what the \nPresident tells you to do, without regard to your constitutional duty \nto advise and consent, then it is an easy issue; you stand up, salute, \nand you vote, and that is it. But if you take seriously your \nconstitutional duty, then it is not so easy. I have to go back to New \nYork, and people will say: What kind of a judge do you think this will \nbe on the court that hears all these important issues? I have to say I \ndon't have a clue because we cannot get any information about him. We \ncannot discharge our constitutional duty to advise and consent.\n\n  I know my friends on the other side of the aisle say: Well, there is \nno information; this man is a blank slate; he has never been a judge; \nwe have no record; he has never been a law professor; he hasn't put a \nlot of his thoughts down in writing; so you have to take what you see. \nHere is this gentleman, and you just have to take it on face value that \nhe will fulfill the rather awesome responsibilities for which he has \nbeen nominated.\n  I just don't think that is good enough. I am just amazed that my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle are willing to abdicate the \nSenate responsibilities embedded in the Constitution, because when you \nstonewall the Judiciary Committee, when you refuse to answer questions, \nwhen you act as if you just came out of nowhere and don't have an \nopinion on anything, everybody knows that is a charade. Everybody knows \nthat. That is what you were told to do in the White House; therefore, \nyou are sitting there, not giving an answer, because if you gave an \nanswer, even some of the Republicans, people of the President's own \nparty, might be disturbed.\n  I went back and looked at some of the questions that were asked. I \nhave not been in law school for a very long\n\n[[Page S2130]]\n\ntime, but I cannot imagine any law student who, with a straight face, \ncould say I don't have an opinion on any Supreme Court case--not one \nsince the beginning of our Republic. I don't think that is a person who \nbelongs on the appellate bench. If you don't have an opinion, move out \nof the way and let somebody who has opinions, who understands the law, \nwho understands the Constitution, who knows what the Supreme Court has \ndecided--let that person take the position on the appellate bench.\n  It is hard to imagine someone sitting before the Judiciary Committee \nand saying he has no opinion on major Supreme Court cases. I find that, \nfrankly, unbelievable. Nobody believes that. My colleagues on the other \nside are willing to go forward with this charade and pretend that the \nman has no opinions when everybody knows he has opinions. He could not \nbe in the position he is in without opinions.\n  I pulled a quote from Chief Justice Rehnquist which I think really \nbears on this. Here is what Chief Justice Rehnquist had to say:\n\n       Since most justices [you could substitute ``judges'' as \n     well] come to this bench no earlier than the middle years, it \n     would be unusual if they had not by that time formulated at \n     least some tentative notion that would influence them in \n     their interpretation of the sweeping clauses of the \n     Constitution and their interaction with one another. It would \n     be not merely unusual but extraordinary if they had not at \n     least given opinions as to constitutional issues in their \n     previous legal careers.\n\n  Well, that is not me talking. That is Chief Justice Rehnquist. I \nthink you could certainly conclude from that that this nominee must be, \ntherefore, extremely unusual--so unusual that I don't think he deserves \nto be confirmed to the bench. Someone who has no opinions clearly does \nnot deserve the kind of responsibility and honor that this appointment \nsuggests.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is the Senator familiar with the statement made by the \nchairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, before the \nFederalist Society when he said:\n\n       Many of President Clinton's nominees tend to have limited \n     paper trails. Determining which of the President's nominees \n     will become activist is complicated and will require the \n     Senate to be more diligent and extensive in its questions of \n     a nominee's jurisprudential views.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I have heard about that, I respond to my \nfriend from Illinois. There is an old colloquial saying: What is good \nfor the goose is good for the gander. It seems to me, if that is the \nstandard the current chairman of the committee adopted in previous \nyears, then for the sake of consistency that ought to be the standard \ntoday. But, of course, that is not what this is all about, as my good \nfriend from Illinois knows.\n  What was an appropriate standard in the previous administration, when \nI believe the President nominated mainstream people willing to answer \nquestions, willing to present opinions, is no longer applicable now \nthat there is a different President. I think that is a very dangerous \nprecedent, and I do hope that Americans understand this: That the \nConstitution does not change from administration to administration.\n  The advise and consent role stays there for the Senate to exercise. \nIf the Senate willingly abdicates this role and decides, I have a \nPresident of my own party in the White House now, so I better not ask \nany questions because I may not like the answers, that is, I believe, a \ndirect repudiation of our constitutional obligations.\n  I know my good friend from Illinois asked a number of questions of \nMr. Estrada seeking some enlightenment, some information on the basis \nof which the Senator from Illinois could exercise his advise and \nconsent role. The best I can determine, it is very hard to see that the \nSenator got any answers.\n  I know in previous years, with many of the same people on the \ncommittee, very specific, explicit questions were asked of nominees. I \nknow that many of the nominees who were nominated by President Clinton \nwere asked very detailed questions about their views of Supreme Court \nand circuit court cases, and to the best of their ability, those who \nreceived hearings which, of course, was not everyone who was nominated \nby the President, but those of President Clinton's appointments who \nreceived hearings felt duty bound to answer those questions, and they \ndid so. They were asked questions such as: Please define judicial \nactivism. Do you agree with the Supreme Court's decision in a specific \ncase, such as United States v. Morrison? If you were a Supreme Court \nJustice, under what circumstances would you vote to overrule precedent \nin the Court? And on and on--very specific questions about the \nConstitution, about our Nation's laws, about Supreme Court decisions.\n  The nominees from President Clinton believed that was their \nobligation, and that is what they were instructed to believe from the \nother end of Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  Unfortunately, many of them were not even given hearings and many who \nwere given hearings were not given votes, and even some who were given \nvotes were never brought to the floor. That is then. What I am worried \nabout is now and how we are going to discharge our constitutional \nresponsibilities.\n\n  If one looks at the long list of people who have appeared before this \ncommittee in the past, it has always been the practice to seek \ninformation that committee members thought would be relevant to \nexercising their constitutional duties, to make sure this person at \nleast had an opinion about the Supreme Court decisions, to make sure \nthis person was not just someone sitting there to fill a chair, but \ncould actually discharge the duties that were about to be considered \nfor him.\n  What bothers me deeply is what I see: a developing of a difference in \nstandards. We are a country that has lasted so long because, among \nother reasons, we believe in the rule of law. It is not people but \nlaws. That is why we invest so much in our Constitution and setting up \ncourts and ensuring people who serve on those courts for lifetime \npositions are of the right stuff--not that they are conservative or \nliberal but that they are people who will not be swayed by political or \npartisan considerations, but will do the best with their God-given \nability the job with which they are entrusted, which is to continue the \nrule of law and to serve justice.\n  Therefore, it is troubling that when we had one President of one \nparty, the same people in this body wanted to ask everything they could \nask. They wanted to know what meetings you went to that had nothing to \ndo with your law practice. They wanted to know how you stood on \nreferenda as a citizen in States that use referenda to set laws. They \nwanted to know all this, and the people who were nominated complied. \nThey thought: I do not see the relevance of it, but if this is what is \nrequested, we will comply with it.\n  Now when we are just focusing on the core issues about the \nsuitability of someone for a lifetime appointment to the second highest \ncourt in the land, we cannot even get information that one would expect \nto get from a first year law student.\n  Obviously, a political decision has been made by the administration \nthat ``don't ask, don't tell'' applies to judicial nominees and, \ntherefore, we are in a position where we cannot discharge our \nconstitutional responsibilities.\n  It sort of surprises me, as well as disappoints me, that the \nadministration is taking this position. I guess we have to expect it \nbecause time and again this administration has proving itself to flout \nthe rule of law, to be very concerned with secrecy, unwilling to share \ninformation with the elected representatives of the American people, \nand, therefore, a pattern seems to be developing.\n  I do not care whether you are a conservative or liberal from New \nYork, Texas, California, Alaska, Hawaii--wherever--it is not good for \nour country to be adopting a policy that elevates secrecy over openness \nwhen it comes to judicial nominations and many other matters.\n  On many grounds, therefore, I stand here today quite troubled about \nwhat is developing with respect specifically to Mr. Estrada, with \nrespect to our Constitution, with respect to the refusal by this \nadministration to provide information legally requested by the Senate \nto fulfill its obligations.\n  I do not understand why we are in this position. I really do not. I \nhave gone back and read the quotes from the distinguished chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, someone I consider a very thoughtful leader on \nlegal issues,\n\n[[Page S2131]]\n\nand yet I do not follow the logic of having one standard for one \nadministration's nominees and another standard for this administration, \nand the willingness of the Senate to cede our constitutional \nresponsibilities. That strikes me as going right to the heart of what \nthe Senate is and should be.\n  Before I arrived in the Senate, I knew it from a distance, as an \nadmirer, a law student, a lawyer, and a law professor in my previous \nlife. I understood the critical role the Senate played, but I have to \nconfess until I actually came, sat in one of these chairs, looked \naround this august Chamber, and listened to my mentor and leader, \nSenator Byrd, describe to us how we happen to be here--not by some \naccident or bolt of lightning, but because of the genius of our \nFounders building on the ideas of those who came before, and that every \ngeneration of Americans has been obligated to continue this \nextraordinary experiment in constitutional democracy. We did not get it \n100 percent right at the beginning. We had a lot of work to do. And the \ncourts played a major role in saying, wait a minute, America, you say \nall these nice words. You act like these are your values, all men are \ncreated equal. What about black men? What about Native Americans? What \nabout women? Do you not think we ought to kind of make reality coincide \nwith rhetoric and really live up to this Constitution?\n  So for more than 200 years, that is what we have been doing. It has \nbeen a partnership: The executive branch, the legislative branch, the \njudicial branch. Decade after decade, we have taken stock of ourselves, \ndetermining what our real bedrock values are as a nation, and making it \nabsolutely clear we would continue to try to perfect our Union, to live \nup to those extraordinarily high ideals that no nation in the history \nof the world had even put down on paper, let alone tried to fulfill.\n  Part of what we are facing today is an agenda by some to really \nchange the direction of our country. Maybe it is a decision the people \nof the United States would support if they ever got to vote on it. \nMaybe it is a decision the people in this Chamber would support if we \never voted on it. But that is not how it is occurring. It really is by \nsecrecy and stealth. It is by nominees to our second highest court who \nwill not tell us what they believe on the most important issues facing \nus as a nation. It is a deliberate attempt to turn the clock back.\n  I read the documents that have come from organizations that work hand \nin hand with the administration about vetting and nominating nominees. \nI know they refer to the Constitution in exile. By that, I guess they \nmean the Constitution that expanded the civil rights, human rights, and \nopportunities of people in cases such as Brown v. Board of Education. \nThat is really sad, that their view of America is so narrow. They want \nto close doors, take up ladders of opportunity, turn the clock back. I \nthink that is very sad. Certainly they are entitled to their opinion, \nbut their opinion should be explicit. If that is the agenda, then let \nus have a democratic argument about it. Let's have a vote about it. \nLet's know what we are voting on, so when decisions get reversed, \nrights get taken away, people know it was not just foisted on them by \nsecrecy and stealth. It happened because of a debate, which is the \nheart of democracy, where people stood on both sides of this Chamber \nand said I do think we have gone too far and others could say, no, we \nhave not gone far enough and where is the middle and how do we come to \nsome resolution.\n  Why it is so important we focus on Mr. Estrada is because he is a \nstealth nominee, because he will not answer questions, and because of \nwhat we are attempting to determine as to our constitutional \nresponsibilities.\n  I have reviewed the transcripts of Mr. Estrada's hearings in front of \nthe committee. In a moment, I will relay several of the more concerning \nareas where we lack information. I want to highlight what two of my \ncolleagues on the Judiciary Committee have said about both the written \ninformation, which is very limited, and the oral response to questions \nfrom Mr. Estrada. Senator Kohl from Wisconsin has said, and I quote, I \npersonally have voted for 99 percent of the nominees that have come \nbefore this committee. In all of those cases, I felt that I knew what \nwe were getting when we voted. There was some record of some writings \nthat gave me an idea about how the nominee would perform as a judge. We \ndo not have much of a public record or written record.\n\n  Addressing Mr. Estrada, Senator Kohl went on, you have opinions, of \ncourse, on many issues, I am sure, but we do not hardly know what any \nof them might be, and some of us might have a tough time supporting \nyour nomination when we know so little.\n  Upon the eve of her vote on Estrada's nomination before the \ncommittee, Senator Feinstein said: Over the last few days, I have been \nreviewing background materials about Miguel Estrada, talking to those \nwho have concerns about him, and I have reread the transcript of Mr. \nEstrada's hearing. I must say that throughout this process, I have been \nstruck by the truly unique lack of information we have about this \nnominee, and the lack of answers he has given to the many questions \nraised by members of this committee.\n  Let me take a minute or two to highlight some of the important issues \nthat come before the DC Circuit and explain more fully why Mr. \nEstrada's answers are just not satisfactory. I do not expect to agree \nwith the vast majority of the judges this administration sets forth. I \nhave a different idea about the Constitution, about the philosophy that \nshould govern the rule of law. I am fully prepared to say that. I have \nalready voted for about 100 people I probably do not agree with on a \nlot of things, but they played by the rules. They respected the \nConstitution. They answered the Senators' questions, not my questions. \nI am not on the committee, but I trusted my Republican and Democratic \ncolleagues who were on the committee would ask good questions, as they \nalways do, get answers, and then they would make a judgment.\n  We have confirmed something like 100 judges in the last 2 years. I \ntrusted the Judiciary Committee, which is the first line of defense on \nadvise and consent, to do the hard work. I would then assess that and \nmake my decision. I cannot do that in this case. I wish I could. I \nmight still vote against the nominee because I might not agree with \nwhat he said in his opinions, but at least the process would be \nrespected, the advice and consent clause of the Constitution would be \nhonored.\n  That is not the case. If we look at the individual areas of concern, \nI think we begin to get an idea why Mr. Estrada does not want to answer \nquestions and why the administration does not want him to answer \nquestions, because even my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwould have some really hard questions if the nominee were permitted to \nanswer questions.\n  Let's start with the environment. The fact is the DC Circuit hears \nalmost all of the cases challenging environmental rules and regulations \nissued by the Environmental Protection Agency. These are extremely \nsignificant decisions. The court decides issues of national importance. \nIt decides issues of great local and regional importance. We may \ndisagree about the best way to protect the environment, but if we are \ngoing to go down a road where we pack the DC Circuit with judges who do \nnot have the idea that protecting the environment is a Federal \nresponsibility, we should know that. We should know what we are \ngetting. We are not buying blindly. We should know what we can expect. \nMaybe then the Congress, if it so chose, could rewrite laws or be clear \nabout congressional intent, but in the absence of knowledge we do not \nknow anything.\n  The court, in a 1999 decision, American Trucking Association v. EPA, \ndemonstrated not only its deep division but its potential for \ncircumventing the President and congressional intent. In that case, the \nDC Circuit decided not to review a ruling that struck down Clean Air \nAct protections against soot and smog. In fact, in the dissent, one of \nthe judges said the court's ruling ignored the last half century of \nSupreme Court jurisprudence. When the case got to the Supreme Court, in \na decision written by Justice Scalia, the DC Circuit was reversed. This \nwas not a Republican or Democrat or liberal or conservative decision. \nThis was a decision based on the precedence, the jurisprudence, the \nlaw.\n\n  Many of the cases that the circuit court of appeals decides in DC do \nnot\n\n[[Page S2132]]\n\ngo to the Supreme Court. Therefore, we have to be conscious of what a \nnominee's position is on environmental issues.\n  Across the board, environmental groups have opposed Mr. Estrada's \nnomination because he has consistently evaded questions on how he might \nconsider cases of vital environmental interest.\n  With respect to labor decisions and the National Labor Relations \nBoard, the DC Circuit hears many of those labor and worker-related \ncases. The court has decided more than 1,000 labor cases over the \nyears. The National Labor Relations Board administers the National \nLabor Relations Act, which is the primary law that governs \nrelationships between employers and employees. Of course, that is at \nthe root of our economy. We want people to be productive and work, but \nwe also want them not to be taken advantage of and mistreated. There is \na balance of power, to go back to my favorite concept, embedded in the \nConstitution. The Congress has worked it out over the last 50 years \nwhere workers have some rights, employers have some rights, and there \nis a system for adjudicating disagreements and grievances. Time and \ntime again, the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia has ruled on \nthese decisions and has consistently said that if a decision from the \nNational Labor Relations Board is supported by substantial evidence, \nthe courts are supposed to uphold it.\n  Unfortunately, many people are concerned and have spoken out against \nMr. Estrada's nomination because they have no way of knowing what, if \nany, opinions he has on these critical issues. It is a fair set of \nquestions to ask and to receive answers about.\n  When it comes to energy, certainly one of the most important issues \nthroughout our country, the DC Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over \ncases coming from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. That is \ncalled FERK. These cases are often up in the court of appeals, trying \nto figure out what is a just and reasonable rate of return for oil, \ngas, and electric companies. Therefore, the cases coming out of the DC \nCircuit affect everybody who has any power that is generated by oil, \ngas, and electricity around our country.\n  In many of these cases, not only individuals but States have big \nstakes in their outcome. When we think about ruling on these cases, it \nis only fair, since it may affect my energy bill, that I have some \nunderstanding from the Judiciary Committee whether this nominee has \nopinions, past track records, clients, anything that might affect his \nrulings.\n  Similarly, the DC Court has exclusive jurisdiction over cases arising \nunder the Federal Communications Commission. Again, that affects every \none of us. Do you have a television? Do you have cable? Do you enjoy \nthe mass media, the broadcast media? Do you have a telephone? Do you \nknow what rates you pay ultimately for long distance? Do you have a \nwireless phone? All of these issues fall under the FCC. Without any \nwritten record, again, we cannot get answers to questions about matters \nthat will affect every American.\n  Some of this may sound technical, and I understand that, but it is \neasily understood that the stark reality is the DC Circuit controls so \nmany of the rules under which we live every single day in our homes and \nworkplaces. This is not some abstract speculative concern about what \nmight happen to somebody else. What happens in this DC Circuit affects \neach of us. That is why I am so concerned that in the absence of \ninformation, in the absence of the Judiciary Committee believing they \nhave been able to make an informed decision and have not just done what \nthey were told to do by the administration, we may be setting up the \npeople we represent for all kinds of changes in their lives that were \nnever aired publicly, were never given due consideration, but which \nwill affect every one of us.\n\n  That is why this nomination cannot be handled lightly, why it cannot \nbe rammed through, why the Constitution and the rule of law, the role \nof the Senate to advise and consent, need to be respected.\n  When we think about where we are right now in the 21st century, we \nknow we have lots of big challenges ahead. We have national security \nchallenges, homeland security challenges, economic challenges, \nchallenges concerning health care, education, the environment, and \nenergy. There is a lot that lies in front of us. We need to bring to \nour considerations the same thoughtful, careful analysis that our \npredecessors in this body brought to theirs.\n  I am very worried that we are making decisions at home and abroad \nthat will affect our country and our children for generations to come. \nCertainly, judicial decisions fall into that category. The DC Circuit \nhas served as kind of a bullpen for the Supreme Court. More judges have \nbeen appointed to the Supreme Court from the DC Circuit than from any \ncourt in the land. That is often where the President looks to find \nsomebody qualified who understands the full range of constitutional and \nlegal issues that will very well end up in the Supreme Court. In fact, \nthe DC Circuit has given us three of the nine current Supreme Court \nJustices--Justices Ginsburg, Scalia, and Thomas.\n  Therefore, I have to be doubly careful about my vote. I don't know \nwhat will happen on the Supreme Court. I wish every one of the Justices \ngood health and a lot of energy for decades to come, but none of us \nknows where we will be tomorrow. We have no way of predicting our fate. \nIt could turn out that there might be an opening on the Supreme Court \nand it might very well be someone from the DC Circuit who could be \nchosen. So far as I know everyone else serving actually answered \nquestions, offered opinions, went through the process, gave the Senate \nthe opportunity to exercise our constitutional duty to advise and \nconsent.\n  If Mr. Estrada joins the court and all of a sudden an opening were to \noccur and the administration said to themselves, this was so good, we \ngot somebody through that nobody could even ask a question of or get a \nstraight answer from, let's just nominate him for the Supreme Court and \ndo the same thing, run the same drill, then I would hope my colleagues \non both sides of this aisle would say, no, no, I cannot let that happen \nto my Constitution. I may love my President but I love my Constitution. \nPresidents come and go but the Constitution remains.\n  We, at our peril, undermine it, disrespect it, disregard it, and this \nbody, at its peril, gives up its constitutional prerogative rendering \nit a debating society, at best, and irrelevancy, at worst. Here we are, \ndebating not just a nomination but debating the Constitution, debating \nthe rule of law, debating whether this Senate and its Judiciary \nCommittee will be able to fulfill its constitutional \nresponsibility. These are high stakes. Talking about many of the \nnominees to the district court of appeals, I just can't help but use a \nlittle history. I think those who do not know history are condemned to \nrepeat it. I know there is always a lot of revisionist history that \ngoes on to suit political, partisan, ideological--even commercial ends. \nBut these are the facts.\n\n  The former President nominated highly qualified people for the DC \nCircuit. Unfortunately, of those three nominees, two of them were given \na hearing, one was not; two were not given a committee vote, one was. \nIt took from 15 to 18 months for no action, no vote, and one out of \nthree was confirmed. We didn't even get the courtesy of a vote, even \nthough tons of information was turned over on the first two of these \nnominees.\n  From my perspective, that is water under the bridge. But I think it \nis telling because the Constitution did not change. As far as I know, \nthe same Constitution we had in 1990 is the Constitution we have in \n2003. The advice and consent clause didn't change, as far as I know. \nThe advice and consent responsibility was the same throughout the 1990s \nas it is now in the 21st century. Some nominees went to extreme lengths \nto provide every scrap of paper, every opinion requested, in order to \ndemonstrate their good faith and their respect for the Senate, their \nrespect for the Constitution.\n  In a previous time, I know my good friends on the other side of the \naisle, were he to have sat there and said, I have no opinion about \nanything, would have said: You are not getting my vote. You should not \neven get a hearing. You don't deserve one. Because somebody\n\n[[Page S2133]]\n\nwho comes before this committee and says he has no opinion about \nanything is clearly gaming the committee. Everybody knows that. I do \nnot think the committee would have stood for it in the 1990s.\n  The Democrats this time voted unanimously against Mr. Estrada on the \nbasis of his failure to answer questions and failure to appropriately \nand respectfully provide written material that was provided in previous \ninstances with respect to Justice Rehnquist and Justice Bork. That \nmaterial was not provided with respect to Mr. Estrada. So I think we \nreally obviously have a double standard. It is an ideologically driven \ndouble standard.\n  I think that is a mistake. I think it is always a mistake when we try \nto push through something that in the long run undermines the balance \nof power, the constitutional framework, the role and responsibility of \nthe Senate.\n  I have received countless letters, e-mails, and telephone calls about \nthis nomination. Many of the people have expressed their concerns about \nthe process in which we are engaged. A letter from a Utica, NY, \nconstituent, Anna Maria Convertino, sums up the objections my office \nhas been receiving. She gave me permission to quote from her letter. \nHere is what Anna Maria from Utica, NY, has to say:\n\n       I am writing to urge you to filibuster the nomination of \n     Miguel Estrada for the District of Columbia Court of Appeals \n     by voting no on cloture. Estrada has refused to answer \n     questions about his commitment to abortion rights or basic \n     civil rights. The burden should be on the nominee for a \n     lifetime appointment to show that he deserves to serve as a \n     Federal judge. Estrada's lack of an established record and \n     unwillingness to answer questions means that he has failed to \n     make this showing.\n\n  I certainly appreciate Anna Maria contacting me and summing up so \nwell the problems with this nomination.\n  Many people who have followed this closely, many major Latino and \nHispanic organizations across our country, and in New York, share those \ndoubts. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which has members from New \nYork City to LA, from Texas to Chicago, interviewed Mr. Estrada. After \nthat interview and reviewing his credentials, they concluded that he \nfailed to merit their endorsement. Today, the caucus again opposes his \nnomination along with the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education \nFund, the Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund led by the able work of my \nconstituent, Angelo Falcon; the National Association of Latino Elected \nand Appointed Officials, the California La Raza lawyers, the Southwest \nVoter Registration Project, the Illinois Puerto Rican Bar Association, \nand on and on and on.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator from New York yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I certainly will.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator was on the floor this morning when there was a \ncolloquy between this Senator and the senior Senator from Illinois. \nThere was a question that arose as to the number of people in the \nHispanic Caucus in the House. I have since checked that and determined \nthere are 20 in the Hispanic Caucus in the House. The only Hispanic \nMembers of the House of Representatives, I am told, who are not members \nof that Hispanic Caucus, are three in number. So it is 20 who are \nmembers of the Hispanic Caucus and 3 who are not.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I appreciate the clarification from my good friend from \nNevada. Certainly, having worked with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus \nover many years, I know they are a national organization, representing \npeople throughout our country. They did not reach this conclusion \nlightly. They interviewed Mr. Estrada. They asked questions. They \nsought information. They talked to other people who knew him, had \nworked with him. They really tried to do due diligence. They tried to \ndo the job that the Judiciary Committee should do, trying to get at \nwhat is it about this nominee that we can either oppose or support. At \nthe end of their inquiry and investigation, they concluded that they \ncould not support him.\n  I am sure that was a difficult decision, from talking with my friends \nin the Hispanic Caucus. It was a very tough decision because on the \nface of it, this looked like a no-brainer: Line up behind Mr. Estrada, \nvote for him, put him on the DC Circuit, and everybody can go home and \nsay: Look what I did; I voted for this nominee.\n  But that is an abdication of responsibility. That is truly the kind \nof action that undermines faith in our democratic process--to abdicate \nyour intelligent, careful analysis of someone just to be able to check \na box. I thought it was very courageous of the Hispanic Caucus to say: \nWe have looked into this, we have investigated it, and we cannot \nsupport him.\n  Therefore, please--please--at least try to find out what this man \nstands for, what he would do, what he believes in, because we have not \nbeen able to do so.\n  Part of why many of us are coming to the floor is that this is a \ntroubling nomination on many grounds. I know there are those, such as \nmy friends in the Hispanic Caucus, who are troubled by the nominee and \nwhat he stands for or doesn't stand for, what he would do or not do, \nand the failure to get information.\n  I know my colleagues on the Democratic side in the Judiciary \nCommittee were extremely troubled--including people, as I have just \nquoted, who historically vote with a President on a nominee--and were \nvery pained about having to say, I can't do it this time.\n  I know, too, that many of us are concerned because, if the Judiciary \nCommittee cannot do the work, we can't do the work. We can't call Mr. \nEstrada into our office and put him under oath and ask him the \nquestions that he wouldn't answer when my colleagues from Illinois and \nfrom New York and from Wisconsin and California and everywhere else \ncould not get answers out of him.\n  But fundamentally, even beyond the procedures--the failure to answer, \nthe kind of stealth campaign that the administration is running, the \ndon't ask, don't tell--the nomination process is the Constitution. I \nthink there are certain duties, whether you are a constitutionalist, an \noriginalist, a Federalist--whatever you are, whatever the label you \nwant to pin on yourself might be--there are certain duties that cannot \nbe delegated. There are responsibilities embedded in the Constitution \nthat were given to us by our Founders in Philadelphia, and among the \nmost important is the importance of the role of the Senate to advise \nand consent.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Certainly.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator aware that Miguel Estrada has argued 15 \ncases before the Supreme Court?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Yes, on behalf of clients--not on behalf of himself.\n  Mr. HATCH. He won 10 of them. Right?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I am aware of that.\n  Mr. HATCH. Has the Senator from New York read any of those briefs \nthat he filed in that court?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I have reviewed a number of them. I certainly am no \nexpert on the cases, but I concede the point to the chairman that Mr. \nEstrada has argued cases on behalf of clients whose positions he was \nadvocating and has done so extremely well.\n  Mr. HATCH. And he has done it on behalf of clients as an attorney \nshould.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Indeed. But he is not representing his clients before \nthe Judiciary Committee. He stands there as Miguel Estrada for a \npotential lifetime appointment to the second highest court in the land. \nTherefore, he can no longer speak for clients. He must speak for \nhimself.\n  Mr. HATCH. He did.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. That is not the conclusion reached by the Democratic \nSenators, nor by the Hispanic Caucus, nor by many who have followed \nthis nomination closely--to ask a man of his record before the Supreme \nCourt whether he had an opinion about any Supreme Court decision and \nfor him to say, no, he did not, is absolutely unbelievable.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator aware that the Hispanic Caucus in the House \nis made up of all Democrats because they would not meet the Republicans \nwho were left out of the caucus?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I am very well aware of the makeup of the Hispanic \nCaucus. I have worked with members of the Hispanic Caucus for many \nyears.\n  I think it is also fair to look at the geographical diversity and the \nexperience base of these people who represent Americans from New York \nto L.A. and from Texas to Chicago who went to the\n\n[[Page S2134]]\n\ntrouble to interview the nominee and concluded by their own efforts \nthat he was not going to be acceptable in part because they couldn't \nget adequate information on which to base a good decision.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator aware that the Democratic Hispanic Caucus \nin the House was actually almost equally divided as to whether or not \nto support Miguel Estrada, but the majority made the----\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I think what I judge is by what people say at the end \nof a conclusive discussion and what they determine based on their own \nconsideration. Much of my concern is based on the Constitution and the \nrole of this body--not on what people did or didn't do, although I \nthink that is instructive, and I think it is very helpful. It does have \nsway with me because I don't believe we have developed an adequate \nrecord in the Judiciary Committee that would give even those of us who \nmight end up opposing his nomination--I don't know that for a fact--an \nadequate basis on which to exercise our constitutional responsibility.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield again for a question?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Yes. I will.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will try not to interrupt the Senator anymore, but the \npoint I was making with the briefs in the Supreme Court--15 of them and \nmore--is that there is a record from which you certainly can determine \nlegal reasoning, as well as an extensive stack of records of the \nJudiciary Committee hearings. And let me say this. Those hearings were \nconducted by none other than the Senator's colleague from New York, \nSenator Schumer, and other Democrat Senators who said the hearings were \nfairly conducted. Is the Senator aware of all of that?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I say to my good friend from Utah, I am aware of all \nthat. But I have to respectfully point out several responses.\n  A long time ago I used to practice law. I represented a lot of \nclients of different kinds, all sorts of folks. Their views and their \npositions were not necessarily mine. I won some and I lost some in the \ntrial court, in the appellate court, and in the administrative hearing \nroom, but I do not believe that any of my clients spoke for me. My \nadvocacy on behalf of clients was not the same as my positions about \nthe law, about constitutional issues, and about many other matters. So \nthe fact that someone has practiced law and that someone has argued \ncases is a factor to take into account. I certainly believe that is a \nsignificant factor. But that is not determinative. That is not in any \nway decisive when it comes to giving someone the opportunity to have a \nlifetime position on the second highest court in the land.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator from New York yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. REID. I want the Senator to know that I met with the chairman of \nthe Hispanic Caucus and other members of the caucus, plus a number of \npeople on a conference call a few days ago--in the last week or 10 \ndays. Is the Senator aware that on that telephone call I was told that \nevery member of the Hispanic Caucus--all 20 of them, every one of \nthem--opposed the nomination of Miguel Estrada to be a member of the \nDistrict of Columbia Court of Appeals?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. The Senator is absolutely correct. In fact, I have a \ncopy of the September 25, 2002, letter written by the Congressional \nHispanic Caucus to the then-chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nannouncing the decision to oppose the nomination.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield on another point?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator aware that every Republican Hispanic member \nin the House is totally in support of Mr. Estrada?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I am well aware that there are three Republican \nHispanic Members in the House who are not members of the Hispanic \nCaucus. I understand that.\n  Mr. HATCH. And that there are four of them.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I would be more than happy to have them send a letter \nexplaining the reasons as to why they support him other than the fact \nthey have been told to do so by the Republican leadership of the House \nand the administration.\n\n  What I have from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus is a very well \nreasoned letter setting out the decision as to why all 20 members of \nthe Hispanic Caucus would not support this nomination. I think it is \ninstructive.\n  It is instructive to read the thinking of the Hispanic Caucus. Of \ncourse, much of it rests on the fact that there is such a limited \nrecord. It is very hard to determine what it is this gentleman would \ndo. I think the Hispanic Caucus raises some very telling points which \nhave not been adequately addressed in the process up until now.\n  For reasons of our Constitution, of our rule of law, of our \nnomination process, of our Senate and its prerogative, as well as the \ndecision apparently made by the administration to adopt a don't ask, \ndon't tell policy when it comes to important lifetime appointments on \nthe Federal judiciary, I certainly will have to oppose this nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will speak more to the constitutional \nissues later.\n  I have to say that I totally disagree with the distinguished Senator \nfrom New York, much as I respect her. I don't think her analysis of the \nConstitution is anywhere near accurate.\n  Second, I was told by people for whom I have great respect that when \nthe vote came up, when they were discussing whether or not the Hispanic \nCaucus in the House, all Democrats, were going to oppose Miguel \nEstrada, there was almost an equal split of those who thought it was \ninadvisable to do that. Of course, after the majority makes that \ndecision, I suppose they went along with that. But that was my \nunderstanding. If it is incorrect, I would be happy to be corrected.\n\n  I also want to make it clear that the three Republican Hispanic \nMembers of the House--all three very outstanding individuals, who have \nstood up for Hispanics all of their careers, all three of them speak \nfluent Spanish--they were basically not allowed to meet with the \nDemocratic Hispanic task force or caucus in the House, and they are \ntotally in favor of Miguel Estrada.\n  Having said those few things, I want to take a moment to talk about \nwhat we are seeing on the nomination of Miguel Estrada. What we are \nseeing is just another step in a campaign to stall action on President \nBush's judicial nominees. It has gotten to the point that the tactics \nthat some of my Democratic colleagues are using are so predictable that \nit is as if they are working from a handbook. I suspect that this \nhandbook had its origins in the Democrats' April 2001 retreat, where \nleading liberal law professors--of course, most of the law schools in \nthis country are filled with leading liberal law professors, or at \nleast liberal law professors--they urged the Democrats in that \nconference to change the ground rules on judicial confirmations. What \nresulted from this retreat is something that can be called--if you will \nnotice this chart--the Senate Democrats' ``weapons of mass \nobstruction'' handbook.\n  Let's take a look at some of the weapons in this handbook. Let me \nturn to the first bullet on the chart. The first weapon suggested by \nthese liberal law professors was to bottle up nominees in committee.\n  We have seen a lot of that in the last 2 years, is all I can say, \nespecially with regard to circuit court nominees. They have allowed a \nsignificant number of district court nominees to go through. These are \nthe trial courts, where it is very unlikely to get into the major \nquestions of law that have to be decided by appellate courts, although \nthey certainly are important.\n  Since the judiciary is a separate, coequal branch of government to \nthe President and to this Congress, this is important stuff. But their \nfirst weapon in their handbook was to bottle up nominees in committee.\n  When control of the Senate shifted to the Democrats in June 2001, we \nsaw an immediate halt of nomination activity in the Judiciary \nCommittee, especially of circuit court of appeals nominees. The \nPresident was not being treated as other Presidents have been. Even \nthough other committees held nomination hearings prior to \nreorganization, and even though the Judiciary Committee held other \nhearings, no nomination hearings were held for more than\n\n[[Page S2135]]\n\na month, despite the fact of a looming vacancy crisis and plenty of \nnominees awaiting a hearing. In fact, as we stand in the Chamber right \nnow, we have a crisis of around 25 or 26 emergency seats, most of them \ncircuit court of appeals seats, in this country today. It is a judicial \ncrisis where people cannot get their cases decided.\n  Then, once we did start considering nominees, the committee \nconsidered only one circuit court nominee at a time. When I was \nchairman during the Clinton administration, I considered more than one \ncircuit nominee at 11 different hearings. But not once during the 107th \nCongress did the Democrats hold a hearing on more than one circuit \nnominee at a time. So bottling them up in committee has been a definite \npractice that came out of that retreat.\n  The point is, as I have been making it here, the first weapon in the \nDemocrats' handbook--that of bottling up nominees in committee--was \nsomething that worked only as long as the Democrats controlled the \ncommittee. Since this is no longer the case, and we are now holding \norderly hearings, fair hearings, with expedition, because the \nRepublicans were fortunate enough to be able to take over control of \nthe Senate, the President is now being treated fairly, as I believe I \ntreated President Clinton in almost every instance--in fact, in every \ninstance as far as I was concerned.\n\n  We put through 377 Clinton judges, the second highest total in the \nhistory of the country for any President, and only five less than the \nhighest total of Ronald Reagan. And Reagan had 6 years of a \nRepublican--his own party--Senate to help him. President Clinton had 6 \nyears with an opposition party--the Republicans--to help him. And we \ndid. You can point to some instances where I wish we had done better, \nbut as far as totality, as far as getting it done, we did the job for \nPresident Clinton, and we treated him fairly. And he, I think, knows \nit.\n  Let's look at some of the other weapons they have used that came out \nof that retreat. One of the most potent weapons of mass obstruction has \nbeen to try to inject ideology into the confirmation process--yes, try \nto inject ideology into the confirmation process. Miguel Estrada's \nnomination is a prime example of how that has worked.\n  Some of my Democratic colleagues claim they oppose Mr. Estrada's \nnomination because he allegedly was not responsive to their questions \nat his hearing. I think we just heard an hour's worth of that. This is \na laughable assertion. Mr. Estrada's hearing, which was held while the \nDemocrats controlled the committee, and chaired by the distinguished \nother Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, lasted all day. Mr. Estrada \nwas asked dozens and dozens of questions, all of which he answered.\n  The real problem that some of my Democratic colleagues have with Mr. \nEstrada is not that he did not answer their questions but that his \nanswers did not give them any reason to oppose him. That is what the \nreal problem is here. He testified that he would follow binding \nprecedent--what more could you ask of a circuit court of appeals \nnominee--that nothing in his personal views would interfere with his \nability to follow the law. What more could you ask of a circuit court \nof appeals nominee?\n  For some of my Democratic colleagues, this is not enough. They want \nto delve into Mr. Estrada's ideology to understand his personal views \non whether Supreme Court cases were correctly decided, and use those \npersonal views as the yardstick by which they measure whether he is \nworthy of confirmation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Does the Senator recall a speech he made to the \nFederalist Society? I will quote from his statement there:\n\n       [M]any of President Clinton's nominees tend to have limited \n     paper trails. Determining which of the President's nominees \n     will become activists is complicated and will require the \n     Senate to be more diligent and extensive in its questions of \n     a nominee's jurisprudential views. . . .\n\n  Does the Senator recall making that speech to the Federalist Society?\n  Mr. HATCH. I sure do. I agree with that statement to this day. I \nagree where there are no paper trails, you should ask questions. I am \nsure the Senator will agree with me, the Democrats controlled the \ncommittee, they controlled the hearing that day. It was a lengthy \nhearing. They asked every question they wanted to ask. They weren't \nhappy with some of the answers, but that was probably par for the \ncourse. It was, certainly, when I was chairman of the committee.\n\n  But injecting ideology into the confirmation process is misguided, at \nbest, and down right irresponsible at worst. It is not, as some \nSenators have suggested, essential to executing our duty of advise and \nconsent. But do not merely take my word for it. My goodness, Heaven \nforbid.\n  During the course of this debate, I have already mentioned the \nstatements that Lloyd Cutler made on this point. Again, I mention Lloyd \nCutler because both sides of this body respect him. We both know he has \nbeen an excellent servant of the people. We both know he is a great \nlawyer, not just in the District of Columbia but throughout the \ncountry.\n  I have participated in forums with Lloyd Cutler, and I have nothing \nbut respect for him. I have not always agreed with him--I have to admit \nthat--but, by and large, we have agreed on most issues.\n  I have already mentioned statements Lloyd Cutler has made on this \npoint, but I believe they are worth repeating because some of my \ncolleagues keep resurrecting the spurious allegation that Mr. Estrada \nwas not forthcoming at his hearing.\n  Mr. Cutler, as we all know, served this country as counsel to \nPresident Carter, and President Clinton, by the way. He also served on \ntwo national commissions that addressed problems in the confirmation \nprocess.\n  He said:\n\n       Candidates should decline to reply when efforts are made to \n     find out how they would decide a particular case.\n\n  That is just a rule that both sides have followed even before Mr. \nCutler made that very erudite statement.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Can the Senator point to any question asked of Miguel \nEstrada by either a Democratic or Republican Senator as to how he would \nrule in a particular case during the course of the confirmation \nhearing? Did any Senator violate the standard Lloyd Cutler enunciated \nin asking Miguel Estrada to tell us how he would rule in a particular \ncase?\n  Mr. HATCH. One of the Democrats on the floor said, if I recall \ncorrectly, he asked the question, what is your belief about the first \namendment. Gee whiz, I could teach law school class for over 3 months \non that subject alone. Another--it may have been the same Senator--said \nhe wanted to know in his questions whether he was going to overturn all \nof the clean air, clean water, and environmental rules, because this \ncourt is so important.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Does that relate to a particular case we are asking him \nto tell us about or rather his views on the Constitution?\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator is an excellent lawyer. I know he is. I have \ntremendous respect for him. He sits on the committee. I enjoy him. But \nwhen you ask questions like that, those are areas where cases come \nbefore the Circuit Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is it the Senator's position we should not ask a question \nof a nominee in any area of law that might come up in any case a judge \nwould rule on?\n  Mr. HATCH. No, I think the Senators on the committee can ask any \nquestions they want to, but I think it is incumbent upon the nominee to \nfollow Mr. Lloyd Cutler's suggestion that ``candidates should decline \nto reply when efforts are made to find out how they would decide a \nparticular case.''\n  I suspect anybody can discuss general law, but that is not what the \ndistinguished Senators were interested in.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator one last question: Can he point to any \nquestion asked by any Senator that went beyond general law and asked \nMiguel Estrada how he would rule on a particular case?\n  Mr. HATCH. I think I just gave two illustrations that certainly were \nquestions of law that could come before the\n\n[[Page S2136]]\n\ncourt. I might add Mr. Estrada was asked to criticize Supreme Court \ncases. Here a Supreme Court advocate who has to appear before the nine \nJustices on the Court is asked to criticize Supreme Court cases that he \nwill be bound to follow as a circuit court judge.\n  By the way, if I recall it correctly, the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois just a short while ago was criticizing Mr. Estrada because in \nthe whole history of American jurisprudence, from the beginning to the \nend, he couldn't come up with cases like Dred Scott, Plessy v. \nFerguson, but the question, if you read in the record was, in the last \n40 years, could you tell us three cases you disagreed with.\n  I believe he could have, maybe. I don't know. But when you are under \npressure and you are sitting there and you are trying to answer \nquestions, I don't think we should hold him to a standard that he has \nto meet these questions head on and absolutely come up with spur-of-\nthe-moment comments. I mean, I can come up with some, I am sure, right \noff the bat, but that was the last 40 years. There were three \nreferences to it, twice referring to 40 years. The middle one between \nthe two I am sure he felt he was talking about the last 40 years, not \nthe whole history of jurisprudence. The first case that has come to \nyour mind perhaps would be Dred Scott; certainly Plessy v. Ferguson. \nCould you name a whole raft of others, perhaps. I don't know. I don't \nknow how I would do if I was sitting there under pressure as Miguel \nEstrada was.\n\n  He is a young man. He has a lot of experience. He can talk about \ncurrent Supreme Court law as well as anybody in our existence. The fact \nis, I thought it was kind of unfair to try and hold him to that \nparticular standard. I am not criticizing my friend from Illinois, but \nto go back and read the record, you will find that was what the \nquestions were.\n  Now, regarding judicial nominees, Mr. Cutler has stated in \nunequivocal terms that candidates should decline to reply when efforts \nare made to find out how they would decide a particular case.\n  I would have trouble with a nominee if the nominee did try to reply \nin those cases. In his opinion, that is Mr. Cutler's opinion, ``what is \nmost important is the appointment of judges who are learned in the \nlaw''--certainly, Estrada is as learned in the law as anybody we have \nhad before the committee--``who are conscientious in their work \nethic''--my gosh, you can't find any fault with Mr. Estrada there; he \nis a hard worker--``and who possess what lawyers describe as judicial \ntemperament.''\n  We have heard some criticize Mr. Estrada because they think he might \nhave a temper. I think everybody in this body might have a temper. That \nis one heck of a poor allegation.\n  Mr. Estrada's academic achievement, his professional accomplishments, \nhis letters of support we received from his colleagues, many of whom \nare Democrats and top Democrats at that, and his ABA rating, the \nhighest the American Bar Association can give, ``unanimously well \nqualified,'' all indicate Mr. Estrada fits this description and \ndeserves our vote of confirmation--this description of none other than \nLloyd Cutler.\n  At the same hearing at which Mr. Cutler made his statements about the \nappropriate scope of the inquiry for confirming judicial nominees, \nanother legal luminary, one of the great lawyers in this town, a man I \nthink almost all of us look up to--certainly I do, and I think I am in \na position to know great lawyers when I see them--Boyden Gray, \ntestified for Mr. Estrada. Mr. Gray, of course, served as White House \ncounsel in the first Bush administration.\n  During his testimony, he told us that two Democratic Senators who are \nformer Judiciary Committee chairmen met with him very early in the \nadministration to let him know in no uncertain terms that if the White \nHouse was caught asking any potential nominee any questions about \nspecific cases, that nominee would be flatly rejected.\n  As Mr. Gray pointed out, that same philosophy is reflected in the \nJudiciary Committee questionnaire which all judicial nominees must \ncomplete before the committee will act on their nominations. It is an \nextensive questionnaire. The questionnaire asks:\n\n       Has anyone involved in the process of selecting you as a \n     judicial nominee discussed with you any specific case, legal \n     issue, or question in a manner that could reasonably be \n     interpreted as asking or seeking a commitment as to how \n     you would rule in such a case, issue, or question?\n\n  The clear goal of this question is to deter the White House from \ngetting commitments from potential nominees on how they would rule in \nspecific cases or commitments that they can overrule certain Supreme \nCourt cases. It now appears certain Senate Democrats want to forbid the \nWhite House from asking nominees how they would rule on specific issues \nwhile reserving that right for themselves. That seems a little \ninconsistent to me. Call it what you will, but this is a double \nstandard if I have ever seen one.\n  More fundamentally, it threatens the very independence of the Federal \njudiciary that our constitutional system of checks and balances was \ndesigned to preserve.\n  Let's face it--too many questions in the confirmation hearings of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees seem calculated politically to \nmanipulate the judicial selection process and to frustrate the \nappointment of judges who would refuse to follow a popular or \npolitically popular course when the Constitution and settled judicial \nprecedent provide otherwise.\n  Miguel Estrada was right not to fall into the trap of criticizing \nparticular Supreme Court cases that he may be called upon as a sitting \nFederal judge to uphold. My colleagues should be commending him for \nthis, not proffering it as a reason to vote against his confirmation.\n  Another weapon in the Democrat handbook is to, as we can see here, \nseek all unpublished opinions. This all came from that retreat: Bottle \nup the nominees as much as you can in committee. I think that even goes \nfurther--bottle them up on the floor, too. We will get to that. Inject \nideology into the confirmation process so you can say this fellow just \nisn't what we want on the court. Seek all unpublished opinions. Let's \ntalk about that.\n  For some nominees who have been judges for a decade or more, this \ndemand has resulted in the production of hundreds of opinions and \nrequired the expenditure of a significant amount of Federal dollars, of \nresources, of money, of effort, and of time. All the time judges spend \nproducing unpublished opinions meant they were not spending that time \nadjudicating cases before them.\n  While demands for unpublished opinions were outstanding, the \nDemocrats in control of the committee had a perfect excuse for not \nacting on their nominations. But the fact is that these nominees had \nample records on which to evaluate their qualifications for the Federal \nbench without seeking their unpublished opinions and diverting them \nfrom doing their job to be judges to satisfy the whim of a few \nDemocratic Senators.\n  I remember in the case of, I believe, Dennis Shedd--who is now \nconfirmed to the circuit court of appeals in his district--they asked \nfor all of his unpublished opinions which were, as I recall, in \nAtlanta, GA, and what was the reason? It was only to see if they could \ndig up something that would be against Dennis Shedd. Unpublished \nopinions? My gosh, I don't ever remember when we did that. But that was \na tool that was used throughout the process to delay. It was an \nexpensive tool to the taxpayers, with no real good fruit coming from \nit.\n  I will refer to the fourth one here. Another weapon is to demand that \nthe nominee produce internal memoranda that are not within the \nnominee's control. Isn't that an interesting one? We Democrats demand \nthat you produce your internal memoranda that you made, and did the \nresearch on, and that you wrote while you served the Federal \nGovernment--even though you don't control that and even though it is \ntightly controlled--or should I say those memoranda are tightly \ncontrolled.\n  We saw the debut of this weapon to obstruct the confirmation of Mr. \nEstrada, and I expect we will see it again. I don't believe a day of \nthis debate has gone by without one Democratic colleague complaining \nthat there is an ``incomplete record'' on him without the record he \noffered as an Assistant Solicitor General of the United States.\n\n[[Page S2137]]\n\n  This complaint ignores many facts. First, every living Solicitor \nGeneral opposes the Democratic efforts to obtain these memoranda. \nSecond, both the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal--many \nwould say they are on opposite sides of the fence--also oppose these \nefforts. Third, this demand for internal Department of Justice \nmemoranda is unprecedented, as the Department itself has explained in a \nlengthy letter.\n  Finally, this demand for internal memoranda ignores the abundant \nrecord of Mr. Estrada. This man has argued 15 cases before the U.S. \nSupreme Court. He won 10 of them. In each one of those cases, he \nauthored a brief that anybody can get ahold of. In each one of those \ncases, there is a transcript of the oral arguments that anyone can get \nahold of. Certainly, members of the Senate Judiciary Committee can get \nahold of them. Surely, my Democratic colleagues can evaluate Mr. \nEstrada's legal reasoning and fitness for the Federal appellate bench \nby examining these briefs and transcripts.\n  Each weapon of obstruction that I have mentioned was most potent when \nthe Democrats controlled the Judiciary Committee. Now things have \nchanged. Democrats no longer control the committee and, as a result, \nMiguel Estrada's nomination is being debated on the Senate floor. This \nmeans that the Senate Democrats must turn to their ultimate weapon of \nobstruction. I am going to peel off that last one. The ultimate weapon \nis the filibuster.\n  Well, filibuster is a potent but extreme weapon to rely upon for the \ndefeat of a judicial nominee. It is potent because it requires a \nsupermajority of 60 votes by 60 Senators to end it. It is extreme \nbecause it unduly politicizes the Federal judiciary, the one branch \nintended to be insulated from political pressure. Let's go through \nthese again. At the retreat, these law professors, who should have \nknown better but are more interested in ideology, in partisanship, \nDemocratic Party politics, in control of the judiciary, made these \nrecommendations: Bottle up nominees in committee. We saw a lot of that \nwhen they were in control. Now they cannot do that anymore, except that \nI suspect that because the Judiciary Committee has a rule that once \nthese nominees are put on a markup, any member of the committee can put \nthem over for a week, we will see that right exercised in every case. \nAt least, we have so far. So bottle them up in committee. Then inject \nideology into the confirmation process because, by doing that, you can \nsay I disagree with you and maybe you think you have a right to vote \nagainst him.\n\n  Look, we don't know how any nominee is going to vote once they become \na judge; it is a lifetime appointment. It is important to ask questions \nand try to do what we can to understand whether the nominee is capable \nor should be confirmed. To inject ideology into the confirmation \nprocess is a very dangerous thing. Thirdly, seek all unpublished \nopinions. That is the ultimate delay tactic, at a tremendous cost to \nthe taxpayers. I don't remember in the past where that was done, except \nit may have been done in a case where they were critical to the final \ndetermination. But it is done today because they want fishing \nexpeditions, or they wanted them to see if they could find some reason \nto oppose. Then, seek privileged internal memoranda.\n  Can you imagine what would happen to the Solicitor General's Office \nif secret memoranda that were used to determine what the Solicitor \nGeneral should do would be disclosed to the public in every case? Can \nyou imagine how that would chill getting responsible, accurate, and \nhonest opinions, so that the Solicitor General can rely upon them? \nAnybody who wanted to be a Federal judge would have to think, how can I \nwrite this so it won't come back to haunt me in the future rather than, \nhow can I write this to do it right and help my Solicitor General. And \nthen the ultimate weapon, if you cannot do anything else, is the \nfilibuster.\n  Now, to filibuster a nominee would be an unprecedented, dangerous \nweapon to use. As best I can tell, a true filibuster has never been \nused to defeat a circuit court nominee. In fact, no filibuster has been \nused to defeat a circuit court nominee. Its contemplated use now \nagainst Miguel Estrada's nomination has been soundly criticized. I was \ntold a short while ago that my colleagues on the other side have \ndecided to filibuster. I don't believe the reasonable people on the \nDemocratic side are going to resort to that type of a weapon. But if \nthey do, they will be following the advice of these law professors who \nhave never been Senators and who are from the far left of the political \nand legal spectrum.\n  The filibuster is an unprecedented and very dangerous weapon, never \nbefore used to defeat a circuit court nominee. In fact, it has never \nbeen used to defeat a district court nominee either. Let me go a little \nbit further here.\n  Just last week, the Washington Post, our local newspaper--but \nnational in scope--declared:\n\n       [A] world in which filibusters serve as an active \n     instrument of nomination politics is not one either party \n     should want.\n\n  That was February 5--last week. The Post is absolutely right. Once we \ngo down that road, that works both ways. I would not want it to, but it \nnaturally will.\n  The Wall Street Journal concurred in the Washington Post's sentiment. \nYou can see the quote:\n\n       Filibusters against judges are almost unheard of. . . . If \n     Republicans let Democrats get away with this abuse of the \n     system now, it will happen again and again.\n\n  Mr. President, copies of these editorials have been printed in the \nRecord.\n  Filibusters of judicial nominees allow a few Members of this body to \nblock the confirmation of any Federal judge, a prospective member of \nour third coequal branch of Government.\n  I have taken to the floor time and again for Democratic and \nRepublican nominees alike to urge my fellow Senators to end debate by \nvoting to invoke cloture which requires the vote of 60 Senators. Most, \nif not all, of these occasions did not represent true filibusters but \nwere situations in which nominees were, nevertheless, forced to \novercome a procedural obstacle of a cloture vote.\n  I am not alone in my disdain for forcing judicial nominees to a \ncloture vote. The distinguished minority leader himself once said, on \nthis double standard for the use of the weapons, Democrat leader Tom \nDaschle, one of my friends and a person for whom I have a lot of \nrespect:\n\n       As Chief Justice Rehnquist has recognized: ``The Senate is \n     surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, \n     but after the necessary time for inquiry it should vote him \n     up or vote him down.'' An up-or-down vote, that is all we \n     ask.\n\n  I think that was wise advice then, and I think it is wise advice now.\n  The ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, my friend Senator \nPatrick Leahy, said:\n\n       I, too, do not want to see the Senate go down a path where \n     a minority of the Senate is determining a judge's fate on \n     votes of 41.\n\n  In other words, 41 Senators can stop any judge once that road is \ntaken. And once we go down that path, that will be a doggone mess and a \ndoggone tragedy to this country.\n  Another one of my Democratic colleagues, himself a former chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee and a friend of mine, Senator Ted Kennedy, had \nthis to say:\n\n       Nominees deserve a vote. If our Republican colleagues don't \n     like them, vote against them. But don't just sit on them--\n     that's obstruction of justice.\n\n  He was right then and that quote is right today. Of course, each of \nmy Democratic colleagues made these remarks when a Democratic President \nwas appointing judicial nominees. It appears that if they filibuster \nthis nominee on the thinnest of excuses--in fact, I do not think they \nhave any reasons to, other than their fear that he is a Hispanic \nconservative Republican who may not rule the way they want him to rule \nin the future and who may some day be considered for the Supreme Court \nof the United States of America--it appears there must be a double \nstandard for the use of these weapons.\n  Let me tell you the origin of the word ``filibuster'' because that is \nan important word here today. It comes from the Spanish word \n``filibustero,'' meaning a pirating or hijacking. It is just one more \nobstruction that has never been used in the case of Federal judges, for \neither the circuit court of appeals or for the district court.\n  That is exactly what an unprecedented filibuster of this nominee \nwould\n\n[[Page S2138]]\n\nbe: A hijacking of the Senate. What it amounts to is two more simple \nEnglish words: More obstruction.\n  There was one true filibuster in the history of the Senate--I have to \nacknowledge that--and that was a filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee, \nAbe Fortas, back in 1968, if I recall it correctly. There was a \nbipartisan filibuster. There were plenty of Democrats and plenty of \nRepublicans who voted against cloture in that case. I think they were \nwrong, whoever voted that way. Richard Nixon was for allowing the vote \nto go forward without a filibuster. But the Senate wisely has never \nutilized a true filibuster since that day. To use it on this nominee \nbecause some have said he is not Hispanic enough, to use it on this \nnominee because some have said he does not have any judicial \nexperience--although Miguel Estrada was a clerk to Amalya Kearse of the \nSecond Circuit Court of Appeals and a clerk to Justice Anthony Kennedy \non the Supreme Court of the United States of America, and has argued 15 \ncases before that august body and numerous cases elsewhere. It seems to \nme he has a lot of judicial experience, though he has not sat on the \nbench.\n\n  If we take that opinion, then that virtually consigns almost every \nHispanic in this country, probably most African Americans--in fact, \nprobably everybody of a minority status--to never being a Federal judge \nbecause most Hispanics have never sat on a bench. There are those who \nhave, admittedly. Most African Americans have never sat on a bench, \nalthough there have been some on lower court benches in the State \ncourts particularly, and even in the Federal courts. But it basically \nsays you cannot make it if you have to have served as a judge before, \nno matter how brilliant you are. There are brilliant African Americans. \nThere are brilliant Hispanics. There are brilliant Native Americans. \nThere are brilliant Asian Americans. And we have brilliant people who \nhave never served as a judge who might have this opportunity some day \nthat Miguel Estrada hopefully will have.\n  Others have used other phony arguments against Miguel Estrada, such \nas he did not answer all the questions. That is par for the course. I \ndo not know many contested judicial nomination proceedings where all \nthe questions have been answered the way the questioners expected them \nto be answered.\n  Then they say: We cannot get hold of all these documents because he \ndid them confidentially while he worked at the Solicitor General's \nOffice, even though four of those seven living Solicitors General who \nare opposed to that type of release of documents are leading Democrats \nin this country. They will not even listen to their own leading \nDemocrats, let alone leading Republicans.\n  I am just imploring my colleagues on the other side: Do not go down \nthe terrible path of filibustering this nominee or any other nominee. \nIt is not only dangerous, it would establish a precedent that literally \nwould be offensive to the country, offensive to the Constitution, \noffensive to the judicial system, offensive to the third branch of \nGovernment, and offensive to any reasonable person who believes the \nPresident's nominees ought to get a fair hearing and they ought to get \na vote up or down on the Senate floor. That is where we make that \ndetermination.\n  If the Democrats have enough votes to defeat Miguel Estrada, I am not \ngoing to complain about it. I might feel badly about it, and I might \nsay it was the wrong thing to do, but they have a right to do that. If \nwe have enough votes on this side, with hopefully the help of a number \nof our friends on the other side, then that is the way it should be. \nMiguel Estrada should go on that bench.\n  Unfortunately, I believe one of the arguments that is flitting around \nin the background in the penumbras and emanations of the Senate is he \nmight some day be asked to be the first Hispanic on the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, and that is the real reason, among a few others that are not \nvalid as well, for the slowdown in a vote on Miguel Estrada.\n  Mr. President, I do not think we should have a filibuster, or a \npirating or hijacking of the judicial process. I think it would be a \nterrific mistake for Democrats to do. Every Republican is going to vote \nfor Miguel Estrada, and I believe a number of Democrats will as well--I \nhope a great number of them will--and they ought to have that right, \nright here on the floor.\n  If my colleagues who disagree do not like it, they can speak out. \nThey can give their reasons, and they can vote no. That will be what \nthey should do if they feel sincerely about this. Politics ought to be \nleft out of it. The fact that they suspect Miguel Estrada may not be \nexactly the way they would want a judge to act on their issues--I do \nnot know whether he will or will not, to be honest, but if the mere \nsuspicion is enough to vote against him without any real basis \notherwise, then I think we are treading on some very dangerous ground.\n  I believe in Miguel Estrada. I believe this President is doing \neverything in his power to reach out to people of color in this \ncountry. I believe we ought to help him. He certainly has indicated his \ndesire to do so, and he certainly has been doing it. This is a \nPresident who has put a number of Democrats on the Federal bench. I \nthink he wants to make sure we fill these seats and we get them done as \nbest we can. Naturally, any President worth his or her salt is going to \ntry to appoint people who, hopefully, agree with him or her. I think \nthat is the nature of the process, and that is what we get when we \nelect a President; we get that President's nominations to the various \nFederal courts.\n  This President is very sincere and has approached it probably less \npolitically than Presidents, Republican and Democrat, whom I have seen \nin the past. He deserves support. He deserves to be treated fairly. His \nnominees deserve to be treated fairly. Above all, Miguel Estrada should \nbe treated fairly. If the ``filibustero'' occurs, I guarantee he is not \nbeing treated fairly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this is an important debate. I acknowledge \nmy colleague, friend, and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Hatch, who has argued very vigorously day after day in support \nof the Miguel Estrada nomination.\n  For those who wonder why the Senate would be taking up time to \ndiscuss one man's nomination to one court, this debate goes to the \nheart of a very basic issue. The issue is the constitutional \nresponsibility of the Senate. After most of us who serve in the Senate \nare long gone and forgotten, some will harken back to this debate and \nmake reference to it to determine whether at this moment in history the \nSenate stood up for its constitutional authority and responsibility.\n  That constitutional authority and responsibility is found in article \nII, section 2, of the U.S. Constitution, which says that the Senate \nshall have the power to advise and consent to the nominees of the \nPresident to the courts of our land. That is an important \nresponsibility from the very beginning of this Republic.\n  There are those in the President's party who might like to change the \nConstitution when it comes to President Bush's nominees, to take out \nthe word ``advise'' and basically say ``consent''--just move on with \nit. If they could, we would move from a Senate to a rubber stamp. That \nis the choice: The Constitution or a rubber stamp.\n  I hope the Senate never reaches the point where we do not stop to ask \nimportant questions of nominees who are seeking a lifetime appointment \nto the Federal bench--no review by voters, no review by Congress. The \njudge is there for life, and, subject to malfeasance or the commission \nof a crime, they will stay in that position until they die or quit. \nThat is what is at stake.\n  Miguel Estrada was nominated by President Bush to serve on the DC \nCircuit Court of Appeals, a lifetime appointment to the second highest \ncourt of the land. This is an important nominee, important because we \nknow that when it comes to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, it is the \nAAA team for the Supreme Court. The White House has made it clear that \nMiguel Estrada may be in line to move up to the major leagues. So \nMiguel Estrada is not just another judicial nominee.\n  If we look at him--and I have had a chance to sit down and talk to \nhim--what a compelling life story he tells. Senator Hatch has recounted \nit, as others have. His legal credentials are\n\n[[Page S2139]]\n\nimpressive, but his views are so suspect that he has consistently \nrefused to say publicly what he believes.\n  I believe the decision of the Bush administration to affirmatively \nact to put a Hispanic nominee on the Federal bench is the right thing. \nA few weeks ago, President Bush said he was not in favor of affirmative \naction. With the nomination of Miguel Estrada, the White House is \naffirmatively acting to put a Hispanic on the bench. I support it. I \nsalute it. It is the right thing to do. I have been honored to appoint \na Hispanic to the district court in Chicago. I think it is important \nthat that court reflect the diversity of my city, my State, and our \nNation. The same thing is true on this court.\n  We have the question being raised by the Senator from Utah as to \nwhether or not Miguel Estrada, during the course of his nomination \nhearing, should be asked questions about his views on the Constitution. \nExcuse me, but if this Senate decides that we cannot ask a nominee to \nthe Federal court a question as basic as his views on our Constitution, \nthen we have been transformed into a rubber stamp: Take it or leave it. \nThe President sent the nominee. Vote for him or else.\n  A lot has been said of the quote from Lloyd Cutler, a man who is well \nrespected, about whether or not a nominee should be asked how he would \nrule in a particular case. Lloyd Cutler is right. If one of the \nnominees came before us and we would ask that nominee, there is a case \npending in the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, tell us how you would rule \non that case if you sat on the bench, that is just plain wrong. We \ncannot do that. But it is not unfair to ask of a nominee his or her \nviews on constitutional issues.\n  It is interesting to me that Senator Hatch would raise this point \nbecause only a week ago, three circuit court nominees, nominated by \nPresident Bush, came before the Judiciary Committee and we spent the \nbetter part of a day or more asking them probing questions about their \nviews on constitutional issues. To their credit, they were forthcoming, \nhonest, and candid in all of their answers. I did not agree with some \nof their points of view, but that is not what this is all about. They \ndo not have to say what I need to hear.\n  I have voted over 100 times now for President Bush's nominees, many \nof whom I disagree with on constitutional issues and policy issues, but \nthat is not what it is about. If they strike me as people who are \nmoderate, honest, skilled, with good temperament, I am going to vote to \nput them on the bench, even if I do not agree with their political \nview. I think that is what the process should be.\n  When it comes to Miguel Estrada, when we asked him the most generic \nquestions to open up and tell us his thinking about constitutional \nlegal issues, he fended us off; he refused.\n  Justice Antonin Scalia on the U.S. Supreme Court was picked by \nPresident Bush as one of his favorite Justices. He likes his \nconservative bent. He may like him personally. Whatever reason, then-\ncandidate Bush said Antonin Scalia was his kind of Supreme Court \nJustice. Do my colleagues know what Justice Antonin Scalia said about \nquestions of judicial candidates regarding their political views? In \nthe case of Republican Party of Minnesota v. White, in an opinion \nwritten by Justice Scalia which overruled restrictions against \ncandidates for elective judicial office from indicating how they would \nrule on legal issues while campaigning, Justice Scalia said:\n\n       Even if it were possible to select judges who do not have \n     preconceived views on legal issues, it would hardly be \n     desirable to do so. Proof that a Justice's mind at the time \n     he joined the Court was complete tabula rasa in the area of \n     constitutional adjudication would be evidence of lack of \n     qualification, not lack of bias. And since avoiding judicial \n     preconceptions on legal issues is neither possible nor \n     desirable, pretending otherwise by attempting to preserve the \n     appearance of that type of impartiality can hardly be a \n     compelling state interest, either.\n\n  Did you note the words of Justice Antonin Scalia, the favorite of \nPresident Bush and many of my Republican colleagues on the floor?\n\n       Proof that a Justice's mind at the time he joined the Court \n     was a complete tabula rasa in the area of constitutional \n     adjudication would be evidence of lack of qualification, not \n     lack of bias.\n\n  Going back to Latin courses I took too many years ago to recount in \nthis speech, tabula rasa is a blank slate. What the Justice has said in \nthis opinion is, when nominees come before you saying they never \nthought about a certain issue, never reflected on a constitutional \nposition, don't have an opinion to share with you, that's not evidence \nof lack of bias, that's evidence of lack of qualification. And that is \nwhat this debate is all about.\n  There is no doubt in my mind Miguel Estrada has his own point of \nview, understands constitutional issues, and would express it. But he \nhas been carefully coached and managed by the Department of Justice and \nthe White House to come before the Senate Judiciary Committee and, \nfrankly, deny any opinion on any constitutional issue.\n  My colleague, Senator Schumer, asked him to just point out a Supreme \nCourt case he disagreed with.\n  No, he said, if I didn't hear the arguments and I didn't read the \nbriefs, I am not going to do it.\n  We asked him not only in the hearings but in written questions I sent \nto him afterwards, what is your view on Roe v. Wade, the landmark \ndecision related to abortion in America.\n  Again he said, Well, since I didn't hear the arguments and I wasn't \nthere, I am just not going to say what I understand when it comes to \nRoe v. Wade.\n  What a sharp contrast to John Ashcroft, the new Attorney General \nunder President Bush who, when asked the same question in his \nconfirmation hearing, said he would view that as established law and, \nunless it were overturned by the Supreme Court, would enforce it. \nMiguel Estrada would not even go that far.\n  I asked him as well to give the name of a judge, living or dead, whom \nyou would emulate on the bench--a wide open, softball question. He \ncould have picked the most conservative judge in history and the most \nliberal judge and said both of them brought the following qualities to \nthe court and I hope to follow those qualities. He had been so \ncarefully prepared, so cautioned by the Department of Justice, he \nwouldn't even go that far to suggest there was a Supreme Court Justice \nor a living judge, or one who has passed away, he would seek to \nemulate.\n  So what does that mean? Here is a man who will not tell us the most \nbasic information about his views on the Constitution, on judicial \nphilosophy, general questions you would ask of any nominee. And the \nRepublican majority comes and tells us approve him anyway. Give him \nthat lifetime appointment.\n  Roll the dice. Gamble he is going to be the right person. The \nRepublican majority says to the Senate: Be a rubberstamp. Don't ask \nthese questions. Now you are getting into ``advice.'' That is what the \nConstitution says, ``advice and consent.''\n  Let me point out some things that ought to be part of the record. I \nam proud to have named a Puerto Rican judge to the district court in \nChicago. During President Clinton's tenure, 10 of his more than 30 \nHispanic nominees were delayed or blocked from receiving hearings or \nvotes by the Republican Senate Judiciary Committee, chaired by the \nSenator from Utah; 10 out of 30 Hispanic nominees.\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator recalls, I am confident, that one of the \nnominees, one of the 20 who made it through, a man named Paez from \nCalifornia, waited 4 years before he was able to get confirmed by the \nSenate?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Four years. And there was never any question raised about \nhis qualifications or answers to questions.\n  Mr. REID. In fact, the Senator will recall he was a judge and had \nbeen for many years and had voluminous judicial opinions people could \nlook at.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Absolutely. I might say to the Senator from Nevada, the \nSenator from Utah, in a speech to the Utah Federalist Society, said \nwhen you have a nominee like Miguel Estrada with no published opinions, \nthen you have to really ask questions. Get to the bottom of his \njurisprudential views, in the words of the Senator from Utah. In the \ncase of Judge Paez, there was not only ample record about how he ruled, \nhe answered the questions. Miguel Estrada has ducked the questions time \nand time again and believes if he can\n\n[[Page S2140]]\n\nhold us back long enough he will get a lifetime appointment to the \nFederal bench. That would be a dereliction of duty on the part of the \nSenate and that is why we are spending this time on this nominee. An \nimportant constitutional principle is at stake here, a principle of \nwhether or not the Senate will have the right and the authority to ask \nthe questions, to make a reasoned judgment before we give our advice \nand consent to a President's judicial nominees.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for one more question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I am not sure the Senator is aware from Congressional News, \nthis publication that quotes what we say in the press every day--the \ndistinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee appeared on MSNBC \nHardball last evening. Among other things, are you aware he said, \ntalking about the Democrats in the Senate:\n\n       What they are really worried about is Estrada is so \n     qualified and so good and he's Hispanic, that he's on the \n     fast track to the Supreme Court. They think they don't want a \n     Hispanic Republican, let alone a conservative, on the Supreme \n     Court of the United States of America, and that's what this \n     is all about.\n\n  What is the Senator's comment in that regard?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I can tell the Senator, as I said earlier, I was happy to \nappoint a Hispanic to the Federal District Court in Chicago. I hope \nsooner rather than later there will be a Hispanic on the United States \nSupreme Court. If you look at this nominee, Miguel Estrada, it is \nreally instructive to me that the Hispanic Caucus of Congress has come \nout in opposition to his nomination. Some have dismissed that and said \nthere are three Republican Hispanics in the House who favor his \nnomination. I am going to make that part of the Record. I ask unanimous \nconsent if I might have a list of letters in opposition and concern to \nthe nomination of Miguel Estrada be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Letters of Opposition to and Concern About the Nomination of Miguel \n              Estrada to the D.C.

The list of organizations that oppose Miguel Estrada is \nextremely long. It goes on for pages. Congressional Hispanic Caucus and \nBlack Caucus--but listen to these. The Mexican-American Legal Defense \nand Education Fund--this is the premier Hispanic civil rights \norganization in America--opposes the nomination of Miguel Estrada. \nFrankly, I hope we do have a nominee of Hispanic origin who is on the \nSupreme Court as quickly as possible, as soon as there is a vacancy and \na qualified candidate. But I hope Members will take pause to realize \nthat just having a Hispanic surname is not enough. We need to bring a \nperson\n\n[[Page S2141]]\n\nto the highest court of the land who really understands that \nresponsibility and is not so cagey and careful when it comes to \nexplaining his point of view. That has been the case with Miguel \nEstrada.\n  He is, in fact, a stealth candidate. It's an effort by the Bush White \nHouse to put in a secret judiciary, judicial nominees who do not share \ntheir point of view with the public so you, frankly, have to gamble, \nwhen they come to the bench, that they will be moderate and reasonable \nin their judicial views. That is not the case with Miguel Estrada.\n  Let me make note, too, of the Federalist Society, to which Mr. \nEstrada belongs. He appears to be following the advice of DC Circuit \nJudge Lawrence Silberman, who recently told the Federalist Society that \nhe provided key advice to Antonin Scalia in 1986 that led to his smooth \nconfirmation. Lawrence Silberman told the great Federalist Society that \nhe said to Antonin Scalia: Don't answer any questions about judicial \nphilosophy or views.\n  It goes back to the Clarence Thomas model. When Clarence Thomas, like \nMiguel Estrada, told the Senate Judiciary Committee at the time that he \nhad no opinion on the issue of abortion--that is a red flag. There have \nbeen judicial nominees from the Bush White House who disagree with my \nposition on this important issue, but they have been honest enough to \nsay that, regardless of my personal and private points of view, when it \ncomes to my responsibility as a judge, I will follow Roe v. Wade until \nit is overruled by the Supreme Court. As John Ashcroft, another person \nwho opposes Roe v. Wade, has said, it is the established law of the \nland until overturned. Why couldn't Miguel Estrada, who has been a \nSupreme Court clerk, go that far--to acknowledge that point of law, \nthat stare decisis and precedent would guide him on an issue as \nimportant as Roe v. Wade?\n  His refusal to do that has caused alarm on this side of the aisle, \namong the majority of the Members.\n  Let me speak to you about some of the other issues that have been \nraised by some of my Republican colleagues during the course of this \ndebate. We have heard from a Republican Senator in the Dallas Morning \nNews that if we deny Mr. Estrada the position on the DC Circuit, it \nwould be to shut the door on the American dream of Hispanics \neverywhere.\n  The reality is that until last week, Mr. Estrada was the only Latino \nnominated by President Bush to any of the 42 vacancies that have \nexisted on the courts of appeal. In contrast, President Clinton \nnominated 11 Latinos to our appellate courts, and he also nominated 21 \nto district courts. Republicans blocked several of these, including \nEnrique Moreno, Jorge Rangel, and Christine Arguello.\n  Let me also note this argument about Estrada which Senator Trent Lott \nsaid to the Associated Press last year, that they--the Democrats--don't \nwant Miguel Estrada because he is Hispanic. The reality is that 8 of 10 \nHispanic appellate court judges were appointed by President Clinton. \nThree other nominees of President Clinton to the courts would apply, as \nwell as others for the district courts.\n  Mr. Estrada, in his background, has never in his legal career \nprovided any pro bono legal expertise to the Latino community. He has \nnever joined, supported, volunteered for, or participated in events of \nany organization dedicated to serving and advancing the Latino \ncommunity. He has never made any effort to open the doors of \nopportunity to Latino law students or junior lawyers.\n  Let me refer to another comment made by some of the Republicans in \nthe Chamber. Senator Rick Santorum said this on Fox News on April 10 of \nlast year:\n\n       They don't want any examples out there for America to see \n     of somebody who is conservative and also minority. . . . [I]f \n     you are a conservative, we don't like it. But if you are a \n     minority and a conservative, we hate you.\n\n  Under Senator Leahy, then chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the \ncommittee approved the following Bush nominees: Phillip Martinez, Jose \nMartinez, Alia Ludlum, Randy Crane, and Judge Jose Linares.\n  Time and again, when Republicans controlled the Senate, the Judiciary \nCommittee has approved these judges who are conservatives and \nminorities.\n  The point made by our colleague, Senator Santorum, just does not \nwash.\n  Let me note some of the other statements that have been made.\n  They argue that requesting Mr. Estrada to produce his writings is \nunprecedented.\n  Here is a man who has not been a judge but is in the Solicitor \nGeneral's Office who had a bounty of legal writings, and we are asking \nthat he present them so we can have an insight into his thinking--not \nunlike a judicial nominee who has served as a judge and we read his \nopinions to try to understand where this judge is coming from. It is \nnot unusual, frankly, in the Judiciary Committee to point out that a \njudge has been overruled a certain number of times to know whether or \nnot they have clear thinking and whether or not they understand the \nlaw. But when it comes to Miguel Estrada, the Bush White House under \nRepublicans refused to give us the documentation so we can see into the \nmind of Miguel Estrada who has carefully avoided answering direct \nquestions on judicial philosophy.\n  The Department of Justice provided memos by attorneys during the \nnominations of William Bradford Reynolds, nominated to be Associate \nAttorney General; Robert Bork, nominated to be a Supreme Court Justice; \nBenjamin Civiletti, nominated to be Attorney General; Stephen Trott, \nnominated to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit; and even Judge \nWilliam Rehnquist when he was nominated to be Chief Justice of the \nSupreme Court.\n  So asking for this documentation is certainly not unprecedented. In \nfact, there is ample precedent. When we look at the Estrada nomination, \nwe see a clear effort to stonewall. Mr. Estrada has refused to say \nwhether he would strictly interpret the U.S. Constitution.\n\n  Listen carefully to what I say here. There is not a single Clinton \nnominee who would have made it past this question before the Republican \nSenate Judiciary Committee. They were each asked point blank that \nquestion. If they did not answer in a fashion acceptable to the \nJudiciary Committee, it was over, their nomination was finished.\n  Miguel Estrada comes before us and refuses to even answer the \nquestion. I think I know what his answer would be. But why is he so \nafraid to share his judicial philosophy with us? Is it so radical, so \nunusual, is it so out of the ordinary that he is afraid people across \nAmerica will be worried about putting him on the second highest court \nin the land for a lifetime appointment? That is the only conclusion I \ncan draw from that.\n  When it came to Mr. Estrada, he refused to discuss the judicial or \nlegal philosophy of any current Supreme Court Justice.\n  When I asked nominees for district court judgeships in my State to \ngive me an insight into their thinking about Supreme Court Justices--\nwhich you think is good or somebody you disagree with--I got really \ninteresting answers from Democrat and Republican nominees. Sometimes I \nam surprised by the things they pick out. It gives you an insight into \nwhat they are looking for and perhaps the role model on whom they might \nmodel their own judicial career.\n  When it comes to Estrada, a man on the fast track to the Supreme \nCourt, he wouldn't discuss the judicial or legal philosophy of any \ncurrent Supreme Court Justice. When we asked him to name any Supreme \nCourt decision in history with which he disagreed--as I reflect on this \nquestion, this is not about a particular case. This is about a case \nthat was decided 20 or 30 or 40 years ago. In this case, we have a \nsituation where Miguel Estrada refused to answer the question.\n  So what we have before us, unfortunately, is a situation where we \nhave a candidate who has not brought before us the kind of background, \nthe kind of answers to questions which can give us solace that we are \nappointing to the second highest court in the land a man who has the \nqualifications and the temperament and the skill to handle the job.\n  Our colleagues have emphasized that Mr. Estrada received a well-\nqualified rating from the American Bar Association. The ABA committee \nrating of Mr.\n\n[[Page S2142]]\n\nEstrada, as for all nominees, is advisory and not binding. But it is \ninteresting to look at that rating and what it has meant in the past.\n  Last fall, a number of Republicans complained that a Bush nominee \nwith a well-qualified rating from the ABA received votes against their \nconfirmation, but there was no acknowledgment that many of these same \nRepublicans had voted against Clinton nominees who received well-\nqualified ratings.\n  While the Republicans were in control of the Senate, and when the \nJudiciary Committee was chaired by Senator Hatch, the following \nnominees received well-qualified ratings, and many Republicans voted \nagainst them:\n  Judge Merrick Garland, the last judge confirmed to the DC Circuit; \nJudge Gerald Lynch, of the Southern District of New York; Judge \nRosemary Barkett--who is, incidentally, a Latina--who was found well-\nqualified for the Ninth Circuit was voted against by the Republicans; \nJudge William Fletcher of the Ninth Circuit; Judge Ray Fisher of the \nNinth Circuit; Marcia Berzon of the Ninth Circuit; Sonia Sotomayor, \nanother Latino, a nominee found well-qualified by the ABA and voted \nagainst in the Second Circuit by Republicans; Judge Margaret McKowen, \nof the Ninth Circuit; Richard Paez, to whom the Senator from Nevada \njust made reference, another Latino, to the Ninth Circuit, and was held \nup for 4 years, was found well-qualified, not voted for by Republicans; \nJudge Margaret Morrow, of California, voted well-qualified.\n\n  Incidentally, the line of inquiry on Margaret Morrow I thought was \nthe most intrusive I have ever heard. Under the Republican-controlled \nSenate Judiciary Committee, Margaret Morrow, with the most amazing \nlegal credentials and who answered every question, finally in her \nfrustration, when the Republican majority on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee said to her: We want you to tell us how you voted throughout \nyour life on propositions on the California ballot. Did you vote yes or \nno, and why?--we are asking Miguel Estrada what his position is on Roe \nv. Wade, and the Republican majority on the floor here is saying: You \nare going too far.\n  When it came to Clinton nominees such as Margaret Morrow, they wanted \nher to violate the secrecy and sanctity of her vote in the polling \nplace and explain how she voted on a proposition before the California \nelectorate. That shows you how far they were going to go--way too far \nin the extreme to stop the well-qualified nominee.\n  All we are asking of Miguel Estrada is the basics: What is your \nposition on basic constitutional issues? When it comes to Supreme Court \ndecisions, discuss one of them you might have disagreed with in the \nlast 40 years, or in the history of the Supreme Court.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. In one moment.\n  Asking him: Give us the name of one Supreme Court Justice, living or \ndead, whom you would emulate as a member of the bar or as a member of \nthe bench. He refuses to answer any of those questions.\n  I will yield to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Does the Senator remember--you may or may not have been \nthere at the time--he was asked about Roe v. Wade, and he said it was \nsettled law and that he would apply it? Does the Senator remember that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to read exactly what he said when I asked the \nquestion because I sent it to him in the written questions that came.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is what it said in the transcript.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will bear with me.\n  Mr. HATCH. It is on page 128 of the transcript. Specifically asked, \nhe said it is settled law and he would apply it. I do not know what \nmore he could say.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am looking for it.\n  Mr. HATCH. I certainly do not know what more he should have said. If \nyou go to page 128----\n  Mr. DURBIN. This isn't what I am referring to. These are written \nquestions which were sent to him. I just read his answer. It was \ncurious to me, I say to the Senator from Utah, when he was given an \nopportunity to say just that, he did not. He did not.\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, he did. In his oral questions he was asked about Roe \nv. Wade, and he said it was settled law, he would apply it. Maybe he \ndid not say exactly what you wanted him to at the time, but that is \nwhat he did say.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me read my question:\n\n       You and I met privately before your hearing--\n\n  I addressed this to Miguel Estrada--\n\n     and I asked you for your views on Roe v. Wade. You indicated \n     you considered the answer to that question to be a private \n     matter, but your answer suggested you do have an opinion. Do \n     you have an opinion on the merits of Roe v. Wade? If so, have \n     you read the briefs and transcripts of the oral argument?\n\n  This is Miguel Estrada's response:\n\n       I stated during our meeting, like many Americans, I have \n     personal views on the subject of abortion, which views I \n     consider a private matter that I was unprepared to share or \n     discuss with you. I also stated I do not harbor any personal \n     views of any kind that if I were a judge would preclude me \n     from applying controlling Supreme Court law in the area of \n     abortion. I did not state that I have private views on \n     whether Roe v. Wade was correctly decided. As I stated during \n     my hearing, it would not be appropriate for me to express \n     such a view without doing the intensive work that a judge \n     hearing that case would have to undertake, not only reading \n     briefs and hearing the arguments of counsel but also \n     independently investigating the relevant constitutional text, \n     case law, and history.\n\n  Had he answered exactly as the Senator from Utah had said--it is \ncontrolling law, and that is what I will apply, or this is my view on \nthe general issue of privacy--I think it would have opened our eyes to \nan insight into what he was thinking. But again, he was careful to \navoid----\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield again?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. Senator Feinstein asked him about Roe v. Wade. He \nbasically said that he should not discuss his views on it, but he said, \non page 128:\n\n       I have had no particular reason to go back and look at \n     whether it was right or wrong as a matter of law as I would \n     if I were a judge that was hearing the case for the first \n     time. It is there. It is the law as it is subsequently \n     refined by the Casey case. And I will follow it.\n\n  And Senator Feinstein said:\n\n       So you believe it is settled law?\n\n  Mr. Estrada said:\n\n       I believe so.\n\n  So maybe he did not answer exactly the way you wanted him to in the \nwritten questions, but in the oral testimony he made it very clear that \nhe would follow the law and that he believes it is settled law. I do \nnot know what more he should have said.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to my colleague from Utah, I thank him for the \nquestion. And I just say that I cannot quite understand how we could \nget so many different versions of answers from this nominee. That is \ntroubling to me. It concerns me. And I think it raises the question of \nwhether or not he was coached in terms of avoiding or trying to avoid \nexpressing his personal point of view.\n  I see other colleagues in the Chamber seeking recognition at this \ntime. I have spoken earlier, and I will just say, before closing, I \nhope that those following this debate will understand the historic \nnature of the debate. What is at stake here is the question of the \nconstitutional authority and responsibility of the Senate when it comes \nto the advice and consent given on judicial nominees.\n  We believe, on this side of the aisle--at least many of us do--that \nMiguel Estrada should be more forthcoming, should give us his writings \nso we can understand what is in his mind and what he would bring to \nthis bench so we would have better answers to the basic questions we \nshould ask every nominee from every President. To do otherwise is to \nrelegate us to a minority status in terms of our major responsibility \nunder the Constitution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding the Senator from \nMississippi wishes to speak now. He told me earlier that he wishes to \nspeak for 10 or 15 minutes. That would take us past 12:30. I ask \nunanimous consent that the distinguished Senator from Mississippi be \nrecognized for up to 15 minutes, and following that the Senate recess \nfor its normal Tuesday recess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for making \nthat\n\n[[Page S2143]]\n\nrequest. I believe I can make my remarks in that time.\n  Mr. President, I take this occasion to speak on behalf of this \nnominee. I think he certainly deserves to be confirmed by the Senate, \nin a normal vote which would require a majority of the Senators, and \nthat this matter not be subject to a protracted debate, which could, in \nfact, turn it into a filibuster.\n  I wish to speak first in support of this specific nominee, but then \nalso as one who has viewed the judicial nominations and the debate that \nhas taken place over the past 7 years.\n  There has been a lot of interesting discussion. It is amazing that \nwhen the majority changes, the debate seems to shift sides, both ways. \nSome of the arguments we are hearing now we were criticized for making \nin the past. But I do not want to get into statistics or what may have \nhappened with this judge or that judge.\n  At the beginning, I want to talk about this nominee, this outstanding \nman who has lived the American dream in an incredible way. I am pleased \nand honored to be able to come to the floor and express my support for \nMiguel Estrada to be a U.S. circuit judge for the District of Columbia \nCircuit Court of Appeals.\n  I think he is highly qualified to be a Federal judge. Beyond that, \nhowever, his American success story exemplifies what the American dream \nis really all about. It is about hard-working immigrants who moved to \nthe United States and searched for a better life. It is people, such as \nMr. Estrada, who have made our country stronger by contributing to our \nsociety with their strong work ethic and desire to achieve. Others have \nmade those points, but I want to be on record talking about them \nmyself.\n\n  First, Miguel Estrada was born and raised in Honduras, and immigrated \nto the United States at age 17, speaking little English at the time. He \nquickly learned English, however, and excelled in academics, graduating \nwith a bachelor's degree magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from \nColumbia College. Then he went on to earn his J.D. degree magna cum \nlaude from Harvard Law School. I might add, he was editor of the \nHarvard Law Review, a high honor and great achievement.\n  He had valuable opportunities to learn the intricacies of the Federal \nappeals court system by clerking for a Second Circuit court of appeals \njudge--who was a Carter appointee--and serving as a clerk for U.S. \nSupreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy.\n  He has built a distinguished record as an attorney in private \npractice, as a Federal prosecutor in New York, and as an Assistant to \nthe Solicitor General under both President Clinton and President George \nH.W. Bush.\n  Mr. Estrada has argued 15 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court, \nincluding a death penalty case in which he represented a death row \ninmate pro bono. The point was made that maybe he had not done any pro \nbono work for Hispanics specifically, but when you do pro bono work, \nyou do not always check that kind of background. You do this work on \nbehalf of a client who would not be represented if you were not willing \nto serve without pay on behalf of this individual.\n  It is rare to see an attorney or judge with such an outstanding \nrecord even at the time of retirement. The experience this young man \nhas had is incredible in terms of his background, his education, the \nvariety of the experience he has with the judiciary and with the \napplication of law--and even before the Supreme Court, both as a clerk \nand also in appearances he has made. So, clearly in terms of experience \nand education, Miguel Estrada is highly qualified.\n  I find it very curious and exacerbating, quite frankly, that some \nMembers of the Senate are questioning whether or not he is qualified. \nAfter all, he was rated unanimously well-qualified by the American Bar \nAssociation, a rating that has been considered--I believe Senator Hatch \nand others have described it as the ``gold standard'' for the Democrats \nas to whether or not a man or woman should be qualified to serve on the \nFederal judiciary. So certainly to get a unanimously well-qualified \nrating from the ABA should make a tremendous difference here as to this \nnominee.\n  He does have the support of a lot of people in the Hispanic \ncommunity. In fact, I know Hispanics all across America are asking the \nquestion: What is the problem here?\n  This is a well-qualified man who is Hispanic and has the educational \nbackground and experience. Why are they still opposing him? Is it \nbecause he is brilliant? I suspect maybe that is part of the problem. \nIs it because he has a conservative philosophy of strict construction \nand interpretation of the Constitution? Maybe that is part of it, too. \nIs it because he is Hispanic? I don't understand the basis for the \nopposition.\n  The only thing I heard is that maybe he hasn't revealed enough of \nwhat he might do in a hypothetical case or the argument just being \nmade, or that he would not name a decision with which he disagreed. It \nis a catch-22. If you begin to speculate or if you begin to identify a \nparticular case, then you are attacked because you identified that \nparticular case.\n  We have a right and an obligation to ask any question we want to ask. \nJudicial nominees have a right to have their own private views, but \nthey also, as he has done, have to speak up and say they will support \nthe law as it exists. They should state that they will support the \nrulings of the Supreme Court. He has done that.\n  No, there is something more going on. It probably has something to do \nwith the debate that just took place, with speculation or suspicion as \nto what his position privately may be on Roe v. Wade. That is partially \nwhat is going on here.\n  We have argued back and forth over the years about what should be the \nbasis for our votes. I talked to my senior colleague from Mississippi, \nSenator Cochran, who served on the committee and is a senior Member of \nthis body, about what should be the basis of these votes. Generally \nspeaking, the nominee is selected by the President of the United \nStates, who won an election. A lot of people understand one of the most \nimportant things a President does is to select the men and women who \nwill go on our Federal judiciary and the Supreme Court. They make that \nselection. If that man or woman is qualified by temperament, by \neducation, and by experience, and unless there is some ethical \nlimitation or something of that nature, generally speaking you ought to \ngive them the benefit of the doubt and vote for them.\n  That is why I stood here in the Senate and explained why I would vote \nfor Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. I knew I wouldn't agree with a lot of \nher decisions. I didn't agree with her philosophy. But she didn't have \na conflict of interest. She didn't have an ethical problem. She was \nqualified. I voted for her, even though philosophically I had problems \nwith the nomination. There were others where that situation applied, \nwhere I wound up voting for them even though I would not agree with the \ndecisions that they would make. That is the way we should do it.\n  Other times I spoke against nominees and I voted against them, even \nthough as the Majority Leader, I had the responsibility sometimes to \ncall them up. I remember two very controversial judges nominated to the \nFederal bench, Paez and Berzon from California. Senator Hatch and I \nwere criticized because we, in fact, moved them through the process. \nThey wound up coming before the Senate and were voted on. I voted \nagainst them both, but I helped move the process forward. I stated my \nproblems with them and voted against them. I wouldn't dare, however, \ntry to filibuster them because I had some concerns about how they would \nrule in the Federal judiciary positions for which they had been \nnominated.\n  If a decision is made to prolong debate and turn it into a filibuster \nand we wind up having to have votes on a cloture petition, we will be \non the verge of setting a very dangerous precedent, one that has not \nhappened, in fact, in 35 years or so.\n\n  I remember a couple of years ago there was a nominee supported, as a \nmatter of fact, during the Clinton years by Senator Hatch, I believe it \nwas. We started having the movement toward a filibuster. I think we \nmaybe even had a cloture vote. I remember the discussion across the \naisle. Both sides were saying: Wait a minute, do we want to set this \nprecedent; do we want to do this? Does the Senate want to start voting \non judges requiring 60\n\n[[Page S2144]]\n\nvotes to get a confirmation? The Senate responsibly, wisely, backed \naway from that position.\n  I urge my colleagues, come to the floor, state your concerns. If you \nhave additional questions, I guess there is still time to get some \nanswers. But we need to have an up-or-down vote on this nominee this \nweek. He has been pending since May 9, 2001, as have some other very \nqualified nominees for the Federal judiciary. How long is enough? How \nmuch time do you need to review the record and look at the credentials, \nthe qualifications of a nominee?\n  It is actually embarrassing, the way the questions are being raised \nabout this nominee, that we wouldn't give this nominee an overwhelming \nand perhaps unanimous confirmation to this position. Is it a fear that \nthis brilliant, young Hispanic who has lived and taken advantage of the \nAmerican dream might some day be recommended for the Supreme Court? Is \nthat what is going on here? If it is, why don't we at least wait and \nworry about that when he gets nominated to the Supreme Court.\n  He is qualified. He will be an outstanding Federal judge. I urge my \ncolleagues to stop using very weak arguments about how maybe he didn't \nanswer detailed questions about what his rulings might be in a \nhypothetical case. That is not usually the basis we use for voting \nagainst a nominee.\n  I thank Senator Hatch for the job he has done on the committee. I am \nglad this process is beginning to break loose now for men and women, \nminorities, who have been pending for close to 2 years and who deserve \nto be considered by the Senate. I wholeheartedly endorse this nominee \nand look forward to seeing the leadership he will provide on this \nparticular circuit court of appeals.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/11/senate-section/article/S2144-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions).

ESTRADA, OF VIRGINIA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n      CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I have listened with great interest, and \neven great concern, to the debate that has taken place in this Chamber \non the issue of Miguel Estrada's nomination to serve on the DC Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, and I feel impelled to stand and explain the reasons \nwhy I think not only Miguel Estrada deserves confirmation by this \nbody--indeed, he deserves a vote--but why I think the judicial \nconfirmation process is broken and has fallen into a state beneath the \ndignity of this institution and this body.\n  Indeed, I think if you could characterize what has been going on with \nregard to this confirmation process, you could talk about ``delay''--\nthe fact that Miguel Estrada's name had been sent up for consideration \nby the Senate some 18 months ago, on May 9, 2001.\n  Second, I would choose the word ``defeat'' in talking about this \nnomination. It is clear the overarching objective of those who choose \nto oppose this nomination are those who wish to defeat President Bush \non any and every front they can find, where they don't believe they \nwill have to pay a political price.\n  You could also talk about ``deny''--denying an opportunity for \nimmigrants like Miguel Estrada, someone who is living the American \ndream, to serve in a position of public trust.\n  Finally, I will use the word ``dispirit.'' Clearly, there is an \nattempt to dispirit those who would offer themselves for public \nservice, to make it so burdensome and so distasteful that they will \nchoose not to offer themselves for public service.\n  So I believe much of this debate encompasses these four concepts: \nDelay, defeat, deny, and dispirit.\n  Now, how have opponents to Miguel Estrada's confirmation chosen to \napproach their opposition? First, I believe they have used scare \ntactics. The Senator from Massachusetts said the other day:\n\n       When this or any other administration nominates judges who \n     would weaken the core values of our country and roll back the \n     basic rights that make our country a genuine democracy, the \n     Senate should reject them.\n\n  And then we heard from the Senator from Vermont:\n\n       We see an emboldened executive branch wielding its rising \n     influence over both Houses of Congress and ever more \n     determined to pack the Federal courts with activist allies, \n     to turn the independent judiciary into a political judiciary.\n\n  Mr. President, if either one of those statements were true, if I \nbelieved those accusations were supported by the evidence, I would not \nsupport this nomination, nor would, I believe, any Senator, Republican \nor Democrat, support this nomination. But I believe more than anything \nelse that sort of rhetoric, unsubstantiated in fact, is proof positive \nthis confirmation process is broken. And I say enough is enough.\n\n  Opponents of Miguel Estrada's confirmation claim he has an inadequate \nrecord. They claim he has little relevant practical experience. They \nclaim because he would not engage with them in a debating tactic, \nasking him whether there is any Supreme Court decision with which he \ndisagreed, and finally, they claim that he has not clearly stated his \njudicial philosophy.\n  In my remarks over these next few minutes, I hope to address each one \nof those objections and show they are merely pretext for what is really \ngoing on here.\n  The American people know what is going on here, though, regardless of \nwhat Members may claim. They realize the judicial confirmation process \nin the Senate has become a game of political football, where the \nparticipants think they are going to score points against their \nopponent--Republicans against Democrats, Democrats against Republicans. \nBut while the people who engage in this game of political football may \nbelieve they are scoring points, it is the American people who lose.\n  Again, I want to associate myself with the thoughtful remarks made \nthe other day by the senior Senator from Pennsylvania who called for an \nend to the fingerpointing, the recriminations and the faultfinding. He \ncalled for the beginning of a new protocol, a new process that befits \nthe dignity of this institution, one that would provide a timely, \ncomprehensive, and efficient way to evaluate and vote on judicial \nnominees, regardless of which party is in power in the White House.\n  First of all, I want to address the objection that has been noted \nabout Mr. Estrada's refusal to state a political position or \nideological position on a whole range of issues that will, in all \nlikelihood, come before him on the bench.\n  Everyone knows judges are not supposed to be politicians, running on \nthe basis of a party platform, and, worse yet, everyone knows judges \nare not supposed to prejudge cases that may come before them. Why have \na trial? Why have the adversaries in a court of law argue about what \nthe facts are or what the application of the law to those facts should \nbe if a judge is going to prejudge that case? That is not justice; that \nis the antithesis of justice and the dispassionate impartiality we \nexpect from judges.\n  Every lawyer--and this body is chock full of lawyers--knows that \ncases are decided on the basis of the facts and the law, not--in a \ncourt of law, at least--on the basis of a political persuasion or an \nideological position. Of course, Mr. Estrada is well within his rights \nto say, I am not going to prejudge a case because I do not know exactly \nhow the facts may come before me; I do not know how the jury may decide \nthe facts, and therefore I cannot tell you how the law may apply to \nthat particular set of facts on a case-by-case basis.\n  Under our system of government, judges hold a very different job from \nthat held by a member of the legislature or even the President, a \nmember of the executive branch. Judges, if they are going to be true to \ntheir oath, if they are going to interpret the law, not make law, are \nbound by what this body says the law should be when we pass a bill or \nthe President signs a bill into law, by the Constitution, and by \nprecedents; that is, earlier decisions made by high court.\n\n[[Page S2145]]\n\n  Any judge who presumes to take on the role of a lawmaker is, I \nsubmit, a lawbreaker. A judge should not be a politician campaigning \nfor confirmation, and I applaud Mr. Estrada for refusing to submit \nhimself to that sort of process and refusing to prejudge cases or to \nact like a politician campaigning for confirmation.\n\n  During the Judiciary Committee hearing and during the executive \nsessions in which I participated as a member of the executive \ncommittee, Mr. Estrada was asked: Do you disagree with any previous \ndecision of the U.S. Supreme Court? I am afraid that demonstrates again \nwhat the judicial confirmation process has degenerated into. It should \nnot be trivialized, and it should not be reduced to a law school \nclassroom where narrow and provocative points of law are debated.\n  Does anyone really doubt that if any nominee disagreed with a \nSenator's view on policy issues, no matter how wrong under the law, we \nwould see nothing but further degeneration of the confirmation process?\n  I believe that Mr. Estrada, being a good lawyer and highly qualified \nto serve on the DC Court of Appeals, is following the dictum of a \nSupreme Court Justice who said the Supreme Court is not final because \nit is always right; it is right because it is final. In other words, \nthe way the Supreme Court decides a case puts it to rest unless, in the \nlegislative area, Congress comes back and passes a statute that, in \neffect, overrules that decision by changing the law and making it \nperhaps clearer what its intent is, or even, in the rarest of \ncircumstances on a constitutional point, that the people choose to \namend the Constitution and say that does not represent what we, the \npeople, want the Constitution to reflect or it does not reflect our \nvalues. And there is a process, of course, for that as well.\n  One of the most extraordinary arguments I have heard by opponents to \nMiguel Estrada's confirmation is that he does not have the experience \nto sit on the DC Court of Appeals.\n  I have been honored during my career to serve as a judge at a trial \ncourt level, at a State supreme court level, and I have been honored to \nserve as an attorney general of my State, the State of Texas, before I \ncame to the Congress. I will tell you that Mr. Miguel Estrada has \nexactly the kind of experience that has prepared him better than \nvirtually anyone could possibly be for service on this court.\n  Of course, we all know his record, a distinguished academic record. \nWe know he served in the Solicitor General's Office during the Clinton \nadministration and argued 15 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. As \nattorney general of Texas, I had the honor of arguing twice before the \nU.S. Supreme Court myself, and I must tell you that is the Super Bowl \nfor someone in my profession and someone in Miguel Estrada's \nprofession. That is the peak of your career. That is the highlight of \nyour legal experience, and to do it 15 times, it is as if he had Super \nBowl rings on every finger of both hands, and to claim he is not \nqualified is preposterous.\n  Of course, you cannot have the experience of being a judge until you \nhave actually been one. People have to start somewhere. Even the senior \nSenator from New York has stated that Miguel Estrada passes his self-\nstyled test for excellence. He said: Excellence is legal excellence, \nthe quality of the mind. We don't want political hacks on these \nimportant courts. No one disputes that Mr. Estrada passes this point \nwith flying colors. He comes highly recommended in this regard. When \nthe ABA, the American Bar Association, recommends him, that is all they \nare evaluating.\n  I believe it is a red herring to argue that Miguel Estrada has \ninsufficient experience to serve on this important court.\n  What is really going on? I think a comment in the Congressional \nRecord on February 5, 2003, by the ranking minority member of the \nJudiciary Committee, the Senator from Vermont, is very telling, and I \nwant to read this twice so there is no missing what he said.\n  He said:\n\n       I have friends who range across the political spectrum. But \n     I think I also would be willing to state what my political \n     philosophy is, or certainly what my judicial philosophy is, \n     if I am going to ask for a lifetime appointment to the bench, \n     just as I have to state what my political philosophy is when \n     I ask the people of Vermont to elect or reelect me.\n\n  So it is clear, what the Senator is saying is he expects a person \nnominated by the President, before this body for confirmation, to \nexpress a political philosophy, just like he or any other Member of \nthis body would running for the Senate.\n  I believe that demonstrates exactly how wrong the concept is of what \nthe advice and consent function of the Senate should be under our \nConstitution, and how wrong the concept is of what a judge should be \nunder our Government of separated powers. I want to talk about that in \na moment.\n  When I think about the scare tactics that have been employed over the \nlast few weeks with regard to Miguel Estrada, it becomes crystal clear \nto me why our Government has a difficult time recruiting talented \nindividuals to leave the private sector and offer themselves for public \nservice. Why would anyone in Miguel Estrada's position, a successful \nlawyer, someone who, as I said, has been to the Super Bowl 15 times, \nsubject himself to such a spectacle?\n  Mr. Estrada is very good at what he does. He has a successful law \npractice as a partner in a prestigious firm. In the 16 years he has \npracticed law, his reputation is unblemished. For the first time in his \ncareer, his professionalism, his temperament, his willingness to put \nhis hand on the Bible and take an oath and abide by that in performing \nthe job of a judge are all being called into question. Again, I ask: \nWhy would he or anyone else like him subject himself to this broken \nprocess?\n  If he were here today, he would say, as he told me in my office, that \naccepting this nomination to serve on the DC Court of Appeals is not \nabout personal accomplishment, personal achievement, but it is a sense \nof duty and obligation to our country, his adopted country.\n  This country took in his mother and his sister, and himself. At age \n17, he came from Honduras to America, barely speaking English. Working \ntogether and at great sacrifice, his mother put Miguel through law \nschool, with his help. He worked odd jobs. It is also worthwhile to \nnote, they put his sister through medical school.\n  These immigrants, one a distinguished lawyer, another a distinguished \ndoctor, by dint of hard work, access to a good education, have achieved \nwhat we all recognize as the American dream and what every immigrant \nhopes for. Indeed, we are a nation of immigrants. Through education and \nhard work, they have found prosperity, and this opportunity, this hope, \nis the best civil right this country can give to any immigrant.\n  Miguel Estrada sees this as an opportunity to contribute to a way of \nlife that provided him a way out, an opportunity for great achievement \nand success, and an opportunity for public service. Only under our \nbroken, destructive judicial confirmation process, as it has now become \nin this body, someone can be demonized, not just criticized but \ndemonized, for such an honorable goal. It is a shame.\n  America has always been, and God willing will always be, a land of \nopportunity. Yes, despite our imperfections, despite our mistakes, \nmillions have flocked to these shores seeking a better life for \nthemselves, their children, and their grandchildren. America is, of \ncourse, a land of immigrants, where those who come look for freedom to \nspeak as they wish, to associate with whom they choose, to worship \naccording to the dictates of their conscience and, yes, to seek \njustice. Those who have come have spared nothing, sometimes even their \nown lives, seeking opportunities for those who come after. At different \ntimes during the course of this Nation's history, they have come from \nEngland, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Mexico, Canada, Asia. They have come by \nthe thousands and tens of thousands. What has drawn them irresistibly \nto this country is their hope and their ambition, not just for \nthemselves but for those who would come after them.\n\n  It is that diversity, that desire, that dedication, that is the \nbedrock of American strength and resilience, and which has made America \na beacon of hope for the rest of the world.\n\n[[Page S2146]]\n\n  To me, one of the most amazing things about Miguel Estrada's story is \nin many ways it is not unique. It is exemplary, but it is not unique. \nHis learning to speak English at 17, his subsequent admission and \noutstanding accomplishment at the premier institutions of higher \nlearning in this country, have all been remarkable, but the simple \nimmigrant story that is his life has been repeated time and again over \nthe course of this Nation's history. People have come to work in this \ncountry with little but their hopes and their dreams, and by dint of \nfaith, hard work, determination, sacrifice, they achieve the American \ndream. Each time this happens, and it has happened time and again \nduring the course of this Nation's history, America redeems a promise \nit makes to all who would come here: Liberty and justice for all.\n  Too often, we focus on what is wrong with our country. No doubt we \nshould strive to correct our mistakes, strive to overcome our \nshortcomings whenever and however we can, but we would be a cynical \npeople, knowing the costs of everything and the worth of nothing, if we \ndid not also celebrate what is right in America. We should celebrate \noccasions like this when the hopes, dreams, and aspirations of an \nimmigrant family from Honduras have become a reality, confirming once \nagain America is indeed the last best hope of mankind, where all who \ncome here and who are willing to work hard to sacrifice can live up to \ntheir God-given potential.\n  We have heard it said Mr. Estrada has not laid out his judicial \nphilosophy. I was surprised to hear that in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee the other day, when the senior Senator from New York made \nthat charge, and said all he has told us is he will follow the law, he \nhas not told us what his judicial philosophy is. Well, I think Mr. \nEstrada has articulated the best judicial philosophy that we as \nAmericans could possibly hope for, a judicial philosophy and a \ndedication to the law that the American people who appear before the \nbench require.\n  What he has said is he will not pursue his own agenda. He will not \npursue a social or political agenda. He will not try to make the law \naccording to his liking. He will give the legislatures' enactments and \nthe acts of Congress deference and will seek to determine our intent as \npolicymakers and as those in the political branch who run for office \nbased on a platform saying what we are for and then are voted for by \nthe people of our State to come here. By saying he would follow the \nlaw, he is saying he would not only honor legislative acts, he would \nfollow judicial precedence. That is the decisions by the highest court \nin the land.\n\n  As legislators, as those in the Senate who have the awesome \nresponsibility of advice and consent, we should want to hear that. We \nshould embrace it. There is no role for advocacy of personal beliefs or \npolitical agendas on the part of a judge under our Constitution. Judges \nare bound to follow Supreme Court precedent, whether they agree with it \nor not as a personal matter. If there is such a thing as the rule of \nlaw as opposed to the rule of men, judges are bound to follow the acts \nof the legislature and judicial precedent, whether they agree with them \nor not. Mr. Estrada has committed to follow the law, whether he agrees \nwith it or not. Personal views and ideology have no role whatsoever to \nplay. I believe that under our Constitution--and I believe that is what \nis taught in our classrooms in civics every day across this Nation--\nthis is the appropriate role for a judge and for our judicial branch. \nWe don't want them making legislative policy. We do not want judges who \nare legislators in robes.\n  My colleagues across the aisle in this Chamber know, we all know, \nthat is our job. We stand accountable to the American people and to the \nvoters of our States for doing that job. That is what we have accepted \nby coming here and agreeing to represent our States.\n  A lot of the debate we are hearing today, this week--and who knows \nhow long this will go on--is not just about Miguel Estrada but about \nwhat is the appropriate role for our three branches of Government. \nHeaven knows, this is not a brandnew debate. But I would think most of \nthe country would have thought that matter already settled. Indeed it \nwas. Alexander Hamilton wrote about it in the Federalist Papers, of \ncourse, as the President knows, when the people of New York were \nconsidering this new Constitution, whether to ratify it. He was \nexplaining the various provisions of this new Constitution to the \npeople at that ratifying convention in New York. It is addressed in \nFederalist No. 78, what is the role we expect of the judiciary and how \ndoes that relate or compare to the role we have for the legislature or \nfor the executive branch--the President.\n  He said:\n\n       Whoever attentively considers the different departments of \n     power must perceive, that, in a government in which they are \n     separated from each other, the judiciary, from the nature of \n     its functions, will always be the least dangerous [branch] to \n     the political rights of the Constitution; because it will be \n     least in a capacity to annoy or injure them. The Executive \n     [on the other hand] not only dispenses the honors, but holds \n     the sword of the community.\n\n  In other words, the executive's job is to execute the laws passed by \nthe legislature.\n\n       The legislature not only commands the purse, but prescribes \n     the rules by which the duties and rights of every citizen are \n     to be regulated.\n\n  In other words, the legislature makes policy, makes the law.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       The judiciary, on the contrary, has no influence over the \n     sword or the purse; no direction either of the strength or of \n     the wealth of the society; and can take no active resolution \n     whatever. It may truly be said to have neither FORCE nor \n     WILL, but merely judgment; and must ultimately depend upon \n     the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its \n     judgments.\n\n  I would like to address one other comment that is made from time to \ntime about the role of the Senate in performing its advice and consent \nfunctions. Some Senators I have heard say they perceive their role as \nseeking to achieve balance of the courts, by which I take them to mean \nthey believe that a court, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, \nmust be evenly split with judges of different philosophies.\n\n  That concept is completely alien to our Constitution. Balance and \nindependence, in our judicial branch, are not meant to be determined by \nRepublicans and Democrats choosing their respective champions. The \nPresident has a right granted to him under the Constitution to appoint \njudges of his choosing, subject to the advice and consent of the \nSenate. That is one of the reasons we vote for a candidate to serve as \nPresident of the United States. All we should rightly do as Senators is \ndetermine whether or not a nominee has the qualifications and the \ntemperament to be a judge. Included, of course as an element of that \ntemperament, we should expect that nominees will pledge to a sound \njudicial philosophy, to uphold the law, by giving the legislature \ndeference and by following judicial precedent. Miguel Estrada has \npledged to do exactly that, and we should ask no more and no less of \nany nominee.\n  I said earlier I believe our judicial confirmation process is broken, \nthat the kind of things we see going on in the process--delay, defeat, \ndenial, and a dispiriting of those who would offer themselves for \npublic service--has created a terrible situation. The process has \nbecome so politicized that we find ourselves in situations such as \nthis, where Senators on the other side of the aisle are now talking \nfilibuster, to deny this President the prerogative, granted to him \nunder the Constitution, to appoint a highly qualified individual such \nas Miguel Estrada to serve on the District of Columbia Court of \nAppeals.\n  It is obvious to any reasonable person that the Senate needs a fresh \nstart. We need a fresh start on judicial nominees and on the judicial \nconfirmation process. Miguel Estrada, like other nominees, has waited \nfor an inordinate amount of time--18 months so far. We owe it to the \nmen and women who are nominated by the President to do our job on a \ntimely basis, and to do it applying constitutional standards, not those \nthat we make up or which we perhaps prefer, or those which serve the \npolitical interests of some constituency. The truth is, we owe it not \nonly to the men and women who are nominated, we owe it to the American \npeople to do our job, to do it on a timely basis, and to apply correct \nconstitutional standards, because we know, and common sense will tell \nus, that the failure of this body to timely act on the President's \nnominees means that\n\n[[Page S2147]]\n\nvery real human beings with real live cases and controversies that they \nneed to have resolved are simply being told there is no room for their \ncase. Justice delayed is justice denied.\n  As someone new to this body, I hope a new system can be devised \nenabling us to consider, on a bipartisan basis, new rules, a new \nagreement, a new paradigm, a new protocol that will guide us in the \nmanner in which we consider the President's nominees. That is not just \nfor this President, but anyone elected by the people to serve in that \nimportant office, regardless of who is in power, whether it is a \nRepublican or a Democrat.\n  The result of this fresh start should be timely consideration of a \nnominee's qualifications and an up-or-down vote by the Judiciary \nCommittee--and certainly no one is suggesting that any Senator ought to \ndo anything other than to cast their vote either for or against a \nnominee. But they ought to do so on a timely basis. We should not have \nthe kind of delay which we have had in this case. But if a nominee is \nvoted out of the Judiciary Committee, then, of course, there ought to \nbe that timely vote by the entire Senate regardless of who is \nPresident. Let us not hold to the delays and obstructions of the past \nas methods for treating judicial nominees in the future.\n\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to confirm Miguel Estrada. I believe \nwe ought to have a vote today on his nomination. We have had many days \nof debate. We have had 18 months since the President first proposed his \nname. Mr. Estrada has been scrutinized and questioned. His background \nhas been investigated by the FBI. I believe he deserves a vote either \nup or down today.\n  Of course, I will, for the reasons I have just stated, vote for his \nconfirmation. I believe the Nation will benefit from his experience, \nand he will be given the opportunity to give back to his adopted \ncountry through this position of honorable public service.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first, I have enjoyed the presentation of \nthe Senator from Texas. But I would suggest that my experience here \nover for now more than two decades indicates that the problem isn't a \nmatter of whether it is a Democrat or a Republican President. The \nprocess is broken down there. It is not up here. The advice and consent \nrole which we have under the Constitution is something that should work \nand should continue to work.\n  I suggest here on the floor myself that we need to do something to \nspeed up the process down there. When these people apply for \njudgeships, the work is unending. For people who want to have Cabinet \nor sub-Cabinet jobs, the process is unending, and we have to do \nsomething to get that speeded up. The problem is not up here.\n  The Senator from North Carolina wishes to speak for up to 10 minutes. \nFollowing that--I always want to refer to Senator Byrd as the leader, \nand he is a leader but he is now the President pro tempore emeritus--I \nask unanimous consent that Senator Byrd, the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia, be recognized following the remarks of Senator Edwards.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I believe judges have no greater \nresponsibility than to ensure fair treatment and equal justice under \nthe law. I also believe one of our greatest responsibilities as \nSenators is to advise and consent on the President's nominees to the \nbench. I, for one, take this responsibility very seriously. It is not \nour duty as Members of the Senate to just rubber stamp the President's \nnominees--particularly nominees who we doubt are committed to \nprotecting equal rights for every single American.\n  Having read the record of this nominee very carefully, I feel \ncompelled to oppose the nomination of Miguel Estrada for two reasons. \nFirst, what we know about his record raises serious questions about his \ncommitment to protecting equal rights under the law.\n  Second, and more importantly, his refusal to answer reasonable \nquestions during the confirmation process makes it impossible to \nexamine his views of the law and determine whether his personal views \nwould overrule law and legal precedent.\n  Federal judges wield enormous power and have a huge impact on the \nrights of individuals all across America. Given the fact that the \nSupreme Court reviews fewer than 100 cases per year, circuit courts, \nsuch as the DC Circuit where Miguel Estrada is being nominated to, ends \nup as the courts of last resort for nearly 30,000 cases each year.\n  Let me repeat that. Fewer than 100 cases are reviewed before the \nSupreme Court, and 30,000 cases are decided at the circuit court level.\n  These cases affect the interpretation of the Constitution as well as \nstatutes enacted by us to protect equal rights. The circuit courts are \nthe courts where Federal regulations will be upheld or overturned, \nwhere many personal rights will either be kept or lost, and where \ninvasions of freedom will be allowed or curtailed. They are the courts \nwhere thousands of individuals will have a final determination in \nmatters that affect their financial future, their health, their \nliberty, and their lives.\n  The District of Columbia Circuit is an especially important court in \nour judicial system. It is the most prestigious and powerful appellate \ncourt below the Supreme Court level because it has exclusive \njurisdiction over critical Federal constitutional rights.\n  About Mr. Estrada: The little that we know of Miguel Estrada's \napproach to the law is troubling. But Mr. Estrada's record is not the \nmain reason I can't support his nomination at this time. The main \nreason is that he has not explained his views. Before his hearing, I \nlooked forward to hearing Mr. Estrada discuss his views, but he refused \nto do so. Instead, he stonewalled serious and valid questions--serious \nand valid questions that have been answered by many other nominees who \nhave appeared before the committee.\n  Other judicial nominees of President Bush have discussed at length \ntheir views in hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee. For \nexample, Michael McConnell, whom I voted for and who was recently \nconfirmed to the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, thoroughly \ndiscussed his views on subjects such as Roe v. Wade and the Supreme \nCourt's recent ``federalism'' or ``States rights'' decisions limiting \nthe authority of Congress.\n  But with Mr. Estrada, it is very different. The Justice Department \nrefused to produce any legal memoranda written by Mr. Estrada during \nhis 5 years as a lawyer in the Solicitor General's office. In this \nposition, Mr. Estrada researched the law, he wrote memoranda, \npleadings, and briefs on behalf of the Federal Government on critical \nand constitutional and statutory questions that were before the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n\n  I understand the administration has concerns about executive \nprivilege, but there are ways to strike a balance between the \nprivileges of the executive and the rights of the Senate to learn about \na nominee before we make a decision about him. That is what has \nhappened during the judicial nomination process of other nominees who \nhave worked in the Solicitor General's office, including Robert Bork \nand Chief Justice William Rehnquist. We tried to discuss Mr. Estrada's \nviews with him during the hearing, but instead of being forthcoming in \nanswering our questions, Mr. Estrada was extraordinarily evasive. Time \nafter time, Mr. Estrada refused to answer our questions because he \nclaimed not to have an opinion since he has not been personally \ninvolved, read the briefs, listened to oral arguments, or independently \nresearched the case.\n  Anybody who has attended law school, including myself, knows that law \nstudents and lawyers express opinions about Supreme Court cases every \nday because of their ramifications for current cases with similar \nissues.\n  Nine times during his testimony Mr. Estrada refused to name any \nSupreme Court case with which he disagreed. And time after time after \ntime, Mr. Estrada just flat out refused to offer us any explanation of \nor insight into his view of his judicial philosophy.\n  For example, we have heard the President state on many occasions that \nhe intended to appoint judges who are strict constructionists--a term \ncommonly used in describing judicial philosophy and often applied to \nJustices Scalia, Thomas, and Rehnquist. I asked Mr. Estrada a simple \nquestion of whether he considered himself within that category; did he \nconsider himself\n\n[[Page S2148]]\n\na strict constructionist? But he refused to provide a straight answer.\n  Question to Mr. Estrada:\n\n       Are you a strict constructionist?\n\n  Answer:\n\n       I am a fair constructionist, I think.\n\n  Question:\n\n       Do you consider yourself to be a strict constructionist?\n\n  Answer:\n\n       I consider myself to be a fair constructionist. I mean, \n     that is today. I don't think that it should be the goal of \n     our courts to be strict or lax. The goal of the courts is to \n     get it right. . . .\n\n  I tried again.\n  Question:\n\n       Let me ask the same question a little differently. The \n     President gave a speech last night at a fundraiser and \n     specifically referred to your nomination, among others. The \n     President said, ``For a stronger America, we need good \n     judges. We need people who will not write the law from the \n     bench, but people who''--and I am quoting him now--``strictly \n     interpret the Constitution.''\n       Do you fall within the President's definition?\n\n  Mr. Estrada's answer:\n\n       I have not spoken with the President about this or any \n     other subject. I don't know what he meant. If I had to take \n     his text as a statute, I would want to know more about the \n     circumstances in order to figure out whether I can answer \n     your question.\n\n  Question:\n\n       You haven't been asked that question by anyone during the \n     course of your nomination process?\n\n  If I can interject here, this is something the President talks about \nregularly--appointing judges who are strict constructionists.\n  He has now been asked several times by me in the hearing whether he \nis a strict constructionist. His answer was artifice language without \nanswering the question.\n  I asked the question whether he is a strict constructionist. I asked:\n\n       You haven't been asked that question by anyone during the \n     course of your nomination process?\n\n  Answer:\n\n       No. I was asked very similar questions, and they generally \n     had to do with how I go about generally interpreting the \n     Constitution and statutes--and I gave the answer that I gave \n     you a few minutes ago.\n\n  In other words, ``none of your business'' was the answer.\n  Other Senators tried to get a straight answer from Mr. Estrada.\n  Question:\n\n       Of the current members of the Supreme Court, who would you \n     characterize as a strict constructionist? Who would you \n     characterize as a fair constructionist?\n\n  That was his language.\n\n       How would you characterize the remaining Justices?\n\n  Answer:\n\n       I would characterize each member of the current Court as a \n     ``fair constructionist.''\n\n  The people on the Supreme Court today have totally different \nphilosophies. Everyone knows that. You have a broad spectrum from \nsomeone such as Justice Scalia to someone such as Justice Stevens. But \nMr. Estrada said they were all ``fair constructionists,'' which \nbasically meant the term had no meaning at all.\n  It is like asking someone, ``Which Member of the Senate has your \nphilosophy?'' and the answer being, ``Well, they all do.'' We do not \nall have the same philosophy in the Senate. I do not think anyone would \nquestion that.\n  He refused to answer a question about his views of any judge, living \nor dead.\n  Question:\n\n       In terms of judicial philosophy, please name several \n     judges, living or dead, whom you admire and would like to \n     emulate on the bench?\n\n  Answer:\n\n       There is no judge, living or dead, whom I would seek to \n     emulate on the bench, whether in terms of judicial philosophy \n     or otherwise. . . .\n\n  Again, ``none of your business.''\n  As a judge on the D.C. Circuit, Miguel Estrada would have an enormous \nimpact on the lives of millions of Americans. The American people \ndeserve to know about this man who will have such an effect on their \nlives. They deserve to know whether he will respect and protect their \ncivil rights. They deserve to know this before he dons the cloak of \nsilence he will get once he is on the bench. The American people \ndeserve more from Miguel Estrada than ``none of your business.''\n  I look forward to working on a bipartisan basis to elevate qualified, \nmoderate nominees to the Federal bench. In particular, in the Fourth \nCircuit, where North Carolina is, I have high hopes President Bush will \nnominate a highly qualified candidate whom I will be able to support.\n  But, based upon Mr. Estrada's record, this is clearly not the right \nman. I will not just rubberstamp nominees who have not proven they are \nqualified for the extraordinary responsibilities of a Federal judge, \nand particularly the extraordinary responsibilities of a judge who \nwould sit on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. As a result, I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose this nomination.\n  I thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Is the Senate in \nexecutive session?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in executive session.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in legislative \nsession.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Byrd are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Minnesota is here. I am \nholding the floor now because the Democratic leader has been waiting \nsince 2:15 to come and speak. I am wondering how long the Senator from \nMinnesota wishes to speak?\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I say to the Democratic whip, I have \nabout 2\\1/2\\ pages typed, probably no more than 10 minutes, 5 to 10 \nminutes maximum.\n  Mr. REID. Why don't you go ahead and speak for, what did you say, up \nto 10 minutes?\n  Mr. COLEMAN. At the maximum.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that following the statement of the \nSenator from Minnesota, the Democratic leader be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, this morning the distinguished Senator \nfrom New York made some statements about the Senate's constitutional \nadvice and consent responsibility. I would like now to respond to those \nstatements because some of her views of the Senate's appropriate role \nin judicial nominations are different from mine.\n  I speak as a former solicitor general of the State of Minnesota. I \nhad an opportunity to argue on many occasions before the highest courts \nin my State. I have a great love and appreciation for our Constitution \nand its history.\n  In its enumeration of the President's powers, the Constitution has \nprovided a role for the Senate in the appointment of various Federal \nofficials, including Federal judges. The relevant text, which is set \nforth in article II, section 2, of the Constitution, reads:\n\n       The President . . . shall nominate, and by and with the \n     Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . Judges \n     of the Supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United \n     States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided \n     for, and which shall be established by law[.]\n\n  As one scholar has noted:\n\n       a reasonable reading of the text suggests that because the \n     Senate's role in the appointments process is outlined in \n     Article II enumeration of presidential powers, rather than \n     described in the Article I enumeration of congressional \n     powers, the Senate plays a more limited role in the \n     appointment of judges.\n\n  A reading of Alexander Hamilton's commentary on the Appointments \nClause sheds some additional light on how the Framers viewed the \nSenate's duty of advise and consent. Hamilton acknowledged the danger \nthat the Senate's advise and consent role could create an overly \nindulgent Senate relationship to appointed officeholders engaged in \nmalfeasance. Hamilton rebutted this point by arguing that the Senate \nwould have a strong interest in appointing qualified leaders and in \nprotecting its reputation for appointing quality officeholders. He \nfurther pointed out--and this is important--that the Senate does not \nhave the power to choose officeholders, but only to advise and consent. \nIn a moment of amazing prescience, he stated that he felt that Senators \nmight have political reasons for confirming or rejecting a nominee. He \nnevertheless observed--or perhaps hoped--that since the President alone\n\n[[Page S2149]]\n\nmakes the nominations, Senators would be somewhat constrained in their \nvoting decisions and that self-interested decisions would be offset by \nother Senators. He predicted that voting decisions on the merits would \nbecome much more the norm.\n\n  I wonder what Alexander Hamilton would say about the debate we have \nhad over Miguel Estrada's nominations. I can't imagine that he would be \npleased.\n  Hamilton believed that the appointments powers were wisely vested in \nthe hands of two parties, the President and the Senate. On one hand, \nHamilton believed the President, acting alone, would be the better \nchoice for making nominations, as he would be less vulnerable to \npersonal considerations and political negotiations than the Senate and \nmore inclined, as the sole decision maker, to select nominees who would \nreflect well on the presidency. On the other hand, he argued that the \nSenate's role would act as a powerful check on unfit nominees by the \nPresident. As he put it, Senate confirmation ``would be an excellent \ncheck upon a spirit of favoritism in the President, and would tend \ngreatly to prevent the appointment of unfit characters from State \nprejudice, from family connection, from personal attachment, or from a \nview to popularity.''\n  So there you have it, straight from Alexander Hamilton himself. The \nrole of the Senate is a limited one of protecting against the \nappointment of nominees who are unfit for the federal bench. I agree \nthat the Senate owes some deference to the President's choices.\n  Hamilton also believed that the Senate would act on judicial nominees \nwith integrity in order to avoid public disapproval. Now, the last \nthing I want to do is cast aspersion on the integrity of my colleagues \nwho oppose Mr. Estrada's nomination. But I must say that the amount of \nmisinformation being repeated here on the Senate floor about Mr. \nEstrada, and the manner in which his opponents have ignored his vast \nlegal experience and record, is cause for grave concern.\n  Historically, deliberation by the Senate on judicial nominations was \nquite short, especially when compared to what we are seeing on the \nSenate floor on Mr. Estrada's nomination. Take, for example, the 1862 \nnomination and confirmation of Samuel F. Miller to the United States \nSupreme Court. The Senate formally deliberated on the nomination for \nonly 30 minutes before confirming him. Confirmations on the same day, \nor within a few days of the nomination were the norm well into the 20th \ncentury.\n  Contrast this with what we are seeing on Mr. Estrada's nomination. We \nare now on our fourth day of debate with no end in sight. The \nRepublicans have offered at least two generous time agreements to set a \nvote for Mr. Estrada's nomination, but the Democratic leadership \nrejected both of them.\n  I have taken the time to share with my colleagues some of the \nhistorical details of the judicial confirmation process in order to put \nthe debate over Mr. Estrada's nomination into perspective. What was \nenumerated in the Constitution as ``advice and consent'' has in \npractice devolved to ``negotiation and cooperation'' in the best cases, \nand ``obstruct and delay'' in the worst cases, aided and abetted by the \nliberal Washington special interest groups. I fear that we are seeing \nthe latter at work in Mr. Estrada's case.\n  I was recently elected to get things done. I was elected, and I heard \nmy voters say: Put aside the bitter partisanship that is stopping the \nSenate from moving forward and that has prevented the Senate from \ngetting a prescription drug benefit and Medicare for seniors, that \nstopped us from getting disaster relief assistance, that stopped us \nfrom getting a budget and appropriations bills passed.\n  Now we are facing the first partisan filibuster of a circuit court \njudicial nominee. Now we are facing a new standard--not the gold \nstandard of the American Bar Association but talks about qualified, or \nwell-qualified, of which Mr. Estrada has received the highest ranking--\na new Federal standard. But, instead, we are facing a standard of \npolitical acceptability. Our Constitution is being tested. It is being \ntested by the reaction to Mr. Estrada's nomination.\n  He is someone who comes to us as an immigrant who worked his way up, \nwho became the top of his class in college, the top of his class in law \nschool, magna cum laude from Harvard, editor of the Law Review, clerked \nfor Federal judges, clerked for Supreme Court Judges, and comes to us \nwith the highest qualification rating by the American Bar Association. \nBut now we are facing a new standard.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reject the \npolitical considerations and get back to that view and that perspective \non whether they are fit, whether they are qualified, and whether they \nhave the right kind of judicial temperament. Let us put an end to this \ndebate. Let us support and confirm Mr. Estrada's nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, last night the Senate voted on three \njudicial nominations. And we voted unanimously--Republicans and \nDemocrats. We voted unanimously, recognizing that those nominations \nwere very likely ones with which we had perhaps even broad \nphilosophical differences. But we voted. We didn't delay. We had \ndebate. We all had an opportunity to make our evaluation. We came to \nsome conclusion.\n  That is how it should work. That is what our Founding Fathers had \nenvisioned. That is what the distinguished Senator from Minnesota was \njust alluding to--advise and consent. When it works, there are very few \nglitches. When it works, Republicans and Democrats can come together \nand make their best judgment.\n  It worked in this case. Why did it work? It worked in part because \nthese nominees came before the Judiciary Committee and they did their \nbest to answer the questions presented to them. They did their best to \noffer as much information as they could about their past, about their \nrecord, about others' judgments, and about their record. Having \npresented their information, having made their case, the Judiciary \nCommittee voted, they were passed out of committee, they came to the \nfloor, and the Senate voted.\n  Not one Republican Senator has mentioned that process today. They say \nthat somehow we are abrogating our responsibilities in requesting \nexactly the same information from Miguel Estrada--not any more but not \nany less.\n  So this is not a question about disallowing conservative judges. We \ndo that. We actually do it fairly regularly. It is my view that there \nare times when judges we view to be outside the mainstream--extreme, in \nother words--ought to be considered on the basis of their philosophical \npoints of view. But if they fall within what we view to be, as best as \nwe can tell, the philosophical mainstream in spite of their \nconservatism, I think a President has a basic right to nominate those \nin whom he has confidence.\n  There are those who have argued in the last couple of days that this \nis really about our opposition to diversity, that somehow we are \nopposed to Hispanic judges. That is not only unfortunate and not only \nin error, but I think it does a disservice to this debate. Frankly, \nthey ought to know better than to resort to that kind of rhetoric which \ndemeans the debate. If this were about diversity, if this were about \nsome concern for Hispanic judges as some have asserted, we would be \nhard pressed to find one, much less virtually the entire Congressional \nHispanic Caucus, in opposition. Yet that is what we find. Virtually \nevery member of the Hispanic Caucus in the House of Representatives has \nopposed this nomination. Why? In large measure for the same reasons we \noppose this nomination, unless we have more information. They don't \nknow either where Mr. Estrada stands. They have no record either. In \nspite of their best efforts, there is a shroud of secrecy around this \nnominee that is very disconcerting.\n  Why is it that nominee after nominee comes before the Judiciary \nCommittee and provides the information required? Why is it we have \naccess to the information, the records of virtually every other \nnominee? Why is it, with that record of performance, that when it comes \nto this nominee--whether it is before the Judiciary Committee or before \nthe Hispanic Caucus or before anybody else seeking information--we come \nup with nothing?\n\n[[Page S2150]]\n\n  Mr. President, either this nominee knows nothing or he feels he must \nhide something. It is one or the other: He knows nothing or feels the \nneed to hide something.\n  Now, I suppose if this were a temporary nomination, if this were \nsomething within the administration, with a beginning and an end to the \nterm--a commission, even a Secretary--perhaps we could let this go by, \nperhaps we should not feel quite as troubled by this lack of \nwillingness to be more forthcoming. But this is for the second highest \ncourt in the land. And not only the second highest court in the land, \nthis is actually for, arguably, the most important court in all of the \ncircuits in this country.\n  It is within this circuit that we find perhaps the single most \ncomplex, the most serious, the most hotly debated, the most contentious \nissues to come before the courts. Those who will serve on this court \nwill decide the future of title IX, the future of workers rights, the \nfuture of campaign finance, the status of toxic waste cleanup. Those \nand many more issues will be decided in the D.C. Circuit.\n  So we are left with a very serious dilemma: Do we vote on what is \nessentially a blank slate or do we say: ``Look, we will vote, we will \nbe prepared to move forward on this and any other nomination so long as \nthat information can be provided''?\n  Today, Senator Leahy and I have sent a letter to the President asking \nthat the documentation that has been provided on numerous other \noccasions--the Solicitor General records--be provided as they were with \nMr. Bork, Mr. Rehnquist, Benjamin Civiletti, and many others. That \nprecedent has long since been established. We have asked for the same \ninformation provided to the Senate that was provided on those nominees. \nWhy? Because there is no record. Why? Because there is no basis upon \nwhich to make a public judgment unless we have that information.\n  That is all we are asking: Give us some record upon which to make our \njudgment, No. 1. And, No. 2, let us just ask Mr. Estrada to present to \nus the answers to the same questions that have been asked by Republican \ncolleagues to nominees in past Congresses and by Democratic and \nRepublican Senators to nominees in this Congress.\n  Why is it we should give some exclusion to this particular nominee? \nWhat is it about this nominee that gives him that right to say: ``No, \nI'm above that. I don't have to provide that information. I don't have \nto provide the same information that Mr. Bork provided or that Mr. \nRehnquist provided. I don't have to do that. I'm unique''?\n  There is nothing unique about defying the Senate. Others have \nattempted to do so. But when one defies the Senate, defies the \nConstitution, when someone undermines the constitutional obligation we \nhave to advise and consent, we take that seriously.\n  So we have no choice. We have an obligation to live up to the same \nstandard with this nomination that we have with all the others. All we \nare suggesting is that our colleagues live up to it as well. Provide us \nwith the information. Answer the questions. Once that happens, we will \nmake our judgment on this nomination. Some already have. But there are \nmany others who deserve the right to make a proper evaluation.\n\n  I must say, based on the limited information available to us, there \nalready are serious questions about Mr. Estrada's qualifications. His \nimmediate supervisor at the Justice Department said: I cannot, in good \nconscience, recommend this man to serve on the Circuit Court of the \nUnited States of America. I cannot do that. In fact, he went on to say: \nI can't even trust this person. That is from the supervisor, the person \nwho probably knows this man the best.\n  Mr. President, if a supervisor at the Justice Department cannot find \nwithin himself to support this nominee, how in the world is it we say \nwe know better?\n  If Mr. Estrada has more information he can share that would shed some \nlight on what it is that has caused his supervisor to be as concerned \nas he was to oppose this nomination, then I would say it would be in \nhis interest to bring it forward, to let us look at it. And that is why \nthe Solicitor General papers are so critical.\n  So, Mr. President, I do not know how long this debate will go on, but \nI will say this: We have thought about this very carefully now for many \ndays. And it is not without a great deal of concern and disappointment \nthat I come to the floor with the report I have just shared.\n  Our colleagues feel as strongly about this as anything that has been \npresented to us. There is no doubt we have the votes to sustain \nwhatever procedural efforts are made to bring this debate to a close. I \nwould hope that would not be necessary.\n  This matter can be resolved if we simply have access to the documents \nand have answers to the questions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter Senator Leahy \nand I sent to the President be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 11, 2003.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are writing in reference to your \n     nomination of Miguel Estrada to the U.S. Court of Appeals for \n     the District of Columbia Circuit. Pursuant to the \n     Constitution, the Senate is to act as a co-equal participant \n     in the confirmation of judges to the federal bench. Unlike \n     nominations made by a President for Executive Branch \n     appointments, judicial nominees are reviewed by the Senate \n     for appointment to lifetime positions in the Judicial Branch.\n       The Senate has often requested and received supplemental \n     documents when it is considering controversial nominations or \n     when evaluating a candidate with a limited public record. The \n     Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote to your \n     Administration on May 15, 2002 to request such supplemental \n     documents to assist in Senate consideration of the Estrada \n     nomination. In particular, the request was made for appeal \n     recommendations, certiorari recommendations, and amicus \n     recommendations that Mr. Estrada worked on while at the \n     Department of Justice.\n       Prior Administrations have accommodated similar Senate \n     requests for such documents. Such documents were provided \n     during Senate consideration of the nominations of Robert H. \n     Bork, William Bradford Reynolds, Benjamin Civiletti, Stephen \n     Trott, and William H. Rehnquist.\n       Your Administration has refused to accommodate the Senate's \n     request for documents in connection with the Estrada \n     nomination. That refusal was a matter of inquiry at the \n     confirmation hearing held on this nomination on September 26, \n     2002. Following the hearing, Senator Schumer wrote to the \n     Attorney General on January 23, 2003, to follow up on the \n     request.\n       In addition to requests for documents, Senators frequently \n     question judicial nominees during their confirmation hearings \n     to determine their judicial philosophy, views and \n     temperament. For example, then-Senator John Ashcroft asked \n     nominees: ``Which judge has served as a model for the way you \n     would conduct yourself as a judge and why?'' Mr. Estrada \n     refused to answer a similar question.\n       During consideration of President Clinton's judicial \n     nominees, Republican Senators asked repeated questions \n     regarding nominees' judicial philosophy, views or legal \n     matters, and approaches to interpreting the Constitution. \n     They insisted on and received answers. During his \n     consideration before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr. \n     Estrada failed to answer these kinds of questions. These \n     questions have not only been routinely asked by the Senate, \n     they have been routinely answered by other nominees--\n     including other nominees from your Administration.\n       For the Senate to make an informed decision about Mr. \n     Estrada's nomination, it is essential that we receive the \n     information requested and answers to these basic legal \n     questions. Specifically we ask:\n       1. That you instruct the Department of Justice to \n     accommodate the requests for documents immediately so that \n     the hearing process can be completed and the Senate can have \n     a more complete record on which to consider this nomination; \n     and\n       2. That Mr. Estrada answer the questions that he refused to \n     answer during his Judicial Committee hearing to allow for a \n     credible review of his judicial philosophy and legal views.\n       We would appreciate your personal attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Tom Daschle.\n     Patrick Leahy.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Answer the questions. Provide the information. Let's \nmove this debate forward. Let's do the right thing. Let's live up to \nour constitutional obligation. Let's respect the advice and consent \nclause of the United States Constitution. Let's do what our forefathers \nexpected of us. Let's not carve out an exemption for Mr. Estrada or \nanybody else. Let us make a wise decision about this nomination, as we \nhave in so many other cases.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip.\n\n[[Page S2151]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, earlier today there was a colloquy between \nthe junior Senator from New York and this Senator, following remarks of \nthe distinguished Chair of the Judiciary Committee, who said the \nCongressional Hispanic Caucus was divided on their feelings about the \nnominee now before this body.\n  I mentioned to the Senator from New York I had been privy to a \nconversation just a few days ago with the chairman of the Hispanic \nCaucus and other members of that caucus who said they unanimously \noppose Miguel Estrada to be district judge for the District of \nColumbia.\n  I will now read into the record a statement of the Chair of the \nHispanic Caucus, Congressman Ciro D. Rodriguez, dated today, which \nreads:\n\n       ``It is disheartening to see that Members of the Republican \n     Senate continue to make misleading and unfound statements \n     regarding the Congressional Hispanic Caucus's opposition to \n     Bush judicial nominee Miguel Estrada,'' said Congressman Ciro \n     D. Rodriguez, chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. \n     ``The CHC will continue to stand by its unanimous opposition \n     to this unqualified nominee and will not waiver.''\n       ``Senate Republicans continue to hit below the belt, \n     insulting Hispanic Members of this Congress who have been \n     elected to serve as a voice for the people in their \n     community,'' continued Congressman Rodriguez. ``Today, Senate \n     Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch continues to make misleading, \n     partisan swipes. He incorrectly claims that the CHC is split \n     in its opposition, and he mischaracterizes our arguments. \n     Yesterday, the CHC released a letter to Senator Hatch \n     demanding an apology for comments he made during Senatorial \n     debate, likening Members of the CHC `to the lioness eating \n     her cubs . . .' We have yet to receive an apology or even an \n     acknowledgment from the Senator that his comments were out of \n     line and insulting.''\n       ``The CHC has supported numerous highly qualified Hispanic \n     appointees by the Bush Administration,'' noted Congressman \n     Rodriguez. ``We oppose Mr. Estrada, however, based on our \n     review of his inadequate qualifications for what is viewed as \n     the second most powerful court in the nation.''\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been on the Senate floor since the \ndebate on the Miguel Estrada nomination commenced last week. I have \nstated in the strongest terms my support for his qualifications. I am \nnot alone. Virtually anybody who knows him, anybody who has any \nbackground on Miguel Estrada, feels the same way. I have stated in the \nstrongest terms this support. The record is replete with reasons why he \nwould be an excellent addition to this DC Circuit and with facts \ndispelling the specious arguments of his detractors.\n  I will now address the procedural tactic that is being used against \nMiguel Estrada, and I am talking about a filibuster of this nomination. \nA filibuster of Mr. Estrada's nomination will require a cloture vote by \nthe Senate to end debate, unless reasonable minds on the Democratic \nside can prevail.\n  I know there are some who are working to try to prevail, just like I \nhad to work on our side to prevail over those who wanted to filibuster \nsome of President Clinton's nominees. I am hoping reasonable people on \nthe Democrat side will prevail. They simply must prevail because we \nreally do not want to start down the road of a filibuster.\n  As I say, a filibuster of Mr. Estrada's nomination will require a \ncloture vote by the Senate to end debate. This means that a \nsupermajority of 60 votes will be required to allow us to proceed to an \nup-or-down vote on Miguel Estrada's nomination. That is an insult to \nMiguel Estrada. It is an insult to the Senate. It is an insult to \nHispanic people all over this country who are watching what is \nhappening. Actually, it is an insult to this coequal branch of \ngovernment, the judiciary.\n  I have taken the Senate floor on more than one occasion to decry the \ntactic of enforcing judicial nominees through a cloture vote. My \nposition has been the same, regardless whether the nominee was \nappointed by a Democratic or Republican President. I am proud to say \nduring my nearly 30 years in the Senate, I have never voted against \ncloture for a judicial nominee, even on the rare occasion when I \nopposed a judicial nomination and ultimately voted against that \nnomination.\n  An example in point is the nomination of Lee Sarokin to the Third \nCircuit. Even though I voted against his nomination, I voted in favor \nof cloture because I strongly believed his nomination deserved to \nsucceed or fail on the basis of the votes of a simple majority of the \nSenate, not on the will of merely 41 Senators who vote against cloture. \nI argued strenuously in favor of invoking cloture on two of President \nClinton's judicial nominees, Marcia Berzon and Richard Paez.\n  There are times when legislators must, to be effective, demonstrate \nmastery of politics, but there are also other times when politics, \nthough available, must be foresworn. This is one of those times. There \nis a quote of Disraeli that addresses this situation perfectly. To \nparaphrase, next to knowing when to seize an opportunity, the most \nimportant thing is knowing when to forgo an advantage.\n  I hope my colleagues will forgo their perceived advantage of a \nfilibuster of Miguel Estrada's nomination. Forcing a supermajority vote \non any judicial nominee is a maneuver that needlessly injects even more \npolitics into the already overpoliticized confirmation process. I \nbelieve there are certain areas that should be designated as off limits \nfrom political activity. The Senate's role in confirming lifetime \nappointed article III judges and the underlying principle that the \nSenate perform that role through the majority vote of its Members are \nsuch issues. Nothing less depends on the recognition of these \nprinciples than the continued untarnished respect for our third branch \nof Government, the one branch of Government intended to be above \npolitical influence, the Federal judiciary.\n  On the basis of principle, I have always tried to be fair to judicial \nnominees, regardless of the political affiliation of the President \nmaking the nomination. The opposition to now Judge Berzon and now Judge \nPaez, two Clinton nominees, was led by members of my own party. They \nbelieved very deeply that Marcia Berzon, with her very liberal \nphilosophy, would become an activist judge. They knew, in their eyes--\nand I think they were pretty right--that Judge Paez as a Federal \ndistrict court judge was an activist judge, writing activist decisions. \nI met Judge Paez, and he said he would be very careful not to be \nactivist in the future. It did not take him long on the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, in the eyes of some, to go back to his activist ways. \nActivism means acting as a superlegislator on the bench, making laws \nthat should be made by those who have to stand for reelection--Members \nof Congress and the President.\n  When members of my own party fought against Judge Berzon, now Judge \nBerzon, and then Judge Paez, during that time I stood against the use \nof cloture to attempt to thwart a vote on their nominations, and I was \nsuccessful. Now it is my friends across the aisle first subjecting \nMiguel Estrada's nomination to a cloture vote. I stand just as firmly \ntoday against the use of this tactic to prevent his nomination from \ncoming to the floor of the Senate for an up-or-down vote, which is what \nthe President deserves. If we are going to be fair to the President of \nthe United States, whoever the President may be, we should always \nprovide that opportunity to have an up-or-down vote on these nominees.\n\n  To be sure, this body has on occasion engaged in the dubious practice \nof filibusters of judicial nominees, but forcing the filing of cloture \non a judicial nominee remains the exception rather than the rule. We \nhave always been able to thwart the attempted filibuster by some who I \nthink at the time did not fully realize the import of their actions.\n  We have always been successful. Overall, these episodes have been \ninfrequent and they have been unfortunate in each case. I hope they \nwill remain as such and that what we are seeing today is not the \nbeginning of a long battle of fighting filibuster threats against \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees. There is real cause for concern \nthat is not to be taken lightly in the wake of the November elections. \nLeading liberals hit the newspapers to urge my\n\n[[Page S2152]]\n\nDemocratic colleagues to use the filibuster as a tool to defeat \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees.\n  On November 11 of last year, the Legal Times published an article: \n``A Major Shift in the Battle for the Bench.'' The article was \nsubtitled: ``With GOP steering the Judiciary Committee, liberal \nadvocates turn to more desperate measures.'' The article reported on \nthe plans of liberal interest groups to refocus their energies against \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees on the Senate floor where \n``filibusters and legislative horse trading may give liberal interest \ngroups their best shot at influencing the process.''\n  The senior legislative counsel of one liberal group called the \nfilibuster a ``plausible weapon.''\n  Also on November 11, two liberal law professors published an op-ed in \nthe Los Angeles Times entitled: ``No to a Far-Right Court: Use \nFilibusters.'' In an implicit nod to the rarity of the use of a \nfilibuster to defeat a judicial nominee, the article urged ``courageous \nDemocrats'' that a filibuster is the only way to thwart President \nBush's nominees.\n  The New York Times on November 10 similarly urged Democrats ``not \n[to] be afraid to mount a filibuster,'' which, again, implicitly \nacknowledges the extremity of filibustering a judicial nomination.\n  On November 14, the Madison Capital Times reported that a Federal \nfeminist group was targeting Wisconsin for a grassroots campaign to \ndrum up support for the filibustering of Bush Supreme Court nominees. \nThe paper candidly reported:\n\n       The tactic would call on Senators to filibuster in order to \n     block [pro-life] nominees. A filibuster is a parliamentary \n     technique that allows a majority of Senators to keep a vote \n     from being taken. Defeating a nominee requires a majority \n     vote in the Senate, but only 41 of the 100 Senators are \n     needed to sustain a filibuster.\n\n  The rallies in Madison and Milwaukee were only 2 of 12 such campaigns \nby this group on college campuses nationwide to drum up support for \nfilibustering judicial nominees based on the single litmus test issue \nof abortion.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent editorials be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From Capital Times, Nov. 14, 2002]\n\n            Activist: Urge Senators to Save Abortion Rights\n\n                          (By Samara Kalk Der)\n\n       Women's rights leader Eleanor Smeal was in Milwaukee and \n     Madison Wednesday urging grass-roots abortion rights \n     supporters to send a message to U.S. Sens. Russ Feingold and \n     Herb Kohl.\n       Smeal said she came to Wisconsin because it is the only \n     state where both of its senators sit on the Judiciary \n     Committee, which wields considerable power when it comes to \n     the scrutiny and confirmation of Supreme Court justices.\n       While Democrats Feingold and Kohl both take positions \n     supporting abortion rights, women in Wisconsin must not take \n     for granted, Smeal told an overflow crowd of 250 that packed \n     into the Marquee Room at the Madison Civic Center Wednesday \n     night for ``Never Go Back,'' a national campaign aimed at \n     putting a spotlight on the protection of abortion rights.'' I \n     hope this campus organizes like it has never organized \n     before,'' Smeal told the group, which was nearly all female \n     and filled with many UW-Madison students.\n       The political landscape is making those who cherish the \n     right to choose an abortion nervous, and Smeal and local \n     activists who spoke.\n       ``What Nov. 5 (the midterm election) has done is made it \n     clear to everybody what we are up against,'' said Smeal, \n     president of the Feminist Majority Foundation and three-time \n     president of the National Organization for Women.\n       Smeal led the first national abortion rights march in 1986, \n     which drew about 100,000 to rally in Washington, D.C. In \n     1989, more than twice as many marched, she said. And then, in \n     1992, the march turned out more than 700,000.\n       ``I believe we are going to have to march again and again \n     and again,'' she said.\n       Vacancies on the U.S. Supreme Court may appear as early as \n     this summer, and it is expected that President George W. Bush \n     will seek to appoint justices who oppose abortion.\n       Smeal is touting a plan to save abortion rights now that \n     the country has a conservative president and U.S. Senate \n     majority. The strategy focuses on the Senate because it has \n     the power to confirm, reject or block nominees to he U.S. \n     high court.\n       The tactic would call on senators to filibuster in order to \n     block anti-abortion nominees. A filibuster is a parliamentary \n     technique that allows a minority of senators to keep a vote \n     from being taken. Defeating a nominee requires a majority \n     vote in the Senate, but only 41 of the 100 senators are \n     needed to sustain a filibuster.\n       ``It's the safest tool we have to save the lives of the \n     next generation of women,'' Smeal said.\n       If the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, the 30-year-old \n     decision that struck down restrictive state abortion laws, \n     abortion rights will again be determined state by state. That \n     means rich women will be able to hop a plane to get an \n     abortion, while poor women will be left to bring unwanted \n     pregnancies to term or seek dangerous, ``back alley'' \n     abortions, Smeal said.\n       ``We'll lose centuries,'' she added.\n       Dr. Dennis Christensen, medical director of the Madison \n     Abortion Clinic, also spoke. He said the huge turnout for the \n     event was one of the few bright spots he's seen since last \n     week's election. For the first time in 30 years he really \n     feels the urgency of the abortion rights cause, he said.\n       ``Where were the women in this election?'' he asked.\n       ``Christensen said he is not a politician or a fund-raiser. \n     He is a physician who is able to help women ``with this \n     problem that they have.''\n       ``I don't have to worry about it. I'm not going to get \n     pregnant,'' he added.\n       If Roe v. Wade is overturned, abortion in Wisconsin will \n     become illegal the next day, Christensen said. Wisconsin is \n     one of just 14 states where abortion will be considered \n     illegal should the federal law get struck down, he added.\n       ``I don't think I'm ready to spend my retirement in jail,'' \n     he quipped. ``I plan to spend it on the golf course.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 10, 2002]\n\n                        Defending the Judiciary\n\n       The biggest fallout from last week's Republican capture of \n     the Senate may be that it will now be harder to block \n     ideologically extreme nominees to the federal courts. But \n     contrary to what some conservatives claim, nothing in the \n     election returns suggests that Americans want the courts \n     packed with such judges. Given the new political lineup, \n     Democratic and moderate Republican senators must be more \n     involved in the confirmation process to ensure that Justice \n     Department ideologues do not have a free hand in shaping the \n     federal judiciary for decades to come.\n       For all of the talk of Republican ascendancy, last week's \n     election returns did not produce anything like a right-wing \n     mandate. Republicans running in the hardest-fought elections \n     hewed to the political center. The victory margins in the \n     races that ended up shifting the Senate--Minnesota and \n     Missouri--were less than three percentage points.\n       Despite President Bush's campaign promise to ``unite, not \n     divide,'' many of his judicial nominees have done the \n     reverse. They favor taking away the right to abortion, \n     striking down reasonable environmental regulations and \n     turning back the clock on race. (One pending nominee at one \n     point criticized the Supreme Court's ruling that Bob Jones \n     University should lose its tax-exempt status for \n     discriminating against black students.) With the Senate in \n     Republican control, the administration is likely to choose \n     even more troubling nominees.\n       Senate Democrats must insist on two things going forward: \n     consultation and consensus. Senator Patrick Leahy, who will \n     be the ranking minority member of the Judiciary Committee, \n     should ask to meet with the administration in advance to head \n     off unacceptable candidates before they are nominated. \n     Consultation of this kind occurred in the Clinton years, and \n     it should be the norm for judicial selections, no matter \n     which party holds the White House.\n       Senate Democrats should also make it clear that they will \n     not accept extremist nominees. They must draw a line in the \n     sand and say that those whose politics cross it will not be \n     confirmed.\n       Democrats in the Senate no longer control the Judiciary \n     Committee, which has until now been screening out the worst \n     nominees, and cannot win party-line votes. But they should \n     reach out to moderate Republican senators and build a \n     mainstream coalition. And when a judicial nominee is \n     unacceptable, they should not be afraid to mount a \n     filibuster, which Republicans would need 60 votes to \n     overcome.\n       Rumors have been swirling around Washington that there \n     could be one or more Supreme Court vacancies in the next few \n     months, making the stakes as high as can be. With the White \n     House representing the far right in the nominating process, \n     it remains up to the Senate--even in its new configuration--\n     to represent the rest of the country.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. What these articles suggest is that the liberal interest \ngroups are just as intent as ever on using every trick in the book to \ndefeat President Bush's judicial nominees. From the start of their \nrecord, as they have tried to do with Miguel Estrada and others, by \nforcing a cloture vote, it appears the liberal interest groups will \nstop at nothing to further their agenda. What is more, it looks as if \nthe defeat we are seeing on Miguel Estrada is\n\n[[Page S2153]]\n\nnot so much about him as it is about seeing how well a filibuster works \nin case there is a Supreme Court nominee this summer.\n  It also may have a more sinister purpose: To desensitize the American \npeople to filibustering judicial nominees so that the practice will \nbecome more acceptable and so that less outrage will be expressed over \nthe filibustering of other circuit nominees and ultimately a Supreme \nCourt nominee. This is all part of the strategy of changing the ground \nrules on judicial nominations that Senate Democrats discussed at their \nretreat back in April of 2001.\n  I am not the only one who recognized the dangerous precedent that \nsome Democrats would set in filibustering qualified nominees. The \nWashington Post, hardly a bastion of conservatism, warned in a December \n5, 2002, editorial that ``a world in which filibusters serve as an \nactive instrument of nomination politics is not one either party should \nwant.''\n  The Washington Post urged Democrats to ``stand down'' on any attempt \nto deny Miguel Estrada a vote because his nomination ``in no way \ndeserves a filibuster.''\n  I couldn't agree more.\n  I hope I am wrong about the extent to which the liberal interests \ngroups have had a role in orchestrating this lengthy debate on Miguel \nEstrada's nomination. I hope that this is not another example of an \nattempt by some of my Democratic colleagues to change the ground rules \non judicial nominees. I hope that my Democratic colleagues will \nexercise the same independence that I did when I joined them to invoke \ncloture on the nominations of Clinton judicial nominees who were \nopposed by many of my Republican colleagues.\n  When I argued to invoke cloture on the nominations of Judge Berzon \nand Judge Paez, I noted several important reasons for avoiding a \nfilibuster of judicial nominees. One is that the Senate's \nconstitutional duty of advise and consent contemplates that a vote by a \nsimple majority of the Senate determine the fate of a judicial nominee. \nThere is nothing in the Constitution that gives that power to a \nminority of 41 Senators, just as that power should not be yielded by 10 \nSenators in a party-line vote in committee.\n  Another reason is that most of the fight over a nomination has \noccurred well before a nominee arrives at the Senate floor. The battles \nare largely fought between the White House and the Judiciary Committee, \nsince it is our job to vet the nominees. By the time a judicial nominee \nreaches the Senate floor, he or she deserves a vote on the merits \nwithout having to clear the procedural hurdle of a cloture vote.\n  In the past, several of my Democratic colleagues have joined me in \ncondemning the practice of forcing judicial nominees through a cloture \nvote. For example, during the debate on Clinton nominees, one of my \nDemocratic friends spoke passionately about this tactic. He said:\n\n       I . . . do not want to see the Senate go down a path where \n     a minority of the Senate is determining a judge's fate on \n     votes of 41.\n\n  He continued:\n\n       I . . . took the floor on occasion to oppose filibusters to \n     hold . . . up [nominations] and believe that we should have a \n     vote up or down.\n\n  On a different occasion, the same colleague said:\n\n       I have stated over and over again on this floor that . . . \n     I would object and fight against any filibuster on a judge, \n     whether it is somebody I opposed or supported; that I felt \n     the Senate should do its duty.\n\n  And another Democratic colleague put it simply when she said:\n\n       A nominee is entitled to a vote. Vote them up or vote them \n     down . . . If someone has an opposition to a judge, they \n     should come to the floor and say that.\n\n  I agree wholeheartedly with these statements.\n  Miguel Estrada waited more than 16 months for his confirmation \nhearing. He waited another 4 months for a committee vote on his \nnomination. And now his nomination is being subjected to yet another \nhurdle: Extended floor debate on his nomination with no end in sight. \nIf we're going to debate Mr. Estrada's nomination, then let's do it, \nvote on it, and get on with the other important matters that are the \nwork of this body.\n  I hope my colleagues are not going to the unworthy ends of \nfilibustering the President's nominees. It is unfair to the President. \nIt is unfair to the process. It is unfair to Miguel Estrada who has \nearned the right to be here.\n  I think it is important to remind my Democratic colleagues of \nstatements they have made over the years opposing filibusters of \njudicial nominees. Of course, there was a Democratic President in the \nWhite House at the time these statements were made. I guess that is the \ndouble standard for Mr. Estrada, in more ways than one.\n  I remember, on the nomination of Merrick Garland, here was a \nstatement of Senator Sarbanes, who came to the Senate the same time I \ndid, and whom I respect, the Senator from Maryland. It was on the \nnomination of Merrick Garland, President Clinton's nominee to the very \nsame court, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, \nfor which Miguel Estrada has been nominated. He said this:\n\n       It is worse than that. It is not whether you let the \n     President have his nominees confirmed. You will not even let \n     them be considered by the Senate for an up-or-down vote. That \n     is the problem today. In other words, the other side will not \n     let the process work so these nominees can come before the \n     Senate for judgment. Some may come before the Senate for \n     judgment and be rejected by the Senate. That is OK. But at \n     least let the process work so the nominees have an \n     opportunity and the judiciary has an opportunity to have \n     these vacant positions filled so the court system does not \n     begin to break down because of the failure to confirm new \n     judges. The Senator from Delaware, when he was chairman of \n     the committee, always measured up to that responsibility, I \n     think often taking a lot of political heat for doing it. But \n     he was out to make sure the system could function. He had \n     Republican Presidents nominating judges. He processed their \n     nominations. He brought them to the floor of the Senate. He \n     gave the Senate a chance to vote on them up or down for those \n     people to get confirmed. that process is breaking down.\n\n  On another occasion Senator Biden said:\n\n       So any member who is nominated for the district or circuit \n     court who, in fact, any Senator believes will be a person of \n     their word and follow stare decisis, it does not matter to me \n     what their ideology is, as long as they are in a position \n     where they are in the general mainstream of American \n     political life and they have not committed crimes of moral \n     turpitude, and have not, in fact, acted in a way that would \n     shed a negative light on the court. But I also respectfully \n     suggest that everyone who is nominated is entitled to have a \n     shot, to have a hearing and to have a shot to be heard on the \n     floor and have a vote on the floor.\n\n  That was a statement of Senator Joseph Biden, Congressional Record, \nMarch 19, 1997 at S2540.\n  This is a statement of Senator Barbara Boxer on the nomination of \nMargaret Morrow, to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals:\n\n       According to the U.S. Constitution, the President \n     nominates, and the Senate shall provide advice and consent. \n     It is not the role of the Senate to obstruct the process and \n     prevent numbers of highly qualified nominees from even being \n     given the opportunity for a vote on the Senate floor.\n\n  That statement of Senator Boxer was printed in the Congressional \nRecord, May 14, 1997 at S4420.\n  On the nomination of Judge Richard Paez, to the Ninth Circuit, \nSenator Leahy, the distinguished ranking member and Senator from \nVermont, said:\n\n       I have heard rumors that some on the Republican side \n     planned to filibuster this nomination. I cannot recall a \n     judicial nomination being successfully filibustered. I do not \n     recall earlier this year when the Republican Chairman of the \n     Judiciary Committee and I noted how improper it would be to \n     filibuster a judicial nomination. During this year's long-\n     delayed debate on the confirmation of Margaret Morrow, \n     Senator Hatch said: `I think it is a travesty if we ever \n     start getting into a game of filibustering judges.' Well, it \n     appears that travesty was successfully threatened by some on \n     the Republican side of the aisle and kept the Minority Leader \n     from fulfilling his commitment to call up the nomination for \n     a confirmation vote.\n\n  That is printed in the Congressional Record, October 14, 1997 at \nS12578.\n  He said:\n\n       If Senators are opposed to any judge, bring them up and \n     vote against them. But don't do an anonymous hold, which \n     diminishes the credibility and respect of the whole U.S. \n     Senate. I have had judicial nominations by both Democrat and \n     Republican Presidents that I intended to oppose. But I fought \n     like mad to make sure they at least got a chance to be on the \n     floor for a vote. I have stated over and over again on this \n     floor that I would refuse to put an anonymous hold on any \n     judge; that I would object and fight against any filibuster \n     on a judge, whether it is somebody I opposed or supported; \n     that I felt the Senate should do its duty.\n\n  That was printed in the Congressional Record, June 18, 1998 at S6523.\n\n[[Page S2154]]\n\n  He said:\n\n       I hope we might reach a point where we as a Senate will \n     accept our responsibility and vote people up or vote them \n     down. Bring the names here. If we want to vote against them, \n     vote against them.\n\n  That was printed in the Congressional Record, October 22, 1997 at \nS10925.\n  He also said:\n\n       I hope that when we return . . . there will be a \n     realization by those in this body who have started down this \n     destructive path of attacking the judiciary and stalling the \n     confirmation of qualified nominees to the Federal bench that \n     those efforts do not serve the national interest or the \n     American people I hope that we can once again remove these \n     important matters from partisan and ideological politics.\n\n  That is a statement of Senator Patrick J. Leahy printed in the \nCongressional Record of November 13, 1997 at S12569.\n  There are other statements by my colleagues, but I don't want to bore \nthe Senate with any more. Let me just say, I hope we do not have a \ndouble standard, but it sure looks as if we do. If Miguel Estrada's \nnomination is truly filibustered--and I hope it is not, but we are \ngetting to the point where we know it will be and we know that it is \nbecause the time is passing--then I think this body is going to be \nsorry because in the past we have been able to stop filibusters. Both \nsides have labored diligently to do so.\n  I have to tell you, if this is the way it is going to be in the \nfuture, nobody is going to be able to stop them. It just means that \nreally highly qualified candidates who are controversial to one side \nare going to be filibustered. It is that simple. I don't want to see \nthat day come.\n  I am disappointed and somewhat outraged with the recent letter that \nwas sent to the President of the United States. This was sent by the \ndistinguished minority leader and the distinguished Democrat leader on \nthe Judiciary Committee. The fact of the matter is, Miguel Estrada's \nhearing was held in September of last year while the Senate was under \nDemocratic control. The Democrats remained in control for the rest of \nthe 107th Congress. If they weren't satisfied with Miguel Estrada's \nanswers at the hearing, they could have held another hearing.\n  But this is what the letter said:\n\n       Dear Mr. President: We are writing in reference to your \n     nomination of Miguel Estrada to the Estrada to the U.S. Court \n     of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Pursuant to \n     the Constitution, the Senate is to act as a co-equal \n     participant in the confirmation of judges to the federal \n     bench. Unlike nominations made by a President for Executive \n     Branch appointments, judicial nominees are reviewed by the \n     Senate for appointment to lifetime positions in the Judicial \n     Branch.\n       The Senate has often requested and received supplemental \n     documents when it is considering controversial nominations or \n     when evaluating a candidate with a limited public record. The \n     Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote to your \n     Administration on May 15, 2002 to request such supplemental \n     documents to assist in Senate consideration of the Estrada \n     nomination. In particular, the request was made for appeal \n     recommendations, certiorari recommendations, and amicus \n     recommendations that Mr. Estrada worked on while at the \n     Department of Justice.\n       Prior Administrations have accommodated similar Senate \n     requests for such documents. Such documents were provided \n     during Senate consideration of the nominations of Robert H. \n     Bork, William Bradford Reynolds, Benjamin Civiletti, Stephen \n     Trott, and William H. Rehnquist.\n       Your Administration has refused to accommodate the Senate's \n     request for documents in connection with the Estrada \n     nomination. That refusal was a matter of inquiry at the \n     confirmation hearing held on this nomination on September 26, \n     2002. Following the hearing, Senator Schumer wrote to the \n     Attorney General on January 23, 2003, to follow up on the \n     request.\n\n  I note parenthetically that was after President Bush won the election \nand the control of the Judiciary Committee was on its way to the \nRepublicans in the Senate.\n  To continue with the letter:\n\n       In addition to requests for documents, Senators frequently \n     question judicial nominees during their confirmation hearings \n     to determine philosophy, views and temperament. For example, \n     then-Senator John Ashcroft asked nominees: ``Which judge has \n     served as a model for the way you would conduct yourself as a \n     judge and why?'' Mr. Estrada refused to answer a similar \n     question.\n       During consideration of President Clinton's judicial \n     nominees, Republican Senators asked repeated questions \n     regarding nominees' judicial philosophy, views on legal \n     matters, and approaches to interpreting the Constitution. \n     They insisted on and received answers. During his \n     consideration before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr. \n     Estrada failed to answer these kinds of questions. These \n     questions have not only been routinely asked by the Senate, \n     they have been routinely answered by other nominees--\n     including other nominees from your Administration.\n       For the Senate to make an informed decision about Mr. \n     Estrada's nomination, it is essential that we receive the \n     information requested and answers to these basic legal \n     questions. Specifically we ask:\n       1. That you instruct the Department of Justice to \n     accommodate the requests for documents immediately so that \n     the hearing process can be completed and the Senate can have \n     a more complete record on which to consider this nomination; \n     and\n       2. That Mr. Estrada answer the questions that he refused to \n     answer during his Judiciary Committee hearing to allow for a \n     credible review of his judicial philosophy and legal views.\n       We would appreciate your personal attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Tom Daschle.\n     Patrick Leahy.\n\n  Madam President, as I said before, if they weren't satisfied with \nMiguel Estrada's answers at his hearing which they conducted and which \nthey controlled, then they could have held another hearing. Nothing \nwould have stopped them. They had the power to do so. They did not. \nThey could have asked him followup questions in writing. Only two of \nthe Democrats did. The fact of the matter is Estrada did answer the \nquestions he was asked by the Democrats and Republicans back in \nSeptember when he had his hearing. My Democratic colleagues are unhappy \nonly because Mr. Estrada did not say anything they could use to oppose \nhim. In other words, he didn't tell them what they really wanted to \nhear, which would have been mistakes, or some error, or some difference \nin opinion they could then use to oppose him. He answered the \nquestions. He just didn't answer them the way they wanted him to \nanswer.\n  That is why they are trying to engage in this fishing expedition and \ndemanding unprecedented, unfettered access to the internal privileged \nmemoranda Mr. Estrada offered at the Department of Justice. These \nmemoranda are attorney work product done for our country when he worked \nfor the Solicitor General. Any lawyer would object to having to hand \nthem over. He didn't. He was proud of his work. He didn't care if the \nGovernment would give them over. But the Government has taken a \nprincipled position; that is, these internal documents should not be \nturned over to the Senate Judiciary Committee to be used to try to \nthwart the nomination of anybody, or to be used, since they were \ninternal confidential documents. They were the work products of \nattorneys within the Solicitor General's Office. It is like asking a \nnominee to give up all of the confidential information his law firm had \nand that he worked on during the time at his law firm that is not in \nthe public record. Any lawyer would object to turning that over.\n  What are we going to do when we disagree with somebody who worked for \nSenator Hatch? Are we going to ask for all of the internal documents \nthe man or woman did while he worked for me that were given for my \npurview as their supervisor, and as their Senator, so I could take \nthose documents and determine what to do in the future?\n  Let us make it even more clear.\n  Should Senator Daschle's staff be subject to this kind of thing?\n  Why would the Solicitor General's Office be subject to having to turn \nover confidential documents that were meant to help the Solicitor \nGeneral make decisions on behalf of our country? Can you imagine how \nthat would chill the work of the people in that office if attorneys \nthere wanted to become judges someday? You don't think that would cause \nthem to be putting their fingers up into the wind and asking, How will \nthis be interpreted someday if I ever come up for a judicial \nnomination? Hopefully they wouldn't, but, of course, they would. Let us \nbe honest about it.\n  But here, unlike Senator Daschle's representations--he certainly is a \nfriend of mine. He signed this letter. It is the Department of Justice, \nnot Mr. Estrada, that holds the memos. The Department has set forth the \nreasons why it is so inappropriate to release these memos. It is \ncrystal clear to me--to all seven remaining former Solicitors General \nof the United States,\n\n[[Page S2155]]\n\nand to the Washington Post. It is clear to them, and to the Wall Street \nJournal. It is to just about everyone, it appears, except to my \nDemocratic colleagues. Why would they want these memoranda? To see if \nthey could find some reason to again attack Mr. Estrada? Is this \nHispanic gentleman so unqualified they have to go on fishing \nexpeditions to try to find things to give him a difficult time with?\n\n  The fact of the matter is he is as qualified as anybody we have had \nbefore the committee, and the American Bar Association said so. I know \nthe Supreme Court Justices feel so. I know a lot of leading Democratic \nlawyers in this town are saying this is the man who deserves \nconfirmation. Why is he being treated differently?\n  One of my colleagues the other day was complaining he thinks some of \nus over here are calling our Democratic colleagues racists because they \nare against Miguel Estrada. No. Nobody over here has made that comment. \nNobody over here has even implied that. But what I have said is it \nisn't because he is Hispanic they are against him--it is because he is \na Hispanic Republican who they think is conservative and who is going \non a court they think is equally divided--where over 90 percent of the \ncases are unanimous decisions, anyway, in that court.\n  It is the worst excuse for voting against him I have ever heard. But \nit is because he is a Hispanic Republican conservative. That is the \nreason they are against him. They are so afraid he might not please \nthem when he gets on the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia.\n  I suggest to them he is a great lawyer. He understands precedent. He \nunderstands the rule of precedent. He understands the rule of what we \ncall stare decisis in the law, and he more than told every one of them \nwho questioned him over and over that he would apply the law as it is, \nregardless of his personal beliefs.\n  What more can anybody say? They are accusing him of not being \nresponsive? I am accusing them of not being fair to a Hispanic \nconservative Republican. I do not know what his point of view is on Roe \nv. Wade. To this day, I don't know. I do know he at one time helped the \nNational Organization for Women in a serious case, which I think if \nthey were offering him as a nominee they would argue means he is all \nright. I do not know what his position is. But I will tell you this. He \ndeserves to be confirmed as a jurist on the Circuit Court of Appeals \nfor the District of Columbia.\n  Let me address in a little more detail why this letter Senator \nDaschle and Senator Leahy sent to President Bush is so outrageous in \nits continuous demand for privileged documents.\n  At the outset, I must note the nature of this request for unfettered \naccess to the universe of Mr. Estrada's work product is truly \nextraordinary. Contrary to what Senator Daschle and others would have \nus believe, and as I have mentioned before, during the last Congress \nthe Senate confirmed Jonathan Adelstein, a former aide to Senator Tom \nDaschle to a position on the FCC. The Republicans did not demand all of \nMr. Adelstein's memoranda to Senator Daschle on telecommunications \nissues before confirming him, despite the fact they would have been \nuseful in determining how Mr. Adelstein would have approached his \ndecisions as a commissioner. This is because of the obvious reason that \nto do so would have intruded into the deliberative relationship between \nMr. Adelstein and Senator Daschle. Nobody here ever wanted to do that, \neven if we didn't like the appointment of Mr. Adelstein. And some on \nour side definitely did not like that appointment. I was not one of \nthem, but there was a considerable number who did not agree with this \nappointment for the same reason, and for other equally sound reasons \nthat I will detail.\n\n  No Member of this body should advocate holding Mr. Estrada's \nnomination hostage to demands for access to internal, confidential \ndocuments he authored at the Solicitor General's Office.\n  My Democratic colleagues have claimed that the Department of Justice \nhas a history of disclosing previously confidential, internal documents \nin connection with confirmation proceedings. This is simply not \naccurate.\n  In a letter dated October 8, the Department of Justice points out \nthat since the beginning of the Carter administration there have been \n67 former Department of Justice employees confirmed as Federal circuit \njudges--38 of whom, like Mr. Estrada, had no prior judicial experience. \nEight of these nominees, again like Mr. Estrada, had worked in the \nSolicitor General's Office.\n  The Department of Justice could find no record of having produced \ninternal, deliberative materials created by the nominee while a DOJ \nlawyer in any of these cases.\n  Madam President, one of my Democratic colleagues listed six nominees \nin connection with which he claimed that the Department of Justice \nreleased confidential, internal documents. In its October 8 letter, the \nDepartment of Justice explained that of these nominees, the hearings of \nonly one--only one; Judge Bork--involved documents from their service \nin the Solicitor General's Office.\n  I think there have been those misrepresentations made to Senators in \ntheir caucus, and they are absolutely false, because I chatted with \nsome of my Democratic friends on my way over to the medical liability \nhearing I conducted this afternoon, and they were citing these same \nspecious arguments that they had been told. Look, if we are going to \ntell our colleagues things, they ought to be accurate.\n  In that one case--Judge Bork's--the Department of Justice produced a \nlimited number of documents related to specific topics of interest to \nthe committee. The Department of Justice did not agree to the fishing \nexpedition that was demanded, and they certainly did not agree to the \ntype of fishing expedition that my Democratic colleagues now seek to \nimpose upon Mr. Estrada in the Justice Department.\n  As the Department of Justice observed:\n\n       The vast majority of memoranda authored or received by \n     Judge Bork when he served as Solicitor General were neither \n     sought nor produced. And the limited category of documents \n     that were produced to the Committee did not reveal the \n     internal deliberative recommendations or analysis of \n     assistance to the Solicitor General regarding appeal, \n     certiorari, or amicus recommendations in pending cases.\n\n  Exactly what they have been asking for here is something that has not \nbeen done. Yet I know it has been represented to some of my Democratic \ncolleagues that the Department of Justice did give these kinds of \ndocuments. Well, they did not. And I hope my colleagues are watching \nthis so they can get the truth.\n\n  This is hardly the unfettered, unprecedented access to privileged \nwork product that my Democratic colleagues now seek. And why do they \nseek it for this fellow who has every qualification to be on the \nCircuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and more, who \nthey have not laid a glove on, who they cannot name one thing that \nwould refute his nomination other than these specious arguments that he \nhas not answered the questions? Sure, he has answered the questions. \nThey just don't like the answers.\n  My Democratic colleagues also claim that policy considerations weigh \nheavily on the side of disclosure. Curiously, however, they fail to \nmention the letter that the committee received from all seven living \nformer Solicitors General of the United States, four of whom are \nleading Democrat lawyers, leading Democrat former Solicitors General.\n  I know some of my colleagues on the other side have not heard that \nyet because I asked some of them what is going to happen here and they \nindicated they are probably going to filibuster. And then one of them \nsaid: Why don't you give up those documents from the Justice \nDepartment? I said: Well, seven former Solicitors General, four of whom \nare Democrats, said that would be preposterous, that they should not do \nthat. Those are confidential. That is the work product of attorneys in \nthe Solicitor General's Office.\n  You should have seen the surprised look on some of my colleagues' \nfaces? ``Really?'' It seems to me, if you are going to argue against a \nperson, you ought to at least tell the truth and the facts on the other \nside.\n  Why is it they are picking on this young, terrific Hispanic candidate \nfor this job, who has the highest rating from the American Bar \nAssociation, a unanimously well-qualified rating?\n  The letter, dated June 24, 2002, was signed by Democrat Seth Waxman--\nwe\n\n[[Page S2156]]\n\nall respect Seth; he is a great lawyer--Walter Dellinger--one of the \ngreat teachers in this country; taught at Duke; a fine man; I have \ngrown to think a great deal of him as I have listened to him on a \nvariety of matters, where in the early days I was not sure I did--Drew \nDays, who is a wonderful African-American former Solicitor General, and \na very adamant Democrat; all of them are--and Archibald Cox. You have \nto go pretty far to find somebody more prestigious than Archibald Cox. \nAll Democrats: Waxman, Dellinger, Days, and Cox. And it was signed, as \nwell, by Republicans Ken Starr, Charles Fried, and Robert Bork.\n  The letter notes that when each of the Solicitors General made \nimportant decisions regarding whether to seek Supreme Court review of \nadverse appellate decisions and whether to participate as amicus curiae \nin other high-profile cases, they ``relied on frank, honest and \nthorough advice from [their] staff attorneys like Mr. Estrada. . . .''\n  The letter explains that the open exchange of ideas, which must occur \nin such a context, ``simply cannot take place if attorneys have reason \nto fear that their private recommendations are not private at all, but \nvulnerable to public disclosure.''\n  The letter concludes that:\n\n       [A]ny attempt to intrude into the Office's highly \n     privileged deliberations would come at a cost of the \n     Solicitor General's ability to defend vigorously the United \n     States' litigation interests--a cost that also would be borne \n     by Congress itself.\n\n  This is a bipartisan group of seven former Solicitors General--all \nthe living ones.\n  The former Solicitors General are not the only ones who are disturbed \nby my Democratic colleagues' efforts to obtain privileged Justice \nDepartment memoranda. The editorial boards of two prominent newspapers \nhave also criticized the attempt to obtain these records. I am sure \nthere are others as well.\n  On May 28 of last year, the Washington Post--as I say, hardly a \nbastion of conservative thought--editorialized that the request ``for \nan attorney's work product would be unthinkable if the work had been \ndone for a private client. The legal advice by a line attorney for the \nfederal government is not fair game either.''\n  According to the Washington Post:\n\n       Particularly in elite government offices such as that of \n     the solicitor general, lawyers need to speak freely without \n     worrying that the positions they are advocating today will be \n     used against them if they ever get nominated to some other \n     position.\n\n  Gee, that is a pretty good reason from the Washington Post. I have to \ntell you, that is a wise editorial, and it is true. And it goes along \nwith the seven former Solicitors General, four of whom are Democrats.\n  The Wall Street Journal also criticized my Democratic colleagues' \nrequest in two editorials. In its second editorial, which appeared on \nJune 11, they called the request ``outrageous'' and noted that the true \ngoal was ``to delay, [to] try . . . to put off the day when Mr. Estrada \ntakes a seat on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, from which President \nBush could promote him to become the first Hispanic-American on the \nU.S. Supreme Court.''\n  The Wall Street Journal got it pretty right. What is really behind \nall this is to damage this person as much as they can so this Hispanic \ngentleman, with all of these qualifications, can never receive a \nnomination to the U.S. Supreme Court, can never be considered.\n  Well, I am doing my best to make sure that does not happen, that he \nwill have a chance, just as any other great lawyer in this country, to \nsomeday be nominated. And that is one reason why I have spent so much \ntime on the floor.\n  Let me conclude. The bottom line is that my Democratic friends are \nseeking internal, confidential material that any reasonable person, \nthinking about it, would agree should not be delivered by the Justice \nDepartment to the Senate for partisan purposes--for any purposes.\n  Those seven former Solicitors General had no axes to grind. They \nunderstand how important those documents are, and how important they \nare to be held confidential. Yet my colleagues on the other side keep \nacting as if that is a right they should have no matter what.\n\n  Their attempts have been criticized by all seven living former \nSolicitors General and by at least two major newspapers of which I am \naware. But more fundamental is the fact that Mr. Estrada does not \nobject to turning over these memoranda. He has nothing to hide. It is \nthe Department of Justice that has an institutional interest and a \nrightful institutional interest in refusing to comply with my \nDemocratic colleagues' request. I, for one, understand and agree with \nthe Department's position but the Department's recalcitrance in this \ndispute should neither be imputed to nor held against Mr. Estrada.\n  What bothers me is that we have had colleague after colleague from \nthe other side come to the floor knowing that these seven Solicitors \nGeneral have given this opinion--knowing it--and have not informed \ntheir colleagues, some of whom are very mixed up about this. Why? Why \nwouldn't they tell them the truth? I guess to embarrass Mr. Estrada.\n  This is a fishing expedition par excellence. It is wrong. They just \ndon't want a conservative Hispanic Republican on this court at this \ntime, especially one who has all the credentials that Miguel Estrada \nhas because he would have to be on anybody's short list for the Supreme \nCourt of the United States of America. The longer they can delay him \nfrom taking his seat, the more difficult it will be for him to have any \nchance of being on the Supreme Court and become the first Hispanic not \nonly on the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia but \nthe first Hispanic to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I am not saying the court is going to pick Miguel Estrada, but he \nwould be on the short list; He is that good. How many Senators have \nargued 15 cases before the Supreme Court, winning 10 of them? How many \nSenators graduated magna cum laude from Columbia or from Harvard, which \nhe did? How many Senators held the prestigious position of editor of \nthe Harvard Law Review? I don't know of any.\n  All I can say is, how many Senators could have served not only a \ncircuit court of appeals judge but also as a clerk to a Justice of the \nU.S. Supreme Court, Justice Anthony Kennedy? I don't think any of them. \nMaybe some, but I don't know of them.\n  We have reached the point where it is just terrible. We have waited \nlong enough. We have been going on this debate now for a week. That is \nlonger than most Supreme Court nominations. This man certainly deserves \nto have an up-or-down vote and not a vote on cloture.\n  I have been asked by the leader to make the following unanimous \nconsent request: I ask unanimous consent that there be an additional 6 \nhours for debate on the Estrada nomination; provided further that the \ntime be equally divided between the chairman and ranking member or \ntheir designees, and that following the conclusion of that time, the \nSenate proceed to a vote on the confirmation of the nomination with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HATCH. I would modify my unanimous consent request to 8 \nadditional hours in addition to the 6 I have asked for.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me modify it to 10 additional hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me go further, let me modify it to 20 additional \nhours, which would probably be close to 3 more days.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, reserving the right to object, the good \nSenator, my friend from Utah, can add as many hours as he would like, \nbut the Senate wants to be heard on this matter. There will be \nobjections noted on every request for additional time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator telling me no matter what I offer that \nSenate Democrats are going to object?\n\n[[Page S2157]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. To try to limit debate on this matter, I tell my good \nfriend from Utah, that any effort to limit debate will be objected to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Even if I go up to 40 or 50 hours?\n  Mr. DODD. This is not about the amount of time. The Senate wishes to \nbe heard on this matter. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HATCH. I don't blame the distinguished Senator from Connecticut \nfor having to make these objections.\n  Mr. DODD. I don't blame the good Senator from Utah for making the \nrequests.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am going to keep making them because it is apparent now \nthat we are in the middle of a filibuster. I just want to warn the \nSenate, that is not a good thing. It is not fair to the President. It \nis not fair to Miguel Estrada. It is not fair to the process. It is not \nfair to the judiciary. It is not fair to Senators who have been fair to \nDemocrat nominees who were heavily contested where there were no \ncloture votes or no, should I say, real filibuster. It is just plain \nnot fair.\n  What is so wrong with giving this Hispanic man, who may be \nconservative and who is Republican, an opportunity to serve, to break \nthrough that intellectual glass ceiling that suddenly seems to have \nbeen erected and give him an opportunity to serve since he has such \ngreat ability to be able to do so and has proven it?\n  I repeat again, he has the highest recommendations of the American \nBar Association, the gold standard of my colleagues on the other side. \nThey are the ones who said that the ABA recommendations are the gold \nstandard, and he holds a unanimously well-qualified, highest rating of \nthe American Bar Association. How can we stand here and filibuster \nsomebody like that?\n  All I can say is that I hope everybody in America is watching us \nbecause it is just plain not fair nor is it right. If we are going to \ndo this, it is a road I surely don't want to see the Senate go down. I \nam hoping that my good friend from Connecticut will talk to his friends \non the other side and my friends on the other side and get some reason.\n  We are now at a new point in history for this body. In the \nconfirmation of judicial nominees, this will be the first time in the \nhistory of this country and of this body that a filibuster will be \nconducted against a circuit court of appeals nominee, a true \nfilibuster. I am going to keep the door open for my colleagues to see \nthe error of their ways, and hopefully we can resolve this matter \nbefore the end of this week or in any reasonable time. I offered up to \n50 hours that were objected to. I am surely hoping that my colleagues \nwho think a little more clearly on the other side will influence all of \nour other colleagues who are seemingly so caught up in an ideological \nwarfare and give this vote to Miguel Estrada who deserves it.\n\n  I notice my colleague has been patiently waiting for a long time. I \napologize to him, but I had to make these comments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I am not a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee. I was in the other body some years ago when I served there. \nBut like many of my colleagues here who have served in this institution \nfor some time and have been involved in any number of judicial \nnominations, going back now over the past two decades, this is a unique \nmoment.\n  My friend and colleague from Utah has called this a moment of \nhistoric significance. I agree with him about that. This is an \nimportant moment historically. It is an important moment for this \ninstitution.\n  I enjoy carrying every day with me in my pocket a copy of the \nDeclaration of Independence and the Constitution given to me some years \nago by my seatmate, Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, a rather \ntattered looking copy now. I carry it with me and refer to it quite \nfrequently as a reminder to myself of what a wonderful privilege it is \nto serve in this institution and the sacred obligation we bear, each \nand every one of us, when we are sworn in as Members of this body to \nuphold and defend this Constitution.\n  There are two important relevant points during the next few moments \nas I share my thoughts on the matter of this nomination. The first \nbegins with article III of the Constitution written more than 200 years \nago by our Founding Fathers. It says:\n\n       The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in \n     one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the \n     Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.\n       The judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall \n     hold their offices during good Behaviour . . . [in a sense \n     for life].\n\n  It is a unique office in the judicial branch in this country. Unlike \narticle II on the Presidency, in article III, judicial nominations \nserve, during good behavior, for the rest of their lives.\n  This nominee is in his early forties, I am told. God willing, Miguel \nEstrada may have as many as 40 or 50 years to serve on the judicial \nbranch of this country, either at the circuit court level, or possibly \nthe Supreme Court level, having listened to my friend from Utah about \nthe possibility of being on a short list.\n  So in assessing this nomination and the process, it is critically \nimportant that my colleagues and others be mindful of this article III, \nsection 1 provision, that judges are nominated by the President and \nserve, if confirmed, for life. These are unique positions in the entire \nconstellation of offices that could be held in the Federal Government--\nfor life, during good behavior.\n  The second provision that is important to take note of as you engage \nin this discussion is in article II, section 2. I will quote it. \nArticle II, section 2, in part, reads, in the second paragraph:\n\n       He [the President] shall have, Power by and with the Advice \n     and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two-\n     thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, \n     and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall \n     appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, \n     judges of the Supreme Court, and all other Officers of the \n     United States. . . .\n\n  By and with the advice and consent of the United States Senate.\n  Those two provisions are critically important to keep in mind as you \nlisten to this debate and discussion about this particular nomination. \nThe debate and discussion, I suggest, goes far beyond the individual \nattributes, qualifications of Miguel Estrada.\n  For those reasons, I totally agree with my colleague from Utah that \nthis is a historic moment in terms of how we consider this process, \nwhich has survived for more than 200 years. It has never been changed. \nOver the history of this institution, Senates have taken the role of \nadvice and consent to varying degrees with more or less seriousness. \nThere have been times when there was hardly any advice and consent, and \nmatters went through here rather routinely. I think most historians \nlook back on those periods and would define those moments as being less \nthan stellar periods of this institution's history. When this \ninstitution, a coequal branch of Government with the article I and \narticle III branches of government, has taken its advise and consent \nrole seriously--particularly with lifetime appointments--then I think \nwe have lived up to the Founding Fathers' ambitions for this body.\n  I have voted for almost every Presidential nominee to serve in a \ncabinet or ambassadorial post. I received significant criticism when I \nvoted for John Tower more than a decade ago during the administration \nof the first President Bush. I voted for John Ashcroft to be Attorney \nGeneral of the United States and received substantial criticism, and \nstill do, to this day from people in my own party. I did so not because \nI agreed with John Ashcroft or with John Tower, but I happen to believe \nthat, when it comes to cabinet officers or ambassadors for periods of \nlimited duration, Presidents ought to be able to have their counsel and \nofficial team to advance the ideas and values they articulated during \ntheir campaigns and which the American public supported through the \nelection process. That is not to say I would vote for every single \nnominee of whatever kind, because I take the advice and consent role \nseriously.\n  I have always felt when it comes to judicial nominations, because of \nthat article III, section 1 language that gives them the right to serve \nfor life, far beyond the tenure of the President who appoints them or \nthe Congress that confirms them, far beyond any tenure of anyone who \nserves in any office in the Federal Government, there is a heightened \ndegree of responsibility\n\n[[Page S2158]]\n\nto fulfill the article II, section 2 provisions of the Constitution to \nprovide our advice and consent.\n  So it is with that background I come to this nomination, not because \nI want to necessarily become embroiled in the conditions or \nqualifications of Miguel Estrada, but because I am deeply concerned we \nare getting away from fulfilling the Senate's historic responsibilities \nof fulfilling its article II, section 2 functions and responsibilities.\n  So I rise to express my opposition to this confirmation and to vote, \nwhen the matter occurs, against this nomination, for one simple reason: \nThe administration and Mr. Estrada have failed to provide this Member \nand this institution and its Members with sufficient evidence to \ndemonstrate that Mr. Estrada would fairly and objectively decide cases \nthat will come before the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit.\n\n  I have no doubt in my mind, nor should anyone, that Mr. Estrada was \nnot chosen in some sort of a blind lottery. His name wasn't just picked \nout of the blue because we thought we would like to have a Hispanic on \nthe bench--he has a Hispanic heritage; therefore, we will take Mr. \nEstrada. I promise you there were people who questioned Mr. Estrada \nabout his views before his nomination was made by the President of the \nUnited States. Let there be no doubts or illusions about that. The \nquestion remains, then, if the President is satisfied this nominee is \nqualified to sit on the District's Circuit Court of Appeals, why should \nthose of us who have to vote on this nomination not also be entitled to \nthe same opportunity to be full informed about his views? Not about \nparticular cases that may or could come before the court. I have always \nfelt we have no business inquiring of a judicial nominee what his or \nher views might be about a pending matter that might come before them. \nBut on general questions about their judicial philosophy, their \ndemeanor, how a nominee would conduct him or herself as a judge, those \nare entirely legitimate issues. In fact, we bear a responsibility to \nsee that those questions are raised--certainly, just as the President \nor his appointees have questioned Mr. Estrada on those matters. Before \nthey sent his name up here, I promise you they did that. Certainly \nthose of us who have the responsibility under the Constitution to \nprovide our advice and consent, and ultimately our votes, should be \nentitled to the same opportunity. We have been denied that opportunity. \nBut whatever reasons and motivations there may be this is a process \nissue that should not be tolerated.\n  To suggest a nomination can be made by the President and sent to this \nbody, and that this body should confirm such a nominee without having a \nmeaningful opportunity to solicit information from the nominee is a \nprecedent I don't think we ought to make. That is why I agree with my \ncolleague from Utah that this is a historic moment. We should not walk \naway from our responsibility simply because Mr. Estrada is Hispanic \nand, apparently, of good background. I am not arguing about all of the \ngood things I've heard about Mr. Estrada. What concerns me is the \nPresident and the nominees, or the appointees at the Justice \nDepartment, have had an opportunity to inquire of Mr. Estrada about his \nviews, and that this body--a coequal branch--the Constitution requires \nwe who exercise our advice and consent function are being denied that \nsame opportunity. So no one that I know of--maybe there are some, but \ncertainly not this Member--is questioning the accomplishments of Mr. \nEstrada. What many in the Chamber have questioned, however, is whether \nMr. Estrada is likely to be a fair and unbiased appeals court judge for \nlife.\n  This is an extremely important nomination for the reasons I have just \ntried to articulate. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \nis an important court that has exclusive jurisdiction to review many \nFederal administrative law questions. In a sense, the Court of Appeals \nfor the District of Columbia is the Nation's second highest court, \nbecause its decisions can profoundly impact how the Federal Government \nconducts the people's business. The decisions made by the court of \nappeals affect all of us across the country. This is not a debate, as I \nsaid a moment ago, about whether Mr. Estrada should be appointed to \nserve as a trial judge where he might gain some judicial \nexperience, although were he to go through the process and refuse to \nrespond to the questions, I would have the same concerns, even for a \ndistrict court nominee. I think the precedent is dangerous. When the \nPresident nominates someone to serve as an appellate court judge and we \nallow the nonanswers to stand, the matter is even that much more \nserious because it is an appellate court.\n\n  Rather, this is a debate about whether Mr. Estrada, who has never \nserved as a judge anywhere before, should be appointed as a judge who \nwill judge judges and issue final decisions on a wide-ranging set of \nlegal questions that will have national impact.\n  My colleague from New York, Senator Schumer, as well as others who \nare members of the Judiciary Committee, has pointed out Mr. Estrada is \na young man, as I mentioned earlier. He is in his early forties. If \nconfirmed, he may spend the next half century making decisions that \nwill affect our children, our grandchildren, and generations to come. \nThis is a lifetime appointment.\n  Again, I emphasize that point under article III, section 1. There is \nno going back if we find out Mr. Estrada is not a good judge. This vote \nis final, and if we confirm Mr. Estrada, we are all going to have to \nlive with that decision the rest of our lives. We are being asked to \nconfirm Mr. Estrada even though we have been provided with virtually no \ninformation about his judicial philosophy or judicial competency.\n  We have been offered some evidence that Mr. Estrada is a good lawyer, \nbut good lawyers do not necessarily make good judges and, in my view, \nMr. Estrada, like all judicial nominees, has an obligation to show the \nSenate he can be a good judge. He showed the President he can be a good \njudge, obviously. He showed the staff at the Justice Department he \ncould be a good judge. But he has not shown the Members of this body, \nnor has the American public had the opportunity, through us, to draw \nthat same conclusion.\n  We are not hiring a lawyer, we are confirming a judicial nomination. \nOne of the fundamental differences between lawyers and judges is that \nlawyers are supposed to zealously represent the interests of their \nclients, but judges are supposed to be balanced, of even temperament, \nfair, impartial. We want lawyers to be passionate in advocating the \ncauses of their clients, defending those who deserve to be defended and \nprosecuting those who deserve to be prosecuted. We have an entirely \ndifferent expectation of judges in terms of demeanor and behavior.\n  Again, the fact that Mr. Estrada is a very good lawyer, a passionate \nadvocate on behalf of his clients, is certainly a good recommendation, \nbut not necessarily a recommendation that he bears the temperament to \nsit as a judge on the circuit court of appeals. That may be the case, \nbut when we are denied the opportunity to inquire of him about his \njudicial temperament, about his philosophy, then, in my view, we really \ndon't know. And if we confirm a nomination when we really don't know we \nare setting a precedent that I think is dangerous indeed.\n  Mr. Estrada, apparently on the advice of the administration, has \nchosen not to respond to the Senate's questions, refusing to answer \nquestions on what he thinks about legal issues. He was asked by Senator \nSchumer, I am told, in the committee to name one Supreme Court decision \nover the last 40 or 50 years with which he disagreed. I do not know of \na person in this Chamber who could not answer that question in about 2 \nminutes, particularly those who are members of the bar, attorneys by \nprofession. Certainly, we all know of cases, maybe even cases we \nlearned when we were in law school that we thought were wrong.\n\n  If Mr. Estrada, this terrific lawyer, a graduate of Harvard Law \nSchool, Phi Beta Kappa, cannot name one Supreme Court case with which \nhe disagrees, then we are getting a message: I am not going to answer \nyour questions about these matters, period. I think it is dangerous to \nallow nominees to refuse to respond.\n  My colleague from Utah, the chairman of the committee, Senator Hatch, \nonce noted that when it comes to judicial nominations:\n\n       The Senate has a duty not to be a rubberstamp.\n\n\n[[Page S2159]]\n\n\n  I could not agree more with my friend and colleague from Utah on that \npoint. This is not a trivial matter to be taken lightly. I believe it \nwould be irresponsible to vote to confirm a judicial nominee without \nknowing something about his or her judicial temperament.\n  Not every judicial nominee comes to the Senate with years of \nexperience on the bench, but when a nominee, such as Miguel Estrada, \nhas no judicial experience, we bear a responsibility to look for other \nevidence of his demeanor and his ability to put aside rancor in favor \nof balanced judicial reasoning.\n  I would like to add that when nominees with similar backgrounds as \nMr. Estrada have provided us with evidence, they have been confirmed by \nthe Senate regardless of their ideologies. It was a few months ago the \nSenate Judiciary Committee and the full Senate voted unanimously to \nconfirm Professor Michael McConnell as a judge on the Tenth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. Despite his impressive credentials as a lawyer and \nscholar, he had never been a judge before and, as we all know, a number \nof groups were concerned that his clearly conservative ideologies would \ninfluence his decisions on the bench.\n  However, after Professor McConnell openly and extensively discussed \nhis opinions on issues, such as federalism and Roe v. Wade, in his \nhearing before the Judiciary Committee, then the full Senate, Democrats \nas well as Republicans, agreed that he would fulfill his duties as a \njudge impartially regardless of his personal views.\n  That is a recent example of a nominee unanimously confirmed by this \nbody. But Professor McConnell had the courage of his convictions. He \nwas not ashamed to stand up and say what he believed and why he \nbelieved it. As a result of that kind of forthrightness, this body \nunanimously confirmed him to be a circuit court judge. He had no \njudicial experience, but he was not ashamed of who he was or in what he \nbelieved.\n  I do not know Mr. Estrada, and I presume he is not ashamed of his \nviews, but the reluctance to share those views with the membership of \nthe Senate, with the members of the Judiciary Committee, is troubling, \nto put it mildly. When a nominee will not answer questions, when they \ncannot name a single Supreme Court case with which they disagree, then \nwe begin to get concerned that this is a stonewalling operation.\n  During a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr. Estrada \nrefused to answer a long list of questions about his positions on \nimportant legal matters. Mr. Estrada refused to explain whether he is \ninclined to support the interests of business, States rights, the \nrights of workers, consumers, or children. He refused to comment on \nwhether he would approve the administration's environmental rollbacks. \nHe even declined to give his opinion on a wide range of constitutional \nissues--the merits of Roe v. Wade, the constitutionality of affirmative \naction programs, the death penalty, employment discrimination against \nhomosexuals, the balance between environmental protection and property \nrights, the public's right to know about health and safety standards \nversus a litigant's right to privacy in product liability cases.\n  Is there any doubt that the President or his appointees or staff at \nthe Justice Department have a good idea of how Mr. Estrada feels about \nthose questions? Does anyone believe for a second they would send his \nnomination to the Senate without having some idea of where he stood on \nthese questions? And do not I as a Member of this body, in a coequal \nbranch of Government, have a right, before I cast my vote, to at least \nhave the opportunity to raise these questions and get some answers to \nthem? I think I do.\n  If we set the precedent of saying you can be nominated by a President \nof any party, that your appointed staff at the Justice Department can \nask these questions and know the answers, but Members of the Senate, \nDemocrats or Republicans, have no right to solicit or find out this \ninformation, that is dangerous. That is precedent setting. That is \ntroubling, indeed.\n  Regardless of who the nominee is, regardless of who the President is \nwho sends a nominee to this Chamber, if we set the precedent that \npeople can go through the confirmation process and not share with us \ntheir general views--not their views on how they would rule on \nindividual pending cases; I would strenuously object to questions like \nthat--but to get some sense of the nominee's demeanor, judicial \nphilosophy and ideas. Much to the great credit of Professor McConnell, \nwith whom I would disagree on many matters, I believe, I admire the \nfact he had the intestinal fortitude to stand up and say: This is what \nI believe.\n  As a result of that, the full support of the Senate. But I am deeply \ntroubled with the idea that a person can stonewall, not answer these \nquestions, and then be confirmed by this body. This issue goes far \nbeyond Miguel Estrada. Our failure to understand that, I think, is \ndangerous.\n  When asked about each and every one of the issues I've discussed, Mr. \nEstrada refused to articulate an opinion to the members of the \nJudiciary Committee. It ought to be troubling to every one of us, \nregardless of our views, to set that precedent. It is troubling, to say \nthe least, that a prospective appellate court judge and one who \nclearly, should a vacancy arise in the Supreme Court, according to my \nfriend from Utah--and I believe he is correct--will be on the short \nlist to be on the Supreme Court--that he would have no opinions on any \nof these matters.\n  If Mr. Estrada does indeed have opinions on these issues, it is even \nmore troubling that he refuses to make those opinions known, not just \nto me or members of the committee but to the American public who have \nsent us to the Senate to represent them. They have a right to know how \nthis individual would at least view some of these basic fundamental \nconstitutional questions.\n  Instead of honestly and openly answering questions about his judicial \nphilosophy, Mr. Estrada decided to keep quiet, to take his chances, and \nroll the dice on the floor of the Senate, hoping that the dice would be \nloaded in his favor and that there would be no way to stop this \nnomination from going forward.\n  Senator Schumer once again pointed out that if we confirm Miguel \nEstrada, we are ratifying a don't-ask-don't-tell policy for judicial \nnominees. Tragically, I think that characterization is correct.\n  Mr. Estrada sat before the Judiciary Committee and said nothing, \nbelieving if he did not say a word, the majority of the Senate would \nrubberstamp his nomination. And in turn, the administration has \nwillingly participated in this conspiracy of silence to deny the Senate \nand the American people access to information by refusing to release \ncopies of Mr. Estrada's legal memoranda from his time in the Solicitor \nGeneral's Office.\n  I listened to my colleague from Utah go on at some length about this \npoint. There is no legal requirement that memoranda from the Solicitor \nGeneral's Office be withheld from the Senate. It is true that previous \nSolicitors General have said they would prefer that these documents not \nbe forwarded to the Senate for the reason that this might make it \ndifficult in future years to get the kind of candid assessments by \nJustice Department lawyers. I am somewhat sympathetic to that argument \nforwarded by my colleague from Utah, but in the absence of any other \ninformation it is more necessary to see documents. Certainly, if a \nperson is forthcoming in sharing their views and thoughts, then the \nnecessity to go and solicit documents from the Justice Department where \na nominee may have worked before ought to be avoided, but the issue \narises when a nominee refuses to answer any questions. Where there are \nno other papers, no documents, very few written materials that the \nnominee has produced, the value of these legal memoranda is heightened. \nSo that in the absence of being forthcoming when the questions are \nasked, where does one go? What do I rely on? Do I say to my \nconstituents back home that I am sorry he would not say anything and, \nby the way, there is no legal requirement but the Solicitor General's \nOffice won't share information either?\n  Now, based on some research that has been done, there is precedent \nfor the Solicitor General sharing information, that is really true, and \nI will leave it to my friend and former chairman of the\n\n[[Page S2160]]\n\nJudiciary Committee, the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, to comment \nspecifically on that.\n\n  Going back a number of years ago, the Judiciary Committee sought and \nreceived a number of documents, I believe during the Bork nomination \nand several others. I think Judge Trott was another case. There were \ntwo or three others who had worked in the Solicitor General's Office or \nother offices at the Department of Justice, and they shared with the \nSenate Judiciary Committee the work product of those employees. Those \ndocuments were used by the Judiciary Committee during the confirmation \nprocess.\n  I do not disagree with the Senator from Utah that there are some \nconcerns about going that route for the reasons I have stated, but \nthere is precedent where that information has been made available to \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee when considering nominations for the \nFederal judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. DODD. Let me finish my statement, and I will come back because I \nam going to put in the Record a large number of documents that make \nthat case.\n  Mr. HATCH. I just ask the Senator to yield on that narrow point.\n  Mr. DODD. I would like to finish my statement rather than engage in a \ndebate on this particular point.\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not want to debate. I just want to make one point.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield for one question.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator aware that I just went through that the \nJustice Department proved that these types of documents have never been \ngiven to anybody?\n  Mr. DODD. I was not going to dwell on the point.\n  Mr. HATCH. We go over and over it.\n  Mr. DODD. Then I will go over and over it. In the past documents were \nsubmitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. HATCH. No, they weren't.\n  Mr. DODD. There are four pages of list here that go on. They sent us \na long list.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is the Senator aware of the list from the Justice \nDepartment?\n  Mr. DODD. In fact, I have a letter from the Justice Department dated \nMay 10, 1988, signed by Thomas M. Boyd, Acting Assistant Attorney \nGeneral, in which he says to Chairman Biden:\n\n       As assistant attorney general John Bolton noted in an \n     August 24, 1987, letter to you, many of the documents \n     provided to the committee reflect or disclose purely internal \n     deliberations within the Executive Branch, the work product \n     of attorneys in connection with government litigation or \n     confidential legal advice received from or provided to client \n     agencies within the Executive Branch. We provided these \n     privileged documents to the committee in order to respond \n     fully to the Committee's request and to expedite the \n     confirmation process.\n\n  Would you send them back, in essence. These were documents in the \ncommittee that were provided by the Solicitor General's Office, and the \nassistant attorney general is asking for them back. What do you mean, \nthey had not been sent up? They were.\n  I do not want to dwell on this point, but when we get no information \nfrom the nominee about where he stands on important matters--by the \nway, here is a list of the documentation in that particular case that \ngoes on for four pages. I ask unanimous consent that these matters be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Legislative and \n           Intergovernmental Affairs,\n                                Washington, DC, September 2, 1987.\n     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Attached is one set of copies of \n     documents assembled by the Department in response to your \n     August 10, 1987 request for documents relating to the \n     nomination of Robert Bork to the supreme court of the United \n     States, and provided in response to requests made to date by \n     Committee staff. These documents are being provided under the \n     conditions stated in my August 24, 1987 letter to you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   John R.

I ask unanimous consent that the letter to Senator Biden \nfrom Thomas Boyd dated May 10, 1988, requesting these materials back \nfrom the Senate Judiciary Committee also be printed in the Record at \nthis point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 10, 1988.\n     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Biden: This letter requests that the \n     Committee return to the Justice Department all copies of \n     documents produced by the Department in response to Committee \n     requests for records relating to the nomination of Robert \n     Bork to the Supreme Court. As Assistant Attorney General John \n     Bolton noted in an August 24, 1987, letter to you, many of \n     the documents provided the Committee, ``reflect or disclose \n     purely internal deliberations within the Executive Branch, \n     the work product of attorneys in connection with government \n     litigation or confidential legal advice received from or \n     provided to client agencies within the Executive Branch.'' We \n     provided these privileged documents to the Committee in order \n     to respond fully to the Committee's request and to expedite \n     the confirmation process.\n       Although the Committee's need for these documents has \n     ceased, their privileged nature remains. As we emphasized in \n     our August 24, 1987, letter, production of these documents to \n     the Committee did not constitute a general waiver of claims \n     of privilege. We therefore request that the Committee return \n     all copies of all documents provided by the Department to the \n     Committee, except documents that are clearly a matter of \n     public record (e.g., briefs and judicial opinions) or that \n     were specifically made a part of the record of the hearings.\n       Please contact me if you have any questions. Thank you for \n     your cooperation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Thomas M. Boyd,\n                                Acting Assistant Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. DODD. So there is precedent for this. I do not want to dwell on \nthat point because we ought to avoid that at least when we get nominees \nwho are more forthcoming when questions are asked.\n  I will wrap this up because I see my colleague from New Jersey is in \nthe Chamber and wants to speak on this matter. The Senator from \nVermont, who knows far more about this than this Senator does, is also \npresent.\n  Since the matter was raised by my friend and colleague from Utah \nearlier in his remarks, I thought it was appropriate to address and \nrespond to the issue of whether or not documents from the Solicitor \nGeneral's Office had, in fact, been provided to the Judiciary Committee \nin the past. Of course, there is ample evidence that they have been.\n  I do not blame Mr. Estrada for this, by the way. These are not his \ndocuments. These documents are the documents of the Solicitor General's \nOffice, and therefore the allegation that Mr. Estrada is unwilling to \nprovide these documents is not fair. It is the Department of Justice \nthat has made that decision. I am disappointed that Mr. Estrada has not \nbeen willing to respond to Senators' questions about judicial \nphilosophy and temperament but, rather, refused to answer any \nquestions. That is a separate matter, but I thought it was important \nfor our colleagues to make the distinction.\n  It is unfortunate this has come to be seen as a partisan debate. This \nshould not be the case. This ought to be a matter of concern to every \nsingle Member. If this is the way we conduct these judicial nominations \nin the future and this becomes the precedent, then I think this \ninstitution suffers terribly in terms of fulfilling its article II, \nsection 2, requirements of the advice and\n\n[[Page S2162]]\n\nconsent when the President submits nominations. Of course, for lifetime \nappointees, this matter becomes even that much more serious.\n  I will not take more of the Senate's time on my feelings on this. I \ndo not speak on all of these matters. I pointed out earlier that this \nMember has, in the overwhelming majority of cases, voted to confirm \nnominees from all these administrations over the years where the \nnominations have been for a limited duration. I pointed out I voted for \nJohn Tower and John Ashcroft. I believe Presidents ought to have their \nteams. I recall very vividly, with great warmth, voting for the \nPresiding Officer when he was considered as a nominee before this body.\n  When someone gets elected President, they ought to have their team. \nThe public ought to understand that when the President appoints someone \nto a high office, a Cabinet office or an ambassador, that certainly \nrequires the advice and consent of the Senate. But for a lifetime \nappointee, particularly a young man of 40 years of age, who could be on \nthat bench for 40 or 50 years, far beyond the tenure of this \nPresident's term of office, far beyond the tenure of probably every \nsingle Member who would vote on his nomination, that rises to a \ndifferent level, with all due respect, to the other nominees who come \nbefore this institution.\n  The advice and consent function on a lifetime appointment requires a \nheightened degree of responsibility, in my view, and when nominees will \nnot answer questions about judicial temperament and demeanor, it is \ndeeply troubling to me. Conservatives and liberals ought to join \ntogether in saying: I am sorry, but, Mr. President, if you send us \nnominees and instruct them to do this, then all of us will join \ntogether against that. Regardless of whether it is a Democrat or \nRepublican in the White House, as Senators, as Members of a coequal \nbranch of Government, we cannot fulfill our constitutional \nresponsibility if that is the way in which the President conducts his \nbusiness.\n  This goes beyond Miguel Estrada. I regret he has been caught in this. \nHe has, for whatever reason, decided to be used in this way. That is \nterribly unfortunate for him but far more unfortunate for this \ninstitution and the future of judicial nominations if, in fact, this \nbecomes the platelet on how you get confirmed for a lifetime \nappointment: Don't answer any questions; don't respond to issues about \nconstitutionality of various provisions.\n  I repeat: I have on numerous occasions voted for judicial nominees \nwith whom I have disagreed. But because they have been forthcoming, \nthey have been honest about their views, because they have convinced me \nthey would be impartial and fair sitting on a bench, I have never used \nthe litmus test whether I ideologically disagree with a judicial \nnominee. But when you do not answer my questions or the questions of my \ncolleagues on whom I rely under our committee system, that troubles \nthis Senator deeply. Whether this nominee was made by a Democratic \nPresident or a Republican President, I would stand here and make the \nsame case, that this institution and its Members have an obligation in \nthis historic hour to say to the President, this is not the way to do \nbusiness around here. You cannot send up nominees in this manner and \nexpect this body to rubber stamp a nomination and to send the nominee \noff for the many years he may serve, making decisions without any \nknowledge of whether or not he will conduct his affairs as a judge in a \nway that will bring credit to himself and to the federal courts, let \nalone the institution which is responsible for ultimately voting to \nconfirm this nominee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I agree with my colleague that what he was saying is true, \nas I am sure he intended it to be. He is a dear colleague and close \nfriend. I agree he has an open mind with regard to nominees and has \nexhibited that through the years. He has been totally misled on these \nmatters.\n  That is something that is starting to bother me. I have run into a \nnumber of Democrat Senators who have spouted the same things that are \njust plain not right or factual--not everything he said.\n  But he is correct, I did make a speech at one time where I said we \nshould not rubber stamp these people, and I still believe that. \nHowever, this is not rubber stamping.\n  First, it was 516 days before Miguel Estrada even got his hearing. \nFor those who think he did not answer any questions, take a look at \nthis hearing record. My gosh, I can hardly lift the doggone thing. He \nanswered question after question after question. He just did not answer \nquestions the way they wanted. I suspect, as is very evident here \ntoday, and evident throughout this matter, they do not have anything on \nhim.\n  The distinguished Senator from Vermont wanted to speak and I am \nprepared to turn the time over to him when he returns. I ask unanimous \nconsent that after my remarks the distinguished Senator from New \nJersey--how much time does the Senator desire?\n  Mr. CORZINE. About 30 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I need about 15 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Jersey immediately follow me for 30 minutes, the distinguished \nSenator from Colorado follow the distinguished Senator from New Jersey \nfor 15 minutes, and that the distinguished Senator from Alabama be \npermitted then to speak.\n  Mr. REID. I have no objection, but just so we have some idea, and I \nreally don't care how long the Senator from Alabama speaks, but do you \nhow long you might speak tonight?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Probably 15 minutes.\n  Senator Dodd mentioned some documents. Have those been offered for \nthe Record?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would be pleased to take a look at those.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I tell my dear colleague from Connecticut \nthat I think he has been very badly misled by some of the people on his \nside. Mr. Estrada waited over 500 days for a hearing conducted by \nDemocrats. Senator Schumer is no shrinking violet. We all know that. He \nis another friend of mine, and he is no shrinking violet.\n  They asked questions for a lengthy, extraordinary period of time \ncompared to other nominees. This is the hearing transcript. My gosh. He \nanswered question after question after question. But he just did not \nanswer them the way he wanted them to answer. And he did not make any \nmistakes, apparently, and he did not give them anything to hang him \nwith.\n  There is a double standard being played here. I remember the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut saying he is sorry that Miguel \nEstrada has to be used in this way as a bad example. He is being used \nall right because they cannot pin anything on him that they do not like \nother than they claim he did not answer the questions.\n  Well, they had the committee. They could have asked all the questions \nthey wanted to, and they did, and it went on for hours. I might add \nthat he answered them. He just did not answer them the way they wanted \nhim to answer. Talk about a double standard.\n  Why is this Hispanic person going through this? I will tell you why. \nBecause he is a Hispanic conservative Republican who they are afraid \nwill tip the balance of power on the Circuit Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia and might even be considered for the Supreme Court \nof the United States of America. They are going to do everything they \ncan in their power to delay his nomination.\n  It is pathetic. It is shameful. I am sick and tired of it. I am tired \nof my colleagues being misled by their own colleagues. We go over and \nover the facts in this matter. The requests they were making of the \nJustice Department were for confidential documents.\n  I will take a few minutes, because it is important, after this last \nspeech. I know my colleague would not have said some of the things he \nsaid if he had been given the true facts. I am not disagreeing with \neverything he said, but I certainly disagree with an awful lot of what \nhe said.\n  Fact versus fiction--I will cite what has really gone on here. Their \nbase is People for the American Way, a national abortion rights league, \nthe Alliance for Justice--you can name 20 other far left organizations \nthat just plain do not want any of President Bush's circuit court of \nappeals nominees being treated fairly. They do not\n\n[[Page S2163]]\n\nwant them at all. They disagree with them because they are left wing \nand these nominees are moderate to conservative. At least, we hope they \nare. Certainly, the President hopes they are.\n  And I might add, the President does not tell them what to say up \nhere, which was implied in the last remark. I know how they vote these \njudges. They do not ask them questions like that. We know darned well \nthe minute they do our questionnaire would bring it up. We make it very \nclear in the questionnaire that is not supposed to happen, but, \nnaturally, they help these people understand what is going on.\n  Let me use People for the American Way, just for one of these left-\nwing groups that is almost always wrong. Here is an argument against \nMiguel Estrada. This is in the Senate Democratic Policy Committee \nbriefing book on the nomination of Miguel Estrada: Lack of judicial \nexperience. Mr. Estrada has no judicial experience. He has had no \npublication since a banking law article he wrote in law school. He is \nnot a distinguished legal scholar or professor and he has never taught \na class. The bulk of his career has been spent in the Solicitor \nGeneral's Office and in private practice.\n  Hey, that ain't bad right there, Solicitor General's Office and \nprivate practice. But the fact he has no judicial experience is a \njoke--as if that is an inhibiting factor.\n  This is what People for the American Way said in a letter from the \npresident, Ralph Neas, to the Senate Judiciary Committee, dated January \n29, 2003: Mr. Estrada has worked for the Justice Department for more \nthan half of his career and has never served as a judge or a magistrate \nor law professor and, indeed, has not published any legal writings \nsince law school. It is virtually the same thing in the Democratic \npolicy books. But here are the facts. Only 3 of the 18 judges confirmed \nto the DC Circuit since President Carter's term began in 1977 \npreviously had judicial experience--only 3 of them of the 18 judges.\n\n  Here is another fact. Democrat-appointed DC Circuit judges with no \nprior judicial experience include Harry Edwards--I think he is the \ncurrent chief judge, isn't he, or he was--Merrick Garland, Ruth Bader \nGinsburg, Abner Mikva, David Tatel, and Patricia Wald. They are all \nDemocrats, of course. All were appointed by either Carter or Clinton \nand had no prior judicial experience.\n  Why is it fair for them to be on this court with no prior judicial \nexperience but it is not fair for Mr. Estrada? Why the double standard? \nMy gosh, they are not treating this guy fairly at all.\n  Let me give another fact. Several other Clinton appointees to the \ncourts of appeals received their appointments despite having no prior \njudicial experience. Ninth Circuit appointees Richard Tallman, Marsha \nBerzon, Ronald Gould, Raymond Fisher, William Fletcher, Margaret \nMcKeown, Sidney Thomas, and Michael Hawkins all had no judicial \nexperience prior to taking the bench. Seven of these eight--all but \nFletcher, who was a law professor--were in private practice when they \nwere nominated by President Clinton and confirmed by the Senate.\n  Several Supreme Court Justices had no prior judicial experience \nbefore their first appointment to the bench. Louis Brandeis spent his \nentire career in private practice before he was named to the Supreme \nCourt in 1916. Byron White, a personal friend of mine, one of the great \nJustices, spent 14 years in private practice and 2 years in the Justice \nDepartment. He worked for the Justice Department. I guess that was an \ninhibiting factor before his appointment to the Court by President \nKennedy in 1962. He had no prior judicial experience.\n  Thurgood Marshall had no judicial experience when President Kennedy \nrecess appointed him to the Second Circuit in 1961. Marshall served in \nprivate practice and as special counsel and director of the NAACP prior \nto his appointment.\n  Why is Miguel Estrada, this Hispanic gentleman, being treated \ndifferently? Because he is a Hispanic conservative Republican, or at \nleast they think he is conservative. I am not sure.\n  Let me go back to the Democratic Policy Committee.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I know the Senator is so knowledgeable about these \nmatters. This is an appellate bench, which handles appellate matters. \nBut isn't it true that Mr. Estrada was a law clerk for a Second Circuit \nFederal judge and a U.S. Supreme Court Justice?\n  Mr. HATCH. He was a law clerk to Amalya Kearse on the Second Circuit \nCourt of Appeals and law clerk to Justice Kennedy. He had lots of \nexperience on the judiciary. I am glad the Senator pointed that out.\n  The Senate Democratic policy book on the nomination:\n\n       Mr. Estrada often refused to answer questions.\n\n  We are getting this bullcorn on the floor today, and we have gotten \nit every day we have been here. They don't seem to listen to the facts.\n\n       Mr. Estrada often refused to answer questions, or provided \n     extremely evasive answers during his confirmation hearing.\n\n  You should have heard all of their nominees, whom we allowed to go \nthrough. OK. It goes on to say:\n\n       He declined to answer all questions about his judicial \n     philosophy and his views on important Supreme Court cases. \n     For example, when Senator Schumer asked Mr. Estrada to name a \n     single case from the entire history of the Supreme Court law \n     that he disagreed with, Mr. Estrada refused.\n\n  My goodness. The policy statement says:\n\n       Other judicial nominees of President Bush, including some \n     with significant ``paper trails, have discussed their \n     jurisprudential views extensively in hearings before the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee. Just last year, Michael \n     McConnell--\n\n  You heard Senator Dodd bring this up--\n\n     confirmed to the 10th Circuit, thoroughly discussed his views \n     on such subjects as Roe v. Wade and the Supreme Court's \n     recent ``federalism'' decisions limiting the authority of \n     Congress.\n\n  Here is what People for the American Way have to say:\n\n       Mr. Estrada refused to reveal his jurisprudential views . . \n     . in response to questions by Senators. For example, despite \n     repeated attempts by Senator Schumer, he refused to identify \n     even a single Supreme Court decision over the past 40 years \n     with which he disagrees.\n\n  At least they got that right--the 40 years part--because we have had \nSenator after Senator come here and say he refused to talk about any \ndecisions with which he disagreed. Wouldn't he have disagreed with Dred \nScott or Plessy v. Ferguson? Those were a long time before the 40 years \nthat Senator Schumer asked about. But let's go a little further. People \nfor the American Way says:\n\n       Estrada refused to answer key questions at his Senate \n     Judiciary Committee hearing about his judicial philosophy, \n     such as his views on important Supreme Court decisions. For \n     example, he refused to name a single Supreme Court decision \n     in the last 50 years that he thought was wrong.\n\n  Then they go on to say this. This is again a letter from Ralph Neas.\n\n       Other judicial nominees of President Bush, including some \n     with significant ``paper trails have discussed their \n     jurisprudential views extensively in hearings before the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee. Just last year, Michael \n     McConnell, who was recently confirmed to the Court of Appeals \n     for the 10th circuit, thoroughly discussed his views on such \n     subjects as Roe v. Wade and the Supreme Court's recent \n     federalism or States rights decisions limiting the authority \n     of Congress.\n\n  That was a letter dated January 24, 2002.\n  Let me give you the facts to show how wrong they are. That is what is \nkilling me, that my colleagues would misrepresent like this on the \nfloor of the Senate and misrepresent to their own colleagues. That is \nwhat is killing me. Here are the facts.\n\n       Cannon 5A(3)(d) of the American Bar Association's Model \n     Code of Judicial Conduct states that prospective judges \n     ``shall not . . . make pledges or promises of conduct in \n     office other than the faithful and impartial performance of \n     the duties of office . . . [or] make statements that commit \n     or appear to commit the candidate with respect to cases, \n     controversies or issues that are likely to come before the \n     court.\n\n  Justice Thurgood Marshall made the same point in 1967 when he refused \nto answer questions about the fifth amendment.\n\n       I do not think you want me to be in a position of giving \n     you a statement on the Fifth Amendment and then, if I am \n     confirmed and sit on the Court when a Fifth Amendment case \n     comes up, I will have to disqualify myself.\n\n\n[[Page S2164]]\n\n\n  Or Lloyd Cutler, who is one of the great lawyers in Washington, DC, \nand, frankly, in the country:\n\n       Lloyd Cutler, President Clinton's former White House \n     Counsel, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last \n     year that ``it would be a tragic development if ideology \n     became an increasingly important consideration in the future. \n     To make ideology an issue in the confirmation process is to \n     suggest that the legal process is and should be a political \n     one. That is not only wrong, it is a matter of political \n     science; and also serves to weaken public confidence in the \n     courts.''\n\n  Think about it. Think about it. The reason Mike McConnell had to \nanswer very carefully is that he had written so extensively that he \npretty well had to acknowledge that that is what he wrote on Roe v. \nWade. He was highly critical of Roe v. Wade. I respect my colleagues \nfor accepting Professor McConnell. On the other hand, he had 305, many \nof whom were the most liberal law professors in the country, supporting \nhim because he is so honest and decent and smart, rated as one of the \ntwo or three top constitutional experts in the country.\n  Just think about it. These kind of things bother me. Let me just talk \nabout the SG memo, the Solicitor General memos we have heard so much \nabout here. This is what the Democratic Policy Statement says:\n\n       Due to Mr. Estrada's almost nonexistent paper trail, the \n     Judiciary Committee Democrats have tried to obtain legal \n     memoranda he wrote while serve at DOJ. DOJ has refused to \n     provide these documents which presumably would show Mr. \n     Estrada's constitutional analysis of cases and statutes and \n     give members a window into his judicial reasoning.\n\n  Here is what People for the American Way said in a letter from Ralph \nNeas dated January 29:\n\n       As several Senators have explained, Mr. Estrada has a \n     limited paper trail, particularly because the Justice \n     Department has refused to release the legal memoranda he \n     wrote while serving in the Department.\n\n  Let's get the real facts. All seven living former Solicitors General \nof the United States--Seth Waxman, Drew Days III, Walter Dellinger, \nKenneth Starr, Charles Fried, and Robert Bork--have written the \nJudiciary Committee defending the need to keep such documents \nconfidential. Four of those are leading Democrats.\n  The letter noted that the SG, the Solicitors General:\n\n     relied on frank, honest and thorough advice from their staff \n     attorneys like Mr. Estrada--\n\n  And that the open exchange of ideas which must occur in such a \ncontext--\n\n     simply cannot take place if attorneys have reason to fear \n     that their private recommendations are not private at all, \n     but vulnerable to public disclosure.\n\n  I have said that on the floor of the Senate so many times I am \ngetting sick of saying it. Yet I have had Democrats tell me today: You \nmean seven Solicitors General said that, four of whom are Democrats?\n  They were amazed to hear that.\n  Why did the people for the American Way say that? Because they are \npartisans. They are left-wing partisans. I don't blame them. They \nbelieve in that left-wing philosophy of theirs, and I respect people \nwho believe in their philosophies. The ones I don't respect are those \nwho distort the record. That is unfortunate. That is what they have \nbeen doing.\n  On May 28, 2002, the Washington Post editorialized that the \ncommittee's request for attorney work product ``would be unthinkable if \nthe work had been done for a private client. The legal advice by a line \nattorney for the federal government is not fair game either.''\n  According to the Post editorial:\n\n       Particularly in elite government offices such as that of \n     the solicitor general, lawyers need to be able to speak \n     freely without worrying that the positions they are \n     advocating today will be used against them if they ever get \n     nominated to some other position.\n\n  These people in the Solicitor's Office are generally the top lawyers \naround. Many of them are going to serve in other positions in the \nGovernment. A number of them are going to be judges. We just named \neight of them. There are seven former Deputy Assistants for the \nSolicitor General now serving on Federal circuit courts of appeals. \nNone had any prior judicial experience, and the committee did not ask \nthe Justice Department to turn over any confidential internal memoranda \nthose nominees prepared while serving in the Solicitor General's \nOffice.\n  Why is Miguel Estrada being treated like this? Why is he being \ntreated so unfairly and differently from anybody else? Why is he being \ntreated differently than those seven others, many of whom are \nDemocrats? Is there a double standard here? You doggone right there is. \nIt is because he is a Hispanic conservative Republican. That is why--\nbecause they cannot pin anything on him. When you can't pin something \non somebody, you do fishing expeditions to find any amount of dirt you \ncan get. A fishing expedition into confidential memoranda in the \nSolicitor General's Office should not be allowed, and it has not been.\n  Let me go back to the Democrat policy statement:\n\n         Lack of Support From Hispanic and Other Organizations\n\n       Mr. Estrada is opposed by, among others, the following \n     organizations: Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Congressional \n     Black Caucus, Mexican American Legal Defense and Education \n     Fund, Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, \n     Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, AFL-CIO, Sierra Club, \n     NOW, National Women's Law Center, NARAL and SEIU.\n\n  On January 30, People for the American Way again; this is a press \nrelease rather than a letter:\n\n       Neas noted that leading Hispanic organizations opposing \n     Estrada's confirmation--including the Congressional Hispanic \n     Caucus, Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, \n     Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund--have been \n     joined in opposition by a diverse coalition of environmental \n     protection, women's rights, and other public interest groups.\n\n  But they don't tell you that the following groups, among others, have \nannounced their support for Estrada: League of United Latin American \nCitizens (LULAC) (nation's oldest and largest Hispanic civil rights \norganization); U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce; Hispanic National Bar \nAssociation; Hispanic Business Roundtable; the Latino Coalition; \nNational Association of Small Disadvantaged Businesses; Mexican \nAmerican Grocers Association; and the Hispanic Contractors of America, \nInc.\n  Of course, you can see many other things. There are so many groups \nthat support him.\n  I attended a press conference today where the head of LULAC was so \noutraged at the double standard and the way Miguel Estrada is being \ntreated--and, I might add, LULAC is not a conservative organization but \nit is a respected organization, and I have always respected them. Its \nleader ripped into what is going on over on the other side of the floor \nlike you can't believe. He is one of the leading Hispanics in America, \nand rightfully so.\n  Let me tell you, I think the Hispanic people are starting to catch \non--that it is outrageous the way this man is being treated. He is \nbeing treated with a double standard. He is being mistreated with a \ndouble standard.\n  I must say that I was a little surprised when I saw the similarities \nbetween the Democrats' handbook on Mr. Estrada and the propaganda being \ncirculate by People for the American Way. I guess it's now clear where \nmy Democratic colleagues' talking points are coming from. Maybe my \nDemocratic colleague should examine a little more closely the \neuphemistically-named People for the American Way.\n  Over the past two years, I have watched the war of propaganda waged \nagainst President Bush's judicial nominees. I have seen the records of \ngood men and women distorted and smeared simply because they are the \nnominees of a conservative President. And I have decried the \npertpetrtors of these smear campaigns who have nothing to lose by their \nmisrepresentations but everything to gain when it come to raising money \nto promote their left-wing agenda.\n  I am taking about the liberal Washington special interest groups that \nare the ones manufacturing the weapons of mass obstruction.\n  That is what they are--weapons of mass obstruction in this case, and \nothers as well.\n  One of these groups, People for the American Way, claims that \n``Americans could lose fundamental rights, freedoms, and protections \nthat they have enjoyed for decades'' if the Senate confirms Miguel \nEstrada. How low can you get? When I learned this, I said to myself, \nwith a name like People for the American Way, maybe I should rethink my \nposition on the Estrada nomination. I began thinking, Who are these \nfolks who call themselves People for\n\n[[Page S2165]]\n\nthe American Way and who want me to oppose Miguel Estrada?\n  Obviously, I am not a member of their organization. But, given its \nname, I thought to myself, maybe I should look into joining it. After \nall, I am a person, and I am all for the American way--which, in my \nbook, stands for truth, civility, fidelity, and justice. So I asked \naround my neighborhood and, well, it doesn't appear that any of my \nneighbors are members. My family and friends aren't members. Nor does \nit appear that any of my veteran friends are members.\n  So who are they, these People for the American Way? I went to their \nWeb site to find out. It appears that they are a very busy bunch of \npeople who raise money for left-wing causes. Indeed, their Web page on \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees contained four separate \nsolicitations for donations, four on one page. Profiting at the expense \nof trashing other people's reputation may qualify for the National \nEnquirer way--but it is not the American way. Of course, this \norganization should be free to raise money and exercise its first \namendment rights. But the Senate is not obligated to do its bidding or \njump when it says so.\n  Unfortunately, you can see where a lot of the language is coming \nfrom--People for the American Way over and over. It is false.\n  So I became more curious. Maybe if I learned who its board members \nare I would be convinced that they truly are people who stand for the \nAmerican Way.\n  I did a little more surfing on this Web site and found out that \nPeople for the American Way, board members, include a Hollywood actor.\n  Gee, I think that is great--to have a Hollywood actor acting in \npolitics. We certainly have a few of them, don't we?\n  The board members include a record executive, a Democratic lobbyist, \nand a former Clinton White House staffer who was the center of the FALN \nterrorist clemency debacle. Are these mainstream Americans? Are these \npeople to whom we defer on what qualifies as the American way? Maybe in \nHollywood or on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. But not in my \nneighborhood nor, would I say, in most of America.\n  This is something that deeply troubles me. Too many of my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle appear beholden to groups such as People \nfor the American Way. But their brand of politics includes obstructing \nthe confirmation of qualified men and women to the Federal judiciary \nusing any available weapon. To them, this is war, and all is fair--even \nif it means smearing the reputation of good, solid nominees such as \nMiguel Estrada.\n  Not qualified? Give me a break. An ABA rating, unanimously well-\nqualified, the highest you can have; 15 U.S. Supreme Court arguments; \nColumbia, and Harvard Law magna cum laude; editor of the Harvard Law \nReview; law clerk for the U.S. Supreme Court for Justice Kennedy; and \nAssistant Solicitor General for both Presidents Bush and Clinton.\n  That sort of politics is not the American way at all.\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will stand up to \nthe pressure tactics of the left and recognize that only in America can \na teenage immigrant from Honduras apply his intellect and talent to \nrise to a Presidential appointment to our Nation's highest court. That \nis the American way.\n  Only in America can someone such as Miguel Estrada come here hardly \nspeaking English, accomplish so much and rise to the point where the \nPresident of the United States has nominated him to one of the most \nimportant courts in the country. And only in America can his record be \ndistorted like it is being distorted by the People for the American \nWay, and others. They have a right, I suppose, under the first \namendment to do any kind of distortions they want, but it isn't right \nfor them to do so.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nJersey is recognized.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to \nthe nomination of Miguel Estrada to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  As many of my colleagues have expressed--and my remarks are not from \nthe talking points of the People for the American Way--there are a few \nresponsibilities of Senators that are more important than the review of \njudicial nominations. There are few things we will involve ourselves in \non the floor of the Senate that actually will survive many of us in our \ncareers in the Senate. The Constitution delegates us both the authority \nto advise the executive about possible nominations and the power to \ngive or withhold consent. It is critical that we exercise these \nresponsibilities seriously and with the utmost care. We need to be \njudicious.\n  After all, judicial nominations are fundamentally different than \nnominations for executive branch appointments. Unlike the nominations \nof Cabinet officers, judges, ambassadors, they do not serve the \nPresident. They function in an entirely independent branch of \nGovernment, a branch with significant power to shape the actions and \npolicies of the other two. As a consequence, there is far less reason \nto be deferential to a President's judicial nominations than executive \nbranch nominations. A President deserves to have his own team, but when \nwe are talking about the judiciary, we are talking about an independent \nbranch of Government.\n  Perhaps even more important, judges, unlike executive branch \nofficials, have lifetime appointments. Once the Senate approves their \nnominations, there are few effective ways to hold them accountable for \ntheir decisions. Only in extraordinary circumstances--when a judge is \nguilty of high crimes and misdemeanors--can the legislative branch \nrecall a judge who does a bad job. That is why it is especially \nimportant that Senators assure themselves about the quality of a \nnominee and their philosophy before he or she is sent to the bench. \nThis power should not be just a review of their biographical \ninformation or their academic credentials, their resume. It ought to be \ncomplete with regard to understanding their judicial philosophy and how \nthey may approach their demeanor on the bench.\n  Of course, while all judicial nominations deserve careful review, the \nparticular nomination before us is unusually important. I think it is \npretty clear that the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia is \nwidely acknowledged to be the most powerful appellate court in the \nNation, below only the Supreme Court itself. Because it hears appeals \nfor so many cases, involving Federal agencies, the work of Government, \nits decisions often have broad national impact. It regularly \nestablishes rules with profound implications for workers' safety, \nconsumer protection, civil rights, the environment, and on and on. And \nits decisions help determine the extent to which ordinary Americans are \nallowed to challenge the decisions of their Government or the \njudiciary.\n  Moreover, the person who is ultimately selected to fill the current \nvacancy is likely to be a swing vote on the court. The fact is, there \ncurrently are eight active judges in place, who are often divided on a \n4-4 split. So this individual will almost certainly have an enormous \nimpact on the lives of millions of Americans and vital concerns to \nthem, for better or worse. That, no doubt, is largely why the President \nand the majority of the Senate have made it such a high priority. \nAnd it is a high priority. That is why all Senators need to think long \nand hard before approving this or any nomination.\n\n  Unfortunately, at this point, all of my colleagues face a serious \nproblem in evaluating the nomination before us. We simply do not have \nenough information to do the job properly. At least that is my view. \nThat is because this nominee has no record in public office, and \nbasically has refused to provide us with information necessary to \nevaluate his judgment, fitness for appointment to the second highest \ncourt in the land. He has refused to answer many basic questions that \nwere posed during the Senate Judiciary Committee review. And he has \nwithheld examples of his work and thought in the past, things I think \nwould be available to anyone who would be actually scrubbing down this \nnominee if he were in the executive branch.\n  As a result, it is extremely difficult--frankly, impossible--for any \nSenator to\n\n[[Page S2166]]\n\nevaluate his full set of views, his temperament, values, and method of \nanalyzing legal issues, and his likely approach to the bench.\n  Fundamental questions on issues before the Nation are at stake very \nregularly in this court with respect to affirmative action, Roe v. \nWade, how our labor laws are interpreted, interpretation of the \ncommerce clause, basic fundamental directions I think Senators should \nunderstand and at least have a little bit of perspective about on how \nthis nominee might feel about it.\n  Let me be clear, I recognize it is not appropriate to ask judicial \nnominees to say anything in the nomination process that would undermine \ntheir ability to judge particular cases in the future. They should not \nbe asked to evaluate particular facts, nor to comment on specific legal \nissues likely to come before them, if confirmed. Nominees have a right \nand responsibility to exercise reasonable discretion throughout the \nnomination process. I respect that. I think my Senate colleagues do.\n  That said, we still need to have an understanding of how one might \napproach generally the philosophy of being a judge, how one might look \nat the Constitution, their judicial temperament. All those kinds of \nthings seem to be fair questions people ought to have some \nunderstanding of before someone is approved.\n  While it is not appropriate to expect to comment on specific cases, \nit is entirely appropriate for nominees to answer general questions \nabout their philosophy, their views and thoughts on broad types of \nlegal issues. In fact, it is essential to do so. Otherwise, Senators, \nin my view, will be unable to exercise their own constitutional \nresponsibilities to provide serious advice and consent in this process.\n  By the way, this is fundamental. It is clearly a bipartisan \nviewpoint. It certainly was as we looked at the judicial appointment \nprocess under the previous administration. People wanted to understand \nwhat a candidate's judicial philosophy was and how issues might be \nframed in a general context as they went forward and looked at nominees \nforthcoming from the previous administration.\n  Unfortunately, the nominee before us today--and I believe this is \nreally the heart of the matter--has essentially refused to answer any \nof those relevant questions. He won't provide any information about his \napproach to the legal issues. He won't comment about any past cases. He \nwon't give us even a clue about his judicial philosophy or his views on \nthe way judges should handle their responsibilities. Instead, time \nafter time, in his appearance before the Judiciary Committee, he simply \nrefused to answer questions at all.\n  Now, that does not mean there wasn't any testimony or there were no \nquestions answered. I saw a big book raised up that has a transcript of \nthe hearing, but when it got to the basic questions of judicial \nphilosophy, temperament, and how one would approach issues, there were \nno answers to the questions. Nor has the administration been willing to \nshare any of Mr. Estrada's work product during his service in the \nSolicitor General's Office--a refusal that is apparently not consistent \nwith precedent, at least in a number of cases in recent history, \nJustice Bork's nomination being one of those cases. But there are a \nnumber of others as well.\n  This is the kind of stonewalling, frankly, that I find unacceptable, \nand I think the American people would find unacceptable if they were \nfocused on it. We, as Senators, must not tolerate it either. If this \nstealth and secretive approach to nominations is validated in this \ncase, I am afraid all nominees in the future will adopt a similar \n``secret strategy.'' It will not reveal anything, and so we will sort \nof play Russian roulette with how candidates will serve once they get \nto the bar.\n  Senators will be asked to exercise their constitutional duties with \nlittle or no information. Frankly, being blindfolded as a Senator when \nyou are considering such an important issue is not acceptable.\n  Governing in the dark, governing in secret is most certainly contrary \nto the philosophy underlying our constitutional premises, and approving \na nomination in such circumstances would represent a gross abdication \nof our responsibilities. In effect, we become nothing more than a \nrubberstamp. I hear there has been some argument about the rubberstamp \nconcept. The distinguished Senator from Utah used that phrase when he \nwas taking a different view about judicial philosophy for other \ncandidates at another point in time and didn't appreciate it. I don't \nthink we should at this point accept it and embrace it as our approach.\n  We need to be a part of this process and understand more about the \nnominee. Remember the stakes that could well be involved in the pending \nnomination. Is the Senate really willing to put the fate of worker \nsafety in the hands of someone we know so little about? What about the \nmyriad of consumer protections or civil rights, environmental \nprotections, and so on?\n  Would any of my colleagues be willing to hire a legal counsel into \ntheir own staff, would any of us bring anybody into our own activities, \nas we represent the people from our States, without knowing at least \nsomething about their general approach to how they would deal with \nissues and how they approach their worklife? Who would do that? I don't \nknow that anybody would do that in the private sector where I came \nfrom, and I doubt very seriously anybody would do that right here with \ntheir own staffs. That is true even though any of us can easily remove \nour own staffers if they fail to perform adequately.\n  In the case of a judicial nomination, by contrast, we are talking \nabout a lifetime appointment over which we will have no control once \nconfirmation is in place.\n  Let me ask my colleagues this: Do we really think the White House and \nthe Justice Department nominated Mr. Estrada without knowing his views \nand approach to the law? Do we really think the same kinds of questions \nwe would expect to ask ourselves, maybe of our own employees or someone \nwho was giving us legal advice, don't we think that process was \nfollowed by the Justice Department and the White House? Once again, if \nthat didn't happen, I would be disappointed. I would think the \nexecutive branch would not be following its responsibilities. I doubt \nanyone would take on someone with a lifetime appointment in a most \nserious position without understanding where they stood \nphilosophically, temperament-wise, and with regard to how they view the \nlaw.\n  Beyond the constitutional issue, which by a wide margin is the most \nimportant, I would like to take a moment to respond to some claims that \nhave been made by supporters of the nomination during the course of the \ndebate. I am actually a little bit offended by it.\n  First, some of the supporters of Mr. Estrada have suggested those \nopposed to the nomination somehow are obstructing the process of \nfilling vacancies on the Federal bench. This is a ridiculous statement \non its face. During the last 17 months of the last Congress, under \nDemocratic leadership, the Senate confirmed 100 of President Bush's \njudicial nominees. In fact, under Democratic leadership, the Senate \nworked at a rate almost twice the average during the preceding years \nwhen a Republican-led Senate repeatedly blocked the nominees of a \nDemocratic President.\n\n  I can tell you in my own experience in New Jersey, we had four \nopenings on the district court. We worked very carefully and \nthoughtfully and cooperatively with the administration to fill those \nvacancies with a diverse set of candidates, quite broad based. And we \nare now working very cooperatively to try to fill a circuit court \njudgeship in the same way that is now being debated with regard to the \ndistrict court in Washington, DC. This is not something where \ncooperation is lacking. Over and over and over again people are \nprepared to reach out even when people have different judicial \nphilosophies and work together.\n  I am not suggesting Democrats should block nominations in some sort \nof a tit for tat. In fact, we have not. I don't agree with that \napproach. I don't think it would be appropriate. But it is wrong and \nunfair for others to argue we are being obstructionist just because we \nrefuse to serve as rubberstamps. I don't plan on being one. I was not \nelected to be a rubberstamp.\n  Let's remember, Senator Schumer has pointed out so eloquently that in \nthe case of judicial nominations, the burden of proof does not lie with \nthe Senate or those opposed to a nomination. The burden appropriately \nrests\n\n[[Page S2167]]\n\nwith the nominee himself or herself and the President who made the \nnomination. It is their affirmative obligation to convince the Senate \nof a nominee's suitability.\n  It is clear in this case Mr. Estrada and the administration have not \nmet this obligation. To the contrary, they have tried to say as little \nas possible about Mr. Estrada and his views. Again, we have a stealthy, \nsecretive nomination process going on, and it is inconsistent with what \nour responsibilities are. It degrades the integrity of our role as \nSenators in the confirmation process.\n  Unfortunately, others in this body have also gone so far as to say \nthat opposition to Mr. Estrada's nomination has been based on an ethnic \nbackground. I heard that just recently. It has even been suggested that \nopponents of the nomination are intent on keeping Hispanics off the \ncourt and opposition is disrespectful to our Hispanic citizens.\n  Let's get real. These kinds of attacks are outrageous, part of an \nattempt to intimidate those opposed to the Estrada nomination. Frankly, \nthey just don't represent the kind of debate we should be having in the \nSenate, and they won't work. After all, most major national \norganizations that exist to represent the Hispanic community are \nactively opposing this nomination. I know this from actual dialog, not \nfrom some lobbying organization that represents a particular judicial \nphilosophy. I hear it from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, hardly an \nanti-Hispanic organization. I hear it from the National Association of \nLatino Elected and Appointed Officials; again, hardly an anti-Hispanic \norganization; Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund--I \ncould go on and on--National Puerto Rican Coalition; Puerto Rican Legal \nDefense and Education Fund. None of these organizations are anti-\nHispanic.\n  By the way, those of us on this side of the aisle who are trying to \nexpress a principle with regard to the Constitution are not, either. To \nhave any kind of implication that we are is over the top. When \nvirtually every credible Hispanic group opposes this nomination, it \nsimply does not pass the laugh test to argue otherwise. The claim is \nridiculous.\n  It is similarly preposterous to claim the Democratic Party is anti-\nHispanic. Of the 10 Hispanic appellate judges currently seated in the \nFederal courts, eight were appointed by President Clinton. Three of \nPresident Clinton's first 14 judicial nominees were Hispanic, and he \nnominated more than 30 Hispanic men and women to Federal courts.\n  Let's contrast that record to that of our friends from the other side \nof the aisle. First, let's look at the Bush administration record. Of \nthe 42 vacancies that existed in the 13 circuit courts of appeal during \nPresident Bush's tenure, the President has nominated only two \nHispanics. That is 42 vacancies, two Hispanics.\n  Now let's look at the record of Republicans in the Congress. During \nPresident Clinton's tenure, 10 of the more than 30 Hispanic nominees \nwere delayed or blocked from receiving hearings or votes, and many \nhighly qualified Hispanic nominees were delayed for extended periods of \ntime.\n  Take Richard Paez, for example. He was a highly qualified candidate, \nwell respected in his profession, yet his confirmation was delayed for \nmore than 1,500 days--1,500 days and we are complaining about 500 here. \nAnd 39 Republican Senators voted against him then.\n\n  In sum, the other party doesn't have a strong record when it comes to \npromoting this. I think it is hard to put it into a framework that \nsomehow or another this campaign is anti-Hispanic.\n  Speaking for myself, I strongly believe in promoting diversity on the \nFederal bench. I was proud to join my colleagues who spoke about the \nefforts of working together with the White House and actively \nsupporting the nomination of Jose Linares to the district court last \nyear. Mr. Linares, a first-generation American born in Cuba, has been a \nleader in the Hispanic community in my State for many years, serving as \npresident of the New Jersey Hispanic Bar Association and representing \nmany clients of Hispanic origin while operating in private practice. \nMr. Linares is just one example of my continued dedication, and I \nbelieve most of us in the Senate on both sides of the aisle, to \npromoting diversity on the Federal bench.\n  While I strongly believe in the value of promoting diversity and \nincreased Hispanic representation in the judiciary, that doesn't mean \nthe Senate should be rubberstamping any and every Hispanic nomination. \nIn this case, we have a nominee who has consistently refused to answer \nany substantive questions regarding judicial philosophy, has no \njudicial experience, and is actively opposed by most of the mainstream \norganizations that represent the Hispanic community.\n  I hope my colleagues will remember what is at stake here. This is not \njust another vacancy on a single court. This debate, ultimately, is \nabout our responsibilities as Senators. The question is whether we are \ngoing to become nothing more than that proverbial rubberstamp, \nabandoning our duty of advice and consent on judicial nominations. The \nquestion is whether we are going to start approving nominees about \nwhose philosophies we know virtually nothing; whether we are going to \nvote like a gambler, blindly spinning a wheel of chance and hoping for \nthe best.\n  I don't think the American people want that. I know the folks in New \nJersey don't want that kind of attitude out of their Senator. I, for \none, hope that the Senate will live up to our constitutional duties and \nthat Senators will embrace the responsibilities entrusted to us by the \npeople who elected us. That is why we are here: To ask those questions, \nto be diligent, thorough, and judicious, and to make sure we have an \nimpartial judiciary after we go through the process.\n  I hope enough of my colleagues will have the strength to stand up to \nthe demagogic attacks coming from many proponents and supporters of \nthis nomination. I hope some of those on the other side will reconsider \ntheir approach.\n  Speaking for myself, this is one Senator who cannot and will not face \ndown under these irresponsible attacks. This is one Senator who will \nnot abandon his sense of responsibility to our Constitution. I simply \ncannot, in good conscience, support this nomination as it stands today \nwithout the information being provided that is necessary to understand \nthe context of the nominee.\n  I would very much like to see a more diverse court, and I will work \nto make sure it happens. But I will not put my seal of approval on an \nindividual who has basically challenged the nomination process in \nrefusing to answer the kinds of questions that would allow me to have \nthe assurance, when I speak to the people of New Jersey, that I \nunderstand how someone with a lifetime appointment might think about \nsome of the most important issues that impact their lives in the days \nand years and decades ahead, particularly for a 43-year-old nominee. I \ndo not intend to be a rubberstamp.\n\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Colorado is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise to share an observation made by my \ncolleague on this side of the aisle--the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Hatch from Utah--that, like him, I believe there is \na double standard.\n  Last week, I came to the floor to urge my colleagues to support the \nconfirmation of Miguel Estrada, President Bush's nominee to the DC \nCircuit Court. Last week, I had my statement focused on the late Byron \nWhite, Justice to the U.S. Supreme Court. During my comments, I pointed \nout that Justice White's judicial career began in a manner very similar \nto that of Miguel Estrada. Justice White was nominated by President \nJohn F. Kennedy when he was only 44 years old. He went on to serve his \ncountry for three decades, without having any judicial experience prior \nto joining the Supreme Court. And he did an exemplary job on the bench.\n  Yet opponents of Miguel Estrada have pointed to his lack of judicial \nexperience as the ``poison pill'' to his nomination. This is an \nunacceptable double standard. This experience litmus test, as I call \nit, is nothing but an obstructionist argument that is intended to \nundermine the entire judicial nomination process. It is wreaking havoc \nwith our constitutional duty to confirm the President's nominations.\n\n[[Page S2168]]\n\nTo say that Mr. Estrada, one of the best appellate court lawyers in the \ncountry, should not be confirmed because he lacks prior judicial \nexperience is simply ridiculous. Justice White, a great Coloradan, \nwould never have been confirmed had he faced such a strenuous litmus \ntest; nor would another great Coloradan, Carlos Lucero, have been \nconfirmed had that test been applied to him.\n  Judge Lucero was nominated to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals by \nPresident Bill Clinton on March 23, 1995, and was confirmed by the \nSenate on June 30, 1995. Three months is all it took. Like Justice \nWhite and Miguel Estrada, Judge Carlos Lucero had never served as a \njudge prior to joining the court. Regardless of this fact, within 3 \nmonths of his nomination, the Judiciary Committee, then under the \nleadership of Chairman Hatch, held a confirmation hearing for Mr. \nLucero. At no point during the confirmation hearing--not even once--did \na member of the committee discuss his lack of judicial experience; nor \ndid they consider it to be an impediment to his nomination. Instead, \nthe Judiciary Committee moved forward with the nomination in a \nRepublican-controlled Senate.\n  Judge Lucero had served as a staff assistant to a U.S. Senator. He \nhad served on the staff of the Senate Judiciary Committee, clerked for \nJudge Doyle of the Colorado District of the U.S. District Court, and \npracticed law in the private sector prior to joining the Federal bench.\n  Let's look at Miguel Estrada. He was a graduate from Harvard Law \nSchool with high honors. We have a lot of his qualifications listed on \nthe board behind me. He served as a law clerk to Supreme Court Justice \nAnthony Kennedy, and he worked as an Assistant Solicitor General of the \nUnited States in both the Bush and the Clinton administrations. Neither \nCarlos Lucero--now Judge Lucero--nor Miguel Estrada had judicial \nexperience at the time of their nomination. They both had a breadth of \nlegal experience that ensured success on the bench. Miguel Estrada's \noutstanding record of accomplishment and real-life experiences prove \nthat he will be no different than Judge White or Judge Lucero and that \nhe will perform his judicial duties with great conviction and \nenthusiasm.\n  Within 3 months, Mr. Lucero was nominated, confirmed, and seated on \nthe bench of the Tenth Circuit, becoming that court's first Hispanic \njudge. Somehow, the fact that Mr. Lucero had no judicial experience did \nnot stop a Clinton appointee from being confirmed, but that is not the \nonly ironic argument.\n  The Lucero nomination points out a second double standard being put \nforward by his opponents that Miguel Estrada is too political. Carlos \nLucero was a two-time candidate for the Senate and a member of one of \nPresident Carter's advisory committees. Yet he still was confirmed \nwithout a concern being voiced by a single Senator that he was involved \nin a Senate race which was hailed by local newspapers as a bitter \ninterparty slugfest, and the opposition to Miguel Estrada wants to \ncomplain about politics.\n  Upon his confirmation, Judge Lucero correctly stated it was ``an \nunfortunate vestige of history'' that it had taken so long for the \nTenth Circuit to seat a Hispanic judge. It certainly was not because of \ndelays in a Republican Senate.\n  With the nomination of Miguel Estrada, the Senate has an opportunity \nto place the first Hispanic judge on the bench of the DC Circuit Court, \na man who came to this country at age 17 as an immigrant from Honduras, \nand a man who is well equipped to serve as the Nation's second most \nimportant court, certainly a success story of America and one that I \nlike to herald time and again.\n  When Judge Lucero was before the committee, he was not asked his \nposition on one issue, and yet my colleagues just saw my colleague from \nUtah show the Members of this Senate three pages of facts and testimony \nthat had been collected on Miguel Estrada.\n  There were a couple questions in committee. I have them right here. \nThis is the committee record on Lucero. We saw the 3-inch committee \nrecord on Miguel Estrada. When Judge Lucero from Colorado was on the \nTenth Circuit Court of Appeals, they asked him two questions: No. 1--it \nwas an open-ended question--give this committee some idea why you think \nyou qualify to serve on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. It was an \nopen-ended question, a softball. No. 2--it was intended to be somewhat \nhumorous and bring some levity to the committee hearing--they simply \nkidded him with a question: Is it easier to become a Senator or is it \neasier to become a judge? That was the extent of the questions, other \nthan a few introductory remarks that were made in committee on Carlos \nLucero.\n  Yet we have information collected of an extremely qualified \ncandidate, Miguel Estrada. I have to tell you, there is a double \nstandard. Unlike Judge Lucero who was nominated by President Clinton, \nMiguel Estrada has been forced to put his life on hold while special \ninterests play games with our system of justice, delaying his \nconfirmation and perpetrating an unfortunate status quo.\n  Miguel Estrada's nomination has been pending since May 9, 2001. That \nis nearly 2 years, and this is simply ridiculous. Judge Lucero was \nnominated and confirmed in 3 months. Miguel Estrada has been waiting \nfor 2 years. Judge Lucero ran for the Senate twice. Miguel Estrada is \nfar less political than Judge Lucero.\n  Judge Lucero clerked for a U.S. district judge but had no judicial \nexperience. Miguel Estrada served as a clerk to Justice Kennedy of the \nU.S. Supreme Court, Assistant to the Solicitor General, assistant U.S. \nattorney, and deputy chief of the appellate section, and law clerk to \nJudge Amalya L. Kearse of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second \nCircuit.\n\n  Judge Lucero practiced law in Colorado. Miguel Estrada practiced law \nin front of the U.S. Supreme Court where he argued 15 cases. Mr. \nEstrada's qualifications are clear and abundant. The obstructionist \ncharade must stop.\n  Over the past 2 years, many of my colleagues have come to the floor \nto make statements regarding the sad pace of judicial nominations \nduring the last Congress. They have made excellent points, but I \nbelieve the most telling statistic is simply that more appeals court \nnominees have had to wait over a year for a hearing in President Bush's \nPresidency than in the last 50 years combined.\n  Let me repeat that. The most telling statistic is simply that more \nappeals court nominees have had to wait over a year for a hearing in \nPresident Bush's Presidency than in the last 50 years combined.\n  The stalemate on the Bush nominees must end. In the wake of September \n11, we now understand the somber reality that the most basic of our \ncountry's values and traditions are under attack. That is why it is so \nimportant that we move the nomination process forward and provide the \njudiciary branch of Government the tools that are necessary to carry \nout its constitutional duty. We cannot continue to allow partisan \npolitics to interfere with principled jurisprudence that is intended to \nserve justice on those who have done us harm.\n  Justice cannot be delivered from an empty bench. Miguel Estrada's \nlife story defines the very notion of our Republic. Like Judge Lucero \nand Justice White, he is an American success story, building his \nsuccess by combining energy and opportunity with self-respect and \nintegrity and values.\n  It is time for the confirmation process to move forward and for a \nvote on the floor of the Senate. At least we can have a vote on the \nfloor of the Senate. And it is time to drop the double standard and to \nconfirm this very highly qualified nominee. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have been watching these proceedings on \ntelevision in my office. I have heard some of the presentations that \nhave been made. It seems that emotions are running high on this issue \non both sides, and I can understand that, and maybe, given the stakes \nwe are playing with, applaud the fact that people feel strongly enough \nto come to the floor and express themselves.\n  I wish to make a few comments simply in reaction to some of the \nstatements I heard this afternoon, however. Perhaps no one will notice, \nbut in my own mind I will have done something to set the record \nstraight.\n  The Democratic leader talked at some length about Miguel Estrada's \nsupervisor at the Department of Justice,\n\n[[Page S2169]]\n\na supervisor who has now publicly stated that he does not think Mr. \nEstrada should be confirmed. That is obviously that supervisor's right, \nand it is something I think we should appropriately take into \nconsideration.\n  That which I would point out, however, is that while Mr. Estrada was \nworking there, that same supervisor gave him the highest possible \nratings in his annual performance reviews. We are told there is no \npaper trail on Mr. Estrada, but there is a paper trail in terms of the \nwritten performance reviews of his activities while he was in the \nDepartment of Justice, and those reviews are unanimously and \nunchangingly glowing, giving us the indication, at least in the written \nopinion of his supervisors filed for the record in a situation where \nthere was no political pressure one way or the other, that Mr. Estrada \nis certainly qualified in every way for the assignment he had at the \nDepartment of Justice and the implication, of course, is that he would \nbe qualified for further assignments later in his career.\n  I should also like to point out that this was not the Ed Meese \nJustice Department, this was not the Richard Kleindienst Justice \nDepartment, those who have been attacked as being unduly partisan \nbecause of the nature of the particular Attorney General and his \ncloseness to the President. This was the Janet Reno Justice Department, \nand Mr. Estrada was there not for a week or two in transition but he \nwas there for a matter of years. If he is part of the vast right-wing \nconspiracy, as some have suggested, why did the people of the Reno \nJustice Department speak so highly of him and retain him for so long?\n\n  There can be only one logical answer. Either the people involved in \nthe hiring of the Justice Department under Janet Reno were incredibly \nblind to Mr. Estrada's ideological bent or they saw in him a lawyer of \nincredible and significant ability and wanted his services and retained \nhis services.\n  The Democratic leader made a great point out of the fact that none of \nMr. Estrada's memos, while he was at the Justice Department, is being \nsupplied to the committee for review. He did not tell us that Mr. \nEstrada's supervisor, the Solicitor General of the United States, \nappointed by President Clinton and serving under Attorney General Reno, \nsays those memos should not be made public. The Solicitor General, not \nMr. Estrada, was the client. The client who received the memos is the \none saying the memos should not be made public, and yet the lawyer who \nprepared the memos, in confidentiality for his client, is being \nattacked for not violating his client's request.\n  I think it is fairly clear that the client is right in this case and \nthat Mr. Estrada is acting in the highest levels of his profession to \nsee to it that those memos are not made public. If they were made \npublic, I do not think they would find anything in them that would \nexpose Mr. Estrada as part of the vast right-wing conspiracy. I think \nthey would find the excellent work of a superb lawyer so that it would \nprobably help Mr. Estrada's case if those memos were brought forth in \nestablishing his competence and his ability. But professional ethics \nsay that a lawyer does not disclose that which he has prepared for a \nclient, particularly in the case where the client says: Do not do it. \nMr. Estrada has not done it and is being attacked now on the floor of \nthe Senate for what, in my opinion, is his appropriate professional \nstance.\n  So we have the circumstance where a man who is responding to his \nprofessional requirements, a man whose career is fully open and clear \nfor everyone to see, a man who has hidden nothing and has no holes at \nany point in his chronological resume, is being held up and being \ndenied a vote on the floor of the Senate. As I have said before, we do \nnot really know why. We do not know what particular test is being \napplied to this confirmation.\n  We know there are others whose rating by the American Bar Association \nis not as good as Mr. Estrada's who have gone through without any \ndifficulty. We know there are those whose ``lack of judicial \nexperience'' is exactly the same as Mr. Estrada's, others for whom the \nlack of judicial experience made no difference but which in his case \nsuddenly is touted as making all the difference in the world.\n  We know these are straw arguments because we can find plenty of cases \nwhere others in exactly the same situation as Mr. Estrada did not have \nthem raised against them.\n  So what we have is a situation where an additional test, unannounced \nand therefore unknown, is being applied in this case. I have tried to \nfigure it out. I have asked Senator Leahy to disclose what particular \ntest he is applying in this situation. I have been unable to find a \nsatisfactory answer. As I have said, perhaps facetiously but with some \nseriousness, I have come to the conclusion that the test that is being \napplied is passing muster with the editorial board of the New York \nTimes. If the New York Times editorial board decides Mr. Estrada is not \nto be accepted, that means he must be turned down because the New York \nTimes is the voice of what I call the responsible left in this country. \nWe have the irresponsible left, but we have the responsible left.\n\n  There are those who claim the New York Times is completely middle of \nthe road, the New York Times has no ideology. Those who are making that \nclaim do not read the New York Times, or if they do, they do not \nunderstand it. It is the voice of the left in this country, the \nresponsible left.\n  If its editorial board has decided that Miguel Estrada must not be \nconfirmed, there are those who say we cannot cross the editorial board \nof the New York Times, we must follow their dictates, and therefore, \nwithout announcing it, we recognize that Estrada has failed that test \nand therefore must be opposed, and we will make up these other reasons \nto oppose him, even though we cannot apply these same reasons to other \ncandidates for whom we have voted.\n  I hope I am wrong. Some will say: That is a facetious, almost \ncapricious, statement on your part, Senator Bennett. But I renew the \nrequest. I ask those who have determined in advance the test that \nEstrada must pass, and who have determined that he has failed to pass \nthat test, to do us the courtesy of telling us what that test is, \ntelling us in advance what hoop the nominees must pass through in order \nfor them to allow the nominees a vote on the floor of the Senate. Until \nthey tell us, this whole process we are going through will remain \nsomewhat of a mystery.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we are about to wrap up for this evening. I \nhave been very disappointed with some of the debate today because it is \napparent that some of our colleagues have not looked at the record, \nhave not gotten the facts, that they are listening to People for the \nAmerican Way and all the distortions that come from there. That is \ndisturbing to me.\n  When I was chairman of this committee for 6 years during the Clinton \nadministration, we put through 377 Federal judges. There were a number \nwho gave great angst to people on my side because of the differences in \nphilosophy, differences in judging, differences in approaches to \njudging, but we put them through. We did not mistreat people, at least \nas far as I can see, not like this.\n  It is important for people to realize what he has been through, \nbecause to hear this talk on the other side, one would think nobody \never even looked at this man; that they had not had a chance to \nquestion him; that he did not answer any questions.\n  This binder contains the hearing record. Most hearing records would \nbe 10 pages. This is his hearing record. My gosh, the hearing was \nconducted by Democrats. They controlled the whole shebang. They asked \nevery question they wanted to, and he answered them. I can see today he \ndid not answer them the way they wanted him to, so that they could \ncomplain about him, but he did answer them. I think he answered them \nbetter than most of their judges whom I put through answered our \nquestions.\n  Think about what he has been through. Before a person gets nominated, \nthe White House does a thorough review. They do a thorough research on \nwhether or not to nominate the person. They also interrogate the person \nas to whether there are any difficulties that person might have. Then \nif they decide they are ready to go forward, they are subject to an FBI \nreport. They then send out the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\n[[Page S2170]]\n\n  The Federal Bureau of Investigation does a terrific investigation. \nGenerally on a judgeship like Estrada, it is a notebook at least this \nthick, where they interview the nominee's friends, neighbors, business \nassociates, enemies, wackos, crazies. This is what you call a raw FBI \nreport. Then assuming that goes well, the administration then makes a \ndetermination whether to submit the name. As they submit the name, they \ngenerally notify--sometimes even before they submit the name--the \nAmerican Bar Association.\n  The American Bar Association then takes one of their examiners after \nall the FBI has done and their examiner generally is from the same area \nas the nominee. That examiner then goes and talks to the leading \nattorneys, the leading lawyers in the area--and others, if the person \nis so led--to determine ethical standards, legal ability, \nindustriousness, health, strength, temperament, and so forth. All that \nis investigated by the ABA. Most nominees get a rating of \n``qualified.'' That is a high rating. Anytime you can get the rating of \n``qualified'' from the American Bar Association, you have done \nsomething pretty worthwhile. That means you have achieved in this life.\n  I used to be pretty upset at the American Bar Association when I saw \npartisan politics being played with the standing committee that \ninvestigated people. The perfect illustration was in the Bork case. \nUnanimously well qualified when he came up for the Circuit Court of \nAppeals for DC, the same court we are talking about here, and just a \nfew years later, found to be ``well qualified'' by a majority of the \nstanding committee, and ``not qualified''--one of the leading \nintellects in law in the history of this country? I happen to know one \nor two of the people on there who voted ``not qualified'' who were very \npartisan Democrats and did not want a conservative like Bob Bork on the \ncourt. They won in the end.\n  Since then we have had our problems with the ABA. When I became \nchairman, I took the ABA out of the process, and my argument was then, \nand it is still a good argument, why let one of the bar associations, \neven though it is the largest one, and not all the other ones, vote \nthese people? If we let them all vote, we would never get through the \nprocess. In fact, it takes at least 2 months to 3 months for the ABA. \nThey say they can do it in 30 days, but it is generally between 35 and \n60 days to do their research. When the nominee comes up to the \nJudiciary Committee, all of that is submitted to the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  Now, the chairman and the ranking member, in particular, have staff--\nskilled, honest, decent staff on both sides--who, along with the \nchairman and ranking member, go through all of those materials that the \nFBI especially has collected. Sometimes it is extremely voluminous. If \nwe see, in going through the materials, that something has not been \nanswered, or something has not been investigated, then we go to the FBI \nand say, You have to do further investigation. We want this done. And \nthe FBI then does it, pursuant to our rules. It is, again, a very big, \narduous, difficult process.\n  Then, as in the case of Estrada, the Democrats controlled the \ncommittee. They took a total of 516 days--16 months--before they even \nhad a hearing. Now, generally these hearings go 2 or 3 hours at the \nmost. Estrada's hearing was virtually all day. It was conducted by the \nDemocrats. In fact, Senator Schumer chaired the hearing. Senator \nSchumer, as I have said before, is no shrinking violet. He is a tough \nguy. He is a very smart lawyer. I value our friendship because he is \nalways straightforward. We have a decent, good, workable relationship. \nBut he, along with other Democrats, then came in and asked questions of \nMiguel Estrada. They asked voluminous questions. That is what this \nhearing transcript is all about. You do not see many hearing \ntranscripts that big. I have been here almost 30 years and I have seen \nvery few that large until there is some real problem. But in all of \nthis hearing, out of it came their comments that he really did not \nanswer the questions. But he did answer the questions. Some of the \nquestions he did not want to answer because they may have involved \nissues that could come before him as a judge. And he was not supposed \nto answer those questions. Lloyd Cutler, whom I quoted over the last \nweek many times, says they should not answer questions that involve \nmatters that might come before them.\n\n  The Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has a \ntremendously broad jurisdiction. It is, like the people said, the \nsecond most important court in the country and in some ways the most \nimportant court because they have thousands of cases that the Supreme \nCourt of the United States of America will never hear because they can \nonly take 80 to 100 cases a year. So it is a very important court. It \nis a court of last resort to many. Because, as I said, those cases do \nnot go to the Supreme Court.\n  Not only did they ask questions all day long and ask serious \nquestions and he gave serious answers--and if you read the transcript, \nyou will see that--they had every crack they wanted. If they did not \nhave it, they could have called for another day of hearing. That would \nhave been extremely unusual for a circuit court nominee, but they could \nhave. They controlled the committee. There would have been absolutely \nnothing I as ranking member on that committee could have done other \nthan complain. I probably would not have complained. But they did not \ndo that. They did not ask anymore questions.\n  Now, after the full hearing and all of this time it took to do that, \nand all of the questions all of the Democrats asked at that time--which \nhe answers; maybe, I admit, he did not answer the way they wanted him \nto, but that is not his obligation; he didn't make any mistake--he did \nnot give them something to feed on to destroy him with.\n  There has not been a good argument against him made since we have \nstarted this debate other than ``he did not answer the questions.'' \nWell, some questions did not deserve being answered, but he answered a \nlot of questions.\n  Then, when the hearing is closed, they do a transcript. That is what \nthis big document is, a transcript of that hearing. That is given to \nthe Senators who want it. And most everyone does. Then the Senators \npour over that transcript and if they see questions that were not \nanswered in that transcript, then they have a right to write written \nquestions. And the Senators who are really interested then write \nwritten questions for him to answer. Guess how many Democrats wrote \nwritten questions? Two. And he answered those written questions. He may \nnot have answered them the way they wanted him to do so they could \nattack him and try to destroy his nomination, but he answered them. \nWhere were all of the questions they are now raising when they had \nevery opportunity to ask those questions?\n  By the way, that hearing was finished in September of last year. \nOrdinarily when you have a hearing--not always but ordinarily--the next \nJudiciary Committee markup, the persons put on that Judiciary Committee \nmarkup where you can raise anything you want to. Did they put him on a \nmarkup between September and January of this year? Not on your life. \nThey did not give him a chance. He would not have made it. And the \nRepublicans then won control of the Senate. He would not have had a \nchance. So they relied on being able to kill this nomination by never \ncalling it up. Why would they want to kill a nomination of one of the \nbrightest young Hispanic leaders in America who is totally qualified \nfor the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia? I'll \ntell you why. It is a very simple reason, to be honest with you. It is \nbecause he is a Hispanic Republican, appointed by a Republican \nPresident. They didn't like it. And they think he is conservative. I \ndon't know whether he is or isn't. I presume he is. I guess they think \nhe is on the fast track to the Supreme Court, and I suspect Miguel \nEstrada has a chance of becoming not only the first Hispanic nominee on \nthe Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, but the \nfirst Hispanic on the United States Supreme Court. And he is not the \nright kind of Hispanic.\n\n  I am the chairman of the Republican Senatorial Hispanic Task Force. \nThat task force is made up of Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. \nWe didn't worry about their political ideology. We worried about \ngetting together with them and seeing what we\n\n[[Page S2171]]\n\ncould do to help the Hispanic community. That has been an amazingly \nsuccessful Hispanic task force.\n  I can tell you I fought very hard for Hispanics my whole Senate \ncareer, and for other people of color, other minorities as well. But \nthe reason they don't like him is because he was appointed by a \nRepublican; a Hispanic appointed by a Republican, who is conservative, \nthey believe, and a Republican himself. That is enough to give him this \nkind of a rough time here on the floor of the Senate.\n  But even then, they had between September of last year and January of \nthis year. As a matter of fact, they had between September of last year \nand February of this year to ask even further questions if they wanted \nto. It would have been very improper for them to do so because he had \nalready been questioned. They controlled, certainly right up to \nJanuary, the middle of January of this year. They could have asked any \nquestions they wanted. They could have had another hearing if they \nwanted. It would have been highly extraordinary and highly unusual, but \nthat is what they could have done.\n  It is partisanship. That is what is showing its ugly face here.\n  As chairman of the Hispanic Task Force in the Senate, I can tell you \nthe Hispanic people in this country, the Latino people, have helped to \nmake this country what it is. The Latino people are basically \nconservative. They believe in families. They believe in staying \ntogether in their marriages. They believe in educating their children. \nThey believe in hard work. They have built the railroads. They have \nhelped mine the mines. They have helped build our buildings.\n  Now we have young Hispanics such as Miguel who have gone on to \nprofessional schools and they are making a difference in this country \nthat deserves commendation. Look what Miguel Estrada is going through \nfor all of that, a fellow who is fulfilling the dream that America \nmakes for us.\n  Miguel deserves better than what he is getting. Frankly, he is being \ntreated very unfairly. I, for one, am really disturbed by it. To \nfilibuster Miguel Estrada with the thin line of complaints they have \nis, I believe, going beyond the pale; to filibuster for the first time \nin a true filibuster the first Hispanic ever nominated to the Circuit \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia because he is a Hispanic \nRepublican who they think is conservative, appointed by a Republican \nPresident who they don't like. I am not saying all the Democrats don't \nlike him, but the ones who are making these, I think, very \nunsubstantiated arguments, do not.\n\n  Time after time we have refuted their arguments in absolute terms and \nthey come right back and keep spewing out the same stuff. The reason I \nwent through People for the American Way is because all of that stuff \nhas been coming from People for the American Way. That, as I have said \nearlier today, is not the American way, to treat a human being the way \nthis man is being treated.\n  I warn my friends on the other side, if you are going to filibuster \nMiguel Estrada, then Katie bar the door because I know people on our \nside who are going to filibuster anybody they disagree with when the \nDemocrats have the Presidency. That will be a sorry state of affairs.\n  As chairman of this committee, I worked very hard to make sure some \nof our firebrands did not get their way in wanting to filibuster Carter \nand Clinton judges. And I won. I was able to convince people it was not \nthe thing to do.\n  I question, under the Constitution, whether you can do this. I really \nquestion it. I don't believe you can. I think it is outrageous to try. \nIt is dangerous to try. And it is not fair to the first Hispanic \nnominated to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Colombia, \nespecially when they have had every chance and we are now in the 21st \nmonth for Mr. Estrada.\n  I guess we can learn to expect that because Mr. Roberts, who is on \nour markup on Thursday, who is considered one of the two greatest \nappellate lawyers in the country--Estrada is considered one of the top \nappellate lawyers, but Roberts is considered one of the two greatest in \nthe country and that's from Supreme Court Justices themselves and many \nothers--Roberts has been sitting here for 11 years, waiting for \napproval by the Senate; nominated three times by two different \nPresidents.\n  That is what we are going through. This is a big slowdown, trying to \nthwart the process because they don't like President Bush.\n  A lot of our people didn't care too much for President Clinton. I \ndid, but a lot of the others didn't. But that didn't stop us from \ntreating him fairly.\n  We have taken enough time.\n  Mr. REID. Has the Senator yielded the floor?\n       Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to yield the floor to my \n     colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my father-in-law, may he rest in peace, was \na chiropractor, but he knew a lot about people's illnesses and how \npeople handled sickness. One thing he always said--he died as a young \nman--one thing he always said was, when somebody says they are sick, \nyou believe they are sick. We have all said ``they are not really \nsick.'' When someone says they are sick, they are sick.\n  This debate here reminds me of my father-in-law's statement. My \nfriend, no matter how many times the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee says there is not a problem with Estrada, there is a problem \nwith Estrada. You can say there is not. You can have pictures of him. \nYou can do all kinds of things, say all kinds of things that there is \nnot a problem. There is a problem. In this country, the Constitution of \nthe United States, article II, section 2, says that we as a Senate have \na right to advise and consent on nominations the President gives us for \na wide variety of offices, not the least of which is the judiciary.\n  That is something that has been done in this country for a long time \nand it will continue a long time after the Estrada matter has ended. \nFor my friend, who has served with such distinction as the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee and ranking member for many years, to say he \nthinks it is unconstitutional to do what we are doing leaves me without \nany logic. I don't understand how he could say that.\n  I repeat, there is a problem with Estrada. You may not agree with \nwhat we believe is a serious problem, a flawed nominee, but we believe \nthere is a problem. This isn't something we have jumped into in a \nmatter of 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 10 hours. This has taken a matter of \ndays, to take a look at this nominee and to make a decision about what \nwe were going to do.\n  The majority has various things they can do at their disposal. We \nbelieve there are questions he did not answer. All nine members of the \nJudiciary Committee who are Democrats agree this man is not, for many \ndifferent reasons, a person who should go on the District Court of \nAppeals.\n  We have heard it before, and I am reminded of my friend, Mo Udall, a \nlongtime Member of Congress from Arizona, who said:\n\n       Everything has been said, but not everyone has said it.\n\n  That is what has happened here. We have talked for days and days, and \nwe will tomorrow, and if someone can come up with something that hasn't \nbeen said by either side--I doubt it. They will continue to say what \nhas been said in the last few days. We have opposition of the \nCongressional Hispanic Caucus. We believe, as has been done with a \nnumber of other people who have been sent to the Senate by Presidents, \nwe are entitled to the memos he wrote when he was a member of the \nSolicitor's Office.\n  I recognize that some say that is not a good idea. It has been done \nin the past. If the majority believes this man is as good as they say \nhe is, why don't they give us those memos? Are they afraid he said \nsomething there that may weigh against his being a judge? I do not \nknow. But I think they protest too much.\n  There is a problem with this nomination. We don't need a numbers game \nhere. But this is a filibuster. There are ways you can get rid of a \nfilibuster: Take down the nomination, and vote to invoke cloture. That \nis about what you can do. Or you can do what has been suggested by the \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee and the Democratic leader in \na letter sent to the President, which basically says let\n\n[[Page S2172]]\n\nus have another hearing, let us ask some questions of this man, and \nhave him submit those memos. It wouldn't take very long. I assume he \ndidn't write too many memos, but we could tell. I am sure they could be \nreviewed in a day. I am sure the hearing could take place in a day.\n  To say that this opposition is because he is Hispanic and he is a \nconservative simply is not based on the facts.\n  But I accept what my friend from Utah has said. That is what he \nbelieves. I know he believes that. I submit that it is not right. He \nhas a right to believe that. As I have said before, people have made \nstatements over here about why they oppose Miguel Estrada. That doesn't \nmean that my friend from Utah has to agree. But that is how people over \nhere feel.\n  We have a problem with this nomination. We are now in the throes of a \nfilibuster. The majority leader has said he thinks the debate tomorrow \nshould go for a long time. If that is what he wants, that is fine. I \nspend all of my legislative life here in the Chamber. I can spend a \nnight or two here. It doesn't really matter that much. We have a lot to \ndo. I know we have other things the leader wants to do. I know we have \na very important appropriations bill that should be coming forward in \nthe form of a conference report very soon. We have to do that.\n  The other reason we may be going through this process is that the \nleader doesn't want to bring any of that stuff forward. Maybe this is \nan excuse for doing nothing. But whatever the majority leader wants to \ndo, I understand the procedures here in the Senate, and we are here \nbecause he determines what we do on this floor. But one of the things \nwe have a right to do is take a look, because of the Constitution of \nthe United States, at nominations that are given us. That is what we \nare doing.\n  As I started my brief little talk here tonight, you may not think \nthere is a problem. But take the word of my father-in-law. May he rest \nin peace. There is a problem. I would suggest there are well over 40 \nDemocrats who believe there is a problem. It seems to me that is the \ncase; there is a problem.\n  There are only a few ways to deal with it. You can stay here and talk \nday after day after day and run TV ads, as they are doing right now, \nsaying that we are anti-Hispanic. It is not going to change the belief \nof people over here that Miguel Estrada should answer questions and \nthat he should provide his memos.\n  If they do not want to do that, they can continue running their ads \nand having to stay here late at night--stay here all night, and have us \nstay here during our vacation. When I say ``vacation,'' as everyone \nknows, they are not vacations; we go back to the States and work. But \nwe are here. We have signed onto this. We as a matter of principle \noppose this nomination. People may disagree with our principle. But \nthat is in fact why we are here. We think there is a problem with this \nman being given this appointment. According to us, he has not answered \nquestions, and he has not submitted his memos. And he is opposed by a \nlot of groups who should be supporting him and don't because they \nbelieve he is not a person who should go on the District Court of \nAppeals.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague. I agree with \nhim; there is a problem here. I don't think there is any question about \nit. There is a problem of whether we are going to treat a person \nfairly. I appreciate my colleague in his own characteristic quiet and \ncautious and decent way. He has outlined what he feels.\n  Think about it. Where were the questions during the time they \ncontrolled the Senate right up through the middle of January? They \ndidn't ask any further questions. Only two Senators gave written \nquestions. They could have held an additional hearing. They did not do \nit. I guess they rolled the dice, figuring they were going to win \nanyway, and they would kill this nomination no matter what happened. \nThe fact is they lost, and now the Republicans are in control of the \nSenate, and we want to see this man get fair treatment.\n  I admit there is a problem. But the Constitution doesn't say the \nSenate should advise and filibuster these nominations. It says the \nSenate should advise and consent to these nominations. That is a far \ncry from filibustering.\n  I question a filibuster in the case of judges in the third branch of \nGovernment. They are a coequal branch of Government.\n  With regard to the memos, Mr. Estrada said it is fine with him if \nthey give up the memos. He doesn't have anything to hide. He is proud \nof his work. But the Justice Department, in its wisdom, says we don't \ngive up these kinds of memos; it is a bad precedent, and we are not \ngoing to do it. So why blame Estrada for that? Why hide behind that \nwhen Estrada isn't the one causing the problem.\n  I happen to agree with the Justice Department. I don't think they \nshould give up confidential memoranda that could chill the work that \ngoes on in the Solicitor General's Office. I don't see how anybody with \na straight face could make that argument as much as it has been made \nwith straight faces today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/11/senate-section/article/S2172-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, as President Bush gears up for a possible \nwar in Iraq, we have been treated to repeated announcements of troop \ndeployments and callups of Reserve forces. A fourth aircraft carrier \nbattle group centered around the USS Theodore Roosevelt is steaming \ntoward the Persian Gulf, and the Navy is reportedly prepared to send up \nto three more carrier battle groups to the region. Two Marine \namphibious groups of seven ships each are also already in the gulf. \nMilitary installations around the Nation are taking on an empty, \nshuttered feeling as unit after unit after unit packs up, says goodbye, \nwipes the tears away from their faces, from the faces of loved ones, \nand ships out. This is happening more and more and more all over this \ncountry.\n  National Guard and Reserve forces have been mobilized not only to go \nto the Persian Gulf but also to guard military installations around the \nUnited States. And more and more and more, one will look at dinner \ntables and at countless workplaces, and there they will see vacant \nchairs, vacant spots.\n  The 300th Chemical Company, headquartered in Morgantown, WV, was \nordered, on January 3, 2003, to report to Fort Dix, NJ, in anticipation \nof deployment to some as yet undetermined final destination.\n  West Virginia: one State, the 35th State in the Union. Every Senator \nhere can look at his or her own State and see what is happening, see \nthe same thing happening as I am seeing in West Virginia. These troops \nmay be gone for a year. They may be gone longer.\n  Other West Virginia Guard and Reserve units have already been called \nup, including members of the Bluefield-based 340th Military Police \nCompany. That is on the southern border of West Virginia, on the border \nwith the State of Virginia. And then there is the Romney-based 351st \nOrdnance Company. Romney is in the northeastern part of West Virginia, \na community that changed hands 56 times in the Civil War.\n  There, too, we see vacant chairs at the dinner tables. We see the \nfamilies, the spouses with the children, spouses who have remained \nbehind. They and their children bow their heads at mealtime and say: \n``God is great. God is good. And we thank Him for this food. By Thy \ngoodness all are fed. Give us, Lord, our daily bread.''\n  And the same scene is repeated and repeated in Kansas, in Florida, in \nCalifornia, in Washington, in Oregon, in Virginia, in South Carolina, \nin North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts, and on and on \nand on. And pretty soon it adds up.\n  Then there is the Kenova-based 261st Ordnance Company and the \nBridgeport-\n\n[[Page S2173]]\n\nbased 459th Engineer Company. Kenova is down near Huntington in \nsouthern West Virginia. Bridgeport is adjacent to Clarksburg in the \nnorth central part of West Virginia.\n  Everywhere one looks, one sees these men and women departing, \nleaving--to return when? We know not when, and in some cases perhaps \nnever.\n  West Virginia Army National Guard members have been recalled to \nactive duty, as have members of the Charleston, WV-based 130th Airlift \nWing and the 167th Airlift Wing in Martinsburg.\n  So over and over and over again, we see this happening, day after day \nafter day.\n  West Virginia is playing an active role in our Nation's military \noperations, and the story is the same in the other 49 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia around the Nation as, week after week after week, \nsmall town newspapers display the smiling portraits of guardsmen and \nreservists called into the active service of their country.\n  I suggest to other Members of the Senate that they take a look at \nwhat is happening within the borders of their own States, the States \nthey represent in this great Chamber, and they will see what I see when \nI look at West Virginia.\n  Even the Coast Guard is sending 8 of its 49 patrol boats and two port \nsecurity units--some 600 personnel--to the Persian Gulf. By mid-\nFebruary, some 150,000 or more service personnel are expected to be in \nthe Persian Gulf region, with the total expected to top 200,000 by \nearly March--not even a month away.\n  These new deployments to the Persian Gulf come on top of many other \nongoing military operations around the globe. Approximately 9,000 U.S. \nservice personnel remain active in Afghanistan battling Taliban forces \nand continuing to root out Osama bin Laden's followers. We spent $27 \nbillion in Afghanistan. Now we have upped that by an additional $10 \nbillion; 27 plus 10, that is $37 billion that the war in Afghanistan \nand the adjacent region has already cost, $37 billion; $37 for every \nminute since Jesus Christ was born; $37 billion spent in Afghanistan \nand the region.\n  And where is Osama bin Laden? Where is he? Thirty-seven billion \ndollars? Yes. And has the countryside been subjugated? No. Only the \ncity of Kabul, perhaps in the daytime.\n  I went to Kabul 48 years ago with a codel from the House of \nRepresentatives, flew up the Khyber Pass in that landlocked country, \nAfghanistan. There it is today, the same country, landlocked, still \nruled by tribal men warring with one another.\n  Approximately 9,000 U.S. service personnel remain active in \nAfghanistan, battling Taliban forces and continuing to root out Osama \nbin Laden's followers. Yes, there it is. American service men and women \nall around the globe, around that globe around which Jules Verne wrote \nthat great novel, ``Around the World in Eighty Days.''\n  Military and political tensions in South Korea are as high as they \nhave been at any time since the Korean war. I remember that Korean war, \nyes. Here we are, a half century later, with thousands of our American \nfighting men and women still there looking across the divided country \nthat separates South from North Korea. Over 51,000 U.S. personnel live \nin South Korea, including 35,654 active duty military personnel. I \nvisited there when Syngman Rhee was President. I visited the Korea \nParliament. Men wore overcoats in the Parliament. It was cold. Can you \nimagine men and women seated in this Chamber in their overcoats? It is \nthe dead of winter, isn't it? Yes, it is.\n  Some 6,900 U.S. forces remain in Bosnia as part of the NATO Operation \nJoint Force. By mid-February, by this short count, 201,554 American \nservice personnel will be far, far away, far from home, far from the \nlights of home, far from the warm fireplaces of home, far from the \nsisters and brothers and mothers and fathers and wives and children and \nhusbands and children engaged in dangerous missions around the globe. \nThis figure does not include forces permanently stationed in Europe, \nJapan, and elsewhere but those on temporary deployment. These deployed \ntroops will be supported by many more military forces based in the \nUnited States.\n  And how much are we debating that? Little is being said. Scarce to \nnothing is being said on the Senate floor as we prepare to go to war in \nall likelihood in a foreign land. Little or nothing is being said in \nthis Chamber or in the other Chamber about what may happen at home once \nthe attack upon Saddam Hussein is unleashed. Are we under a gag rule? \nWhat is going on? I can scarcely believe my eyes and my ears when I \nlook about me. I sometimes say to someone, pinch me, pinch me. Is it \nreal?\n  What has happened to the U.S. Senate, this great forum, the greatest \nupper body in the world, the U.S. Senate? What has happened? What would \nthe Framers think if they could come back and see this Chamber, \naustere, practically vacated? Of course, they knew nothing about \ntelevision in their day. They didn't know that a few Senators could sit \nback in their offices because they didn't have the kind of offices that \nwe have in our day either. But what would those Framers think?\n  What would the 39 signers of the Constitution of the United States \nthink if they could sit in these galleries and look down upon this \nChamber today? What would George Washington have to say about that? \nWhat would James Madison have to say, or John Blair have to say? Or \nCharles Cotesworth Pinckney, what would he say about that? What would \nHugh Williamson have to say? How would he feel about it? How would \nBenjamin Franklin gauge the situation if he saw the U.S. Senate today \nas we are about to prepare to launch an attack upon a sovereign nation \nthat has not attacked our own country? Benjamin Franklin, what would he \nsay?\n  What would David Brearley say as he looked about him and saw few \nSenators discussing the greatest issue of all--the issue of war and \npeace? What would James Wilson say? What would John Dickinson say? What \nwould Thomas Fitzsimons have to say about it? What would Abraham \nBaldwin or William Few say about it? These were signers of the \nDeclaration of Independence. Would George Read have any questions to \nask? How far have we fallen short of the expectations of those who \nframed this Constitution? Here it is. I hold it in my hand. There were \n39 signers. How about John Langley? Rufus King; would he rise to his \nfeet and have anything to say? What would Nathaniel Gorham and Nicholas \nGilman say about this?\n  Would they say: Awaken, awaken, take to the ramparts. In musical \nterms, the operational tempo of the U.S. Armed Forces has moved from \nadagio, which is slow, to allegro, which is fast, and is rapidly moving \nto prestissimo, as fast as possible, or too fast.\n  No one wants our military to go to war without the resources that it \nneeds, and we will certainly do everything within our power if our \nforces are sent into war by the executive. The Senate has attempted to \nwash its hands of the matter and hand the matter over to the President \nof the United States: Here it is; it is all in your hands. We have \nrelegated ourselves to the sidelines. Yes. No one wants our military to \ngo to war without the advantage of overwhelming force. But in this new \nera of terrorist attacks in the homeland, I have some concerns that we \nare leaving America unguarded as we attempt to initiate and sustain so \nmany military operations overseas.\n  Oh, yes, we see the national alert, the orange alert. Well, the \nforces that remain here to protect the American people are fast \ndwindling. How long before they dwindle more and more and more? Yet we \nare on ``orange alert.'' Where are the policemen, the National \nGuardsmen, the reservists, the firefighters, and the schoolteachers--\nthose all about us in our daily walks as citizens? More and more, we \nlook to the right and then we look to the left and we see a vacant spot \nhere and there. Yet we are on orange alert. Where are those who are to \nguard this country when it is on orange alert? Where are they?\n  I am not alone in thinking our country is vulnerable to another \nmassive terrorist attack. On Friday, Attorney General Ashcroft and \nHomeland Security Secretary Ridge announced to the Nation that \ncredible, corroborated intelligence reports required an increase in the \nhomeland security alert level. Yet look about you, and everywhere to \nthe north, east, west, and south one sees line after line, busload \nafter busload, planeload after planeload of National Guardsmen, \nreservists, men and\n\n[[Page S2174]]\n\nwomen leaving their spouses, their children, shedding their tears, \ngoing away--miles away, hundreds of miles away, thousands of miles away \nacross the seas. When will they see one another again?\n  In light of this danger, it is almost bizarre that our military \ncontinues to run at full tilt to ready for war in the Persian Gulf. It \nis as if two ships are passing in the night--one filled with our \nsoldiers headed for the hot sands of the Arabian Peninsula, the other \ncarrying terrorists headed for our shores. Time after time, this \nadministration and its Department heads have put this Nation on alert. \nIf the risk to the American people were not so great, the situation \nwould be almost comical.\n  If an attack strikes a city in the United States, who will respond? \nGovernors might wish to call out the National Guard in order to respond \nto an attack and restore order, but will any units be left to pick up \nthe phone? The military's only mobile chemical and biological \nlaboratory has deployed to the Persian Gulf. Chemical decontamination \nunits, like Morgantown, West Virginia's 300th Chemical Company, have \nbeen called up and shipped out. Gone. The vacant chairs are still \nthere. The vacant pews in the local churches are still there. But the \nmen and women are gone. Many of our Nation's policemen, firemen, and \nother first responders are members of the National Guard and Reserves. \nThey have been called up, and they have been shipped out, leaving one \nimportant national security job for another.\n  It would be a mistake to assume that these troops would soon return \nhome after defeating Iraq in battle. We may be lucky, pray God. The \nsupreme fact in this universe of universes is a Living God. Men can \nstudy and plot and plan all they want to as to what created this Earth, \ncreated the universe, and created man, and come up with this idea and \nthat thesis and that hypothesis, one after another. But the remaining \nsupreme fact is that there is God. I hope God will give this country \nthe good judgment, the wisdom it needs in the days ahead. We may be \nlucky. It may all be over in a day or two. Someone may be able to talk \nto Saddam Hussein and get him to leave and go somewhere else. Who \nknows? But suppose we are not lucky.\n  Saddam Hussein's military is not as strong as it once was, but there \nis still the looming specter that one sees at night when the shades of \ndarkness have fallen. One hears the rustling robes of night, those \nsable robes. One sees the specter, the possible specter of hand to hand \nto hand, building to building to building, block by block by block, \nstreet fighting in the megalopolis of Baghdad. That could become real.\n  Then what will those who seem to be impelled to drive our Nation into \nwar say, those who seem to look upon this forthcoming trial as but a \nvideo game? We press a button here, press a button there, poof, it is \ngone; Saddam Hussein is out of it, and his legions have been conquered \nand decimated and destroyed. Just a video game.\n  I sometimes pinch myself as I sit down and watch the television. I \nwonder, can it be real that these people who have never shot a shot in \ntheir life probably--I cannot complain about that; I have not shot a \nshotgun either--but they are all for going to war. What do they have to \nlose? I do not know. But I wonder what is happening in our country \ntoday when everything is bent for war.\n  Turn on the television set. The first television set we had at my \nhouse was in 1955. I was in my third year in Congress, my second term, \nand went home one afternoon, took some mail with me and was sitting \nafter supper--we still think in terms of supper at my house, not \ndinner. We do not wear these monkey suits, certainly not as much as we \nused to. So we do not put on these fancy suits and go out to dinner at \nnight.\n  There I sat. I was signing my mail, and my wife and I sat there with \nour two daughters. She said: Robert, what do you see? Take a look \naround the room. What's new? I looked around the room. And there it \nwas--a black-and-white television set, 1955.\n  That is the year when the House of Representatives passed legislation \nproviding that the words ``In God We Trust'' will be on the currency of \nthis country--``In God We Trust.'' Those words were already on some of \nthe silver coins, but we passed legislation in that year, 1955--it was \nJune 7, 1955, when we passed legislation providing that the words ``In \nGod We Trust'' would be on our currency. Here it is. It is right on \nthere. Here it is on the $1 bill, with the greatest President of all, \nGeorge Washington. There it is on that bill.\n  That was June 7, 1955, and on June 7, 1954, we had passed in the \nHouse of Representatives legislation adding the words ``under God'' to \nthe Pledge of Allegiance.\n  There we were, sitting around my living room. I turned on that black-\nand-white television set. Ah, I wish I could call those days back. \nThere was Jackie Gleason and ``The Honeymooners,'' really a wholesome, \nfun picture. Then there was Matt Dillon in ``Gunsmoke.'' And there was \nElliott Ness in ``The Untouchables.'' Those were the days, black-and-\nwhite television.\n  Anyhow, I turn the television on now in the evenings, when I can bear \nto look at it for a little while, and the same old story over and over \nis just beating into my ears; this go to war, this beating the drums of \nwar. That is going to be a game. We hear that the game is over. This is \nnot a game, as the French President reminded our own. This is not a \ngame, and it is not over. But there I hear it every night over and over \nand over and over again. That is all the American people hear, this \n``going to war'' theme.\n\n  I hope we will be lucky. I hope we will be. I hope we will find a way \nout of going somehow. I think this Senate ought to debate it. I think \nwe ought to talk about it in this Senate. What would those Framers say \nif they could see the Senate today, tucking its tail between its legs \nand running away from this, the greatest issue of our time: War and \npeace.\n  Nothing is being said about it. Are we afraid to ask questions? Is it \nunpatriotic to ask questions? I say to these pages--we have a new flock \nof pages and they are all these fine young people who come into this \nChamber. They are such wonderful young people--I say to them: What did \nyou think before you came here? Did you expect to hear some great \ndebates about the greatest issue of our day, our time? Did you think \nyou were going to come here and hear about the problems of war and \npeace? Are you disappointed? Have you been disillusioned? You are not \nhearing it, are you? Here we are silent.\n  Is it deemed to be unpatriotic to ask questions? The American people \nout there want us to ask questions. How much is it going to cost? We \nhave already spent $37 billion now through the end of last December in \nAfghanistan, in that region. Where is Osama bin Laden? Where is he? $37 \nbillion. He was wanted dead or alive; $37 billion and still no Osama \nbin Laden. Now our troops are going to be sent to a foreign land, some \nof whom will die, will have their blood shed in the hot desert sands of \na foreign country. And how many people there will die? How many men and \nwomen and children, little children, boys and girls, will die unless we \nare lucky and the bullets do not fly?\n  Our troops could be forced into a wild goose chase for Saddam \nHussein, just as Osama bin Laden has eluded our grasp for the last 14 \nmonths. We could get lucky; we could win the war in a matter of days. \nSaddam Hussein could be served up to us on a silver platter by his \ngenerals who are desperate to save their own lives. But is that the end \nof the story? That is not the end of the story. Someone will have to \noccupy Iraq and purge the government of the Baathist Party elites who \nmight wish to succeed one dictatorship with another dictatorship. \nSomeone will have to calm the situation in the North where the Kurds \nmight seek to form their own country, which is a serious concern for \nour ally Turkey.\n  If the United States goes forward with a war with only token support \nfrom some of our allies, it is not hard to see that we will also bear \nthe greatest burdens in the occupation of Iraq. Who knows that it is \ngoing to be all that easy?\n  They should sit down in front of their television set tonight, as \nthey listen to those talking heads as they gloss over the serious \nquestion of war and peace and they talk about going to war as though it \nwere a video game.\n  Somebody is going to die. America has lost men and women in wars, \nlarge and small, over these 215 years since ours became a republic. \nPeople always\n\n[[Page S2175]]\n\ndie in war. Have we discussed this one? Have we debated it? Have we \nasked the questions our people expect us to ask?\n  Suppose we get into a war and it does not go well. Suppose it turns \nout to be something other than a video game. Then our people back home \nwill say: Where were you?\n  The first question that was ever asked in the history of mankind was \nasked in the Garden of Eden, in the cool of the day, when God searched \nfor Adam and Eve and He asked the first question that was ever asked: \nAdam, where art thou? Old Adam and Eve were over behind some bushes, \nwearing some fig leaves, trying to hide from God.\n  No, one cannot hide from God. One cannot hide from the Creator. And \nwe will not be able to hide from our constituents if this war goes \nsour, if it goes south. They will ask: Robert Byrd, where were you when \nthey voted to turn this matter over to the Commander in Chief, turn it \nover to the Chief Executive, hand it over to him and wash your hands? \nWere you there, Robert? Did you wash your hands on that day? Where were \nyou?\n  We will be asked the question. I kind of hate to look at myself in \nthe mirror and ask myself that question, Where were you when you turned \nyour back on the Constitution of the United States, which says Congress \nshall have power to declare war? Did you turn that over to the \nPresident, Robert Byrd? Did you vote to turn that authority over to the \nPresident? If you did, did you sunset it so that that same power would \nnot be in the hands of the next President? No, the Senate did not even \nwant to sunset it.\n  What would those Framers say to us? Where were you? You stood up at \nthat desk, put your hand on the Bible, and said you would swear to \nsupport and defend the Constitution of the United States against all \nenemies, foreign and domestic. Where were you on that day?\n  If the United States goes forward with a war with only token support \nfrom some of our allies, it is not hard to see that we will also bear \nthe greatest burdens in the occupation of Iraq. Then look in the \nshadows, look into the shadowy mists halfway around the world, and see \nwhat is there. North Korea, with its nuclear programs. Now we are \nbecoming a little afraid of Iran. We are becoming wary of Iran, which \nis third in the forces of evil that have been named. Are they next?\n  The Department of Defense has so far been reluctant to hazard a guess \nat how many troops might be required and how long their mission might \nlast. Perhaps those numbers--we are talking about a postwar Iraq, a \npost-Saddam Iraq. The Department of Defense has been reluctant to \nhazard a guess at how many troops might be required and how long their \nmission might last. Perhaps those numbers are too alarming to discuss \nat this point, but one British think tank has estimated that occupation \nof Iraq may require 50,000 to 200,000 troops and cost $12 billion to \n$50 billion per year for 5 years, perhaps more.\n  Who knows what the ultimate costs will be--$200 billion, $300 \nbillion, $500 billion, a trillion? Add up all of the costs. So long as \nthis occupation continues, how is the National Guard supposed to help \nour States in the homeland security mission? Our police forces can \nhardly pick up the slack. They are already working full tilt, \nperforming the myriad tasks that keep our streets and schools safe 24 \nhours a day, with crime increasing 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year.\n\n  Just because the threat of terrorist activity is higher does not mean \nthat run-of-the-mill villains go on vacation. Just because Osama bin \nLaden is still on the loose does not mean that the John Allen Muhammeds \nof the world will decide not to go on random nationwide shooting \nrampages.\n  At a time when port security has become increasingly important, and \nin which we have learned what a tiny fraction of incoming ships and \ncontainers are being searched for weapons of mass destruction, the \nCoast Guard is reducing its interdiction capability by sending one-\nsixth of its patrol craft to the Persian Gulf.\n  How many more Haitian refugees will be able to land on our shore? How \nmany more drug shipments will make it in? How many ships in distress \nwill have to wait to get help? How many terrorists will be able to land \non our shores? One key problem, in trying to balance the demands of \nStates for National Guard to perform homeland security missions with \nthe deployment of guardsmen to deal with international crises in \nAfghanistan, Iraq, and perhaps elsewhere, is that the military reserves \nare the well from which the Active-Duty Forces must draw for units with \nunique skills. If the military needs large numbers of military police, \nengineers, or civil affairs specialists, it has no choice but to draw \nfrom the Reserve components.\n  Our military is arranged so that the Active Forces alone simply are \nnot able to carry out long periods of conflict or peacekeeping \nmissions. The Department of Defense has announced that it will seek to \nrealign some units so that our Active-Duty Forces will be better able \nto perform specialized missions without drawing so heavily from our \ncitizen soldiers. But would the Framers have questions about how this \nwill be done? How will it be done? Will the 300th Chemical Company be \nripped out from its home in West Virginia and sent to a military base \nhundreds or thousands of miles away? If so, on whom would Governor \nWeiss of West Virginia then call if a chemical attack were to occur in \nmy State?\n  Each Senator should ask themselves the same question about their own \nState. The President has repeatedly said our country is in this war on \nterrorism for the long haul. We should not seek Band-Aid solutions to \nimportant problems. Realignment of Reserve and Active Forces might make \nsense for fiscal year 2004, but what are we going to do about the \nproblem today? What needs to be done to prepare for 10 years down the \nroad? I will not be here.\n  You may not be here or you may be here, Mr. President. But that \nproblem will face this country. Years will come and the years will go, \nproblems will come ever nearer. Let us start by asking some tough \nquestions.\n  Do we need more Active-Duty forces to do everything that the \nPresident is asking our military to do? If so, can we increase our \nrecruiting to find more Americans who are willing to serve in the \nmilitary? Do we want to go back to the draft? That question may come \never closer.\n  While the White House is prepared to dedicate ever greater sums to \nour military, have we underestimated the manpower requirements for the \nwar on terrorism or for nationbuilding in Afghanistan or for a war in \nIraq or for maintaining our security guarantees to South Korea? Let us \nnot shy away from asking these questions simply because we are afraid \nof honest answers that could expose a weakness in our military \nplanning.\n  Our States, cities, and towns are in a homeland security crunch. \nSecurity demands are increasing. State budget deficits are soaring. Ask \nthe Governors of this land about their budget deficits. Ask them about \nthe shortfalls within their own States. Perhaps the homeland security \ncrunch could not have been avoided completely, but its effects could \nhave been mitigated.\n  In November 2001 I offered a $15 billion package to address urgent \nhomeland security needs. Did the White House support it? Did the White \nHouse support that package? No. This White House opposed it.\n  In December 2001 I proposed $7.5 billion in homeland security funds. \nDid the administration support that? No. The administration shaved that \ndown to a fraction of its size. Wouldn't our communities be better \nprepared today for the current terrorism warnings, for the current \norange alert, if those funds had reached our communities more than a \nyear ago?\n  With the homeland security crunch now affecting virtually every State \nin the Union, one would think that we should have learned a lesson. \nHave we?\n  Just last month I offered a $5 billion amendment to H.J. Res. 2, the \nfiscal year 2003 omnibus appropriations legislation to fund these \nprograms that the President had authorized in earlier legislation. Did \nthe White House support my amendment? No. The White House opposed that \namendment, terming it ``new extraneous spending.'' How about that?\n  My opinion differs from that of the White House. I believe that \nproviding funding for programs that have been requested and authorized, \nand which are critical pieces of homeland security, is just as critical \nas going for the\n\n[[Page S2176]]\n\npublic acclaim that comes from proposing a bureaucratic reorganization.\n  Words, and promises, need to be backed up with the money to make \nthose words a reality. Empty promises and hollow rhetoric, no matter \nhow stirring, how bedecked in flags and bunting, will not protect our \nfamilies, our neighbors, and our fellow citizens.\n  Iraq is not the only crisis on the American agenda. Hundreds of \nthousands of troops are shipping out for distant lands while the threat \nof terrorism is growing here at home; while the Nation, for the first \ntime, is being put on orange alert.\n  These troops have our support and our prayers for their safe return. \nThe families they leave behind also need the very best that we can do \nfor them. They need our prayers, and they need more than our prayers; \nthey need to have programs designed to improve their safety and \nsecurity funded and implemented, not put on hold.\n\n  Having lost the $5 billion, then I sought to come through with a $3 \nbillion homeland security amendment. The same thing happened.\n  I hope the view from the White House will expand to focus, not just \nbeyond our shores, but also within our shorelines. We must not leave \nAmerica unguarded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia has had a \ncold the last week or so, so we have missed him in the Chamber. It is \ngood to hear you have your voice back and are gaining your strength. It \nis good to sit and listen to you.\n  I have had a lot of good education. As I said once in a debate in the \nSenate Chamber--we were talking about the distinguished Senator from \nMaryland, who is a Rhodes scholar. It was a colloquy between the \nSenator from West Virginia and the Senator from Maryland. I \ninterrupted, with the consent of the Chair, and said: I am not a Rhodes \nscholar; I am a Byrd scholar. And I really am. I appreciate the \nSenator's remarks. He always pushes to better things. Better parts of \nus come out when you lead us. I appreciate very much the Senator's \nstatement.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished whip for his \ncomments. I thank him for his work that he performs here daily for his \ncountry, for his State, and for his colleagues in the Senate.\n  Mr. REID. I thank Senator Byrd very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/11/senate-section/article/S2176-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, last weekend in Munich, our colleague, \nSenator Lieberman, gave a remarkable speech to the annual Wehrkunde \nSecurity Conference. Alliances have contributed to America's strength \nsince the end of World War II, and Senator Lieberman, like many of us, \nhas watched with concern as those alliances have weakened over the last \n2 years. He makes a compelling case on why those alliances remain vital \nto our security and why it is important that the administration \nredouble its efforts to strengthen those alliances.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of his speech be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   ``Halting the Continental Drift and Revitalizing the U.S.-Europe \n                             Relationship''\n\n             (By U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman; Feb. 8, 2003)\n\n\n       Remarks to Wehrkunde Conference (as prepared for delivery)\n\n       We come together in trying times with an urgent \n     responsibility: to fortify our transatlantic alliance, which \n     has vanquished many foes, spawned many democracies, and \n     promoted many freedoms--but is now struggling to find a \n     common voice in the face of many dangers.\n       The growing reach of NATO and its principles belies a \n     disheartening truth. In a world facing new and evolving \n     threats--terrorists, rogue regimes, and Weapons of Mass \n     Destruction--NATO is split, and risks not only becoming the \n     shell some predicted it would be after the fall of the Berlin \n     Wall... but a dangerous stumbling block to a safer world.\n       The big question before us today is not who will join NATO \n     or whether NATO will field a rapid response force, but \n     instead, can our alliance survive a world in which our \n     enemies are less defined, the dangers are more dispersed, and \n     the road to victory is much less clear?\n       We who are privileged to be leaders of NATO countries must \n     make sure that the answer to that question is yes. The world \n     of the 21st Century and each of our nations will be much \n     safer if our alliance becomes not just larger but stronger, \n     united around shared principles and the need for a common \n     defense to the uncommon new threats that now face us all.\n       This process might best begin with some family therapy, \n     since we have been acting too often in recent years like a \n     dysfunctional family.\n       Let me begin with our side of the family. Since NATO'S \n     inception, the strength of our alliance has always depended \n     on American power. But America's power to lead has always \n     depended on America's ability to listen. During the last two \n     years, the American administration has turned a deaf ear to \n     Europe. Some in America have sent the message that they see \n     NATO and its member countries as a rubber stamp for the \n     crisis that matters most to the United States at the moment, \n     instead of a multilateral alliance of nations who listen to \n     each other's concerns.\n       But I assure you that most Americans understand that \n     America is not an island; it is part of an interconnected \n     world. No matter how mighty a country's army or how large its \n     treasury, vigorous and resilient alliances built on mutual \n     respect are essential to securing the peace and making the \n     world a safer place.\n       At the same time, we Americans are upset that so many \n     Europeans seem so much less anxious about the new threats of \n     terrorism, rogue nations, and weapons of mass destruction \n     than we are. We accept the fact that for more than 50 years, \n     U.S. leadership of NATO and our unique role in the world has \n     meant that our security responsibilities have been more \n     global than Europe's. While we worry about missiles in North \n     Korea or conflict in the Taiwan Straits, Europe has mostly \n     been able to focus on securing its own borders. But if \n     September 11th has taught us anything, it's that none of us \n     can retreat behind borders--because terror recognizes no \n     borders. In today's world, enemies of freedom anywhere are a \n     threat to safety everywhere.\n       I understand why the heavy hand from Washington has lately \n     been seen less as a source of protection and more as a cause \n     of resentment. But I'm here today to argue for your \n     enlightened self-interest. Robert Kagan rightly asks: why \n     should free people--citizens of our closest European allies--\n     seem more worried about America than about terrorism--more \n     anxious about Bush than about bin Laden?\n       We must urgently and honestly confront and resolve the \n     differences that now divide us. If we fail to, the current \n     continental drift will become a permanent rift, and we will \n     all risk losing much more than family harmony. We will \n     endanger our common security and future prosperity. And the \n     world will lose its most reliable force for freedom and \n     stability.\n\n\n                     the anatomy of our disharmony\n\n       We NATO allies still share three basic bonds, as we have \n     since the beginning: common values and aspirations, common \n     enemies who threaten those values, and common fates should we \n     fail to work together. That those bonds are being weakened is \n     an urgent threat that we must confront and resolve without \n     delay.\n\n\n                            The World We See\n\n       The first wedge between us is in the way we see the world \n     and its newest problems. Prime Minister Blair put it well \n     when he said recently: ``The problem people have\n\n[[Page S2177]]\n\n     with the U.S.--not the rabid anti-Americans but the average \n     middle ground--is not that, for example, they oppose them on \n     WMD or international terrorism. People listen to the U.S. on \n     these issues and may well agree with them; but they want the \n     U.S. to listen back.'' As an American, I believe we haven't \n     and we must--and many of my fellow Americans agree.\n       Consider global warming. America is the single biggest \n     global contributor to the problem. Americans know it, and in \n     strong majorities consider global warming to be a serious \n     problem. Yet the Bush Administration turns a deaf ear to \n     American opinion and European pleas to do something about it.\n       It is also clear that the Bush Administration's precipitous \n     withdrawal from the long-term efforts to build an \n     International Criminal Court and strengthen the Nuclear Test \n     Ban Treaty. Again, in large numbers the American people \n     support joining the court and improving the Test Ban Treaty. \n     Even with imperfect world agreements such as these, removing \n     our nation and our priorities from the global conversation \n     creates an unnecessary breach with our allies.\n       If some in America have viewed the world with blinders on--\n     blocking out all concerns except our own--some in Europe seem \n     to us unable to see threats that stare you and us right in \n     the face.\n       For example, when we speak of the terrorists as evil--and \n     of Saddam Hussein as a dangerous tyrant and torturer who has \n     viciously murdered his own people, we are puzzled why many \n     Europeans recoil at those descriptions--which, to us, are \n     thoroughly justified by the facts.\n       Terrorism is not just America's problem. We know full fell \n     that Europe has known more than its share of terror, so we \n     don't presume to preach. But Al Qaida and its ilk consider \n     all of our people as their enemies and targets--because all \n     our nations represent the values and the way of life they \n     hate. They also seek to inflict pain upon moderate Muslim \n     regimes. The fact that citizens from more than 70 countries--\n     including many Muslims--died in the attacks on the World \n     Trade Center is more than a symbolic reality. If we cannot \n     cement our alliance in our own minds, let the hatred of our \n     terrorist foes for all of us do it for us.\n\n\n                              what we say\n\n       Second, the differences between us have been exacerbated by \n     the words we use to describe each other. Along the way, \n     honest policy differences and critiques have given way to \n     caricature and hyperbole.\n       We in America should work for a strong and united Europe, \n     not divide it with our words. There is no ``old Europe'' \n     separate from a ``new Europe.'' A Europe divided was the \n     incubator for mankind's bloodiest century. A Europe united \n     provides the best hope for a more peaceful and secure future, \n     for you and us.\n       And when Europeans caricature America and its leaders as \n     naive or ignorant ``cowboys,'' it offends Americans--even \n     some of us who hail from a place far from cowboy country \n     called New England. The point is: we should challenge each \n     other's policies, not personalities, and question each \n     other's decisions, not motives.\n       Europe and America have often had our differences. Just \n     think about these news headlines about U.S.-European \n     disputes: ``Allies Complain of Washington's Heavy Hand,'' \n     ``France to NATO: Non, Merci,'' ``U.S. Declares Economic \n     Warfare on Allies,'' and ``Protesters Rally Against American \n     Arms Plan.'' As former President Clinton once reminded us, \n     the first of these headlines is from the Suez crisis in 1956. \n     The second is from 1966, when France left NATO's military \n     command. The third is from 1981, during the Siberian Pipeline \n     Crisis. The Fourth is from 1986 during the debate about \n     deploying intermediate nuclear missiles in Europe.\n       Like any good dysfunctional family, we've hurled invectives \n     and insults across the Atlantic intermittently for more than \n     50 years. But the difference is, leaders on both sides have \n     always in the past worked to douse the rhetorical flames, not \n     fan them. It's time we return to that shared compact. Now, \n     more than ever, words have consequences.\n\n\n                         how and when we fight\n\n       The last and most serious area of contention is when, why, \n     and how we commit our military might to protect our people \n     and principles.\n       We Americans must recognize that no matter how strong our \n     military or our economy, we still need help. Defeating the \n     dangers arrayed against us requires more than the forced \n     compliance of our European allies; it requires a genuine \n     partnership.\n       Regrettably, over the past two years, the Bush \n     Administration has too often kept our European friends at \n     bay. NATO's invocation of Article 5, declaring the September \n     11th attacks an attack on us all, was a powerful and moving \n     act of solidarity and sacrifice. But the Bush Administration \n     failed to grasp NATO's outstretched hand in Afghanistan, and \n     that was a mistake. When we made the war our own, the \n     subsequent peace became far too much our own as well.\n       The Administration's declaration of its policy of military \n     preemption has also understandably and unnecessarily raised \n     anxieties in Europe and throughout the world. It made no \n     sense to publicly announce this doctrine without offering our \n     friends and foes alike clarification as to how and when the \n     policy might be exercised. The fact is, the United States, \n     like most countries in the world, has always reserved the \n     right to use force to prevent an attack against its people. \n     But some policies are best left undeclared, to be announced \n     only when it is necessary to implement them. In the case of \n     pre-emptive military action, that ought to be rarely.\n       But it takes two hands to tear a seam. And the fact is, the \n     hand of the Bush Administration has been assisted by the hand \n     of many in Europe in tearing the seam that has united us for \n     more than a half century now.\n       Rather than coming together with one voice to enforce \n     United Nations Resolutions all have supported to disarm \n     Saddam Hussein, we hear many reflexive notes of discord from \n     Europe. Rather than consent to the use of force when all \n     other options have been exhausted, important parts of Europe \n     have pulled back from our shared responsibility to put \n     military muscle behind our policies to protect our security.\n       And the transatlantic gulf between military capabilities \n     doesn't help us overcome this rift. We all know that Europe \n     has grown too dependent on American strength, and that that \n     dependency undermines our partnership. I understand that \n     Europe is focused today on the remarkable challenges of \n     finishing the peaceful integration of Europe, new membership \n     in the E.U., the Euro, and a constitutional convention.\n       But as John Lennon once said, ``life is what happens to us \n     while we're making other plans.'' Global terrorists are not \n     waiting for our European allies to complete their domestic \n     work before planning their next attacks--and it's not enough \n     for Europe to rely upon the military might of America to \n     ensure its own safety. It's time for Europe to take more of \n     its own responsibility. The new NATO rapid response force, \n     authorized at last year's Prague summit, is a start in a \n     better direction. But it is only a first step. A deeper \n     commitment and more money must follow.\n       As I said a few moments ago, we have heard the European \n     complaints that NATO has been ignored by the United States. \n     But now President Bush has come to NATO and asked for the \n     alliance to help in disarming Iraq. While we are very \n     grateful that most member nations have responded positively, \n     two of our closest and most important allies, France and \n     Germany, have resisted NATO requests and taskings. That \n     hurts. The NATO alliance itself made possible the historic \n     reconciliation between Germany and France. I would hope the \n     shared principles that led to that reconciliation would be \n     remembered now.\n       In the interest of our security and our unity, I want to \n     urgently appeal to all NATO nations to rise to help the U.N. \n     and the U.S. meet the threat posed by Saddam Hussein. \n     Thousands of years ago, Sophocles told the Greeks, ``What you \n     cannot enforce, do not command.'' The contemporary corollary \n     of that axiom is: what the world through the United Nations \n     commands, it must enforce--or the judgments of the U.N. will \n     lose their force, and the world that we and you live in will \n     grow much less secure.\n       Our friend Joe Joffe, editor of De Zeit, has said with \n     characteristic insight and edge: ``We are now living through \n     the most critical watershed of the postwar period, with \n     enormous moral and strategic issues at stake, and the only \n     answer many Europeans offer is to constrain and contain \n     American power. So by default they end up on the side of \n     Saddam, in an intellectually corrupt position.''\n       I respectfully suggest that the nations of Europe define \n     their positions on Iraq independently and affirmatively--not \n     in reaction to America or its President. As you know, I am a \n     Democrat. In fact, I'm a Democrat seeking to replace George \n     Bush in the Oval Office. But he and I agree on the danger \n     posed by Saddam and the need to do something soon to \n     eliminate that danger to us, to you, and most immediately to \n     his neighbors in the Arab world--as do most other Democrats, \n     Republicans, and Independents in the U.S.\n       In fact, five years ago, after Saddam ejected the U.N. \n     inspectors, John McCain and I gave up on containment and \n     introduced the Iraqi Liberation Act, which, when it became \n     law, made a change of regime in Baghdad official U.S. policy. \n     You might therefore say that, when it comes to Iraq, \n     President Bush is just enforcing the McCain-Lieberman policy.\n       The facts here are stark and even more clear after \n     Secretary Powell's chilling and convincing testimony at the \n     U.N. on Wednesday. For twelve long years, Saddam has flaunted \n     every attempt to get him to keep his promise to disarm and \n     instead has continued building weapons of mass destruction. \n     If we shrink from challenging his defiance, we will not \n     only leave a ticking time bomb ticking, we will have \n     undermined the remaining credibility of the United \n     Nations, and further diminished the power of NATO to \n     protect the peace of the world.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       The battles against tyranny, terrorism, and weapons of mass \n     destruction, and for freedom, opportunity, and security, are \n     the great causes of our time, and the greatest alliance of \n     all time must lead the way in winning those battles.\n       More than forty years ago, on the Fourth of July, 1962, \n     President Kennedy spoke at Independence Hall in Philadelphia. \n     His words echoed the covenant of our American Constitution, \n     and should guide us now in our Transatlantic relations. \n     ``Acting on our own, by ourselves, we cannot establish \n     justice throughout the world; we cannot insure its domestic \n     tranquility, or provide for its common defense, or promote \n     its general welfare,\n\n[[Page S2178]]\n\n     or secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our \n     posterity. But joined with other free nations, we can do all \n     this and more.''\n       Americans and Europeans are proud people--and justifiably \n     so. We both want to control our own destinies. We both want \n     to shape our own futures. But neither one of us can let pride \n     or politics block the unity by which we will all achieve \n     greater security, freedom, and prosperity. Our values are \n     shared. Our fates are interlocking. We will rise or fall \n     together.\n       And when we rise, the terrorists and tyrants will fall. \n     America still needs Europe, and Europe still needs America, \n     and it is time that all the leaders on both sides of the \n     Atlantic started acting in a way that says we understand that \n     overarching truth.\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/11/senate-section/article/S2178-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2178-S2180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE SARBANES-OXLEY BAN ON INSIDER CORPORATE LOANS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, about 6 months ago, we enacted into law an \nimportant set of reforms to curb some of the corporate abuses that have \nshaken investor confidence in American business, from dishonest \naccounting to price manipulation to cases in which company executives \nhave walked away from poor corporate performance with millions of \ndollars in their pockets, while investors, shareholders, and employees \nhave watched their savings evaporate.\n  These corporate reforms, included in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, \naddressed a host of problems. Today, I want to take a few minutes to \ndiscuss one of the most important reforms included in that bill, \nSection 402, which has so far received very little attention.\n  Section 402 established, for the first time, a prohibition against \npublicly traded corporations using company funds to give personal loans \nto company officers and directors. This simple prohibition is having an \nimpact on corporate America, and I want to take a few minutes to \nexplain the importance of this loan prohibition, the abuses it is \ncorrecting, and why it must be protected from efforts to narrow or \nweaken it.\n  Last year, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I then \nchaired, conducted an extensive, bipartisan investigation into the \ncollapse of Enron. The Subcommittee reviewed 2 million pages of \ndocuments, conducted 100 interviews, held four hearings, and issued two \nreports. One of the issues we looked at were the loans that Enron gave \nto its CEO.\n  In a report entitled, ``The Role of the Board of Directors in Enron's \nCollapse,'' issued in July, the subcommittee found that multimillion-\ndollar loans, using company funds, had been approved by the Enron board \nfor the personal use of Mr. Lay, then chairman of the board and chief \nexecutive officer. The subcommittee found that the board's compensation \ncommittee first gave Mr. Lay access to a $4 million line of credit, \nincreased this credit line in August 2001 to $7.5 million, and \nauthorized repayment with either cash or company stock.\n  The subcommittee found that, in 2000, Mr. Lay began using what one \nEnron board member called an ``ATM approach'' toward his credit line, \nrepeatedly drawing down the entire amount available and then repaying \nthe loan with Enron stock. Records show that Mr. Lay at first drew down \nthe line of credit once per month, then every 2 weeks, and then, on \nsome occasions, several days in a row.\n  In the 1-year period from October 2000 to October 2001, Mr. Lay used \nhis company credit line to obtain over $77 million in cash from the \ncompany. In every case, he repaid the borrowed cash by tendering shares \nof Enron stock. In most cases, he obtained these shares by exercising \nstock options granted to him as part of his executive compensation. Mr. \nLay withdrew these millions of dollars from company coffers at a time \nwhen Enron was experiencing cash flow shortages, Enron's shares were \ndropping, and Enron shareholders were suffering losses. After Enron's \ncollapse, it was discovered that Mr. Lay had borrowed a total of $81 \nmillion from the company in 2001, and failed to repay about $7 million.\n  When asked about these loans at a subcommittee hearing, the head of \nEnron's compensation committee said that his committee had no duty to \nmonitor the CEO's loan activity. He also indicated that, while Mr. \nLay's loans were more extensive than anticipated, appeared to have \nfunctioned as secret stock sales to the company, and affected company \ncash flow at a critical time, he was not prepared to characterize the \nCEO's actions or failure to repay $7 million as an abuse. He declined \nto criticize Mr. Lay's conduct. The subcommittee concluded that the \nEnron board had failed to monitor or halt abuse by Mr. Lay of his \ncompany-financed credit line.\n  Enron was an eye-opener, but it turns out that it is far from the \nonly U.S. company handing out multimillion-dollar loans to executives, \noften without regard to whether the issued loans benefit the \ncorporation or whether they will be repaid.\n  In December 2002, the Corporate Library, a non-profit organization \nthat provides information to help investors and stockholders, published \nthe most comprehensive analysis yet of the pervasiveness of company \nloans to executives prior to enactment of Section 402. The report, \nentitled ``My Big Fat Corporate Loan,'' presents information compiled \nfrom reviewing SEC filings for 1,526 of the largest U.S. corporations \nin the United States. This report relies solely on what companies have \ndisclosed to the public about their loans to executives, without any \nattempt to verify or supplement these disclosures. The result is data \nthat may provide a conservative picture of company lending to \nexecutives.\n  The Corporate Library report has determined that over one-third of \nthe largest 1,500 companies in the U.S. have outstanding loans to \ncompany executives. According to the report, the average size of these \nloans was 10.7 million in 2001, and the total amount of lending \nexceeded $4.5 billion. The report also points out that when company \nloans to purchase split dollar life insurance, described later, for \ncorporate executives are included, the percentage increases to over 75 \npercent. When short-term company loans allowing executives to exercise \nstock options are included, the percentage tops 90 percent.\n  The list of companies issuing these loans include not only companies \nmarked by scandal, such as Enron, Tyco, Adelphia, WorldCom, and Global \nCrossing, but also many companies perceived as solid investments with \ngood corporate practices and reasonable executive pay.\n  The report describes the purpose of the loans as reported by the \ncompanies in their SEC filings. The largest proportion of the loans, \nabout 35 percent, had a stock-related purpose, such as to allow a \ncompany executive to exercise stock options, purchase stock, or retain \nstock after a margin call. The report expresses dismay at examples of \nexecutives using interest-free loans to buy company stock, being \nexcused from repayment of the loan, and thereby acquiring a substantial \ncompany investment without expending any of their own money.\n  Loans to help an executive relocate to a new area, including buying a \nhouse, comprised the second largest portion of company loans to \nexecutives. These loans comprised about 27 percent of the total, \naccording to the report. While relocation loans sound reasonable, the \nreport provides examples of disturbing abuses, including loans for \nmillions of dollars. In one case, Millennium Pharmaceutical issued a \nloan to a senior vice president to buy a house in the Boston area and \nallowed the loan to be forgiven over time. In another case, the \npresident of a Nike business unit was given a so-called loan for a \nsecond home. By its terms, that loan was intended to be forgiven over 5 \nyears. Another example, not mentioned in the report but discussed in \nthe media, is the $16.5 million loan issued by Tyco International to \nits CEO Dennis Kozlowski to buy property in Boca Raton and Nantucket. \nTyco also loaned $14 million to its general counsel, Mark Belnick, for \na New York apartment and to build a home in Utah, a State where Tyco \nhas no operations.\n  It boggles the mind to think that high-paid corporate executives were \nusing company funds to build themselves mansions and then, in some \ncases, skipping repayment of the funds altogether. It is unlikely that \na company would issue a loan to an average employee to build a \nmultimillion-dollar residence or to build a second home, since there \nwould be no business justification for it. There is no justification \nfor lending company funds to a corporate executive either, yet these\n\n[[Page S2179]]\n\ntypes of loans were becoming commonplace. Section 402 was intended to \nstop these loans cold.\n  The Corporate Library report tells us that the third most frequent \ntype of company loan for company executives was issued for \n``unspecified'' reasons. In other words, millions of dollars of \nstockholder funds were loaned without disclosing to the stockholders \nthe purpose of the loans. The authors of the report not only express \ndismay at this unexplained use of company funds, they also suggest that \nthe absence of this information is a clear violation of SEC disclosure \nrequirements.\n  Another issue highlighted in the report is the extent to which \nindividual companies were devoting substantial dollars to executive \nloans. According to the report, Wachovia Corporation led the pack last \nyear with a total of $2.2 billion in company loans to executives. \nAdelphia issued over $263 million in loans to members of the Rigas \nfamily that owned it. Worldcom loaned its CEO $160 million. Kmart, now \noperating in bankruptcy, has outstanding executive loans of $30 \nmillion, including a $5 million so-called ``retention'' loan that it \ngave to its former CEO.\n\n  The report also presents data showing that companies are issuing \nsubstantial loans to executives on terms that disadvantage the company. \nMany companies have been charging below-market interest rates or no \ninterest at all. Others have been allowing their executives to escape \nall loan repayment, simply by forgiving the debt owed. The report \nstates that only half of the companies it examined indicated any plan \nto charge interest, and a careful examination of loan terms revealed a \nnumber of methods to forgive interest or provide additional loans to \ncover it. The report also identifies over 100 companies that had, or \nwere in the process of, forgiving loans to their executives. It also \ndescribes a number of companies that increased outstanding loan amounts \nto include a ``gross up'' to take care of taxes owed by the executive \nas a result of the forgiven loan.\n  Finally, let's look at split dollar life insurance loans. These loans \nhad become very popular among corporate executives in the last few \nyears. The way they work is that the company obtains the insurance \npolicy for its executive and pays the premiums, while the executive \nnames the policy beneficiaries. The policies are called ``split \ndollar'' because, when the policy pays out, the company is reimbursed \nfrom the benefits for the cost of the premiums. The remainder of the \ninsurance benefits, often millions of dollars, goes to the named \nbeneficiaries, such as the executive's family. Because the funds are \ninsurance benefits, the payments to the beneficiaries are mostly tax-\nfree. The result is a company-financed loan to the executive to cover \nthe cost of the insurance premiums, enabling the executive to afford a \ngenerous policy and provide tax-free benefits for his or her \nbeneficiaries.\n  Many of the split dollar life insurance policies that U.S. companies \nprovide to their top executives involve large payouts and large \npremiums. At Enron, for example, Enron provided its CEO, Ken Lay, with \na $12 million split dollar life insurance policy and agreed to pay \npremiums exceeding $1 million.\n  The Corporate Library report found that over 60 percent of the \ncompanies it examined had purchased split dollar life insurance for one \nor more of their executives. The report determined that a number of \nthese policies involved substantial sums of money. For example, the \nreport stated that many of the policies cost ``up to $25 million per \nofficer''; Estee Lauder disclosed paying $26 million for premiums on a \nsplit dollar life insurance policy for its CEO; Comcast disclosed \npaying more that $6.5 million in 1 year and $20 million over 3 years \nfor premiums on a policy for its chairman; and First Virginia Banks \nreported providing all of its executives with insurance coverage of up \nto a $1 million each.\n  Since Section 402 has gone into effect, most companies have \napparently discontinued providing their executives with split dollar \nlife insurance loans, and the executives themselves have declined to \npay the premiums. The result has been a dramatic drop in sales of this \ninsurance. Insurance groups have been lobbying the SEC and Congress to \ncreate an exception to Section 402 to permit companies to resume \nproviding split dollar life insurance loans to their executives, but so \nfar they have been unsuccessful in reversing Section 402's ban on this \ntype of corporate loan.\n  All of the loans banned by Section 402 are loans to corporate \nofficers or directors who are among the highest paid individuals in our \nsociety. In 2001, for example, average CEO pay at the top 350 U.S. \ncompanies was $11 million. That is 400 times the pay of an average \nworker in this country. These loans were on top of that pay.\n  All of these executives could have turned to a bank for their loans. \nInstead, they turned to their employer and asked to use company funds. \nThe practice of U.S. companies loaning company funds to their \nexecutives is relatively new. Given the huge amounts involved, the \nabsence of reasonable interest rates, and the common practice of \ncompanies forgiving the debt altogether, the question becomes whether \nmany of these ``loans'' were simply elaborate ways to enrich corporate \nexecutives at the expense of the investing public. The Corporate \nLibrary report shows that these loans were pervasive and that abuses \nwere commonplace. The work of the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations suggests that too many boards of directors do not have \nthe will or incentive to limit the loan amounts or to detect or prevent \nabuses.\n  That is why, last July, our subcommittee included in its first Enron \nreport a recommendation to stop companies from loaning company funds to \nexecutives. That is why, later that same month, Congress enacted \nSection 402. That is why, in September of last year, Senator Collins \nand I sent a letter to the SEC urging it to resist any attempts to \nnarrow or weaken Section 402's ban on insider loans to allow corporate \nexecutives to purchase company stock, exercise stock options, obtain \ninsurance, relocate for work or pay taxes.\n  Section 402 has put an end to a large set of abuses associated with \ncompany loans to executives. They include loans issued without \ninterest; loans used to build personal mansions at company expense; \nloans used to provide executives' families with tax-free insurance \nbenefits; loans for every purpose and loans that are never repaid. \nCompany funds belong to shareholders and are intended to benefit them \nand the company they own; they were never intended to act as a pool of \nfunds available to be loaned or given to company executives.\n  Congress acted wisely in passing Section 402. This measure, alone, is \nstopping companies from giving billions of dollars in insider loans to \ncorporate executives. Ending these loan abuses should help restore \ninvestor confidence in corporate America. Opponents of this reform are \ncontinuing to seek ways around it, but I hope my colleagues will join \nme in understanding the importance of this reform and the need to \nensure it reaches it full potential.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Levin-Collins letter to the SEC be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                            Committee on Governmental Affairs,\n\n                              Washington, DC., September 25, 2002.\n     Hon. Harvey L. Pitt\n     U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, \n         NW, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The purpose of this letter is to urge \n     the Commission to resist any efforts to narrow or weaken the \n     insider loan prohibition established by Section 402 of the \n     Sarbanes-Oxley Act, codified at 15 U.S.C. 78m(k), a key \n     reform designed to stop a common insider abuse found at Enron \n     Corporation, Worldcom, Tyco International, and other publicly \n     traded companies.\n       Issued related to insider corporate loan abuses were \n     examined by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations in \n     connection with its ongoing review of Enron. In its \n     bipartisan report, ``The Role of the Board of Directors in \n     Enron's Collapse'' (July 2002), copy enclosed, the \n     Subcommittee found that multi-million dollar loans, using \n     company funds, had been approved by the Enron Board for the \n     personal use of Kenneth Lay, then Chairman of the Board and \n     Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The Subcommittee found that \n     the Board's Compensation Committee first gave Mr. Lay access \n     to a $4 million line of credit, increased this credit line in \n     August 2001 to $7.5 million, and authorized repayment with \n     either cash or company stock. The Subcommittee found that, in \n     2000, Mr. Lay began using what one Board member called an \n     ``ATM approach'' toward his credit line, repeatedly drawing \n     down the entire amount available and then repaying the loan\n\n[[Page S2180]]\n\n     with Enron stock. Records show that Mr. Lay at first drew \n     down the line of credit once per month then every two weeks \n     and then, on some occasions, several days in a row. In the \n     one-year period from October 2000 to October 2001, Mr. Lay \n     used the credit line to obtain over $77 million in cash from \n     the company and repaid the loans exclusively with Enron \n     stock, at a time when the company had significant cash flow \n     issues. After Enron's collapse, it was discovered that Mr. \n     Lay had failed to repay and still owes the company about $7 \n     million. The Subcommittee concluded that the Enron board had \n     failed to monitor or halt abuse by Mr. Lay of his multi-\n     million-dollar, company-financed credit line.\n       Enron, of course, is not alone in having experienced \n     corporate loan abuses. Similar abuses by corporate executives \n     given company-financed loans for millions of dollars have \n     taken place at other U.S. publicly traded companies. At the \n     time of Worldcom's collapse, for example, Board Chairman and \n     CEO Bernard Ebbers was found to have outstanding company-\n     financed loans exceeding $400 million. Apparently, most of \n     these loans had been provided to enable him to purchase \n     Worldcom stock. At Tyco International, Board Chairman and CEO \n     Dennis Kozlowski and other executives apparently managed to \n     secure not only multi-million-dollar personal loans using \n     company funds, but to arrange to have these loans deemed \n     ``forgiven'' in amounts allegedly totaling more than $100 \n     million. Apparently these loans were to pay for employee \n     relocation expenses, including the purchase of expensive \n     residences. Numerous other publicly traded companies have \n     also provided troubling, multi-million-dollar, company-\n     financed loans to corporate executives, including \n     Adelphia, AMC Entertainment, Dynegy, FedEx, Healthsouth, \n     Home Depot, Kmart, Mattel, Microsoft, Priceline.com, \n     SONICblue, and more.\n       Given the extent of insider abuse in this area and the lack \n     of effective Board or management oversight, the Subcommittee \n     recommended in its July report that Board members at publicly \n     traded companies bar the issuance of company-financed loans \n     to company directors and senior officers. Later that same \n     month, Senator Charles Schumer offered on the Senate floor \n     the amendment that led to inclusion of the Section 402 \n     prohibition in the final corporate reform law.\n       Media reports indicate that some companies may be pressing \n     the SEC to narrow the scope of the prohibition or otherwise \n     weaken it through regulation, guidance, or other means. These \n     media reports suggest that opponents want exemptions, for \n     example, for company loans used by executives to purchase \n     company stock, exercise stock options, obtain insurance, \n     relocate for work, or pay taxes. But the legislative history \n     provides no basis for creating these exemptions or otherwise \n     weakening the provision. To the contrary, the statutory \n     prohibition makes it clear that publicly traded companies are \n     not supposed to be using company funds to provide personal \n     financing to company directors or officers for any reason; \n     financing is to be provided instead by lenders, credit card \n     operators, or other third parties engaged in the ordinary \n     course of business.\n       In light of the abusive record compiled by the Permanent \n     Subcommittee on Investigations among others, the \n     Subcommittee's bipartisan recommendation to bar company-\n     financed loans to corporate directors or officers, and the \n     plain language of the statutory prohibition itself, the \n     Commission should continue to resist efforts to weaken this \n     significant post-Enron reform. Congress enacted and the SEC \n     must enforce this bright-line measure to end corporate loan \n     abuses by top executives.\n       Thank you for your attention to this important matter. If \n     your staff has any questions or concerns about this letter or \n     would like additional copies of the Subcommittee report, \n     please have them contact Elise Bean, Subcommittee Staff \n     Director, at (202) 224-9505 or Kim Corthell, Minority Staff \n     Director, at (202) 224-3721.\n           Sincerely,\n     Susan M.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. In the last Congress Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred September 2, \n2001 in Athens, GA. Christopher Gregory, 20, was attacked while leaving \na gay bar. Gregory was walking with friends when a group of people \nstarted shouting anti-gay epithets at them. After Gregory turned and \nyelled ``Leave us alone!'' an attacker punched him, knocking him to the \nground.

Mr. President, I rise today to condemn in the strongest \nterms the rejection yesterday by France, Germany, and Belgium of \nTurkey's formal request for defensive help under Article 4 of the North \nAtlantic Treaty. This was the first invocation of Article 4 in the 54-\nyear history of NATO.\n  Article 4 mandates alliance members to consult ``whenever, in the \nopinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political \nindependence or security of any of the Parties is threatened.'' Fearing \na preemptive attack by Iraq, Turkey requested Patriot missile \nbatteries, AWACS radar planes, and specialized units for countering \nchemical and biological warfare.\n  Sixteen of the 19 NATO members voted to grant Turkey its request. \nFrance, Germany, and Belgium, however, refused, thereby blocking the \nrequest under the alliance's consensus principle. Paris, Berlin, and \nBrussels argued that even this kind of defensive action by NATO would \nappear to commit the alliance to war before the U.N. weapons inspectors \nin Iraq had issued their second report this Friday.\n  I have spoken at length on the situation in Iraq on the floor of this \nchamber and in many other venues. Today, therefore, I will restrict my \ncomments to yesterday's action in NATO's North Atlantic Council, NAC, \nand the potential ramifications for the future of the alliance.\n  Frankly, I am shocked and outraged at the behavior of France, \nGermany, and Belgium. I could easily give an emotional response, but I \nwill not descend to the level of caricature and vitriolic insults that, \nunfortunately, one increasingly hears from Western European America-\nbashers.\n  Nor will I indulge in blanket criticism. France is this country's \noldest ally and in the last 12 years took part in the Gulf War, the \nKosovo air campaign, and in Operation Enduring Freedom. Germany too has \nparticipated in recent military and peacekeeping operations and on this \nvery day, together with the Netherlands, is assuming command of the \nInternational Security Assistance Force, ISAF, peacekeeping operation \nin Afghanistan. Belgium is also contributing troops to peacekeeping in \nthe Balkans.\n  This is, however, only part of the story. Recent history, \nunfortunately, gives us a foretaste of yesterday's action in the NAC. \nOne might recall Belgium's refusal during the Gulf War to sell \nammunition to NATO ally Great Britain. Or more directly applicable was \nthe Bundestag speech early in 1991 by Mr. Otto Lambsdorff, then a \nleader of the German Free Democratic Party, opposing military shipments \nto NATO ally Turkey because of elements of Ankara's domestic policy.\n  Germany's action yesterday was particularly distasteful, since that \ncountry's postwar economic miracle or ``Wirtschaftswunder'' was to a \nconsiderable extent built by the sweat of Turkish guest workers.\n  Aside from moral considerations, the refusal of assistance to Turkey \nby these three countries gravely undermines the solidarity that is the \nbedrock of the North Atlantic Alliance.\n  At first glance, their behavior is puzzling, since they surely know \nthat the United States will stand by its Turkish ally and either \nunilaterally, or in conjunction with other NATO members, will provide \nthe equipment that Ankara feels it needs.\n  Already one European ally has stepped up to the plate. The Dutch \nForeign Ministry has declared that ``the Netherlands is strongly \nopposed'' to the French-German-Belgian move and ``will go ahead with \nproviding Patriot missiles to Turkey.'' The Dutch, in fact, have \nalready sent an air force team to Turkey to prepare for the dispatch of \nthe Patriot missile batteries, which will be manned by 370 Dutch \nmilitary personnel.\n  So since Turkey will receive defensive assistance, the French-German-\n\n[[Page S2181]]\n\nBelgian refusal can only be seen as a symbolic gesture--a direct swipe \nat American leadership of the alliance--but one with more than symbolic \nimportance. U.S. Ambassador Nick Burns declared that it is causing NATO \nto face ``a crisis of credibility.''\n  I would use a metaphor to describe yesterday's action: Paris, Berlin, \nand Brussels are playing with fire. If the United States believes that \nNATO is a hindrance to its security requirements, it will continue to \nbypass the alliance, and NATO will quickly atrophy. No serious observer \nbelieves that the European Union has either the capability or the will \nto provide a credible military alternative to a NATO deprived of \nAmerican muscle. A security vacuum would quickly develop on the \ncontinent, thereby undoing more than a half-century of common effort \nand endangering the EU itself.\n  Finally, let me address the faulty logic offered by France, Germany, \nand Belgium for their action yesterday. To repeat: their ambassadors \nargued that if NATO were to furnish Turkey with the defensive materiel \nit requested, it would appear that the alliance was committing itself \nto war before the U.N. weapons inspectors in Iraq had issued their \nsecond report this Friday.\n  Paris, Berlin, and Brussels might be interested to learn that U.N. \nSecretary General Kofi Annan will brief the members of the Security \nCouncil this Thursday on the status of contingency planning by the \nUnited Nations for humanitarian assistance for Iraq in the event of \nwar.\n  According to the argument used yesterday in the NAC by the French, \nGermans, and Belgians, the U.N.'s action, therefore, is hastening the \noutbreak of war.\n  I fully anticipate that French President Chirac, German Chancellor \nSchroeder, and Belgian Prime Minister Verhofstadt will condemn \nSecretary General Annan for his recklessness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/11/senate-section/article/S2181-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2181-S2182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RULES OF THE COMMITTEE ON VETERANS' AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, in December 2002 President Bush announced \nhis decision to deploy a limited national missile defense system by \n2004. Our distinguished colleague, Senator Levin, detailed the \nlimitations of the proposed system and testing procedures in an article \nin the Detroit News on December 29 entitled, ``Untested Missile Defense \nSetup Poses Risks.'' I ask unanimous consent that his entire article be \nplaced in the Record following my statement. I would like to elaborate \non some of the concerns raised by the distinguished ranking member of \nthe Armed Services Committee and discuss my concern that this system \ndoes nothing to protect my State or other parts of the United States \nfrom attack.\n  President Bush's limited national missile defense system, first \nproposed by the administration in March 2001 and called ``the Alaska \nOption,'' consists of 5 to 10 silos/interceptor launchers in Fort \nGreely, AK and an upgraded Cobra Dane radar on Shemya Island, AK.\n  At that time, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz and Missile \nDefense Agency Director Gen Ronald Kadish called the Alaska site a \n``test bed'' that could be transformed into a fully operational \nfacility easily. During an Armed Services Committee hearing in July \n2001, Mr. Wolfowitz stated, ``This developmental capability could \nbecome, with very little modification, an operational capability.'' In \na later statement, he added that ``it would be essentially a software \nchange to turn it into an operational capability.''\n  I believe that more than modest modifications would be required. Even \nif the test bed was functioning and proven effective, significant \nchanges would be needed to make it an operational system. The changes \nmay not be technically difficult but they are very complicated when \napplied as a whole system. They involve many command, control, \ncommunication issues that will determine who makes the decision to fire \nand when and with how much information. In large and complex research \nand development programs, one should always be wary of anything that is \ndescribed as ``just a software fix.''\n  In July 2001 Phil Coyle, former Director of Operational Test and \nEvaluation in the Pentagon testified before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee and defined effective deployment as the fielding of an \noperational system with some military utility that is effective under \nrealistic combat conditions, against realistic threats and \ncountermeasures, possible without adequate prior knowledge of the \ntarget cluster composition, timing, trajectory, or direction, and when \noperated by military personnel at all times of the day or night and in \nall weapons.\n  Mr. Coyle estimated that it would take a decade, rather than 4 years, \nto produce an effective defense system. As Senator Levin raised in his \narticle, no part of the limited missile defense system has been tested \nagainst realistic targets, and there are no plans to test the \nintegrated system as a whole before it is deployed. Senator Levin \ncorrectly questions whether such a system will be even marginally \neffective.\n  One could also question whether this system should be labeled a \n``national'' missile defense. Given the geometry of the Cobra Dane \nradar, the system may be better labeled a continental missile defense. \nThe Cobra Dane Radar on Shemya Island was built to detect Soviet \nmissile launches. It has a fixed orientation and a narrow field of \nview, northwest from Shemya, towards Russia. This radar cannot see \nmissiles launched from North Korea towards Hawaii, and will have only \nmarginal capability for southern California. The radar cannot see the \ncurrent missile defense target range between California and Hawaii.\n  The administration is well aware of the limitations of the radar and \nexclusion of Hawaii in the proposed deployed system. General Kadish \nreferred to this as ``the Hawaii problem'' during a briefing for \nSenator Reed and members of the Armed Services Strategic Subcommittee \non July 27, 2001. At that time, General Kadish said that they were \nconsidering using an Aegis cruiser to supplement the Cobra Dane radar. \nSuch a cruiser would have to be permanently on station to provide \nadequate coverage.\n  Even with upgrades to increase the radar's field of view, the radar \nstill will not be capable of discriminating launch characteristics or \ntrajectory. An X band radar, such as the one now in Kwajalein, is \nneeded. In fact, no radar in Alaska will be able to discriminate launch \ncharacteristics. The administration has not asked for funding to \nupgrade the existing radar or build a new one.\n  The President characterized in December 2002 his initiative to field \na missile defense system as ``modest.'' The program is less than \nmodest. It is inadequate and expensive. The path towards an effective \nand efficient missile defense program is the one outlined by Senator \nLevin.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Detroit News, Dec. 29, 2002]\n\n Levin: Untested Missile Defense Setup Poses Risks; Can Missile Shield \n                               Be Built?\n\n                        (By Senator Carl Levin)\n\n       President Bush's decision to deploy a limited national \n     missile defense system starting in 2004 before it has been \n     tested and shown to work violates common sense. The Pentagon \n     will spend large amounts of money to deploy an unproven \n     defense, money that could be better used to fight more likely \n     and imminent threats of terrorism.\n       Many of us have reservations about deployment of a national \n     defense against long-range ballistic missiles because: (1) \n     the intelligence community says such missiles are one of the \n     least likely threats to our security (in part because use of \n     such missiles would leave a ``return address'' that would \n     guarantee a devastating response from the United States); and \n     (2) because deployment of a national missile defense is \n     likely to unleash an arms race with other countries.\n       However, even ardent proponents of a national missile \n     defense should not support deployment of an untested, \n     unproven system. The United States may eventually succeed in \n     developing a national missile defense system that will \n     actually work against real world threats, but we have not \n     done so yet. According to the Pentagon, the national missile \n     defense system to be deployed in 2004 requires a new booster \n     rocket that has never been tested against any target.\n\n[[Page S2183]]\n\n       The 2004 system would rely on a radar in Alaska built in \n     the 1970's that was never designed for missile defense, that \n     has no capability to differentiate the target warhead from \n     decoys, that has never been tested against a long-range \n     ballistic missile, and that the administration never plans to \n     test against a long-range missile.\n       No part of the system has been tested against realistic \n     targets, and there are no plans to test the integrated system \n     as a whole before it is deployed. Secretary of Defense Donald \n     Rumsfeld has said that this is just an ``initial capability'' \n     in a program that ``will evolve over time'' and will \n     ultimately ``look quite different than it begins.''\n       What the Pentagon has tried not to emphasize is that this \n     ``initial capability'' is likely to be marginally effective, \n     if it works at all. Declaring this untested, marginal system \n     ready to deploy is like declaring a newly designed airplane \n     ready to fly before the wings have been attached to the \n     airframe and the electronics installed in the cockpit.\n       In his previous tenure as Secretary of Defense, Rumsfeld \n     had to preside over the dismantling of the Safeguard missile \n     defense system which he had inherited and which was \n     operational for less than six months because the technical \n     limitations of the system rendered it ineffective. The \n     development, deployment and dismantling of the Safeguard \n     system cost the taxpayers tens of billions of dollars without \n     enhancing our national security in any way. This is an \n     experience that we should not want to repeat.\n       Since that time, Congress has instituted reforms in the \n     Defense Department to help prevent the premature and costly \n     fielding of unproven systems. Congress established the \n     Pentagon's Director of Operational Test and Evaluation to \n     oversee major defense programs and ensure they are adequately \n     tested and demonstrated to work before they are deployed--in \n     other words, that any new system is proven to ``fly before we \n     buy.''\n       Congress also established the Joint Requirements Oversight \n     Council, which gives the military services oversight over \n     weapons programs to ensure that they perform well enough to \n     be useful on the battlefield.\n       The Bush administration, however, has unwisely exempted all \n     missile defense programs from the normal oversight of these \n     important organizations. As a result, these programs are not \n     subject to normal review by senior military and civilian \n     acquisition officials, and they are not subject to the normal \n     operational test and evaluation process.\n       Instead, the secretary of defense has delegated many of the \n     functions of these offices to the Missile Defense Agency, \n     effectively making that agency responsible for overseeing \n     itself. History shows that without real oversight, major \n     weapon systems don't work well, suffer serious schedule \n     delays and have major cost overruns.\n       The Bush administration should re-establish effective \n     oversight of missile defense programs by the Director of \n     Operational Test and Evaluation, the Joint Requirements \n     Oversight Council, and other oversight organizations with the \n     Department of Defense. Rather than rushing to deploy an \n     unproven national missile defense system, the administration \n     should focus on completing the development of a missile \n     defense that will be effective against likely threats and \n     that is shown to work through proper testing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/11/senate-section/article/S2183-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DUCHENNE MD AWARENESS WEEK\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, this week is the Parent Project Muscular \nDystrophy's Duchenne MD Awareness Week. It is also the 2-year \nanniversary of the introduction of the MD CARE Act, which I was pleased \nto cosponsor with our late colleague, Senator Paul Wellstone, to raise \nawareness and expand Federal support for medical research to find a \ncure for this devastating disease.\n  The need for this legislation was first brought to my attention by \none of my constituents, Brian Denger, of Biddeford, ME, who has not \none, but two wonderful boys--Matthew and Patrick--with Duchenne \nMuscular Dystrophy. The Dengers--who also have a daughter, Rachel, with \njuvenile diabetes--are a loving and courageous family whose strength \nand spirit inspired me to become involved in advocating for more \nresearch funding for muscular dystrophy.\n  Until I met Brian, I really did not know much about Duchenne Muscular \nDystrophy. He was the first to tell me that 1 in 3,500 male children \nworldwide will be born with the disease and lose the ability to walk by \nage 10. He told me about the terrible progression of the disease. As it \nprogresses, muscle deterioration in the back and chest begins to put \npressure on the lungs, making it more and more difficult for the child \nto breathe.\n  What really caught my attention was the fact that the lifespan of \nchildren suffering from this disease has not been extended in any \nsignificant way in recent years. Current treatment options for boys \nlike Matthew and Patrick are minimal and aimed simply at managing their \nsymptoms in an effort to optimize their quality of life for the limited \ntime they have with us.\n  Given our Nation's wealth of scientific expertise coupled with the \ntremendous infusion of resources we have poured into the NIH in recent \nyears, we can and should do more for families like the Dengers. That is \nwhy I joined with Senator Wellstone in introducing the MD CARE Act, \nwhich President Bush signed into law in December of 2001.\n  Since the passage of this important legislation, the National \nInstitutes of Health have established grants for the creation of three \nCenters of Excellence in Muscular Dystrophy Research, which will \nprovide focused research and development in all phases--including \nbasic, clinical, and transitional--of the research spectrum. In \naddition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have developed \nan in-depth surveillance and epidemiology study of Duchenne and Becker \nmuscular dystrophy. A population-based epidemiological study of \nDuchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy will provide the extensive data \nnecessary to inform research decisions, standards of care, physician \ntraining, and public health approaches to assist families living with \nDuchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy.\n  The NIH and the CDC are to be commended for the progress they are \nmaking in their research efforts related to muscular dystrophy. These \nefforts to improve the quality and length of life for thousands of \nchildren diagnosed with muscular dystrophy are invaluable, and I \ncommend the researchers and all of the families who have worked so hard \nto combat this devastating disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/11/senate-section/article/S2183-2", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2183-S2184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE ``COLUMBIA'' TRAGEDY\n\n  Mr. WYDEN.

Mr. President, I rise today with great sadness and \ntremendous gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from \nKokomo, IN. Specialist Brian Clemens was just 19 years old. He died \nlast week in Kuwait as he and his comrades in the 1st Battalion, 293rd \nInfantry of the Indiana Army National Guard prepared for a war that may \nsoon begin. Brian was there, in a far away land, to fight for values we \nhold close to our hearts.\n  Specialist Clemens was the first Indiana National Guard member killed \noverseas since Operation Desert Storm ended more than a decade ago. He \nwas also the first American to perish while dutifully serving our \nNation in a build-up for possible war with Iraq. I mourn along with \nBrian's family, friends and community. While our pride in Brian shall \ncertainly live on, so too will our sorrow. But Brian's life, his \ncourage, and his strength of character should serve as a powerful and \nconsoling force in the difficult days ahead.\n  Brian Clemens was an energetic and caring young man. He was adored by \nall who knew him for his charismatic personality. He was a positive \nforce within his community, never failing to give of himself whenever \npossible. In the months following his graduation from Maconaquah High \nSchool in 2001, Brian returned to the school regularly to help \nwrestlers on the team hone their skills. He was selfless with his time \nand constantly gave back to the community in which he lived, cherishing \nhis relationships above all else. Deeply devoted to his family, Brian \nwas especially close to his younger sister, Jennifer.\n  As President Abraham Lincoln wrote in a letter to the mother of a \nfallen Union soldier: ``I pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the \nanguish of your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of \nthe loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours to have \nlaid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.'' These words \nring as true today as they did 140 years ago, as we mourn the loss of \nBrian Clemens and honor the sacrifice he made for America and for all \nof humanity.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Brian Clemens in the official \nRecord of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his \nprofound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When I think \nabout this just cause in which we are engaged, and the unfortunate pain \nthat comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like \nBrian's can find comfort in the word of the prophet Isaiah who said, \n``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away \ntears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God \nbless the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/11/senate-section/article/S2184-2", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO PAM BONRUD\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, the South Dakota Public Utilities \nCommission recently announced that Pam Bonrud will serve as the PUC's \nnew executive director. I wish to congratulate Ms. Bonrud for her \nselection to lead the PUC and to formally thank her for her 10 years of \nservice to the Lewis and Clark Rural Water System.\n  During that time, Ms. Bonrud distinguished herself as an effective \nand dedicated leader. While with Lewis and Clark, Ms. Bonrud was \ninstrumental in helping me and my colleagues secure the successful \npassage of legislation authorizing the project. Through her leadership, \nwe were able to build a strong coalition supporting the project at the \nlocal, State and Federal levels within the States of South Dakota, \nMinnesota, and Iowa.\n  Ms. Bonrud displayed all the qualities necessary to help make sure \nthis critically important water project would receive Federal \nauthorization. She was professional, persistent, and determined, and \nalways had a positive attitude, even though the authorization process \ntook 6 years from the time the first version of the legislation was \nintroduced in 1994.\n  I always enjoyed working with Ms. Bonrud, and she was able to work \neffectively with Senators and House Members of all three States \ninvolved and on both sides of the aisle. She has been one of South \nDakota's best advocates and supporters of rural water development, and \nthe entire southeast region of South Dakota, as well southwestern \nMinnesota and northwestern Iowa, will always be thankful for her 10 \nyears of hard work, dedication, and foresight to help bring this much \nneeded drinking water project from the drawing board to construction.\n  In fact, the Lewis and Clark System will be undertaking a \ngroundbreaking ceremony this spring, and Ms. Bonrud is a major reason \nit will be the beginning of making this project a reality. She leaves \nthe project in good stead and her leadership and fine character will be \nsorely missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/11/senate-section/article/S2184-3", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/11/senate-section/article/S2184-4", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations, a withdrawal, and a treaty which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/11/senate-section/article/S2184-5", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:22 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that pursuant to \nthe provisions of section 201(a)(2) of the Congressional Budget and \nImpoundment Control Act of 1974, Public Law 93-344, the Speaker of the \nHouse of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate \nappoints Mr. Douglas Holtz-Eakin as Director of the Congressional \nBudget Office for a term of office expiring on January 3, 2007.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/11/senate-section/article/S2184-6", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2184-S2185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MEASURES REFERRED\n\n  The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources was discharged from \nfurther consideration of the following measure which was referred to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works:\n\n       S. 277.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to simplify \nthe application of the excise tax imposed on bows and arrows; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, along with my colleagues, Senators Hatch, \nMiller, Bayh and Grassley, I am pleased to introduce the Archery Excise \nTax Simplification Act of 2003. This bill will protect funding for the \nWildlife Restoration Program, the Pittman-Robertson fund, by \nsimplifying administration and compliance with the excise tax and \nclosing an unintended loophole that allows arrows assembled outside the \nUnited States to avoid the excise tax imposed on domestic \nmanufacturers.\n  The creation of the Wildlife Restoration Program is one of the great \nsuccess stories of cooperation among America's sportsmen and women, \nState fish and wildlife agencies, and the sporting goods industry. \nWorking together with Congress, Americans who enjoy the outdoors \nvolunteered to pay an excise tax on sporting arms and ammunition to be \nused for hunter education programs, wildlife restoration, and habitat \nconservation.\n  Originally the archery industry did not participate in this program. \nHowever, the growth of bow hunting in the '60s and '70s led the archery \nindustry to decide they would support the excise tax that funds State \ngame agencies. As a result, the tax was extended to archery equipment \nin 1975. The tax on archery equipment was meant to parallel the tax \nthat hunters were paying on firearms and ready-to-fire ammunition. The \narchery industry and bow hunters are pleased to contribute to the \nsuccess of the Wildlife Restoration Program.\n  Because current law taxes components and not arrows, foreign \nmanufacturers are selling arrows in the United States without paying \nthe excise tax\n\n[[Page S2189]]\n\nthat is imposed on arrows made in the United States. Not only are these \nuntaxed imports unfair to American workers, they threaten the integrity \nof the Wildlife Restoration Fund.\n  This issue is important to companies in Montana. Mike Ellig, a \nmanufacturer of archery products in Bozeman, MT, pays this tax. He \nsupports the tax, but asks that it be fair. Mike's company, Montana \nBlack Gold, and the archery industry want to support the Wildlife \nRestoration Program. But the way the tax works today, American \nmanufacturers are at a competitive disadvantage. That is why the 800 \nmembers of the Montana Bowhunters Association support this measure.\n  This legislation will close the loophole that allows imported arrows \nto avoid the excise tax paid by domestic manufacturers. While keeping \nthe current 12.4 percent tax on arrow components, the proposal will \nimpose a tax of 12 percent on the first sale of an arrow assembled from \nuntaxed components. U.S. manufacturers and foreign manufacturers will \nbe treated equally.\n  Since this loophole was inadvertently created in 1997, archery \nimports, mostly finished arrows, increased from $430,000 in 1998, to \n$1.6 million in 1999, to $3.2 million in 2000, to $7.8 million in 2001 \nand to $11.0 million in 2002, through November. If Congress does not \nact quickly to close this loophole, domestic manufacturers will be \nforced to relocate outside of the United States. They simply cannot \nafford to lose market share for a fifth year to competitors who do not \npay the same tax they pay. If a few more move overseas, the rest will \nfollow. The result will be a catastrophic loss of revenue for the \nFederal Wildlife Restoration Fund.\n  Current law also taxes non-hunters, contrary to Congressional intent. \nTo relieve non-hunters from the requirement to pay for wildlife \nmanagement, the legislation would eliminate the current-law tax on bows \nwith draw weights of less than 30 pounds. Those bows are not suitable \nor, in many states, legal for hunting. To preserve the revenue for the \nWildlife Restoration Fund, the bill would retain the current tax on \nbows that are suitable for hunting.\n  The proposal would also clarify that broadheads are an accessory \ntaxed at 11 percent rather than as an arrow component taxed at 12.4 \npercent. This will correct the ambiguity in the 1997 Act that led to \nthe misclassification of broadheads.\n  In summary, the Arrow Excise Tax Simplification Act of 2001 would \naccomplish worthy objectives. It would close the loophole that allows \nforeign imported arrows to escape the tax and remove the tax on youth \nand recreational archery equipment that were never meant to be taxed. \nWe will accomplish these goals while protecting the Wildlife \nRestoration Program by ensuring that there is no significant diminution \nof revenues collected by the archery excise tax. The Joint Committee on \nTaxation estimates the proposal will decrease revenues by $5 million \nover ten years resulting in small changes in outlays from the Federal \nAid in Wildlife Fund. Failure to close the import loophole will \neviscerate the archery tax base resulting in devastating losses to the \nFund.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 339\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate the Federal building and United States \ncourthouse located at 515 9th Street in Rapid City, South Dakota, as \nthe ``Andrew W. Bogue Federal Building and United States Courthouse''; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation on \nbehalf of Senator Tim Johnson and myself to name the Rapid City United \nStates Courthouse and Federal Building in honor of Judge Andrew W. \nBogue, Senior Judge of the U.S. District Court of the District of South \nDakota.\n  The administration of justice in western South Dakota is nearly \nsynonymous with the name of Judge Bogue. He is almost single-handedly \nresponsible for establishing the Federal district court in Rapid City, \nand worked tirelessly to see the Courthouse and Federal Building \nconstructed there to provide a new home for the administration of \njustice in the area.\n  Judge Bogue was the first resident judge in the western division of \nthe U.S. District Court District of South Dakota. Before he came along, \njudges had to travel into the division from other parts of the State, \nand court was held in the ancient Deadwood Territorial Courthouse or in \nmakeshift courtrooms throughout the 11-county region. Faced with the \nlogistical hassles of court operations, attorneys were less likely to \nuse the court system.\n  After Judge Bogue took the bench, he helped transform the justice \nsystem in western South Dakota. First, he oversaw the establishment of \na new district seat in Rapid City, the population center. Then he \nworked alongside South Dakota's congressional delegation to secure \nfunding for the construction of the Rapid City Federal Building and \nUnited States Courthouse.\n  During the course of his career as a Federal judge, Bogue has \npresided over many high-profile cases, including cases stemming from \nAmerican Indian Movement, AIM, uprisings in the 1970s. He has \nmaintained a reputation for being fair, objective, and compassionate.\n  Before rising to the U.S. District Court bench, Andrew Bogue was \neducated at South Dakota State University. After serving our Nation \nwith the U.S. Army Signal Corps during World War II, he returned home \nto complete a law degree at the University of South Dakota and to marry \nhis lovely wife Liz. He was admitted to the South Dakota Bar in 1947.\n  Andrew Bogue again answered the call to defend our country during the \nKorean War, serving in the U.S. Army's Judge Advocate General's corps. \nUpon his return, he practiced as a private attorney and a State's \nAttorney before becoming a South Dakota circuit court judge. He joined \nthe Federal bench on May 1, 1970, and was elevated to Chief Judge in \n1980. He took senior status in 1985.\n  It is right and fitting that the Rapid City Federal Building and \nCourthouse be named for the individual whose legacy pervades its halls. \nThe legislation Senator Johnson and I introduce today began with an \noutpouring of support from Judge Bogue's colleagues. The Pennington \nCounty Bar Association and the Seventh Judicial Circuit Court Judges \nand Magistrate Judges have\n\n[[Page S2190]]\n\npassed resolutions supporting this initiative. I am proud to offer this \nlegislation in honor of a great South Dakotan.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 341\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF ANDREW W.

Bogue Federal \n     Building and United States Courthouse.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GREGG (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. \n        Alexander):\n  S. 342. A bill to amend the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act \nto make improvements to and reauthorize programs under that Act, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, last year our Nation was stunned by a \nvideotape of a mother beating her 4 year old daughter in the parking \nlot of a shopping center. Yet the unfortunate fact is that each year, \nbehind closed doors, close to one million children in the United States \nare abused or neglected and as a result, are in need of assistance and \nout-of-home care.\n  I am pleased today to be joined by Senators Kennedy, Dodd and \nAlexander, in introducing legislation aimed at reducing child abuse and \nneglect and mitigating its very damaging impact. The ``Keeping Children \nand Families Safe Act of 2003'' reauthorizes four key programs designed \nto do just that.\n  First, we reauthorize the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, \nCAPTA, which provides grants to States to improve child protection \nsystems and to support community-based family resource and support \nservices. CAPTA also authorizes research and demonstration projects \naimed at preventing and treating child abuse and neglect.\n  The last reauthorization of CAPTA in 1996 made significant changes in \nthis program to better target limited Federal resources and to enhance \nthe ability of States to respond to the most serious cases of abuse and \nneglect. Unfortunately, the issues facing an overburdened child welfare \nsystem are seldom easily resolved. The Keeping Children and Families \nSafe Act will build upon previous changes to CAPTA, by enhancing the \nCPS workforce and continuing to ensure that children and families \nreceive appropriate services and referrals.\n  The legislation my colleagues and I are introducing today encourages \nnew training and better qualifications for child and family service \nworkers. With this reauthorization, States can give additional training \nto CPS workers on how to best work with families from the time that the \nCPS worker walks through the door of a home to the point of treatment \nfor the child and family.\n  In 2000, CPS workers nationwide investigated 1.7 million cases of \nreported Child Abuse and Neglect. The environments in which CPS workers \nconduct these investigations can vary greatly in level of safety. With \nthis legislation, States will be able to use Federal dollars to provide \nsome personal safety training for CPS workers for when they enter the \nhome. Additionally, the rights of families are also addressed during \nthe initial stages of investigation, by requiring CPS workers to inform \nindividuals of child maltreatment allegations made against them.\n  During their investigations, CPS workers encounter a myriad of types \nof abuse. In 2000, approximately 63 percent of children who were \nvictims of maltreatment suffered neglect, 19 percent suffered physical \nabuse, 10 percent suffered sexual abuse, and 8 percent suffered \nemotional maltreatment. In order to help insure that cases of abuse and \nneglect are properly identified, States would be able to provide cross-\ntraining for CPS workers to help them better recognize neglect, \ndomestic violence or substance abuse in a family. This bill would also \nenhance linkages between child protection services and education, \nhealth, mental health, and judicial systems. Further, it would \nencourage greater collaboration with the juvenile justice system to \nensure that children who move between these two systems do so smoothly \nand receive the proper services.\n  As a condition of receiving state grant money, we ask States to have \npolicies and procedures, including referral to CPS, to address the \nneeds of infants who have been prenatally exposed to illegal \nsubstances. We also require States to perform background checks on all \nadults in prospective foster care households. Current law only requires \nthat checks be performed on the prospective foster care parent.\n  We have all heard the horrific accounts in the media of those \nchildren who slip through the cracks of the child protective system. It \nis our hope that with this reauthorization, which includes an increase \nin authorization to $200 million, we can help States to fill some of \nthose cracks.\n  The second program we reauthorize is the Adoption Opportunities Act. \nThis Act is intended to eliminate barriers to adoption and to \nprovide permanent homes for children, particularly children who are \nhard to place, including children with special needs, older children, \nand disabled infants with life-threatening conditions.\n\n  With 131,000 children currently waiting for adoption, we must improve \nupon this program by seeking to further tear down barriers to adoption. \nSpecifically--we are placing an increased emphasis on the elimination \nof inter-jurisdictional barriers to adoption.\n  This Act would require the Secretary of the Department of Health and \nHuman Services to fund public or private entities, including States, to \ndevelop a uniform home-study standard and protocols for acceptance of \nhome-studies between States and jurisdictions. The Secretary would also \nhelp to facilitate cross-jurisdictional placements by developing models \nof financing, expanding capacity of all adoption exchanges to serve \nincreasing numbers of children, training social workers on preparing \nand moving children across State lines, and developing and supporting \nmodels for networking among agencies, adoption exchange, and parent \nsupport groups across jurisdictional boundaries.\n  Within one year of enactment, the bill would require the Department \nof Health and Human Services, in consultation with the General \nAccounting Office, to facilitate the inter-jurisdictional adoption of \nfoster children. Additionally, the bill would also make inter-\njurisdictional adoption issues--including financing and best \npractices--a part of a larger study HHS would be required to conduct on \nadoption placements. Current law generally allows HHS to fund services \nprovided by public and nonprofit private agencies only. To help \nfacilitate this process, we would double the current authorization for \nthis title from $20 million to $40 million.\n  Third, the Keeping Children and Families Safe Act of 2003 \nreauthorizes the Abandoned Infants Assistance Act. This program \nauthorizes demonstration grants to public and private nonprofit \nagencies for activities aimed at preventing the abandonment of infants, \nidentifying and addressing the needs of abandoned infants, and \nrecruiting and training foster families for abandoned children.\n  Currently, grant recipients must ensure that priority for their \nservices is given to abandoned infants and young children who are HIV-\ninfected, perinatally exposed to HIV, or perinatally drug-exposed. This \nlegislation, which includes and increase in authorization to $45 \nmillion, would broaden priority for services to include abandoned \ninfants and young children who have life threatening illnesses or other \nspecial medical needs.\n  Finally, we reauthorize the Family Violence Prevention and Services \nAct, FVPSA, which assists in efforts to increase public awareness about \nfamily violence and provide immediate shelter and related assistance to \nvictims of family violence and their children.\n\n[[Page S2191]]\n\n  This reauthorization increases the authorization for the National \nDomestic Violence Hotline to $5 million and establishes a National \nDomestic Violence Shelter Network to link domestic violence shelters \nand service providers and the National Domestic Violence Hotline on a \nconfidential website. The website would provide a continuously updated \nlist of shelter availability anywhere in the United States at any time \nand would provide comprehensive information describing the services \neach shelter provides such as medical, social and bilingual services. \nIt would also provide internet access to shelters that do not have \nappropriate technology.\n  Domestic violence and child abuse affect thousands upon thousands of \nfamilies each year, often with tragic results. In the year 2000 alone, \n1200 children died as a consequence of child abuse and neglect, 85 \npercent of whom were under the age of 6. We must continue our efforts \nto stem the tide of abuse to prevent these dreadful results. This \nlegislation reauthorizes four programs that address the needs of some \nof our most at-risk children and families, and I urge my colleagues' \nsupport.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 342\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in \nintroducing the Keeping Children and Families Safe Act of 2003. This \nAct continues our Federal commitment to ensuring that the Nation's most \nvulnerable children are protected and safe.\n  Recent cases of abuse and neglect have made national headlines as \nlocal authorities have failed to identify abused children. These \nfailures have led to tragic consequences--the deaths of innocent and \nunprotected children.\n  Clearly, we must do better--at the national, State, and local levels. \nAnd the bill we introduce today will enhance the Federal partnership \nwith local officials to bring greater protection to our children.\n  Since 1974, the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, or CAPTA, \nhas been a great support in reaching the nearly 900,000 children who \nsuffer abuse and neglect each year. This year's bipartisan \nreauthorization of CAPTA will continue and expand that support through \nFY 2008, and extend CAPTA's related programs, including the Abandoned \nInfants Assistance Act, the Adoption Opportunities Act, and the Family \nViolence Prevention and Services Act.\n  Child abuse and neglect continues to be a serious and daunting \nproblem in our nation. In local communities, child protective services \nagencies bear the responsibility of receiving and investigating reports \nof child abuse and neglect. Each year those agencies respond to nearly \n3 million reports of abuse. It is a tremendous challenge, and \ncaseworkers in local agencies perform an admirable task worthy of our \nthanks.\n  But despite the hard work of child protective services, nearly half \nof all children in substantiated cases of abuse receive no follow-up \nservices or support. In 2000, over 900 children under the age of 6 died \nof abuse and neglect. Those children in desperate circumstances need \nand deserve our help, and we must do better.\n  The Keeping Children and Families Safe Act will bring us closer \ntoward our goal of responding more effectively to child abuse and \nneglect. Our bipartisan bill encourages better training and \nqualifications for child abuse caseworkers, creates linkages to better \nfacilitate referrals for neglected children, and coordinates best \npractices to improve systems that currently serve and protect children.\n  Actions to prevent and address child abuse and neglect must be \nstrengthened and expanded. This bill will improve current systems of \nchild abuse treatment by coordinating information on best practices \namong child protective services agencies through the National Child \nAbuse Clearinghouse, and disseminating those practices that hold \npromise to improve systems. The bill will also ensure that local \ncitizen review panels oversee, review, and bolster the practices of \nchild protective services. Access to technical assistance and grants \nwill also be broadened to private entities working to prevent and treat \nchild abuse.\n  The identification and treatment of abused children cannot be \nimproved without better preparation of those responsible for \ninvestigating abuse and neglect. By improving the training, retention, \nand supervision of child protective caseworkers, the bill will ensure \nthat children receive the help they need. New training will help \ncaseworkers become familiar with their legal duties and receive \nguidance on how to best work with families. Training will also be \nprovided to protect the personal safety of caseworkers as they enter \nhomes to investigate allegations of abuse.\n  More must also be done to ensure that abused children receive ongoing \nsupport and services. This bill will encourage states to adopt a \ncomprehensive approach to treating and preventing abuse by linking \nchild protective services and education, health, mental health, and \njudicial systems to more effectively follow-up with support and \nservices to abused and neglected children. The bill will also promote \npartnerships between public agencies and community-based organizations \nto support child abuse prevention and treatment.\n  I am pleased that the Keeping Children and Families Safe Act \ncontinues the legacy of the late Senator Wellstone in combating \ndomestic violence and addressing its impact on children. It is \nestimated that 10 million children witness physical abuse between their \nparents each year, damaging their emotional and physical well being, \nand causing difficulties later in life.\n  Under this Act, new grants will be awarded, once appropriations for \nthe Family Violence Prevention and Services Act reach $150 million, to \naddress the physical and emotional needs of children who witness \nviolence in their homes. Those funds will support direct services and \ninterventions for children who witness domestic violence, bringing \ntogether child welfare agencies, courts, law enforcement, and other \nappropriate entities.\n  This Act also supports a new electronic network to connect victims of \ndomestic violence and support organizations and networks in local \ncommunities. This network will enhance the current national domestic \nviolence hotline, which serves as a vital resource for victims of \ndomestic abuse 24-hours-a-day, 365 days a year. The hotline currently \nprovides support and assistance to 300 to 400 callers a day.\n  We must do more to help children and their families overcome the \nharmful effects of abuse, neglect, and violence. The Keeping Children \nand Families Safe Act of 2003 is a step in the right direction toward \nthat goal, and I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Gregg, \nSenator Kennedy, and Senator Alexander in introducing the Keeping \nChildren and Families Safe Act of 2003.\n  The bill we are introducing today would strengthen efforts to prevent \nchild abuse and neglect, promote increased sharing of information and \npartnerships between child protective services and education, health, \nand juvenile justice systems, and encourage a variety of new training \nprograms to improve child protection, particularly cross-training in \nrecognizing domestic violence and substance abuse in addition to child \nabuse detection and protection training.\n  The Keeping Children and Families Safe Act of 2003 renews grants to \nStates to improve child protection systems and increases to $200 \nmillion the\n\n[[Page S2200]]\n\nauthorization for child abuse investigations, training of child \nprotection service, CPS, workers, and community child abuse prevention \nprograms. For States to receive funding, they must meet several new \nrequirements: have triage procedures to provide appropriate referrals \nof a child ``not at risk of imminent harm'' to a community organization \nor for voluntary preventive services; have policies in place to address \nthe needs of infants who are born and identified as having been \nphysically affected by prenatal exposure to illegal drugs, which must \ninclude a safe plan of care for the child; have policies for improved \ntraining, retention, and supervision of caseworkers; and require \ncriminal background record checks for prospective foster and adoptive \nparents and all other adults living in the household, not later than 2 \nyears after the law's enactment.\n  Child abuse and neglect continue to be significant problems in the \nUnited States.\n  About 3 million referrals concerning the welfare of about 5 million \nchildren were made to Child Protection Services, CPS, agencies \nthroughout the Nation in 2000. Of these referrals, about two-thirds, 62 \npercent, were ``screened-in'' for further assessment and investigation. \nProfessionals, including teachers, law enforcement officers, social \nservice workers, and physicians made more than half, 56 percent, of the \nscreened-in reports. About 879,000 children were found to be victims of \nchild maltreatment. About two-thirds, 63 percent, suffered neglect, \nincluding medical neglect; 19 percent were physically abused; 10 \npercent were sexually abused; and 8 percent were emotionally \nmaltreated.\n  Many of these children fail to receive adequate protection and \nservices. Nearly half, 45 percent, of these children failed to receive \nservices.\n  The most tragic consequence of child maltreatment is death. The April \nmaltreatment summary data released by the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, HHS, shows that about 1,200 children died of abuse and \nneglect in 2000. Children younger than six years of age accounted for \n85 percent of child fatalities and children younger than one year of \nage accounted for 44 percent of child fatalities.\n  Child abuse is not a new phenomenon. For more than a decade, numerous \nreports have called attention to the tragic abuse and neglect of \nchildren and the inadequacy of our Child Protection Services, CPS, \nsystems to protect our children.\n  In 1990, the U.S. Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect concluded \nthat ``child abuse and neglect is a national emergency.'' In 1995, the \nU.S. Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect reported that ``State \nand local CPS caseworkers are often overextended and cannot adequately \nfunction under their current caseloads.'' The report also stated that, \n``in many jurisdictions, caseloads are so high that CPS response is \nlimited to taking the complaint call, making a single visit to the \nhome, and deciding whether or not the complaint is valid, often without \nany subsequent monitoring of the family.''\n  A 1997 General Accounting Office, GAO, report found, ``the CPS system \nis in crisis, plagued by difficult problems, such as growing caseloads, \nincreasingly complex social problems and underlying child maltreatment, \nand ongoing systemic weaknesses in day-to-day operations.'' According \nto GAO, CPS weaknesses include ``difficulty in maintaining a skilled \nworkforce; the inability to consistently follow key policies and \nprocedures designed to protect children; developing useful case data \nand record-keeping systems, such as automated case management; and \nestablishing good working relationships with the courts.''\n  According to the May 2001 ``Report from the Child Welfare Workforce \nSurvey: State and County Data and Findings'' conducted by the American \nPublic Human Services Association, APHSA, the Child Welfare League of \nAmerica, CWLA, and the Alliance for Children and Families, annual staff \nturnover is high and morale is low among CPS workers. The report found \nthat CPS workers had an annual turnover rate of 22 percent, 76 percent \nhigher than the turnover rate for total agency staff. The \n``preventable'' turnover rate was 67 percent, or two-thirds higher than \nthe rate for all other direct service workers and total agency staff. \nIn some States, 75 percent or more of staff turnovers were preventable.\n  States rated a number of retention issues as highly problematic. In \ndescending order they are: workloads that are too high and/or \ndemanding; caseloads that are too high; too much worker time spent on \ntravel, paperwork, courts, and meetings; workers not feeling valued by \nthe agency; low salaries; supervision problems; and insufficient \nresources for families and children.\n  To prevent turnover and retain quality CPS staff, some States have \nbegun to increase in-service training, increase education \nopportunities, increase supervisory training, increase or improve \norientation, increase worker safety, and offer flex-time or changes in \noffice hours. Most States, however, continue to grapple with staff \nturnover and training issues.\n  Continued public criticism of CPS efforts, continued frustration by \nCPS staff and child welfare workers, and continued abuse and neglect, \nand death, of our nation's children, served as the backdrop as we put \ntogether the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, CAPTA, \nreauthorization bill this year.\n  The Child Protection System mission must focus on the safety of \nchildren. To ensure that the system works as intended, CPS needs to be \nappropriately staffed. The staff need to receive appropriate training \nand cross-training to better recognize substance abuse and domestic \nviolence problems. The bill we are introducing today encourages triage \napproaches and differential response systems so that those reports \nwhere children are most at-risk of imminent harm can be prioritized. \nThe bill specifically emphasizes collaborations in communities between \nCPS, health agencies, including mental health agencies, schools, and \ncommunity-based groups to help strengthen families and provide better \nprotection for children. The bill provides grants for prevention \nprograms and activities to prevent child abuse and neglect for families \nat-risk to improve the likelihood that a child will grow up in a home \nwithout violence, abuse, or neglect.\n  Beyond the CAPTA title of this legislation, our bill reauthorizes the \nFamily Violence Prevention and Services Act, including new efforts to \naddress the needs of children who witness domestic violence, the \nAdoption Opportunities Act, and the Abandoned Infants Assistance Act.\n  Child protection ought not be a partisan issue. This bill will help \nensure that it is not. I want to commend and thank my co-authors--\nChairman Gregg, Senator Kennedy and Senator Alexander--for their \nefforts to craft a bipartisan initiative that can help to prevent and \nalleviate suffering among our Nation's children. I urge my colleagues \nto join us in supporting this bill and to strengthen child protection \nlaws early this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Mr. Johnson, Mrs. Murray, Ms. \n        Stabenow, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Inouye, and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 343. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \npermit direct payment under the medicare program for clinical social \nworker services provided to residents of skilled nursing facilities; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Clinical \nSocial Work Medicare Equity Act of 2003.'' I am proud to sponsor this \nlegislation that will include clinical social workers among other \nmental health providers that are exempted from the Medicare Part B \nProspective Payment System. This bill will ensure that clinical social \nworkers can receive Medicare reimbursements for the mental health \nservices they provide in skilled nursing facilities.\n  Since my first days in Congress, I have been fighting to protect and \nstrengthen the safety for our Nation's seniors. Making sure that \nseniors have access to quality, affordable mental health care is an \nimportant part of this fight. I know that millions of seniors do not \nhave access to, or are not receiving, the mental health services they \nneed. For example, depression affects nearly 6 million seniors, but \nonly one-tenth ever get treated. This is unacceptable. Clinical social \nworkers\n\n[[Page S2201]]\n\nmay also be the only mental health providers in some rural areas. \nProtecting seniors' access to clinical social workers can help make \nsure that our most vulnerable citizens get the quality, affordable \nmental health care they need.\n  Clinical social workers, much like psychologists and psychiatrists, \ntreat and diagnose mental illnesses. In fact, clinical social workers \nare the primary mental health providers for nursing home residents. But \nunlike other mental health providers, clinical social workers cannot \nbill directly for the important services they provide to their \npatients. This bill will correct this inequity and make sure clinical \nsocial workers get the payments and respect they deserve.\n  Before the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, clinical social workers \nbilled Medicare Part B directly for mental health services provided in \nnursing facilities to each patient they served. Under the Prospective \nPayment System, services provided by clinical social workers are \nlumped, or ``bundled,'' along with the services of other health care \nproviders for the purposes of billing and payments. Psychologists and \npsychiatrists, who provide similar counseling, were exempted from this \nsystem and continue to bill Medicare directly. This bill would exempt \nclinical social workers, like their mental health colleagues, from the \nProspective Payment System, and would make sure that clinical social \nworkers are paid for the services they provide to patients in skilled \nnursing facilities. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits \nImprovement and Protection Act addressed some of these concerns, but \nthis legislation would remove the final barrier to ensuring that \nclinical social workers are treated fairly and equitably for the care \nthey provide.\n  This bill is about more than paperwork and payment procedures. This \nbill is about equal access to Medicare payments for the equal and \nimportant work done by clinical social workers. It is also about making \nsure our Nation's most vulnerable citizens have access to quality, \naffordable mental health care. Without clinical social workers, many \nnursing home residents may never get the counseling they need when \nfaced with a life threatening illness or the loss of a loved one. I \nthink we can do better by our nation's seniors, and I'm fighting to \nmake sure we do.\n  The Clinical Social Work Medicare Equity Act of 2003 is strongly \nsupported by the National Association of Social Workers. I ask \nunanimous consent that a letter of endorsement from the National \nAssociation of Social Workers be printed in the Record. I also want to \nthank Senators Johnson, Murray, Stabenow, Corzine, Inouye, and Bingaman \nfor their cosponsorship of this bill. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to enact this important legislation.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                            of Social Workers,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 10, 2003.\n     Hon. Barbara A. Mikulski,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Mikulski: I am writing on behalf of the \n     National Association of Social Workers (NASW), the largest \n     professional social work organization with nearly 150,000 \n     members nationwide. NASW promotes, develops, and protects the \n     effective practice of social work and social workers. NASW \n     also seeks to enhance the well being of individuals, \n     families, and communities through its work, service, and \n     advocacy.\n       NASW strongly supports the Clinical Social Work Medicare \n     Equity Act of 2003 which will end the unfair treatment of \n     clinical social workers under the Medicare Part B Prospective \n     Payment System (PPS) for Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs).\n       Section 4432 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 authorized \n     the creation of the PPS, under which the cost of a variety of \n     daily services provided to SNF patients is bundled into a \n     single amount. Prior to PPS, a separate Medicare Part B claim \n     was filed by the provider for each individual service \n     rendered to a patient. Congress made this change in an \n     attempt to captitate the rapidly rising costs of additional \n     patient services delivered by Medicare providers to SNF \n     patients, with the precise target being physical, \n     occupational, and speech-language therapy services. However, \n     Congress recognized that some services, such as mental health \n     and anesthesia, are best provided on an individual basis \n     rather than as part of the bundle of services. Thus, the \n     following types of providers are specifically excluded from \n     the PPS: physicians, clinical psychologists, certified nurse-\n     midwives, and certified registered nurse anesthetists. \n     Unfortunately, due to an unintentional oversight during the \n     drafting process, clinical social workers were not listed \n     among the aforementioned providers in the legislation.\n       In 1996, Department of Health and Human Services Inspector \n     General June Gibbs Brown published a report entitled ``Mental \n     Health Services in Nursing Facilities''. The purpose of the \n     report was to describe the types of mental health services \n     provided in nursing facilities and identify potential \n     vulnerabilities in the mental health services covered by \n     Medicare. One critical funding of the report was 70% of \n     nursing home respondents stated that permitting clinical \n     social workers and clinical psychologists to bill \n     independently had a beneficial effect on the provision of \n     mental health services in nursing facilities. The Clinical \n     Social Work Medicare Equity will maintain this beneficial \n     effect on SNF patients by ensuring the continuation of direct \n     Medicare billing by clinical social workers for mental health \n     services rendered to SNF patients.\n       Your efforts on behalf of mental health patients and \n     professionals nationwide are greatly appreciated by our \n     members. We thank you for your strong interest in and \n     commitment to this important issue as demonstrated by your \n     sponsorship of the Clinical Social Work Medicare Equity Act.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact Francesca Fierro O'Reilly \n     of my staff at 202-408-8600 x336 should you require anything \n     further. NASW looks forward to working with you on this and \n     future issues of mutual concern.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Elizabeth J. Clark,\n                               PhD, ACSW, MPH, Executive Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 344. A bill expressing the policy of the United States regarding \nthe United States relationship with Native Hawaiians and to provide a \nprocess for the recognition by the United States of the Native Hawaiian \ngoverning entity, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill with my \nfriend and colleague, the senior Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye, which \nwould clarify the political relationship between Native Hawaiians and \nthe United States. This measure would extend the Federal policy of \nself-determination and self-governance to Hawaii's indigenous, native \npeoples--Native Hawaiians, by providing a process for the reorganized \nNative Hawaiian governing entity to be recognized for the purposes of a \ngovernment-to-government relationship with the United States.\n  The bill we introduce today is identical to legislation that was \nreported by the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs during the 107th \nCongress. This bill does three things. First if provides a process for \nFederal recognition of the Native Hawaiian governing entity. Second, it \nestablishes an office within the Department of the Interior to focus on \nNative Hawaiian issues and to serve as a liaison between Native \nHawaiians and the Federal Government. Finally, it establishes an \ninteragency coordinating group to be composed of representatives of \nfederal agencies which administer programs and implement policies \nimpacting Native Hawaiians.\n  While Federal policies towards Native Hawaiians have paralleled that \nof Native American Indians and Alaska Natives, the Federal policy of \nself-determination and self-governance has not yet been extended to \nNative Hawaiians. This measure extends this policy to Native Hawaiians, \nthus furthering the process of reconciliation between Native Hawaiians \nand the United States, and providing parity in the Federal Government's \ninteractions with American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native \nHawaiians.\n  This measure does not establish entitlements or special treatment for \nNative Hawaiians based on race. This measure focuses on the political \nrelationship afforded to Native Hawaiians based on the United States' \nrecognition of Native Hawaiians as the aboriginal, indigenous peoples \nof Hawaii. While the United States' history with its indigenous peoples \nhas been dismal, in recent decades, the United States has engaged in a \npolicy of self-determination and self-governance with its indigenous \npeoples. Government-to-government relationships provide indigenous \npeoples with the opportunity to work directly with the Federal \nGovernment on policies affecting their lands, natural resources and \nmany other aspects of their well-being.\n  This measure does not impact program funding for American Indians and \nAlaska Natives. Federal programs for Native Hawaiian health, education, \nand housing are already administered by\n\n[[Page S2202]]\n\nthe Departments of Health and Human Services, Education, and Housing \nand Urban Development. The bill I introduce today contains a provision \nwhich makes clear that this bill does not authorize new eligibility for \nparticipation in any programs and services provided by the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs. This bill does not authorize gaming in Hawaii. In fact, \nit clearly states that the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, IGRA, does not \napply to the Native Hawaiian governing entity.\n\n  Finally, this measure does not preclude Native Hawaiians from seeking \nalternatives in the international arena. This measure focuses on self-\ndetermination within the framework of Federal law and seeks to \nestablish equality in the Federal policies extended towards American \nIndians, Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians.\n  We introduced similar legislation during the 106th and 107th \nCongresses. A previous version of this legislation was passed by the \nHouse of Representatives during the 106th Congress. The legislation is \nwidely supported by our indigenous brethren, American Indians and \nAlaska Natives. It is also supported by the Hawaii State Legislature \nwhich passed two resolutions supporting a government-to-government \nrelationship between Native Hawaiians and the United States. Similar \nresolutions have been passed by the Alaska Federation of Natives, \nNational Congress of American Indians, Japanese American Citizens' \nLeague, and the National Education Association.\n  The essence of Hawaii is captured not by the physical beauty of its \nislands, but by the beauty of its people. Those who have lived in \nHawaii have a unique demeanor and attitude which is appropriately \ndescribed as the ``aloha'' spirit. The people of Hawaii demonstrate the \naloha spirit through their actions--through their generosity, through \ntheir appreciation of the environment and natural resources, through \ntheir willingness to care for each other, through their genuine \nfriendliness.\n  The people of Hawaii share many ethnic backgrounds and cultures. This \nmix of culture and tradition is based on the unique history of Hawaii. \nThe Aloha spirit is the legacy of the pride we all share in the culture \nand tradition of Hawaii's indigenous, native peoples, the Native \nHawaiians. Hawaii's State motto, ``Ua mau ke'ea `o ka `aina i ka \npono,'' which means ``the life of the land is perpetuated in \nrighteousness,'' captures the culture of Native Hawaiians. Prior to \nwestern contact, Native Hawaiians lived in an advanced society, in \ndistinct and structured communities steeped in science. The Native \nHawaiians honored their `aina, land, and environment, and therefore \ndeveloped methods of irrigation, agriculture, aquaculture, navigation, \nmedicine, fishing and other forms of subsistence whereby the land and \nsea were efficiently used without waste or damage. Respect for the \nenvironment formed the basis of their culture and tradition. It is from \nthis culture and tradition that the Aloha spirit, which is demonstrated \nthroughout Hawaii, by all of its people, has endured and flourished.\n  Despite the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, Native Hawaiians \nnever directly relinquished their inherent sovereignty as a people over \ntheir national lands, either through their government or through a \nplebiscite or referendum. Ever since the overthrow of their government, \nNative Hawaiians have sought to maintain political authority within \ntheir community. The Federal policy of self-governance and self-\ndetermination recognizes and provides for this inherent right within \nFederal law.\n  Throughout my service in the Congress and the Senate, I have worked \nto establish a proper foundation of reconciliation between the United \nStates and Native Hawaiians to positively address longstanding issues \nof concern resulting from the overthrow. The legislation we introduce \ntoday to clarify the political relationship between Native Hawaiians \nand the United States proceeds from our efforts to promote \nreconciliation. This endeavor enjoys overwhelming support from Native \nHawaiians and all the people of Hawaii.\n  In 1978, the people of Hawaii acted to preserve Native Hawaiian \nculture and tradition by amending Hawaii's State constitution to \nestablish the Office of Hawaiian Affairs and to give expression to the \nright of self-determination and self-governance at the State level for \nHawaii's indigenous peoples, Native Hawaiians. Starting with statehood, \nHawaii endeavored to address and protect the rights and concerns of \nHawaii's indigenous peoples in accordance with authority delegated \nunder Federal policy. The constraints of this approach are evident. \nThis bill extends the Federal policy of self-determination and self-\ngovernance to Native Hawaiians at the Federal level through a \ngovernment-to-government relationship with the Native Hawaiian \ngoverning entity.\n  This measure is not being introduced to circumvent the 1999 United \nStates Supreme Court decision in the case of Rice v. Cayeano. The Rice \ncase was a voting rights case whereby the Supreme Court held that the \nState of Hawaii must allow all citizens of Hawaii to vote for the \ntrustees of a quasi-State agency, the Office of Hawaiian Affairs. \nNothing in this legislation would alter the eligibility of the \nelectorate who votes for the Board of Trustees for the Office of \nHawaiian Affairs.\n  This measure is critical to the people of Hawaii because it provides \nthe structure necessary to address many longstanding issues facing \nHawaii's indigenous peoples and the State of Hawaii. By addressing and \nresolving these matters, we continue our process of healing, a process \nof reconciliation not only within the United States, but within the \nState of Hawaii. The time has come for us to be able to address these \ndeeply rooted issues in order for us to be able to move forward as one.\n  I cannot emphasize how important this issue is for the people of \nHawaii. At the state level, I will continue to work with the Hawaii \nState Legislature which has expressed its support for this legislation. \nI will also be working with Governor Linda Lingle, Hawaii's newly \nelected Governor, who has expressed her support for Federal recognition \nfor Native Hawaiians. I look forward to continuing my discussions with \nofficials within the Federal Government to address issues related to \nthis bill, and I continue to welcome input from the people of Hawaii as \nto how we should move forward as a State, and as a community, to \naddress longstanding issues resulting from the overthrow of the Kingdom \nof Hawaii.\n  We have an established record of United States' commitment to \nreconciliation with Native Hawaiians. This legislation is another step \nforward to honoring that commitment. I ask all my colleagues to join me \nin enacting this critical measure for the people of Hawaii.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this measure \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 344\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Constitution vests Congress with the authority to \n     address the conditions of the indigenous, native people of \n     the United States.\n       (2) Native Hawaiians, the native people of the Hawaiian \n     archipelago which is now part of the United States, are \n     indigenous, native people of the United States.\n       (3) The United States has a special trust relationship to \n     promote the welfare of the native people of the United \n     States, including Native Hawaiians.\n       (4) Under the treaty making power of the United States, \n     Congress exercised its constitutional authority to confirm a \n     treaty between the United States and the government that \n     represented the Hawaiian people, and from 1826 until 1893, \n     the United States recognized the independence of the Kingdom \n     of Hawaii, extended full diplomatic recognition to the \n     Hawaiian Government, and entered into treaties and \n     conventions with the Hawaiian monarchs to govern commerce and \n     navigation in 1826, 1842, 1849, 1875, and 1887.\n       (5) Pursuant to the provisions of the Hawaiian Homes \n     Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108, chapter 42), the United \n     States set aside 203,500 acres of land in the Federal \n     territory that later became the State of Hawaii to address \n     the conditions of Native Hawaiians.\n       (6) By setting aside 203,500 acres of land for Native \n     Hawaiian homesteads and farms, the Act assists the Native \n     Hawaiian community in maintaining distinct native settlements \n     throughout the State of Hawaii.\n       (7) Approximately 6,800 Native Hawaiian lessees and their \n     family members reside on Hawaiian Home Lands and \n     approximately 18,000 Native Hawaiians who are eligible to \n     reside on the Home Lands are on a waiting list to receive \n     assignments of land.\n       (8) In 1959, as part of the compact admitting Hawaii into \n     the United States, Congress\n\n[[Page S2203]]\n\n     established the Ceded Lands Trust for 5 purposes, 1 of which \n     is the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians. Such \n     trust consists of approximately 1,800,000 acres of land, \n     submerged lands, and the revenues derived from such lands, \n     the assets of which have never been completely inventoried or \n     segregated.\n       (9) Throughout the years, Native Hawaiians have repeatedly \n     sought access to the Ceded Lands Trust and its resources and \n     revenues in order to establish and maintain native \n     settlements and distinct native communities throughout the \n     State.\n       (10) The Hawaiian Home Lands and the Ceded Lands provide an \n     important foundation for the ability of the Native Hawaiian \n     community to maintain the practice of Native Hawaiian \n     culture, language, and traditions, and for the survival of \n     the Native Hawaiian people.\n       (11) Native Hawaiians have maintained other distinctly \n     native areas in Hawaii.\n       (12) On November 23, 1993, Public Law 103-150 (107 Stat. \n     1510) (commonly known as the Apology Resolution) was enacted \n     into law, extending an apology on behalf of the United States \n     to the Native people of Hawaii for the United States role in \n     the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii.\n       (13) The Apology Resolution acknowledges that the overthrow \n     of the Kingdom of Hawaii occurred with the active \n     participation of agents and citizens of the United States and \n     further acknowledges that the Native Hawaiian people never \n     directly relinquished their claims to their inherent \n     sovereignty as a people over their national lands to the \n     United States, either through their monarchy or through a \n     plebiscite or referendum.\n       (14) The Apology Resolution expresses the commitment of \n     Congress and the President to acknowledge the ramifications \n     of the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii and to support \n     reconciliation efforts between the United States and Native \n     Hawaiians; and to have Congress and the President, through \n     the President's designated officials, consult with Native \n     Hawaiians on the reconciliation process as called for under \n     the Apology Resolution.\n       (15) Despite the overthrow of the Hawaiian Government, \n     Native Hawaiians have continued to maintain their separate \n     identity as a distinct native community through the formation \n     of cultural, social, and political institutions, and to give \n     expression to their rights as native people to self-\n     determination and self-governance as evidenced through their \n     participation in the Office of Hawaiian Affairs.\n       (16) Native Hawaiians also give expression to their rights \n     as native people to self-determination and self-governance \n     through the provision of governmental services to Native \n     Hawaiians, including the provision of health care services, \n     educational programs, employment and training programs, \n     children's services, conservation programs, fish and wildlife \n     protection, agricultural programs, native language immersion \n     programs and native language immersion schools from \n     kindergarten through high school, as well as college and \n     master's degree programs in native language immersion \n     instruction, and traditional justice programs, and by \n     continuing their efforts to enhance Native Hawaiian self-\n     determination and local control.\n       (17) Native Hawaiians are actively engaged in Native \n     Hawaiian cultural practices, traditional agricultural \n     methods, fishing and subsistence practices, maintenance of \n     cultural use areas and sacred sites, protection of burial \n     sites, and the exercise of their traditional rights to gather \n     medicinal plants and herbs, and food sources.\n       (18) The Native Hawaiian people wish to preserve, develop, \n     and transmit to future Native Hawaiian generations their \n     ancestral lands and Native Hawaiian political and cultural \n     identity in accordance with their traditions, beliefs, \n     customs and practices, language, and social and political \n     institutions, and to achieve greater self-determination over \n     their own affairs.\n       (19) This Act provides for a process within the framework \n     of Federal law for the Native Hawaiian people to exercise \n     their inherent rights as a distinct aboriginal, indigenous, \n     native community to reorganize a Native Hawaiian governing \n     entity for the purpose of giving expression to their rights \n     as native people to self-determination and self-governance.\n       (20) The United States has declared that--\n       (A) the United States has a special responsibility for the \n     welfare of the native peoples of the United States, including \n     Native Hawaiians;\n       (B) Congress has identified Native Hawaiians as a distinct \n     indigenous group within the scope of its Indian affairs \n     power, and has enacted dozens of statutes on their behalf \n     pursuant to its recognized trust responsibility; and\n       (C) Congress has also delegated broad authority to \n     administer a portion of the Federal trust responsibility to \n     the State of Hawaii.\n       (21) The United States has recognized and reaffirmed the \n     special trust relationship with the Native Hawaiian people \n     through the enactment of the Act entitled ``An Act to provide \n     for the admission of the State of Hawaii into the Union'', \n     approved March 18, 1959 (Public Law 86-3; 73 Stat. 4) by--\n       (A) ceding to the State of Hawaii title to the public lands \n     formerly held by the United States, and mandating that those \n     lands be held in public trust for 5 purposes, one of which is \n     for the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians; and\n       (B) transferring the United States responsibility for the \n     administration of the Hawaiian Home Lands to the State of \n     Hawaii, but retaining the authority to enforce the trust, \n     including the exclusive right of the United States to consent \n     to any actions affecting the lands which comprise the corpus \n     of the trust and any amendments to the Hawaiian Homes \n     Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108, chapter 42) that are \n     enacted by the legislature of the State of Hawaii affecting \n     the beneficiaries under the Act.\n       (22) The United States continually has recognized and \n     reaffirmed that--\n       (A) Native Hawaiians have a cultural, historic, and land-\n     based link to the aboriginal, native people who exercised \n     sovereignty over the Hawaiian Islands;\n       (B) Native Hawaiians have never relinquished their claims \n     to sovereignty or their sovereign lands;\n       (C) the United States extends services to Native Hawaiians \n     because of their unique status as the aboriginal, native \n     people of a once sovereign nation with whom the United States \n     has a political and legal relationship; and\n       (D) the special trust relationship of American Indians, \n     Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians to the United States \n     arises out of their status as aboriginal, indigenous, native \n     people of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend the title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprohibit physicians and other health care practitioners from charging \nmembership or other incidental fee (or requiring purchase of other \nitems or services) as a prerequisite for the provision of an item or \nservice to a medicare beneficiary; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nEqual Access to Medicare Act to combat the growing practice of \n``concierge care'' medical practices. As my colleagues may recall I \nintroduced similar legislation last Congress to deal with the growing \nproblem of doctors shutting down their practices and opening new ones, \nonly accepting those patients willing to pay a membership fee. These \nfees range from $1,500 to $20,000 annually. By charging these dues, or \nrequiring patients to purchase non-Medicare covered services, doctors \nhave been able to shrink their patient load and maintain high profit \nmargins while continuing to bill Medicare, all on the backs of low- and \nmiddle-income beneficiaries.\n  This is a dangerous model that causes significant disparities in the \ncare available to Medicare beneficiaries. A doctor receiving Medicare \nreimbursement should not be allowed to turn away those Medicare \nbeneficiaries who cannot, or choose not to pay a membership fee. My \nbill simply prevents Medicare from reimbursing doctors who charge \nmembership fees or require the purchase of non-Medicare covered \nservices as a condition for the provision of care.\n  Since the introduction of this bill in 2001, the practice has been \nrapidly expanding with versions in many states. As an increasing number \nof Medicare beneficiaries voice their concerns, it is time for Congress \nto act. I hope that as we debate Medicare modernization this year, \nCongress will agree to put an end to this egregious practice.\n  In addition to the concerns of seniors, health care advocacy groups \nhave begun to weigh in as well. Both the American Academy of Family \nPhysicians and the American Medical Association have expressed concern \nabout the ``. . . risks associated with the spread of this model'', \nAMA, June 2002 report. Should this practice proliferate, a doctor \nshortage for low- and middle-income Medicare beneficiaries is likely, \nexacerbating an already ailing health care marketplace.\n  I must emphasize: this bill does not interfere with a doctor's \nability to set up a practice with a limited number of patients while \nremaining adequately compensated. Nor would doctors who participate in \nMedicare be prevented from contracting privately with patients for non-\nMedicare covered services. It simply provides that doctors who \nparticipate in the Medicare program may not select patients based upon \nwillingness or ability to pay a fee for other services. This is the \nsame standard that private insurance companies apply to their \nproviders.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in helping Medicare keep its \npromise of accessibility to seniors who have paid a lifetime of \n``premiums.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 345\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act \nto establish a governmentwide policy requiring competition in certain \nexecutive agency procurements; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Craig \nThomas in introducing the Federal Prison Industries Competition in \nContracting Act. Our bill is based on a straightforward premise: it is \nunfair for Federal Prison Industries to deny businesses in the private \nsector an opportunity to compete for sales to their own government.\n  I repeat: the bill that we are introducing today, it enacted, would \ndo nothing more than permit private sector companies to compete for \nFederal contracts that are paid for with their dollars. It may seem \nincredible that they are denied this opportunity today, but that is the \nlaw, because if Federal Prison Industries says that it wants a \ncontract, it gets that contract, regardless whether a company in the \nprivate sector may offer to provide the product better, cheaper, or \nfaster.\n  We have made considerable progress on this issue since Senator Thomas \nand I introduced a similar bill in the 107th congress. Two years ago, \nthe Senate voted 74-24 to end Federal Prison Industries' monopoly on \nDepartment of Defense contracts. Not only was that provision enacted \ninto law, we were able to strengthen it with a second provision in last \nyear's defense bill.\n  Despite this progress, much work remains to be done. As of today, \nFederal Prison Industries retains its monopoly on the contracts of \nevery agency of the Federal Government, other than the Department of \nDefense. This means that all other Federal agencies, including the new \nDepartment of Homeland Security, may be required to purchase products \nfrom Federal Prison Industries. It also means that private sector \ncompanies may find it impossible to sell their products to their own \ngovernment, even when their products outperform FPI products in terms \nof price, quality and time of delivery.\n  The bill that we are introducing today would not limit the ability of \nFederal Prison Industries to sell its products to Federal agencies. It \nwould simply say that these sales should be made on a competitive, \nrather than a sole-source basis.\n  FPI starts with a significant advantage in any competition with the \nprivate sector, since FPI pays inmates less than two dollars an hour, \nfar below the minimum wage and a small fraction of the wage paid to \nmost private sector workers in competing industries. And of course, the \ntaxpayers provide a direct subsidy to Federal Prison Industries \nproducts by picking up the cost of feeding, clothing, and housing the \ninmates who provide the labor. Given those advantages, there is no \nreason why we should still require Federal agencies to purchase \nproducts from FPI even when they are more expensive or of a lower \nquality than competing commercial items. I can think of no reason why \nprivate industry should be prohibited from competing for these federal \nagency contracts.\n\n  We have made several changes to this bill since it was introduced in \nthe 107th Congress. The new bill has been harmonized with the \nprovisions that we have already enacted for the Department of Defense, \nto ensure that we will have a single, government-wide procurement \npolicy for agencies purchasing products available from Federal Prison \nindustries. This government-wide policy would be codified in the Office \nof Federal Procurement Policy Act, which is the primary procurement \nstatute that applies to both defense and non-defense agencies. I \nbelieve that these changes will strengthen the bill and reinforce its \nunderlying intent.\n\n[[Page S2206]]\n\n  Federal Prison Industries has repeatedly claimed that it provides a \nquality product at a price that is competitive with current market \nprices. Indeed, the Federal Prison Industries statute requires them to \ndo so. That statute states that FPI may provide to Federal agencies \nproducts that ``meet their requirements'' at prices that do not \n``exceed current market prices''.\n  Yet, FPI remains unwilling to compete with private sector businesses \nand their employees, or even to permit federal agencies to compare \ntheir products and prices with those available in the private sector. \nIndeed, FPI has tried to prohibit Federal agencies from conducting \nmarket research, as they would ordinarily do, to determine whether the \nprice and quality or FPI products is comparable to what is available in \nthe commercial marketplace. Instead, Federal agencies are directed to \ncontact FPI, which acts as the sole arbiter of whether the product \nmeets the agency's requirements.\n  The result is totally and understandably frustrating to private \nsector businesses and their employees who are denied an opportunity to \ncompete for Federal business, as well as to the Federal agencies who \nare forced to buy FPI products. The frustration of these businesses \ncomes through in a series of letters that were placed in the record of \na House Small Business Committee hearing in the last Congress. One \nletter stated with regard to UNICOR--the trade name used by Federal \nPrison Industries:\n\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: My name is Billy Carroll; I am an \n     outside sales representatives with C Office Supply Co. in \n     Biloxi Mississippi. Our company has been in business for over \n     20 years and we employ 20 people.\n       During the course of our 20-year history we have done \n     considerable business with numerous governmental agencies and \n     military installations. Some of them being Naval Construction \n     Battalion in Gulfport, Mississippi; Air National Guard in \n     Gulfport; Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi; Naval Station in \n     Pascagoula; and NASA in Stennis Space Center.\n       As a result of FPI's unfair monopolistic practices, we have \n     seen sales from these governmental agencies go from \n     $100,000.00 a month to less than $5,000 a month.\n       There are numerous horror stories we hear from our \n     customers who deal with UNICOR. The most recent one being \n     that a customer had to wait 5 months to get their furniture. \n     When the furniture finally arrived, it wasn't even what they \n     had ordered. This is something that would have been averted \n     had they been able to use our company or another dealer.\n       I could go on about how we could have sold the product much \n     cheaper, which would have saved taxpayers money, faster \n     delivery, which would have increased productivity, and \n     finally better service, but I won't. You get the picture.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Billy Carroll,\n                            C Office Supply Company, Biloxi, MS.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Other vendors expressed even greater frustration about \nFPI's unfair business practices:\n\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: During the past 5 years I have had \n     representatives from UNICOR tell my customers that they had \n     to turn over my proprietary designs to UNICOR, without \n     payment to the dealership. They have told my customers that \n     if they do not buy UNICOR, they will be `reported to \n     congress' and that there is no place else to go for \n     government furniture. They frighten young department of \n     defense officials with words like `illegal' when they ask \n     about waivers.\n       The UNICOR reps routinely refuse waivers on the first \n     approach. The answer is a standard `UNICOR has products which \n     will meet your needs.' No explanation. They refuse to answer \n     waiver requests in a timely fashion. I have had a $110,000 \n     order for the Arizona Air National Guard in Tucson literally \n     taken away by UNICOR. The representative demanded the designs \n     and said that UNICOR would fill the request. There would be \n     no waiver and no discussion. And she was right. Despite the \n     fact that all of the programming phase had been completed by \n     my designers, at no cost to the federal government, this rep \n     insisted that she knew what was best for this customer. Of \n     course, the products arrived late, in poor condition, was \n     much more expensive than the budgeted GSA furniture--and the \n     reps have not been heard from. The answer is `a 10% discount' \n     or a `free chair.'\n       In Texas, my representative worked for 4 months with a \n     customer, completing designs and meeting all relevant \n     criteria. She proposed only products on GSA contract. UNICOR \n     unilaterally refused to waive the chairs, approximately \n     $50,000 worth, because their factories were not at capacity. \n     The fact that the UNICOR chairs do not meet the price point, \n     that UNICOR spent no time with the customers determining \n     function, color or other requirements has no meaning. The \n     seating portion of the order is lost. The remaining portion \n     would have been lost, as well, if the customer had not spent \n     approximately 30 days going from one appeal process to the \n     other attempting to get waivers. Very few customers will take \n     the time to do this. Of course, when the project finally \n     arrives, it will be late and missions will be compromised.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Ruthanne S. Pitts,\n\n                                     Simmons Contract Furnishings,\n     Tucson, Arizona.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I personally worked with the staff who \n     had just moved into a new ward at Walter Reed Army Medical \n     Center. We had two meetings during which I took measurements \n     and went over in great detail the furniture items they needed \n     for the report room, reception area, patient education room, \n     two offices and some miscellaneous shelving. The total I \n     quoted to Walter Reed was approximately $13,000 and met their \n     needs exactly. This was in April of 2000. Our delivery would \n     have been completed within a month.\n       Because Walter Reed couldn't get a UNICOR waiver (just to \n     determine this fact takes at least 6 weeks) the order was \n     placed with UNICOR and took eight months to be delivered (it \n     just showed up last week) and much of it was not what \n     officials at Walter Reed even ordered. FPI tells their \n     customers what the customer can have rather than meeting the \n     needs of the customer. As an example, we had designed a \n     workstation for the report room to accommodate four \n     computers. UNICOR sent an expensive, massive cherry \n     workstation for an executive office that had to be put in \n     someone's office (who didn't need new furniture) because it \n     was unusable where it was supposed to go. UNICOR charged an \n     additional $1,500.00 to assemble this (and didn't have proper \n     tools to finish the assembly). Our price for the proper item \n     including all set up was less than they charged for set-up \n     alone.\n       You know, it's not just the impact FPI has on our \n     businesses, it's the waste of everybody's tax dollars when \n     furniture costs more and doesn't even do the job.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Diane Lake,\n     Economy Office Products, Inc. Fairfax, VA.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am concerned in the way taxpayers' \n     money is being wasted. A few years ago I had proposed over \n     $100,000.00 in chairs to the VA Medical Center. They were \n     excited about the chair I was proposing on contract. The \n     chair was less expensive than the chair proposed by FPI. The \n     customer also recognized that the chair I was proposing was \n     better in quality and had more ergonomic features, which \n     would assist in some of their health issues. Another comment \n     made by the VA was the problem with the FPI chairs breaking \n     easily. Parts were near impossible to get, so they would \n     throw the FPI chair in the garbage.\n       In this situation FPI denied the VA waiver. Regretfully \n     they had to buy FPI chairs. I can not believe this happens in \n     America.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Rick Buchholz,\n                                Christianson's Business Furniture.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. These letters are far from unique. In case after case, \nFederal Prison Industries insists on taking contracts away from private \nbusinesses, even where FPI's products are inferior, their prices are \nhigher, and they are not prepared to deliver in a timely manner. This \nis wrong.\n  Avoiding competition is the easy way out, but it isn't the right way \nfor FPI, it isn't the right way for the private sector workers whose \njobs FPI is taking, and it isn't the right way for Federal agencies, \nwhich too often get stuck with the bill for inferior products that \ncan't compete with private sector goods. Competition will be better for \nFederal agencies, better for the taxpayer, and better for working men \nand women around the country.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join Senator Levin \nin introducing a bill that will further my efforts to limit government \ncompetition with the private sector. Senator Levin and I propose to \neliminate the mandatory contracting requirement that Federal agencies \nare subject to when it comes to products made by the Federal Prison \nIndustries, FPI. Under law, all Federal agencies, except the Department \nof Defense, are required to purchase products made by the FPI. Simply \nput, this bill will require the FPI to compete with the private sector \nfor Federal contracts.\n  Currently, the FPI employs approximately 22,000 Federal prisoners or \nroughly 20 percent of all Federal prisoners. These prisoners are \nresponsible for producing a diverse range of products for the FPI, \nranging from office furniture to clothing. The remaining 80 percent of \nFederal prisoners, who work, do so in and around Federal prisons.\n  While Senator Levin and I believe that it is important to keep \nprisoners working, we do not believe that this effort should unduly \nharm or conflict with law-abiding businesses. This bill seeks to \nminimize the unfair competition that private sector companies face with \nthe FPI.\n\n[[Page S2207]]\n\n  The FPI's mandatory source requirement not only undercuts private \nbusiness throughout America, but its mandatory source preference \noftentimes costs American taxpayers more money. I believe American \ntaxpayers would be alarmed to learn of the preferential treatment that \nthe FPI enjoys when it comes to Federal contracts.\n  As I said before, Senator Levin and I support the goal of keeping \nprisoners busy while serving their time in prison. However, if we allow \ncompetition in Federal contracts, the FPI will be required to focus its \nefforts in product areas that don't unfairly compete with the private \nsector. Clearly, competitive bidding is a reasonable process that will \nensure taxpayer's dollars are being spent justly.\n  Of particular note, our bill allows contracting officers, within each \nFederal agency, the ability to use competitive procedures for the \nprocurement of products. This approach allows Federal agencies to \nselect the FPI contracts if he/she believes that the FPI can meet that \nparticularly agency's requirements and the product is offered at a fair \nand reasonable price. The above outlined provision in our bill seeks to \nplace the control of government procurement in the hands of contracting \nofficers, rather than in the hands of the FPI.\n  In addition to establishing a competitive procedure for the \nprocurement of products, we include a provision that allows the \nAttorney General to grant a waiver to this process if a particular \ncontract is deemed essential to the safety and effective administration \nof a particular prison.\n  I am confident that by allowing competition for government contracts \nour bill will save tax dollars. As Congress looks for additional cost \nsaving practices, the elimination of the FPI's mandatory source \npreference will bring about numerous improvements, not just in cost \nsavings, but also in streamlining of the FPI's products.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 347. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior and the \nSecretary of Agriculture to conduct a joint special resources study to \nevaluate the suitability and feasibility of establishing the Rim of the \nValley Corridor as a unit of the Santa Monica Mountains National \nRecreation Area, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this bill \ntoday to direct the Interior Secretary to conduct a study to evaluate \nthe suitability and feasibility of expanding the Santa Monica National \nRecreation Area to include the Rim of the Valley Corridor.\n  The Rim of the Valley Corridor encircles the San Fernando Valley, La \nCrescenta, Simi, Santa Clarita, Conejo Valleys, consisting of parts of \nthe Santa Monica Mountains, Santa Susanna Mountains, San Gabriel \nMountains, Verdugo Mountains, San Rafael Hills and connects to the \nadjacent Los Padres and San Bernardino National Forests.\n  This parcel of land is unique because of its rare Mediterranean \necosystem and wildlife corridor that stretches north from the Santa \nMonicas. With the population growth forecasted to multiply \nexponentially over the next several decades, the need for parks to \nbalance out the expected population growth has become critical in \nCalifornia.\n  Since the creation of the Santa Monica Recreation Area in 1978, \nFederal, State, and local authorities have worked successfully together \nto create and maintain the highly successful Santa Monica Mountains \nNational Recreation Area, the world's largest urban park, hemmed in on \nall sides by development.\n  Park and recreational lands provide people with a vital refuge from \nurban life while preserving valuable habitat and wildlife. With the \npassage of this legislation, Congress will hold true to its original \ncommitment to preserve the scenic, natural, and historic setting of the \nSanta Monica Mountains Recreation Area. With the inclusion of the Rim \nof the Valley Corridor in Santa Monica Mountains Recreation Area, \ngreater ecological health and diversity will be promoted, particularly \nfor larger animals like mountain lions, bobcats, and the golden eagle.\n  After the study called for in this bill is complete, the Secretary of \nthe Interior and Congress will be in a key position to determine \nwhether the Rim of the Valley warrants national park status.\n  This bill enjoys strong support from local and State officials and I \nhope that it will have as much strong bipartisan support this Congress, \nas it did last Congress. Congressman Adam Schiff plans to introduce \ncompanion legislation for this bill in the House and I applaud his \ncommitment to this issue.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mr. Biden, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Bayh, Mr. \n        Smith, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 348.

Mr. President, I am pleased once again to join my \ncolleague from New York, Senator Schumer, to talk about a bill that \nwill help American families afford their children's college tuition. \nThe bill we are reintroducing today, the Make College Affordable Act, \nwill make up to $12,000 in college tuition tax deductible each year, \nwhile providing graduates with a tax credit to reduce the cost of their \nstudent loans.\n  With the average college graduate earning 80 percent more than the \naverage non-college, high school graduate, it is abundantly clear that \nin today's economy a college degree is an absolute necessity. When I \nwent to college, it cost about $1,000 a year. That meant, for a family \nmaking about $12,000 a year, the cost of college was about 6 or 7 \npercent of that family's income. Today the average cost of room, board \nand tuition at a four-year public college has jumped to over $9,000 a \nyear. The average cost of room, board and tuition at a private four-\nyear college has jumped to over $25,000. What does this mean? This \nmeans that hard working American families are spending a larger \npercentage of their income than ever before to send their children to \nschool. To attend my alma mater, the University of Delaware, it costs \nnearly 20 percent of a Delaware family's average annual income to cover \ncosts. If that same family wants to send their child to a private \nuniversity, approximately 50 percent of their income is required. This \nmeans that the average American family is likely to spend just as much, \nif not more, on their child's tuition as they are to pay in annual \nmortgage payments.\n  I have said it before. How can we expect families to dream of a \nbetter and brighter future for their children, when the cost of \nattending even some public universities rivals their home mortgage \npayments? We can't.\n  That is why in 1995, I first offered an amendment to permit a $10,000 \ntuition tax deduction. That is why in 1996 and 1997, I introduced my \nGET AHEAD bill which would have provided students and their families \nwith scholarships, tax deductions, and college savings plans. We've \nmade some good progress. A number of initiatives were incorporated into \nthe 1997 tax bill. Today families have available to them the Hope \nScholarship--a tax credit of up to $1,500 for the first two years of \ncollege, and the Lifetime Learning Credit--which permits a 20 percent \ntax credit on up to $10,000 worth of higher education expenses. \nStudents can also claim a tax deduction for interest on student loans, \nhave the opportunity to consolidate their student loans at low interest \nrates and beginning in 2001, have had the chance to deduct up to $3,000 \nin tuition expenses from their Federal income tax.\n  And yet, we can and should do more to help qualified students attend \nthe college of their dreams. This is why I introduced my Tuition \nAssistance for Families Act in January. This bill would expand current \ntuition tax credits, provide merit scholarships to graduating seniors, \nincrease the maximum Pell Grant and raise the tuition tax deduction \nmuch like the bill before us today.\n  I join my friend from New York today to introduce the Make College \nAffordable Act because it will allow most taxpayers to take up to a \n$12,000 tax deduction each year for college tuition and fees. For some \nfamilies this would amount to a tax savings of more than $3,000 each \nyear--$3,000 that can go toward their children's doctor visits, \nretirement savings, child care costs and yes, toward their annual \nmortgage payment.\n  In addition to the tax deduction, the Schumer-Biden bill will provide \na tax credit of up to $1,500 for the interest paid on student loans \nover the first five years of repayment. This credit will be available \nto individuals with incomes of up to $50,000, and families with incomes \nup to $100,000. When one considers that the average graduate is $16,928 \nin debt, you can imagine how quickly interest payments add up each \nyear.\n  We are hearing a great deal these days about tax cuts. How we choose \nto provide them, and who we choose to provide them to, is a reflection \nof our nation's priorities and values. What greater priority could \nthere be than providing our children with a first class education. \nLet's be smart about our investments when considering the tax proposals \nthat come before us. Let's help families provide their children with a \nbetter life through the promise of a college education. And let's not \nforget that the Make College Affordable Act will not only ensure a \nbrighter future for all our children, it will help to guarantee an \neducated and prosperous America down the road.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Ms. Collins, Ms. Landrieu, Ms. \n        Snowe, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Allen, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Dayton, and Mr. \n        Bunning):\n\n[[Page S2209]]\n\n  S. 349. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to repeal \nthe Government pension offset and windfall elimination provisions; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, \nSenator Collins, to introduce legislation to repeal two provisions of \ncurrent law that reduce earned Social Security benefits for teachers \nand other government pensioners--the Windfall Elimination, WEP, \nprovision, and the Government Pension Offset, GPO, provision.\n  Under current law, public employees, whose salaries are often lower \nthan those in the private sector to begin with, find that they are \npenalized and held to a different standard when it comes to retirement \nbenefits. The unfair reduction in their benefits makes it more \ndifficult to recruit teachers, police officers, and fire fighters.\n  The Social Security Windfall Elimination Provision reduces Social \nSecurity benefits for retirees who paid into Social Security and also \nreceive a government pension, such as from a teacher retirement fund. \nPrivate sector retirees receive monthly Social Security checks equal to \n90 percent of their first $561 in average monthly career earnings, plus \n32 percent of monthly earnings up to $3,381 and 15 percent of earnings \nabove $3,381. Government pensioners, however, are only allowed to \nreceive 40 percent of the first $561 in career monthly earnings, a \npenalty of $280.50 per month.\n  To my mind it is simply unfair, especially at a time when we need to \nbe doing all we can to attract qualified people to government service, \nand my legislation will allow government pensioners the chance to earn \nthe same 90 percent to which non-government pension recipients are \nentitled.\n  The current Government Pension Offset provision reduces Social \nSecurity spousal benefits by an amount equal to two-thirds of the \nspouse's public employment civil service pension. This can have the \neffect of taking away, entirely, a spouse's benefits from Social \nSecurity.\n  It is beyond my understanding why we would want to discourage people \nfrom pursuing careers in public service by essentially saying that if \nyou do enter public service, your family will suffer by not being able \nto receive the full retirement benefits they would otherwise be \nentitled to.\n  Record enrollments in public schools and the projected retirements of \nthousands of veteran teachers are driving an urgent need for teacher \nrecruitment. Critical efforts to reduce class sizes also necessitate \nhiring additional teachers. It is estimated that schools will need to \nhire between 2.2 and 2.7 million new teachers nationwide by 2009.\n  California has 284,030 teachers currently, but will need to hire an \nadditional 300,000 teachers by 2010 to keep up with California's rate \nof student enrollment, which is three times the national average. All \nin all, California has to hire 26,000 new teachers every year.\n  To combat the growing teacher shortage crisis, forty-five States and \nthe District of Columbia now offer ``alternate routes'' for \ncertification to teach in the Nation's public schools. It is a sad \nirony that policymakers are encouraging experienced people to change \ncareers and enter the teaching profession at the same time that \nindividuals who have worked in other careers are less likely to want to \nbecome teachers if doing so will affect Social Security benefits they \nworked so hard to earn.\n  Almost 300,000 government retirees nationwide are affected by the GPO \nand the WEP, but their impact is greatest in the 13 states that chose \nto keep their own public employee retirement systems, including \nCalifornia. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the GPO \nreduces benefits for some 200,000 individuals by more than $3,600 a \nyear. The WEP causes already low-paid public employees outside the \nSocial Security system, like teachers, firefighters and police \nofficers, to lose up to sixty percent of the Social Security benefits \nto which they are entitled. Ironically, the loss of Social Security \nbenefits may make these individuals eligible for more costly \nassistance, such as food stamps.\n  The reforms that led to the GPO and the WEP are almost 20 years old. \nAt the time they were enacted, I'm sure they seemed like a good idea. \nNow that we are witnessing the practical effects of those reforms, I \nhope that Congress will pass legislation to address the unfair \nreduction of benefits that make it even more difficult to recruit and \nretain public employees.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague \nfrom California, Senator Feinstein, in introducing the Social Security \nFairness Act, which repeals two provisions of current law--the windfall \nelimination provision, WEP, and the government pension offset, GPO--\nthat unfairly reduce earned Social Security benefits for many public \nemployees. This legislation is of tremendous importance to Maine's \nteachers, police officers, firefighters and other public employees who \ncurrently are unfairly penalized for working in the private sector when \nthe time comes for them to retire.\n  Despite their challenging, difficult and sometimes dangerous jobs, \nthese invaluable public servants often receive far lower salaries than \nprivate sector employees. It is therefore doubly unfair to penalize \nthem and hold them to a different standard when it comes to their \nSocial Security retirement benefits.\n  Moreover, at a time when we should be doing all that we can to \nattract qualified people to public service, this unfair reduction in \nSocial Security benefits makes it even more difficult for our \ncommunities to recruit and retain the teachers, police officers, \nfirefighters, and other public employees who are so critical to the \nsafety and well-being of our families.\n  The government pension offset and windfall elimination provisions \naffect government employees and retirees in virtually every State, but \ntheir effect is most acute in Maine and 14 other States where most \npublic employees are not covered by Social Security. Nationwide, more \nthan one-third of teachers and school employees, and more than one-\nfifth of other public employees, are not covered by Social Security. \nApproximately 250,000 retired Federal, State and local government \nemployees across the country have already been adversely affected by \nthese provisions. Thousands more stand to be affected in the future.\n  The Social Security windfall elimination provision reduces Social \nSecurity benefits for retirees who paid into Social Security and who \nalso receive a government pension from work not covered under Social \nSecurity, such as pensions from the Maine State Retirement Fund. While \nprivate sector retirees receive monthly Social Security checks equal to \n90 percent of their first $561 in average monthly career earnings, \ngovernment pensioners are only allowed to receive 40 percent--a harsh \nand unjust penalty of $280.50 per month.\n  The government pension offset reduces an individual's survivor \nbenefit under Social Security by two-thirds of the amount of his or her \npublic pension. Estimates indicate that 9 out of 10 public employees \naffected by the GPO lose their entire spousal benefit, even though \ntheir deceased spouses paid Social Security taxes for many years.\n  This offset is, unfortunately, most harsh for those who can least \nafford the loss: lower-income women. According to the Congressional \nBudget Office, the GPO reduces benefits for some 200,000 individuals by \nmore than $3,600 a year--an amount that can make the difference between \na comfortable retirement and poverty.\n  This simply is not fair and not right. Our teachers and other public \nemployees face difficult enough challenges in their day-to-day work. \nIndividuals who have devoted their lives to public service should not \nhave the added burden of worrying about their retirement, and these two \nonerous provisions should be repealed.\n  This is an issue that I have heard about at the grocery store, at my \nchurch, and even at my 30th high school class reunion from my many \nfriends who have entered the teaching profession and who are committed \nto living and working in Maine. They love their jobs and the children \nthey teach, but they worry about the future and about their financial \nsecurity in retirement.\n  I also hear a lot about this issue in my constituent mail. Patricia \nDupont, for example, of Orland, ME, wrote that, because she taught for \n15 years under\n\n[[Page S2210]]\n\nSocial Security in New Hampshire, she is living on a retirement income \nof less than $13,000 after 45 years of teaching. Since she also lost \nsurvivors' benefits from her husband's Social Security, she calculates \nthat a repeal of the WEP and GPO would double her current retirement \nincome.\n  Wendy Lessard, an English teacher at Mt. Desert Island High School, \nis an example of another unfortunate consequence of the laws. After 10 \nyears of teaching, she is now considering whether or not to continue \nher career because of the Social Security penalties associated with her \nteacher's pension. She tells me that she has worked vacations in her \nsummers and off-hours to be able to make a better wage and pay back her \nstudent loans. She is just the kind of teacher we want teaching our \nstudents, but is now contemplating leaving the profession because of \nher concerns about financial security in retirement.\n  Moreover, these provisions also penalize private sector employees who \nleave their jobs to become public school teachers. Ruth Wilson, a \nteacher from Otisfield, ME, wrote:\n\n       I entered the teaching profession two years ago, partly in \n     response to the nationwide pleas for educators. As the \n     current pool of educators near retirement in the next few \n     years, our schools face a crisis. Low wages and long hard \n     hours are not great selling points to young students when \n     selecting a career.\n       I love teaching and only regretted my decision when I found \n     out about the penalties I will unfairly suffer. In my former \n     life as a well-paid systems manager at State Street Bank in \n     Boston, I contributed the maximum to Social Security each \n     year. When I decided to become an educator, I figured that \n     because of my many years of maximum Social Security \n     contributions, I would still have a livable retirement \n     ``wage.'' I was unaware that I would be penalized as an \n     educator in your State.\n\n  Maine, like many States, is currently facing a serious shortage of \nteachers, and we simply cannot afford to discourage people from \npursuing important careers in public service in this way. I am \ntherefore pleased to join Senator Feinstein in introducing this \nlegislation to repeal these two unfair provisions, and I urge my \ncolleagues to join us as cosponsors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Edwards, \n        Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Reid, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. \n        Corzine):\n  S. 352. A bill to ensure that commercial insurers cannot engage in \nprice fixing, bid rigging, or market allocations to the detriment of \ncompetition and consumers; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \n``Medical Malpractice Insurance Antitrust Act of 2003'' along with \nSenators Kennedy, Durbin, Edwards, Rockefeller, Reid, Boxer, Feingold, \nand Corzine. In the deafening debate about medical malpractice, I \nbelieve this legislation is a clear and calm statement about fixing one \nsignificant part of the system that is broken--skyrocketing insurance \npremiums for medical malpractice.\n  Our health care system is in crisis. We have heard that statement so \noften that it has begun to lose the force of its truth, but that truth \nis one we must confront and the crisis is one we must abate.\n  Unfortunately, dramatically rising medical malpractice insurance \nrates are forcing some doctors to abandon their practices or to cross \nState lines to find more affordable situations. Patients who need care \nin high-risk specialties--like obstetrics--and patients in areas \nalready under-served by health care providers--like many rural \ncommunities--are too often left without adequate care.\n  We are the richest and most powerful Nation on earth. We should be \nable to ensure access to quality health care to all our citizens and to \nassure the medical profession that its members will not be driven from \ntheir calling by the manipulations of the malpractice insurance \nindustry.\n  The debate about the causes of this latest insurance crisis and the \npossible cures grows shrill. I hope today's hearing will be a calmer \nand more constructive discussion. My principal concerns are \nstraightforward: That we ensure that our Nation's physicians are able \nto provide the high quality of medical care that our citizens deserve \nand for which the United States is world-renowned, and that in those \ninstances where a doctor does harm a patient, that patient should be \nable to seek appropriate redress through our court system.\n  To be sure, different States have different experiences with medical \nmalpractice insurance, and insurance remains a largely State-regulated \nindustry. Each State should endeavor to develop its own solution to \nrising medical malpractice insurance rates because each State has its \nown unique problems. Some States--such as my own, Vermont--while \nexperiencing problems, do not face as great a crisis as others. \nVermont's legislature is at work to find the right answers for our \nState, and the same process is underway now in other States. To \ncontrast, in States such as West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Florida, and \nNew Jersey, doctors are walking out of work in protest over the \nexorbitant rates being extracted from them by their insurance carriers.\n  Thoughtful solutions to the situation will require creative thinking, \na genuine effort to rectify the problem, and bipartisan consensus to \nachieve real reform. Unfortunately, these are not the characteristics \nof the Administration's proposal. Ignoring the central truth of this \ncrisis--that it is a problem in the insurance industry, not the tort \nsystem--the Administration has proposed a plan that would cap non-\neconomic damages at $250,000 in medical malpractice cases. The notion \nthat such a one-size-fits-all scheme is the answer runs counter to the \nfactual experience of the States.\n  Most importantly, the President's proposal does nothing to protect \ntrue victims of medical malpractice. A cap of $250,000 would \narbitrarily limit compensation that the most seriously injured patients \nare able to receive. The medical malpractice reform debate too often \nignores the men, women and children whose lives have been \ndramatically--and often permanently--altered by medical errors.\n  The President's proposal would prevent such individuals--even if they \nhave successfully made their case in a court of law--from receiving \nadequate compensation. We are fortunate in this Nation to have many \nhighly qualified medical professional, and this is especially true in \nmy own home State of Vermont. Unfortunately, good doctors sometimes \nmake errors. It is also unfortunate that some not-so-good doctors \nmanage to make their way into the health care system as well. While we \nmust do all that we can to support the men and women who commit their \nprofessional lives to caring for others, we must also ensure that \npatients have access to adequate remedies should they receive \ninadequate care.\n  High malpractice insurance premiums are not the result of malpractice \nlawsuit verdicts. They are the result of investment decisions by the \ninsurance companies and of business models geared toward ever-\nincreasing profits. But an insurer that has made a bad investment, or \nthat has experienced the same disappointments from Wall Street that so \nmany Americans have, should not be able to recoup its losses from the \ndoctors it insures. The insurance company should have to bear the \nburdens of its own business model, just as the other businesses in the \neconomy do.\n  But another fact of the insurance industry's business model requires \na legislative correction--its blanket exemption from federal antitrust \nlaws. Insurers have for years--too many years--enjoyed a benefit that \nis novel in our marketplace. The McCarran-Ferguson Act permits \ninsurance companies to operate without being subject to most of the \nFederal antitrust laws, and our Nation's physicians and their patients \nhave been the worse off for it. Using their exemption, insurers can \ncollude to set rates, resulting in higher premiums than true \ncompetition would achieve--and because of this exemption, enforcement \nofficials cannot investigate any such collusion. If Congress is serious \nabout controlling rising premiums, we must objectively limit this broad \nexemption in the McCarran-Ferguson Act.\n  That is why today I introduce the ``Medical Malpractice Insurance \nAntitrust Act of 2003.'' I want to thank Senators Kennedy, Durbin, \nEdwards, Rockfeller, Reid, Boxer, Feingold, and Corzine for \ncosponsoring this essential legislation. Our bill modified\n\n[[Page S2211]]\n\nthe McCarran-Ferguson Act with respect to medical malpractice \ninsurance, and only for the most pernicious antitrust offenses: price \nfixing, bid rigging, and market allocations. Only those anticompetitive \npractices that most certainly will affect premiums are addressed. I am \nhard pressed to imagine that anyone could object to a prohibition on \ninsurance carriers' fixing prices or dividing territories. After all, \nthe rest of our Nation's industries manage either to abide by these \nlaws or pay the consequences.\n  Many State insurance commissioners police the industry well within \nthe power they are accorded in their own laws, and some States have \nantitrust laws of their own that could cover some anticompetitive \nactivities in the insurance industry. Our legislation is a scalpel, not \na saw. It would not affect regulation of insurance by State insurance \ncommissioners and other State regulators. But there is no reason to \ncontinue a system in which the Federal enforcers are precluded from \nprosecuting the most harmful antitrust violations just because they are \ncommitted by insurance companies.\n  Our legislation is a carefully tailored solution to one critical \naspect of the problem of excessive medical malpractice insurance rates. \nI hope that quick action by the Judiciary Committee and then by the \nfull Senate, will ensure that this important step on the road to \ngenuine reform is taken before too much more damage is done to the \nphysicians of this country and to the patients they care for.\n  Only professional baseball has enjoyed an antitrust exemption \ncomparable to that created for the insurance industry by the McCarran-\nFerguson Act. Senator Hatch and I have joined forces several times in \nrecent years to scale back that exemption for baseball, and in the Curt \nFlood Act of 1998 we successfully eliminated the exemption as it \napplied to employment relations. I hope we can work together again to \ncreate more competition in the insurance industry, just as we did with \nbaseball.\n  If Congress is serious about controlling rising medical malpractice \ninsurance premiums, then we must limit the broad exemption to Federal \nantitrust law and promote real competition in the insurance industry.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 354. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to \nestablish the National Transportation Modeling and Analysis Program to \ncomplete an advanced transportation simulation model, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat I believe will go a long way in helping to reduce congestion and \nimprove safety and security throughout the Nation's transportation \nnetwork. Today I am introducing the National Transportation Modeling \nand Analysis Program Establishment Act, or NATMAP for short.\n  The purpose of this bill is to authorize the Secretary of \nTransportation to complete an advanced computer model that will \nsimulate, in a single integrated system, traffic flows over every major \ntransportation mode, including highways, air traffic, railways, inland \nwaterways, seaports, pipelines, and other intermodal connections. The \nadvanced model will simulate flows of both passenger and freight \ntraffic.\n  Our transportation network is a central component of our economy and \nfundamental to our freedom and quality of life. America's mobility is \nthe engine of our free market system. The food we eat, the clothes we \nwear, the materials for our homes and offices, and the energy to heat \nour homes and power our businesses all come to us over the Nation's \nvast transportation network. Originating with a producer in one region, \nmaterials and products may travel via any number of combinations of \ntruck, rail, airplane, and barge before reaching their final \ndestinations.\n  Today, the Internet connects the world electronically. But it is our \ntransportation network that provides the vital links for the movement \nof both people and goods domestically and around the world. According \nto the latest statistics, our transportation industry carries over 11 \nbillion tons of freight per year worth about $7 trillion. Of the 3.7 \ntrillion ton-miles of freight carried in 1998, 1.4 trillion went by \nrail, 1 trillion by truck, 673 billion by domestic water \ntransportation, 620 billion by pipeline, and 14 billion by air carrier.\n  Individuals also depend on our transportation system--be it passenger \nrail, commercial airline, intercity bus, or the family car--for \nbusiness travel or simply to enjoy a family vacation. Excluding public \ntransit, passengers on our highways traveled a total of 4.2 trillion \npassenger-miles in 1998. Airlines carried another 463 billion \npassenger-miles. Transit companies and rail lines carried 50 billion.\n  We are also interconnected to the world's transportation system, and, \nas I am sure every Senator well knows, foreign trade is an increasingly \ncritical component of our economy. Our Nation's seaports, international \nairports, and border crossing with Canada and Mexico are the gateways \nthrough which passengers and cargo flow between America and the rest of \nthe world. The smooth flow of trade, both imports and exports, would \nnot be possible without a robust transportation network and the direct \nlinks it provides to our international ports of entry.\n  It should be clear that key to our continuing economic strength is a \ntransportation system that is safe, secure and efficient. Today, we are \nfortunate to have one of the best transportation networks in the world, \nand I believe we need to keep it that way. However, we are starting to \nsee signs of strain from the dramatic increase in traffic. For example, \naccording to the Department of Transportation, from 1980 to 2000, \nhighway travel alone increased a whopping 80 percent. Between 1993 and \n1997, the total tons of freight activity grew by over 14 percent and \ntruck activity grew by 21 percent. In the future, truck travel is \nexpected to grow by more than 3 percent per year--nearly doubling by \n2020. As a result of the increased highway traffic, the operational \nperformance, a measure of congestion, has deteriorated dramatically. \nFor example, FHWA estimates that a typical trip that would take 20 \nminutes in 1987 now takes over 30 minutes--a dramatic 50 percent \nincrease.\n  Meanwhile, the strong growth in foreign trade is putting increased \npressure on ports, airports, and border crossings, as well as \ncontributing to congestion throughout the transportation network. \nAccording to DoT, U.S. international trade more than doubled between \n1990 and 2000, rising from $891 billion to $2.2 trillion.\n  Congestion and delay inevitably result when traffic rates approach \nthe capacity of a system to handle that traffic. I do believe increased \ncongestion in our transportation system is a growing threat to the \nnation's economy. Delays in any part of the vast network lead to \neconomic costs, wasted fuel, increased pollution, and a reduced quality \nof life. Moreover, in the future new security measures could also \nincrease delays and disruptions in the flow of goods through our \ninternational gateways.\n  To deal with the ever-increasing loading of our transportation \nnetwork we will need to find ways to improve system efficiency as well \nas to expand some critical elements of the system. However, in planning \nfor any improvements, we must examine the impact on the whole \ntransportation system that would result from a change in one part of \nthe system That's exactly the goal of the bill I am introducing today.\n  By simulating the Nation's entire transportation infrastructure as a \nsingle, integrated system, the National Transportation Analysis and \nModeling Program will allow policy makers at the State, regional, and \nnational levels to evaluate the implications of new transportation \npolicies and actions. To ensure that all possible interrelated impacts \nare included, the model must simulate individual carriers and the \ntransportation infrastructure used by each of the carriers in an \ninterdependent and dynamic system. The advantage of this simulation of \nindividual carriers and shipments is that the nation's transportation \nsystem can be examined at any level of detail--from the path of an \nindividual truck to national multi-modal traffic flows.\n  Some of the transportation planning issues that could be addressed \nwith NATMAP include: What infrastructure improvements result in the \ngreatest\n\n[[Page S2212]]\n\ngains to overall system security and efficiency? How would the network \nrespond to shifts in population or trade flows? How would the system \nrespond to major disruptions caused by a natural disaster or another \nunthinkable terrorist attack? What effect would system delays due to \nincreased security measures have on traffic flow and congestion?\n  Preliminary work on an advanced transportation model has been \nunderway for several years at Los Alamos National Laboratory. As I'm \nsure most senators know, Los Alamos has a long and impressive history \nin computer simulations of complex systems, including the recent \ncompletion of the TRANSIMS model of transportation systems in \nmetropolitan areas. The development of TRANSIMS for FHWA was originally \nauthorized in section 1210 of TEA-21. NATMAP builds on the original \nwork at LANL on the TRANSIMS model.\n  The initial work at LANL on NATMAP, funded in part by DoT, DoD, and \nthe lab's own internal research and development program, demonstrated \nthe technical feasibility of building a nation-wide freight \ntransportation model that can simulate the movement of millions of \ntrucks across the nation's highway system. During this initial \ndevelopment phase, the model was called the National Transportation \nNetwork and Analysis Capability, or NTNAC for short. In 2001, with \nfunding from the Federal Highway Administration, LANL further developed \nthe model and completed an assessment of cargo flows resulting from \ntrade between the U.S. and Latin America.\n  These preliminary studies have clearly demonstrated the value to the \nnation of a new comprehensive modeling system. I do believe that the \ncomputer model represents a leap ahead in transportation modeling and \nanalysis capability. Indeed, Secretary of Transportation Norm Mineta, \nin a letter to me dated April 9 of this year, had this to say about the \nearly simulations: ``The DOT agrees that NTNAC shows great promise of \nproducing a tool that would be useful for analyzing the national \ntransportation system as a single, integrated system. We agree that \nNTNAC would provide DOT with important new capabilities to assess and \nformulate critical policy and investment options and to help address \nhomeland security and vulnerabilities in the nation's transportation \nnetwork.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Secretary Mineta's letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The bill I am introducing today establishes a six-year program in the \nOffice of the Secretary of Transportation to complete the development \nof the advanced transportation simulation model. The program will also \nsupport early deployment of computer software and graphics packages to \nfederal agencies and states for national, regional, or statewide \ntransportation planning. The bill authorizes a total of $50 million \nfrom the Highway Trust Fund for this effort. When completed, NATMAP \nwill provide the nation a tool to help formulate and analyze critical \ntransportation policy and investment options, including major \ninfrastructure requirements and vulnerabilities within that \ninfrastructure.\n  Congress will soon take up the reauthorization of TEA-21, the six-\nyear transportation bill. I am introducing this bill today so my \nproposal can be fully considered by the Senate's Environment and Public \nWorks Committee and by the Administration as the next authorization \nbill is being developed. I look forward to working with Senator Inhofe, \nthe Chairman of the EPW Committee, and Senator Jeffords, the ranking \nmember, as well as Senator Bond, the Chairman of the Transportation, \nInfrastructure, and Nuclear Safety Subcommittee and Senator Reid, the \nranking member, to incorporate this bill in the reauthorization of TEA-\n21.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 354\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Jeff: Thank you for your letter of January 30 \n     expressing your strong support to continue the development of \n     the National Transportation Network Analysis Capability \n     (NTNAC). The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Office \n     of Policy and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) have \n     been working closely with Los Alamos National Laboratory to \n     develop this tool.\n       During 1998, Los Alamos National Laboratory developed a \n     prototype NTNAC with funding provided by the DOT ($50,000 \n     from\n\n[[Page S2213]]\n\n     the Office of the Secretary's Transportation Policy \n     Development Office), the U.S. Department of Defense \n     (TRANSCOM's Military Transportation Management Command), and \n     the Laboratory's own internal research and development \n     program. This effort demonstrated the technical feasibility \n     of building a national transportation network that can \n     simulate the movements of individual carriers (trucks, \n     trains, planes, water vessels, and pipelines) and individual \n     freight shippers.\n       During 1999, FHWA provided $750,000 to further develop \n     NTNAC and to complete the study ``National Transportation \n     Impact of Latin American Trade Flows.''\n       The DOT agrees that NTNAC shows great promise of producing \n     a tool that would be useful for analyzing the national \n     transportation system as a single, integrated system. We \n     agree that NTNAC would provide DOT with important new \n     capabilities to assess and formulate critical policy and \n     investment options and to help address homeland security and \n     vulnerabilities in the Nation's transportation network.\n       However, the Department's budget is very limited. It would \n     be difficult to find funding to continue the project this \n     year. If funding should become available, we will give \n     priority consideration to continuing the NTNAC development \n     effort.\n       Again, I very much appreciate your thoughts on the \n     importance of continuing the development of NTNAC. If I can \n     provide further information or assistance, please fell free \n     to call me.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                 Normal Y. Mineta.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. LINCOLN (for herself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Hagel, Mr. \n        Dayton, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Coleman and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 355.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nfor an energy efficient appliance credit; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce my package of \nalternative energy and energy efficiency bills. These bills all work in \nconcert toward a single goal--promoting the use of cleaner, renewable \nenergy for this nation.\n  For several decades, the U.S. has relied on foreign sources of energy \nsupply. Worldwide demand for energy has continued to increase, while \nour domestic resource base has decreased, leaving the country \nvulnerable in the event of foreign supply disruptions. This year, the \nU.S. will import 60 percent of its crude oil needs this year. The \nevents of September 11th have focused attention on the need to develop \na new energy policy that focuses on creating new domestic sources. Our \nNation needs to explore and develop all possible domestic options as \nresources for our energy supply. To reduce our dependence on foreign \nimports, it is imperative that policy makers create incentives to \npromote technologies that can produce quality alternative products. Our \nnational security demands that the government undertake programs which \nassure the implementation of real alternative fuel technologies.\n  It is in the best security interests of our Nation to reduce our \nreliance on foreign energy suppliers. We can no longer afford to be \nsubject to the whims and manipulations of foreign cartels like OPEC. \nAdded to these threats posed by OPEC and the instability of the Middle \nEast are the even more sinister possibilities that we face in other \nparts of the world. Developments in many regions of the world where \nmuch of today's energy supplies are obtained--West Africa, the Caspian \nSea, Indonesia, Venezuela, and so forth--clearly serve notice that our \nNation cannot continue to depend on these areas for our future energy \nneeds. These events make it more pressing than ever that we proceed \nforward with the development of our own domestic alternative energy \nresources.\n  In the last Congress, both the House and the Senate passed \ncomprehensive energy bills that would have brought us closer to these \ngoals. In the Senate bill, we were able to strike a delicate balance \nbetween using our resources for energy and preserving our environment \nfor future generations. I was pleased with the Senate version of the \nEnergy Policy Act of 2002, and was disappointed that conferees were \nunable to iron out differences with the House of Representatives before \nadjournment. We must make energy independence a national priority \nbecause it is now essential to our homeland security.\n  Looking ahead, I will continue my work to build a cohesive national \nenergy policy that ultimately reduces our dependence on foreign oil. To \naccomplish this goal, we must provide access to more resources, \ntransmit these resources to the consumer, and encourage industrial and \nindividual consumers to use more renewable energy sources. These \nimportant steps will lead to greater reliability and lower energy costs \nfor consumers.\n  We should all work again in the 108th Congress to adopt a \ncomprehensive energy plan that sets America on the road to energy \nindependence and assures consumers of a reliable and affordable energy \nsupply.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will encourage production of \nbiodiesel and its use in this country; to promote the manufacture of \nenergy efficient home appliances; to encourage the use of fuels \nproduced from animal and agricultural wastes; to encourage the use of \nour waste sources such as landfill gas and municipal solid waste to \nproduce energy; and to spur the investment in delivering fuels to rural \nAmerica. These incentives for production and use of clean and renewable \nfuels can help bridge the investment cost gap between production of \npetroleum and renewable energy.\n  Each of these bills were either included or debated in the Senate \nduring last year's Senate consideration and passage of the energy bill. \nI look forward to their inclusion in the debate and inclusion in any \nenergy bill to be passed by the Senate during the 108th Congress.\n  The first bill I am introducing today is the Biodiesel Promotion Act \nof 2003. I am pleased to be joined in introducing this bill by Senators \nGrassley, Hagel, Dayton, Harkin, Durbin, Coleman, and Johnson. This \nlegislation will provide tax incentives for the production of biodiesel \nfrom agricultural oils, recycled oils, and animal fats and will ensure \nthat biodiesel becomes a central component of this nation's automobile \nfuel market.\n  This legislation is identical to language authored by myself and \nSenator Grassley included in the last Congress's Energy Bill. It is \nintended to be a starting point for our debate and discussion as we \ndraft an energy bill for consideration in this Congress.\n  This legislation will provide a partial exemption from the diesel \nexcise tax for diesel blended with biodiesel. Specifically, the bill \nprovides a one-cent reduction for every percent of biodiesel from \nvirgin agricultural oils blended\n\n[[Page S2214]]\n\nwith diesel up to 20 percent. The legislation will also provide a half-\ncent reduction for every percent of biodiesel from recycled \nagricultural oils or animal fats.\n  Also importantly, in the year that we are to reauthorize the \nTransportation Enhancement Act of 1996, the bill provides for \nreimbursing the Highway Trust Fund from the USDA Commodity Credit \nCorporation, CCC. This procedure will protect the Trust Fund from lost \nrevenues due to the biodiesel incentive while providing a much-needed \nboost to our nation's biodiesel industry. The cost to the CCC would be \noffset at least initially by the savings under the marketing loan \nprogram.\n  Biodiesel, which can be made from just about any agricultural oil \nincluding oils from soybeans, cottonseed, or rice, is completely \nrenewable, contains no petroleum, and can be easily blended with \npetroleum diesel. A biodiesel-diesel blend typically contains up to 20 \npercent renewable content. It can be added directly into the gas tank \nof a compression-ignition, diesel engine vehicle with no major \nmodifications. Biodiesel is completely biodegradable and non-toxic, \ncontains no sulfur, and it is the first and only alternative fuel to \nmeet EPA's Tier I and II health effects testing standards. Biodiesel \nalso stands ready to help us reach the EPA's new rule to reduce the \nsulfur content of highway diesel fuel by over 95 percent.\n  Even after years of research and market development, biodiesel is not \nyet cost-competitive with petroleum diesel. In order to be so, market \nsupport and tax incentives are needed. I believe the provisions \nprovided in this bill will help in leveling the field for biodiesel \nblends and help jumpstart this new industry.\n  The time is right for this investment. It is right for our rural \neconomy, for our environment, and for our national energy security and \nI encourage my colleagues to join us in supporting the Biodiesel \nPromotion Act of 2003.\n  The second component of my package is the EPACT Alternative Fuel \nFlexibility Act of 2003. I am pleased to be joined today by Senators \nBond and Talent in introducing this legislation.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to place biodiesel fuel on equal \nfooting with every other alternative motor fuel used in this nation.\n  The Energy Policy Act of 1992, EPACT, set a national objective to \nshift the focus of national energy demand away from imported oil toward \nrenewable and domestically produced energy sources. When EPACT was \npassed in 1992, it recognized ethanol, natural gas, propane, \nelectricity, and methanol as alternative fuels. The original list of \nalternative fuels did not include biodiesel because the technology had \nnot been fully developed.\n  EPACT set a goal to replace 10 percent of petroleum-based fuels by \n2000 and 30 percent by the year 2010. However, a GAO report issued in \nJuly of 2001 noted that ``limited progress has been made in increasing \nthe numbers of alternative fuel vehicles, AFV, in the national vehicle \nfleet and the use of alternative fuels'' as compared to conventional \nvehicles and fuels.\n  We did not meet the original EPACT goals of replacing 10 percent of \npetroleum-based fuels by 2000. Today we are not on track to meet the \ngoal of 30 percent by the year 2010. In fact, we haven't even come \nclose, and that's partly a result of not allowing all alternative fuels \nto be used to meet the EPACT alternative fuel mandates.\n  This legislation will significantly increase the use of alternative \nfuels by allowing EPACT covered fleets to meet up to 100 percent of the \nEPACT purchase requirements through the use of biodiesel. Currently, \ncovered fleets can only meet up to 50 percent of purchase requirements \nwith biodiesel.\n  By offering an additional option for the use of alternative fuels, we \nwill widen the possibilities for these fuels to be made more widely \navailable. Fleets will continue to have the option to choose the \ncomplying vehicles and fuels that best meet their needs. This \nlegislation is not expected to affect fleets that are currently using \nethanol or natural gas. But this legislation does provide a further \noption for alternative fuel vehicles. Furthermore, it does not directly \ndisplace natural gas or ethanol sales, since biodiesel is used in \nmedium- and heavy-duty trucks rather than light-duty vehicles.\n  By allowing fleets to meet 100 percent of their AFV requirement by \nusing biodiesel, we'll take a positive step toward moving this country \naway from dependence on petroleum-based motor fuels and toward \nalternative motor fuels. I urge all of my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n  The third bill I introduce today as part of my energy independence \npackage is the Animal and Agricultural Waste Renewable Energy \nProduction Act of 2003. I am pleased to be joined today by Senators \nHagel, Bond, and Kerry in introducing this legislation.\n  This legislation would provide a credit under Section 29 of the tax \ncode for the production of fuels from animal and agricultural wastes.\n  Thanks to new technological developments, we can now produce \nsignificant quantities of alternative fuels from agricultural and \nanimal wastes in an environmentally friendly manner. Production \nincentives are needed to assure implementation and commercialization of \nthis new generation of technology.\n  Section 29 was originally enacted to provide an incentive to produce \nalternative and hard-to-reach fuels that could compete with fossil \nfuels and hopefully reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil. As \noriginally enacted, a number of ``non-conventional fuels'' were \neligible for the credit, including the following: oil from shale; oil \nfrom tar sands; natural gas from geo-pressured brine, coal seams, \nDevonian shale, or tight sands; liquid, gaseous or solid synthetic fuel \nfrom coal, including coke and coke by-products; gas from biomass, \nincluding wood; steam from solid agricultural by-products; and \nprocessed solid wood fuels.\n  Other biomass by-products, such as agricultural and animal oils and \nsolids, also should qualify the same as liquid or gaseous synthetic \nfuels derived from coal.\n  New technological advances have been developed which will convert \nthese biomass wastes efficiently to alternative fuels. The most readily \navailable of these wastes are agricultural and animal wastes, municipal \nwastes, plastics, used tires, and forest product wastes. This \nproduction incentive opportunity would provide significant new annual \nquantities of alternative fuel to replace foreign imported oil and \nshould be considered a government investment in the nation's future.\n  If these incentives are implemented, large marketable quantities of \nquality alternative fuel products can be produced as a replacement for \nforeign imported oil. These processes can achieve the desired results \nin an environmentally positive way that essentially converts all wastes \nto products and provides an answer for waste disposal problems. To \nachieve these results, financial incentives need be provided from the \ngovernment. Section 29 should be extended to include alternative fuels \nproduced from all biomass wastes and I encourage all of my colleagues \nto join us in supporting this legislation.\n  The fourth bill I am introducing today is the Capturing Landfill Gas \nfor Energy Act of 2003. This legislation will provide a credit under \neither Section 29 or Section 45 of the tax code for the production of \nenergy from landfill gas, LFG. It is designed to encourage additional \ncollection and productive use of methane gas generated by garbage \ndecomposing in America's landfills. LFG is a renewable fuel that can be \nused directly as an energy source for heating, as a clean burning \nvehicle fuel, as a hydrogen source for fuel cells. Furthermore, it can \npower generators to produce electricity.\n  Congress recognized the importance of LFG for energy diversity and \nnational security by providing such a credit in 1980 and extending it \nfor nearly two decades. With today's critical energy needs and emphasis \non distributed generation, this incentive makes more sense than ever. \nMost of the 360 LFG projects that currently are operating were made \neconomically feasible by the ``non-conventional-source fuel'' \nproduction tax credit under Section 29 of the tax code.\n  But since June 30, 1998, that credit to encourage construction of new \nLFG projects has been unavailable, and few have been constructed since \nthat date. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that 600-\n700 more LFG projects could be constructed nationwide if there were \nsufficient economic incentives in place to foster\n\n[[Page S2215]]\n\ntheir development. With such incentives, it is likely that about 55 new \nprojects would be brought on line each year. Just one medium-sized \nproject could provide three megawatts of electrical power capacity--\nenough to meet the electricity needs of 3,000 homes each year.\n  In addition to the value of LFG as an important contribution to our \noverall energy strategy, there are compelling environmental reasons to \nencourage these projects. Uncontrolled landfill gas can create fire \nhazards and odors and can impair air quality. The methane in landfill \ngas is 21 times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas. \nEven the large landfills that are required under the Clean Air Act to \ncollect their gas and control non-methane organic compounds often find \nit more economic to simply flare or otherwise waste the gas rather than \nuse the methane. Some smaller landfills are not required to collect the \ngas, and may continue to emit it for decades under the Clean Air Act. \nThus, LFG projects not only reduce local and regional air pollution \nwhile yielding a renewable source of energy, they can also reduce the \ncountry's yearly emissions of greenhouse gases by a very substantial \namount at a relatively small cost.\n  Unfortunately, the potential energy and environmental benefits of \nfuture LFG projects are substantial, but they will be lost without \nadequate LFG tax provisions to support project development. On average, \nthe total capital cost of constructing an LFG-fueled electricity \ngenerating project is about $1 million per megawatt, and the annual \noperating and maintenance costs average another $150,000 per megawatt. \nThe average capital cost of a new direct use fuel production and \ndelivery project is about $2.5 million, with annual operation and \nmaintenance costs of about $350,000.\n  My bill proposes sufficient, yet sensible, tax incentives to \nencourage these large investments, and I urge my colleagues to join me \nand support LFG tax credits.\n  Today I am also pleased to be joined by Senator Akaka in introducing \nthe fifth component of my energy package--the Waste to Energy \nUtilization Act of 2003. This legislation will provide a credit under \nSection 45 of the tax code for new waste-to-energy facilities or new \ngenerating units at existing facilities. Such a tax credit encourages \nclean renewable electricity and promotes energy diversity, while \nhelping cities meet the challenge of trash disposal.\n  Nearly 2000 communities nationwide rely on waste-to-energy facilities \nto safely dispose of trash and generate clean, renewable energy that \nmeets the power need of more than two and a half million homes. The \nU.S. Conference of Mayors has repeatedly urged Congress to include \nprovisions that promote waste-to-energy in tax legislation and they are \njoined by the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, \nthe Business Council for Sustainable Energy, the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, and the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers.\n  Arkansas stands with other environmentally conscious States in \nunderstanding that waste-to-energy technology saves valuable land and \nsignificantly reduces the amount of greenhouse gases that would have \nbeen released into our atmosphere without its operation. The volume of \nwaste is reduced by greater than 90 percent in a waste-to-energy \nfacility, and EPA has confirmed that more than 33 million tons of \ngreenhouse gases are avoided annually by the combustion of municipal \nsolid waste. Municipal solid waste is a sustainable source of clean, \nrenewable energy.\n  Local governments spent about $1 billion over the past five years on \nair pollution control equipment to comply with EPA's Maximum Achievable \nControl Technology, MACT, standards required under the Clean Air Act. \nThese retrofits have made waste-to-energy one of the cleanest power \ngenerators in the country. In June, EPA announced that these facilities \nhave shown ``outstanding performance'' resulting in ``dramatic \ndecreases'' in emissions, resulting in reductions of mercury emissions \nof more than 95 percent from a decade ago. Communities with waste-to-\nenergy facilities recycle 33 percent of their trash, on average, and \nhistorically have more successful recycling programs than cities \nwithout waste-to-energy plants.\n  We must sustain a level marketplace to achieve energy diversity and \neconomic growth. I believe this Senate should pass tax legislation that \nincludes production tax credits to spur energy generation, and I \nencourage all of my colleagues to join us and support this legislation.\n  The sixth bill I introduce today is the Resource Efficient Appliance \nIncentives Act of 2003. I am pleased to be joined in introducing this \nbill by Senators Allard, Grassley, Harkin, Stabenow, Hagel, Levin, and \nDeWine. \n  This legislation will provide a tax credit for the production of \nsuper energy-efficient clothes washers and refrigerators if those \nappliances exceed new Federal energy efficiency standards. The tax \ncredit would only be available for five years and would be capped for \neach manufacturer.\n  In 2001, the Department of Energy issued new energy efficiency \nstandards for clothes washers. This agreement accompanies rules for \nhigher efficiency refrigerators issued by the department two years ago. \nThe new rules are significant because clothes washers, clothes dryers, \nand refrigerators account for approximately 15 percent of all household \nenergy consumed in the U.S. annually. The tax incentives contained in \nthis legislation are constructed to encourage manufacturers not only to \nexceed these new efficiency requirements, but to exceed them by up to \n35 percent.\n  Tax incentives are essential to accelerate the production and market \npenetration of leading-edge appliance technologies that create \nsignificant environmental benefits. The need for super energy-efficient \nappliances is greater this year than at any time in the past 20 years. \nOver the life of the appliances, over 200 trillion BTUs of energy will \nbe saved. This is the equivalent of taking 2.3 million cars off the \nroad or making available for other uses the energy of six coal-fired \npower plants for a year.\n  In addition, the clothes washers will reduce the amount of water \nnecessary to wash clothes by 870 billion gallons, an amount equal to \nthe needs of every household in a city the size of Phoenix, Arizona for \ntwo years. The water savings attributable to these new technology \nmachines is not based on some computer generated model but an actual \ncase study that gathered data in the small community of Bern, KS by the \nDept. of Energy's esteemed Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 1998.\n  The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers estimates these super \nenergy-efficient appliances could save the average family $100 per \nyear--or $1,400 per family over the lifetime of the appliance. This \nlegislation will create the incentives necessary to increase the \nproduction and sale of these super energy-efficient appliances in the \nshort term while passing along energy savings to the American consumer.\n  As a DOE analysis indicates, high efficiency washers and \nrefrigerators are significantly more expensive to manufacture than \nthose that simply meet existing federal standards. Further, market \nsurveys of consumers indicate that they are generally not willing to \npay more for high efficiency appliances, even when it can be \ndemonstrated that high efficiency appliances will generate greater \nsavings in utility costs over time. The tax credit will provide an \nincentive for manufacturers to develop a greater selection of super \nefficient models that will appeal to consumers at all price points. In \naddition, to assure increased sales of these appliances, manufacturers \nwill be encouraged to redirect their marketing and advertising \nresources toward the high efficiency models. Enactment of this \nlegislation will bring immediate, significant, and lasting \nenvironmental benefits to the nation, and I encourage all of my \ncolleagues to join us in supporting in this effort.\n  The final bill I am introducing today is the Gas Distribution \nInfrastructure Investment Act of 2003. This legislation will amend the \nInternal Revenue Code to modify the depreciation of natural gas \npipelines, equipment, and infrastructure assets from 20 to 10 years.\n  America's demand for energy is expected to grow by 32 percent during \nthe next 20 years. Consumer demand for natural gas will grow at almost \ntwice that rate, due to its economic, environmental, and operational \nbenefits. That level of natural gas use is almost 60\n\n[[Page S2216]]\n\npercent greater than the highest recorded level. To satisfy this \nprojected demand, we must substantially expand our existing gas \ninfrastructure. This is especially true with respect to the delivery \nsector. Higher capacity utilization of existing infrastructure will \nmeet some of this increased demand, but the delivery sector still will \nrequire capital investments of at least $123 billion for infrastructure \nenhancement and additions.\n  Shrinking the lifetime over which an asset is depreciated does not \nchange the amount of expense a company is allowed to claim over the \nasset's useful life, but simply shortens the expensing period for tax \npurposes. This shortened tax life generates higher cash flows in terms \nof reduced tax liability during the asset's early useful lifetime. \nConversely, the cash flows are decreased, relative to the longer \ndepreciation life, during the later part of the asset's useful life. \nThe overall impact is zero on a gross basis.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. \nInfrastructure development and expansion is crucial if America's homes \nare to continue to rely on clean-burning natural gas to heat their \nhomes and fuel their appliances.\n  I ask unanimous consent that each of the seven bills I am introducing \ntoday be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 355\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise to voice my strong support for \nlegislation introduced today by Senators Lincoln and Allard, entitled \n``The Resource Efficient Appliance Incentive Act of 2003.'' I'm proud \nto be an original cosponsor.\n  This legislation will provide a valuable incentive to accelerate and \nexpand the production and market penetration of ultra energy-efficient \nappliances. By providing a tax credit for the development of super \nenergy-efficient washing machines and refrigerators, this legislation \ncreates the incentives necessary to increase the production and sale of \nthese appliances in the short term and ultimately lead to a dramatic \nchange in consumer purchasing decisions.\n  Under this proposal, manufacturers would be eligible to claim a \ncredit of either $50 or $100, depending on efficiency level, for each \nsuper energy-efficient washing machine produced between 2003 and 2007. \nLikewise, manufacturers would be eligible to claim a credit of $50, \n$100, or $150, depending on efficiency level, for each super energy-\nefficient refrigerator produced between 2003 and 2007. It is estimated \nthat this tax credit will increase the production and purchase of super \nenergy-efficient washers by almost 200 percent and the purchase of \nsuper energy-efficient refrigerators by over 285 percent.\n  Equally important is the long-term environmental benefits of the \nexpanded use of these appliances. Over the life of the appliances, over \n200 trillion Btus of energy will be saved. This is the equivalent of \ntaking 2.3 million cars off the road or closing 6 coal-fired power \nplants for a year. In addition, the clothes washers will reduce the \namount of water necessary to wash clothes by 870 billion gallons, an \namount equal to the needs of every household in a city the size of \nPhoenix, Arizona for two years. And, the benefits to consumers over the \nlife of the washers and refrigerators from operational savings is \nestimated at nearly $1 billion.\n  In my home State of Iowa, this legislation would result in the \nproduction of 1.5 million super energy-efficient washers and \nrefrigerators during the next five years. I also expect Iowans to save \n$11 million in operational costs over the life span of the appliances, \nand 9 billion gallons of water--enough to supply drinking water for the \nentire State for 30 years.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I look forward to \nworking with Senators Lincoln and Allard as we continue to promote \nenergy conservation and efficiency.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself Ms. Snowe, Mr. Sarbanes, Ms. \n        Collins, Mrs. Murray, and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 362. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to \nprovide that a monthly insurance benefit thereunder shall be paid for \nthe month in which the recipient dies, subject to a reduction of 50 \npercent if the recipient dies during the first 15 days of such month, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today, I rise to talk about an issue \nthat is very important to me, very important to my constituents in \nMaryland and very important to the people of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  For the fifth Congress in a row, I am joining in a bipartisan effort \nwith my friend and colleague, Senator Olympia Snowe, to end an unfair \npolicy of the Social Security System.\n  Senator Snowe and I are introducing the Social Security Family \nProtection Act. This bill addresses retirement security and family \nsecurity. We want the middle class of this Nation to know that we are \ngoing to give help to those who practice self-help.\n  What is it I am talking about? I was shocked when I found out that \nSocial Security does not pay benefits for the last month of life. If a \nSocial Security retiree dies on the 18th of the month or even on the \n30th of the month, the surviving spouse or family members must send \nback the Social Security check for that month.\n  I think that is a harsh and heartless rule. That individual worked \nfor Social Security benefits, earned those benefits, and paid into the \nSocial Security trust fund. The system should allow the surviving \nspouse or the estate of the family to use that Social Security check \nfor the last month of life.\n  This legislation has an urgency. When a loved one dies, there are \nexpenses that the family must take care of. People have called my \noffice in tears. Very often it is a son or a daughter that is grieving \nthe death of a parent. They are clearing up the paperwork for their mom \nor dad, and there is the Social Security check. And they say, \n``Senator, the check says for the month of May. Mom died on May 28. Why \ndo we have to send the Social Security check back? We have bills to \npay. We have utility coverage that we need to wrap up, mom's rent, or \nher mortgage, or health expenses. Why is Social Security telling me, \n`Send the check back or we're going to come and get you'?''\n  With all the problems in our country today, we ought to be going \nafter drug dealers and tax dodgers, not honest people who have paid \ninto Social Security, and not the surviving spouse or the family who \nhave been left with the bills for the last month of their loved one's \nlife. They are absolutely right when they call me and say that Social \nSecurity was supposed to be there for them.\n  I've listened to my constituents and to the stories of their lives. \nWhat they say is this: ``Senator Mikulski, we don't want anything for \nfree. But our family does want what our parents worked for. We do want \nwhat we feel we deserve and what has been paid for in the trust fund in \nour loved one's name. Please make sure that our family gets the Social \nSecurity check for the last month of our life.''\n  That is what our bill is going to do. That is why Senator Snowe and I \nare introducing the Family Social Security Protection Act. When we talk \nabout retirement security, the most important part of that is income \nsecurity. And the safety net for most Americans is Social Security.\n  We know that as Senators we have to make sure that Social Security \nremains solvent, and we are working to do that. We also don't want to \ncreate an undue administrative burden at the Social Security \nAdministration--a burden that might affect today's retirees. But it is \nabsolutely crucial that we provide a Social Security check for the last \nmonth of life.\n  How do we propose to do that? We have a very simple, straightforward \nway of dealing with this problem. Our legislation says that if you die \nbefore the 15th of the month, you will get a check for half the month. \nIf you die after the 15th of the month, your surviving spouse or the \nfamily estate would get a check for the full month.\n  We think this bill is fundamentally fair. Senator Snowe and I are \nold-fashioned in our belief in family values. We believe you honor your \nfather and your mother. We believe that it is not only a good religious \nand moral principle, but it is good public policy as well.\n  The way to honor your father and mother is to have a strong Social \nSecurity System and to make sure the system is fair in every way. That \nmeans fair for the retiree and fair for the\n\n[[Page S2220]]\n\nspouse and family. We strongly feel that the current system is an \ninjustice to spouses and families across the Nation. Just because a \nbeneficiary passes away, it does not mean that their bills can go \nunpaid. Join us to correct this policy and to ensure that families and \nrecipients are protected during this difficult time. That is why we \nsupport making sure that the surviving spouse or family can keep the \nSocial Security check for the last month of life.\n  We urge our colleagues to join us in this effort and support the \nSocial Security Family Protection Act. I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of my bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 362\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to \nprovide that the reductions in social security benefits which are \nrequired in the case of spouses and surviving spouses who are also \nreceiving certain Government pensions shall be equal to the amount by \nwhich two-thirds of the total amount of the combined monthly benefit \n(before reduction) and monthly pension exceeds $1,200, adjusted for \ninflation; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an issue that \nis very important to me, very important to my constituents in Maryland \nand very important to government workers and retirees across the \nNation. I am reintroducing a bill to modify a cruel rule of government \nthat is unfair and prevents current workers from enjoying the benefits \nof their hard work during retirement. My bill has bipartisan support \nand the House companion bill\n\n[[Page S2221]]\n\nhad nearly 300 cosponsors last year. With this strong bipartisan \nsupport, I hope that we can correct this cruel rule of government this \nyear.\n  Under current law, a Social Security spousal benefit is reduced or \nentirely eliminated if the surviving spouse is eligible for a pension \nfrom a local, State or Federal Government job that was not covered by \nSocial Security. This policy is known as the Government Pension Offset.\n  This is how the current law works. Consider a surviving spouse who \nretires from government service and receives a government pension of \n$600 a month. She also qualifies for a Social Security spousal benefit \nof $645 a month. Because of the Pension Offset law, which reduces her \nSocial Security benefit by 2/3 of her government pension, her spousal \nbenefit is reduced to $245 a month. So instead of $1245, she will \nreceive only $845 a month. That is $400 a month less to pay the rent, \npurchase a prescription medication, or buy groceries. I think that is \nwrong.\n  My bill does not repeal the government pension offset entirely, but \nit will allow retirees to keep more of what they deserve. It guarantees \nthat those subject to the offset can keep at least $1200 a month in \ncombined retirement income. With my modification, the 2/3 offset would \napply only to the combined benefit that exceeds $1200 a month. So, in \nthe example above, the surviving spouse would face only a $30 offset, \nallowing her to keep $1215 in monthly income.\n  Unfortunately, the current law disproportionately affects women. \nWomen are more likely to receive Social Security spousal benefits and \nto have worked in low-paying or short-term government positions while \nthey were raising families. It is also true that women receive smaller \ngovernment pensions because of their lower earnings, and rely on Social \nSecurity benefits to a greater degree. My modification will allow these \nwomen who have contributed years of important government service and \nfamily service to rely on a larger amount of retirement income.\n  The last time Congress passed a bill significantly effecting Social \nSecurity benefits was in 1999. At that time, the Senate unanimously \nvoted for and passed H.R. 5, The Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act \nof 1999. This legislation ensured that senior citizens who choose to \nwork or who must work can earn income after retirement without losing a \nportion of their Social Security benefit. That law helps senior \ncitizens who earn above $17,000 per year. In contrast, my bill \nspecifically targets those with much lower retirement incomes around \n$13,000 per year and less. I believe that we must work to ensure a \nsafety net for all of our seniors--including those retired federal \nemployees who every day are forced to make difficult choices between \nrent, food, and prescription drugs due to the drastic effects of the \ngovernment pension offset.\n  Why do we punish people who have committed a significant portion of \ntheir lives to government service? We are talking about workers who \nprovide some of the most important services to our community--teachers, \nfirefighters, and many others. Some have already retired. Others are \ncurrently working and looking forward to a deserved retirement. These \nindividuals deserve better than the reduced monthly benefits that the \nPension Offset currently requires.\n  Government employees work hard in service to our nation, and I work \nhard for them. I do not want to see them penalized simply because they \nhave chosen to work in the public sector, rather than for a private \nemployer, and often at lower salaries and sometimes fewer benefits. If \na retired worker in the private sector received a pension, and also \nreceived a spousal Social Security benefit, they would not be subject \nto the Offset. I think we should be looking for ways to reward \ngovernment service, not the other way around. I believe that people who \nwork hard and play by the rules should not be penalized by arcane, \nlegislative technicalities.\n  Frankly, I would like to repeal the offset all together. But, I \nrealize that budget considerations make that unlikely. As a compromise, \nI hope we can agree that retirees who have worked hard all their lives \nshould not have this offset applied until their combined monthly \nbenefit, both government pension and Social Security spousal benefit, \nexceeds $1,200.\n  I also strongly believe that we should ensure that retirees buying \npower keeps up with the cost of living. That's why I have also included \na provision in this legislation to index the $1,200 amount to inflation \nso retirees will see their minimum benefits increase along with the \ncost of living.\n  The Social Security Administration recently estimated that enacting \nthe provisions contained in my bill will have a minimal long-term \nimpact on the Social Security Trust Fund--about 0.01 percent of taxable \npayroll. Additionally, my bill is bipartisan and is strongly supported \nby CARE, the Coalition to Assure Retirement Equity with 43 member \norganizations including the National Association of Retired Federal \nEmployees, NARFE, the American Federation of Federal State County and \nMunicipal Employees, AFSCME, the National Education Association, NEA, \nand the National Treasury Employees Union, NTEU.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort and support my \nlegislation to modify the Government Pension Offset. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of my bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 363\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 52\n\n       Whereas approximately 3,000,000 reports of suspected or \n     known child abuse and neglect involving 5,000,000 American \n     children are made to child protective service agencies each \n     year;\n       Whereas 588,000 American children are unable to live safely \n     with their families and are placed in foster homes and \n     institutions;\n       Whereas it is estimated that more than 1,200 children, 85 \n     percent of whom are under the age of 6 years and 44 percent \n     of whom are under the age of 1 year, lose their lives as a \n     direct result of abuse and neglect every year in America;\n       Whereas this tragic social problem results in human and \n     economic costs due to its relationship to crime and \n     delinquency, drug and alcohol abuse, domestic violence, and \n     welfare dependency; and\n       Whereas Childhelp USA has initiated a ``Day of Hope'' to be \n     observed on Wednesday, April 2, 2003, during Child Abuse \n     Prevention Month, to focus public awareness on this social \n     ill: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (A) all Americans should keep the victims of child abuse \n     and neglect in their thoughts and prayers;\n       (B) all Americans should seek to break the cycle of child \n     abuse and neglect and to give these victimized children hope \n     for the future; and\n       (C) the faith community, nonprofit organizations, and \n     volunteers across America should recommit themselves and \n     mobilize their resources to assist these abused and neglected \n     children; and\n       (2) the Senate--\n       (A) supports the goals and ideas of the ``Day of Hope'', \n     which was initiated by Childhelp USA and will be observed on \n     April 2, 2003, as part of Child Abuse Prevention Month; and\n       (B) commends Childhelp USA for all of its efforts on behalf \n     of abused and neglected children throughout the United \n     States.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution \ndeclaring Wednesday, April 2, 2003, as a National Day of Hope dedicated \nto remembering the victims of child abuse and neglect and recognizing \nChildhelp USA for initiating such a day. I am pleased to be joined in \nthis effort by my colleagues Senators Craig, Lincoln, Hatch, Lott, \nDorgan, Landrieu, Kohl, Inhofe, Domenici, Specter, Biden, and Allen who \nare original cosponsors of the resolution.\n  This resolution is similar to one I introduced in the 107th Congress, \nS. Res. 132, which passed the Senate by unanimous consent on May 22, \n2002. It expresses the sense of Congress that we must break the cycle \nof child abuse and neglect by mobilizing all our resources including \nthe faith community, non-profit organizations and volunteers.\n  The resolution also recognizes Childhelp USA for focusing its efforts \non prevention and research as well as on treatment. Childhelp USA is \none of our oldest national organizations dedicated to meeting the needs \nof abused and neglected children. Childhelp and many other non-profits \nor faith-based organizations nationwide are performing a vital service \nto these children that they would not have otherwise, and they are to \nbe commended for their efforts.\n  More than 3 million children are reported as suspected victims of \nchild abuse and neglect each year. That is 3 million children too many. \nAnd, it is estimated that more than 1200 children lose their lives as a \ndirect result of abuse and neglect every year. That is not acceptable. \nWe must do something to change these disturbing statistics.\n  I know first-hand the importance of having help when it is needed. \nThe National Day of Hope Resolution calls on each of us to renew our \nduty and responsibility to the vulnerable children and families caught \nin the cycle of child abuse and neglect.\n  While we are encouraged by the efforts of many organizations \nnationwide, more needs to be done. That is why we urge our colleagues \nto act quickly on this resolution so we can move another step closer to \nerasing the horror of child abuse from our Nation's history.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 53--AUTHORIZING EXPENDITURES BY THE COMMITTEE ON \n                           VETERANS' AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER submitted the following resolution; from the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs; which was referred to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration:\n\n                               S.

GAO STUDY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Beginning 1 year after the date on which \n     the database described in section 2(a) is established, the \n     Sergeant-at-Arms shall request the Comptroller General to \n     examine the cost of implementing this resolution, other than \n     this section, with particular attention to the cost of \n     establishing and maintaining the database and submit a report \n     within 6 months thereafter. The Sergeant-at-Arms shall ask \n     the Comptroller General to include in the report \n     recommendations on how to make operations under this \n     resolution more cost-effective, and such other \n     recommendations for administrative changes or changes in law, \n     as the Comptroller General may determine to be appropriate.\n       (b) Delivery.--The Sergeant-at-Arms shall transmit a copy \n     of the Comptroller General's report under subsection (a) to--\n       (1) the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration;\n       (2) the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation;\n       (3) the Senate Committee on the Judiciary; and\n       (4) the Joint Committee of the Congress on the Library of \n     Congress.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by \nSenators Leahy, Lieberman, and Harkin in submitting a resolution to \nmake Congressional Research Service, CRS, reports, and other Senate \ndocuments, accessible over the Internet to the American people.\n  CRS is well-known for producing high quality reports and issue briefs \nthat are concise, factual, and unbiased--a rarity in Washington. Many \nof us rely on the work of CRS to make decisions on a wide variety of \ndiverse legislative proposals, such as formulating policies on homeland \nsecurity, determining the implications of war with Iraq, contemplating \nthe future of the Internet, developing health care reform, and \nanalyzing tax policy. Also, we routinely send CRS reports to our \nconstituents in order to help them understand the important issues of \nour time.\n  The sponsors of this resolution believe that it is important for the \npublic\n\n[[Page S2225]]\n\nto have access to these CRS reports. The American public paid over $81 \nmillion to fund CRS's operations in fiscal year 2002 alone. The \ninformational reports covered by this resolution are not confidential \nor classified, and the public deserves to have access to them.\n  By making these reports publicly available, the Senate will better \nserve an important function in helping to inform their constituents. \nMembers of the public will be able to read these CRS products and \nreceive a concise summary of issues that concern them. These reports \nalso will help voters make decisions and petition their legislators on \nhow to best represent them.\n  Currently, corporations, universities, and other well-heeled entities \noften hire former Members of Congress as lobbyists to get access to \nthese reports. However, the general public does not have access to \nthese reports. Instead, the public has to obtain these reports through \nindependent companies, such as Penny Hill Press, which charges almost \n$30 for each report. Otherwise, they must search through a variety of \ngovernment and non-government web sites for outdated reports or get \nthem from their Members of Congress through the mail. It is not fair \nfor the American people to have to pay a third party or search all over \nthe web for products for which they have already footed the bill.\n  This resolution is drafted to set up a system for distributing CRS \nReports that is similar to a pilot program ongoing in the House of \nRepresentatives. Under our resolution, the Senate Sergeant-at-Arms \nwould establish and maintain a system for distribution of CRS \ndocuments. The public would only be able to access these documents \nthrough Senators' or Senate Committees' web pages. This system would \nallow Senators and Committee Chairmen to be able to choose which \ndocuments are made available to the public through their web page.\n  This resolution also includes other safeguards to ensure that CRS is \nable to carry out its mission. Confidential information and reports \ndone for confidential research requests would not be made available to \nthe public. The resolution provides authorization for the Senate \nSergeant-at-Arms to remove the names of CRS employees from these \nproducts to prevent the public from distracting CRS employees. In \naddition, the Senate Sergeant-at-Arms would be authorized to remove \ncopyrighted information from the publicly-available reports. This \nresolution would ensure that the CRS' mission is not altered in any \nway, and that it cannot be open to liability suits.\n  Finally, we recognize that cost concerns had been raised about prior \nversions of this legislation introduced in past Congresses. Yet, our \nunderstanding is that the House system of distribution has been \nachieved at a relatively low cost. We have designed this resolution to \neliminate the cost burden to CRS by shifting the operation and \nmaintenance of the system over to the Senate Sergeant-at-Arms. In \naddition, the Senate Sergeant-at-Arms is directed to ask the General \nAccounting Office, GAO, to evaluate the program after one year to \nexplore how to make the operations more cost-effective.\n  The resolution also would require the Senate Office of Public Records \nto put other selected documents related to Members' receipt of \nhonoraria and travel reimbursement on the Internet. We have already \nvoted to make this information available to the public. Unfortunately, \nthe public can only get access to this information by personally \nvisiting an office in the Hart building. This resolution would allow \nour constituents throughout the country to access this information more \nreadily.\n  This resolution has been endorsed by many groups, including the \nProject on Government Oversight, the Congressional Accountability \nProject, Intel, Computer & Communications Industry Association, the \nCenter for Democracy and Technology, the American Library Association, \nSeeBeyond Technology Corporation, and others. I ask unanimous consent \nthat these letters of support be printed in the Record.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. The Internet offers \na unique opportunity to allow the American people to have everyday \naccess to important information about their government.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    SeeBeyond,\n\n                                    Reston, VA, February 11, 2003.\n     Senator John McCain,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman McCain: We are writing to express our support \n     for the Congressional Openness Act that allows constituents \n     easier and faster access to information through the Internet, \n     and to urge quick Senate passage of the bill.\n       SeeBeyond is a software technology company that enables \n     Government agencies to communicate and share vital \n     information in real time to other federal agencies, state and \n     local Governments and most importantly constituents.\n       The bill allows better ways for the Government to share \n     information, documents and proceedings, including bills, \n     reports and transcripts of committee meetings that educate \n     the public, and we commend your efforts to further the \n     Federal Government's work in this area.\n       We are pleased to offer you our support of this legislation \n     and to encourage its swift passage by the full Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Sam Maccherola,\n\n                                    Vice President, Public Sector,\n     SeeBeyond Technology Corp.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      Congressional Accountability\n\n\n                                                      Project,\n\n                                  Portland, OR, February 11, 2003.\n     Senator John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators McCain and Leahy: We heartily endorse your \n     resolution to place useful congressional documents on the \n     Internet, including Congressional Research Service (CRS) \n     Reports and Issue Briefs, CRS Authorization and Appropriation \n     products, and Senate gift disclosure reports. This resolution \n     is a simple and inexpensive way to improve our democracy.\n       Citizens need access to congressional documents to \n     discharge their civic duties. Regrettable, the 20th Century \n     has come and gone, and yet Congress still has not put many of \n     its most important documents on the Internet. Your resolution \n     will help fix this problem.\n       The Congressional Research Service is a taxpayer-funded \n     research arm of Congress. Their research materials are among \n     the best produced by the federal government. They explain, \n     with fairness and clarity, the controversies and complexities \n     surrounding the most pressing issues of our day. This \n     research belongs on the Internet. Taxpayers deserve easy \n     access to the documents we pay for.\n       We applaud the resolution's directive that Senate \n     committees should ``provide access via the Internet to \n     publicly-available committee information, documents and \n     proceedings, including bills, reports, and official \n     transcripts of committee meetings that are open to the \n     public.''\n       In 1822, James Madison explained why citizens need such \n     information: ``A popular government,'' he wrote, ``without \n     popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a \n     Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or, perhaps both. Knowledge \n     will forever govern ignorance: And a people who mean to be \n     their own Governors, must arm themselves with the power which \n     knowledge gives.''\n           Sincerely,\n         American Association of Law Libraries; American Library \n           Association; American Society of Newspaper Editors; \n           Association of Research Libraries; Center for Democracy \n           and Technology; Center for Digital Democracy; Center \n           for Responsive Politics, Common Cause; Computer & \n           Communications Industry Association; Computer \n           Professionals for Social Responsibility; Congressional \n           Accountability Project; Consumer Federation of America; \n           Consumer Project on Technology; Electronic Frontier \n           Foundation; Electronic Privacy Information Center.\n         Federation of American Scientists; Friends of the Earth; \n           Green Party of the United States; Medical Library \n           Association; National Federation of Press Women; \n           National Security Archive; National Taxpayers Union; \n           National Newspaper Association; OMB Watch; Project on \n           Government Oversight; Public Citizen; Reporters \n           Committee for Freedom of the Press; Society of \n           Professional Journalists; Taxpayers for Common Sense; \n           Union of Concerned Scientists; U.S. Public Interest \n           Research Group (USPIRG).\n\n   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with Senator \nMcCaine to submit our bipartisan resolution to make Congressional \nResearch Service products available over the Internet to the American \npeople. I also want to thank the Project on Government Oversight for \nits excellent report on the need for access to CRS information.\n  The Congressional Research Service has a well-known reputation for \nproducing high-quality reports and information briefs that are \nunbiased, concise and accurate. The taxpayers of this country, who pay \nmillions of dollars a year to fund the CRS, deserve\n\n[[Page S2226]]\n\nspeedy access to these public resources and have a right to see that \ntheir money is being spent well.\n  The goal of our bipartisan legislation is to allow every citizen the \nsame access to the wealth of CRS information as a Member of Congress \nenjoys today. CRS performs invaluable research and produces first-rate \nreports on hundreds of topics. American taxpayers have every right to \nhave direct access to these wonderful resources.\n  Our legislation ensures that private CRS products will remain \nprotected by giving the CRS Director the authority to hold back any \nproducts that are deemed confidential. Moreover, the Director may \nprotect the identity of CRS researchers and any copyrighted material. \nWe can do both--protect confidential material and empower our citizens \nthrough electronic access to invaluable CRS products.\n  The Internet offers us a unique opportunity to allow the American \npeople to have everyday access to this public information. Our \nbipartisan legislation would harness the power of the Information Age \nto allow average citizens to see these public records of the Senate in \ntheir official form, in context and without editorial comment.\n  All of these reports are ``public'' for only those who can afford to \nhire a lawyer or lobbyist, or who can afford to physically travel to \nWashington to visit the Office of Public Records in the Hart Building \nand read them. Indeed, the Project on Government Oversight reports that \nover 150 registered lobbyists are former Members of Congress who have \nautomatic access to CRS documents. That is not very ``public,'' and \ndoes almost nothing for the average voter in Vermont or the rest of \nthis country who does not have easy access to Washington.\n  We can do better, and this resolution does better. Under our \nresolution, any citizen in any corner of this country with access to a \ncomputer at home, at the office or at the public library will be able \nto get on the Internet and get these important congressional documents \nunder our resolution. It allows individual citizens to check the facts, \nto make comparisons, and to make up their own minds.\n  I commend the senior Senator from Arizona for his leadership on this \nand similar issues. I share his desire for the American people to have \nelectronic access to many more congressional resources. I look forward \nto working with him in the coming days to let the information age open \nup the Halls of Congress to all our citizens.\n  As Thomas Jefferson wrote, ``Information is the currency of \ndemocracy.'' Our democracy is stronger if all citizens have equal \naccess to at least the ``congressional-type'' of currency, and that is \nsomething in which Members on both sides of the aisle can celebrate and \njoin.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 4--WELCOMING THE EXPRESSION OF SUPPORT OF \n  18 EUROPEAN NATIONS FOR THE ENFORCEMENT OF UNITED NATIONS SECURITY \n                        COUNSEL RESOLUTION 1441\n\n  Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Graham of South Carolina, \nand Mr. Bayh) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                             S. Con. Res. 4\n\n       Whereas on November 8, 2002, the United Nations Security \n     Council approved Security Council Resolution 1441 under \n     Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter by a vote of 15-0, \n     giving Iraq ``a final opportunity to comply with its \n     disarmament obligations'';\n       Whereas on November 21, 2002, the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization's North Atlantic Council unanimously approved a \n     declaration stating, ``We deplore Iraq's failure to comply \n     fully with its obligations which were imposed as a necessary \n     step to restore international peace and security and we \n     recall that the Security Council has decided in its \n     resolution to afford Iraq a final opportunity to comply with \n     its disarmament obligations under relevant resolutions of the \n     Council.'';\n       Whereas the North Atlantic Council stated, ``NATO Allies \n     stand united in their commitment to take effective action to \n     assist and support the efforts of the United Nations to \n     ensure full and immediate compliance by Iraq, without \n     conditions or restrictions, with United Nations Security \n     Council Resolution 1441. We recall that the Security Council \n     in this resolution has warned Iraq that it will face serious \n     consequences as a result of its continued violation of its \n     obligations.'';\n       Whereas, on January 30, 2003, the Prime Ministers of \n     Denmark, Italy, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and the \n     United Kingdom, and the President of the Czech Republic \n     (``The Eight''), issued a declaration regarding Security \n     Council Resolution 1441;\n       Whereas in their declaration, The Eight stated, ``The \n     transatlantic relationship must not become a casualty of the \n     current Iraqi regime's persistent attempts to threaten world \n     security. . . . The Iraqi regime and its weapons of mass \n     destruction represent a clear threat to world security. This \n     danger has been explicitly recognized by the United Nations. \n     All of us are bound by Security Council Resolution 1441, \n     which was adopted unanimously.'';\n       Whereas The Eight stated, ``Resolution 1441 is Saddam \n     Hussein's last chance to disarm using peaceful means. The \n     opportunity to avoid greater confrontation rests with him. . \n     . . Our governments have a common responsibility to face this \n     threat. . . . [T]he Security Council must maintain its \n     credibility by ensuring full compliance with its resolutions. \n     We cannot allow a dictator to systematically violate those \n     resolutions. If they are not complied with, the Security \n     Council will lose its credibility and world peace will suffer \n     as a result.'';\n       Whereas on February 5, 2003, the Foreign Ministers of \n     Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, \n     Macedonia, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia (``The Ten'') \n     issued a declaration regarding Security Council Resolution \n     1441;\n       Whereas in their declaration, The Ten stated, ``[T]he \n     United States [has] presented compelling evidence to the \n     United Nations Security Council detailing Iraq's weapons of \n     mass destruction programs, its active efforts to deceive \n     United Nations inspectors, and its links to international \n     terrorism. . . . The transatlantic community, of which we are \n     a part, must stand together to face the threat posed by the \n     nexus of terrorism and dictators with weapons of mass \n     destruction.'';\n       Whereas The Ten stated, ``[I]t has now become clear that \n     Iraq is in material breach of United Nations Security Council \n     resolutions, including United Nations Resolution 1441. . . . \n     The clear and present danger posed by Saddam Hussein's regime \n     requires a united response from the community of democracies. \n     We call upon the United Nations Security Council to take the \n     necessary and appropriate action in response to Iraq's \n     continuing threat to international peace and security.'': \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress welcomes--\n       (1) the expression of support from Albania, Bulgaria, \n     Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Hungary, \n     Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Poland, Portugal, \n     Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, and the United Kingdom \n     for Iraq's full compliance with Security Council Resolution \n     1441; and\n       (2) their expression of solidarity with the United States \n     in calling for the demands of the Security Council to be met \n     with regard to Iraq's full disarmament.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/11/senate-section/article/S2226-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOTICES OF HEARINGS/MEETINGS\n\n\n                 COMMITTEE ON RULES AND ADMINISTRATION\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the injunction \nof secrecy be removed from the following treaty transmitted to the \nSenate on February 11, 2003, by the President of the United States:\n  Amendments to the 1987 Treaty on Fisheries with Pacific Island States \n(Treaty Document No. 108-2).\n  I further ask that the treaty be considered as having been read the \nfirst time; that it be referred, with accompanying papers, to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and that the \nPresident's message be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith Amendments to the 1987 Treaty on \nFisheries Between the Governments of Certain Pacific Island States and \nthe Government of the United States of America, with Annexes and agreed \nstatements, done at Port Moresby, April 2, 1987 (the Treaty), done at \nKoror, Palau, March 30, 1999, and at Kiritimati, Kiribati, March 24, \n2002. I also transmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of \nthe Secretary of State with respect to these Amendments, related \nAmendments to the Treaty Annexes, and the Memorandum of Understanding \nregarding provisional application. The United States enjoys positive \nand constructive fisheries relations with the Pacific Island Parties \nthrough the implementation and operation of the Treaty, which is one of \nthe cornerstones of our overall foreign relations with the Pacific \nIsland Parties. This Treaty, and the good relationships it has \nfostered, has provided new opportunities for collaboration between the \nPacific Island Parties and the United States on fisheries conservation \nand management issues. The relationships established as a result of the \nTreaty have also helped to safeguard U.S. commercial and security \ninterests in the region.\n  The Amendments to the Treaty will, among other things, allow U.S. \nlongline vessels to fish in high seas portions of the Treaty Area; \nstreamline the way amendments to the Treaty Annexes are agreed; and \nallow the Parties to consider the issue of capacity in the Treaty Area \nand, where appropriate, to promote consistency between the Treaty and \nthe relevant fisheries management convention, which is likely to come \ninto force during the duration of the extended operation of the Treaty. \nTherefore, no new legislation is necessary in order for the United \nStates to\n\n[[Page S2228]]\n\nratify these Amendments. However, minor amendments to section 6 of the \nSouth Pacific Tuna Act of 1988, Public Law 100-330 will be necessary to \ntake account of the Amendment to paragraph 2 of Article 3 ``Access to \nthe Treaty Area,'' which opens the high seas of the Treaty Area to \nfishing by U.S. longline vessels.\n  I recommend that the Senate give favorable consideration to these \nAmendments and give its advice and consent to their ratification at an \nearly date.\n                                                      George W.

For the information of Senators, tomorrow the Senate will \nresume debate on the nomination of Miguel Estrada. We have now spent 4 \ndays, over 20 hours, debating this well-qualified and capable nominee. \nWhile my colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to object \nto any time agreement, we will continue to work with them to move this \nnomination to a final vote.\n  Many Members have participated in the debate, and we appreciate their \nefforts. However, at some point each side will have had adequate time \nto make their case, and that the Senate should then vote on this \nnomination. At this time, we will continue to give Members the \nopportunity to speak. Senators should, therefore, expect a late night \ntomorrow.\n  In addition to the Estrada nomination, it is the leader's intention \nto also complete action on the omnibus appropriations conference report \nprior to the President's Day recess. Again, I remind Senators that they \nshould expect late nights and rollcall votes throughout the remainder \nof the week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/11/senate-section/article/S2228-3", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
