I Timothy 2:1-2 says, ``I \nexhort, therefore, that first of all, supplications, prayers, \nintercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men; for kings and \nfor all that are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceful \nlife in all godliness and honesty.'' I pray that You empower each \nMember with Your vision and courage as they seek to continue making \nthis Nation the greatest nation on Earth.\n  God, let us remember that You are the author and finisher of our \nfaith.

Mr. President, this morning the Senate will begin \nconsideration of the jobs and economic growth package which was \nreported by the Finance Committee. Under the agreement reached \nyesterday, there are 14 hours remaining for consideration of the bill.\n  I again ask that all Senators who intend to offer amendments contact \nthe chairman and ranking member of the committee to facilitate their \nstructuring of consideration of this bill for today and tomorrow \nmorning.\n  As I indicated last night in closing, I expect a very busy day today \nand, indeed, a busy day tomorrow and on Friday. We will have a busy day \nand likely a busy night tonight as we address this important jobs and \neconomic growth package.\n  When we complete this measure tomorrow, we will proceed directly to \nthe bipartisan global HIV/AIDS bill. The Senate will complete both of \nthese important issues this week. A number of Senators do have \nengagements planned Saturday, a number of commencement addresses and \ninteraction with their constituents, so we will not be in on Saturday, \nbut we will likely be voting late into Friday. I urge them to make \nappropriate arrangements but to be here Friday. We will clearly be \nvoting through tomorrow as well.\n  Mr. President, I made a few statements yesterday on the fact that \nthis HIV/AIDS bill will be addressed this week. The focus today and \nmuch of tomorrow will be on the jobs and economic growth package. I \nhope we can go to the HIV/AIDS bill tomorrow afternoon. This virus, \nHIV/AIDS, casts a shadow of death that reaches across oceans; it knows \nno borders, and it is sweeping across continents. It goes to remote \nvillages and countries all across the globe. It has killed 23 million \npeople, and 42 million people are living with this virus. Of those 42 \nmillion people, most don't know they have the virus. Another 60 million \npeople will likely die of HIV/AIDS by 2020.\n  We have an opportunity to reverse this moral, this humanitarian \ntragedy. The work has been done by the House of Representatives, by the \nPresident of the United States, and now it is up to this body. As I \nhave mentioned before, history will judge whether America has led in \nthe fight against HIV/AIDS, which has caused the greatest destruction \nin human life in recorded history, and whether we stood up in a timely \nfashion and performed heroic rescues. President Bush opened the door to \nthat possibility, the House acted, and we will act this week to pass \nlegislation and get this program established without further delay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/14/senate-section/article/S6147-6", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6147-S6148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. We have two of the most experienced managers in the Senate \nworking on this bill, Senators Grassley and Baucus. The rules of this \ntax\n\n[[Page S6148]]\n\ndebate are not the ordinary rules of the Senate. They are unique in \nthis piece of legislation. So we need to make sure that Members \nunderstand that, and that those who have amendments, as the majority \nleader has indicated, give the managers some indication as to when they \nwill be ready. We don't have the luxury, as we have on a lot of pieces \nof legislation, to just wait around until they show up. With some \nexceptions, the time runs all the time--with the exception, of course, \nif there are rollcall votes.\n  I ask that all Members understand that the rules of this debate are \ndifferent than others. If we are going to complete all of the work \npeople want--we have a significant number of amendments on this side \nthat people want to offer, and they may not be able to offer them. If \nthe majority wants to take time on our amendments, they can do that, of \ncourse.\n  This is also one of those times when we have the ability to enter \ninto debate and have amendments voted on. We are going to have this \ntrimmed down as much as we can on our side, but we have a lot of \namendments. Voting alone on this bill could take several hours. So I \nhope everybody will cooperate with Senators Grassley and Baucus and \nhelp us move this important piece of legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/14/senate-section/article/S6148-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 97, S. 1054. The clerk \nwill state the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1054) to provide for reconciliation pursuant to \n     section 201 of the concurrent resolution on the budget for \n     fiscal year 2004.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are 14 hours \nof debate on the measure to be equally divided.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield to our majority leader whatever \ntime he might consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we are now on the jobs and economic growth \npackage. By statute, the clock is running and we will have a very \nhealthy and productive debate in the next 14 hours, as the assistant \nminority leader said.\n  It is critically important that we do this in a disciplined and \norganized way. The rules are different than on the usual debate. They \nare very clear. What it means is that we need to have participation as \nearly as possible with the two leaders who will be managing this bill. \nI want to reiterate what the assistant leader said.\n  The legislation that we will be discussing--and, ultimately, I \nbelieve will pass--will clearly lower tax burdens, increase jobs, and \nexpand and grow the economy in the short term, midterm, and in the long \nterm. That is an objective I think both sides of the aisle share--\nexpansion of the economy. With that, you have job creation and an \nincrease in savings and investment.\n  The House has done its work on the bill, and now it is time for the \nSenate to do the same, to send a very clear message to the American \npeople that we are serious as a body, as an institution, as a \nGovernment, as the Congress, about creating jobs. When you say creating \njobs, you are really saying to give job security to the people who have \njobs, and also to those people across America who don't have jobs \nbut who want jobs and are willing to work, to have that opportunity.\n\n  Growing the economy is sort of a surrogate of what we say because if \nyou look at the economy and you make that pie larger and larger, in \ntruth, you are creating jobs and growing our gross domestic product in \na way that is consistent with the increased productivity of individuals \nthat has occurred over the last 15, 20 years.\n  A lot of people ask how much. It is hard to give an exact number. We \nall look for those exact numbers. How much will the Senate Finance \nCommittee jobs and tax package grow the economy? We make references to \nother proposals, and the other side of the aisle put a package on the \ntable and quantified it. The President's proposal has been quantified, \nand those numbers have been used. People are asking: What about the \npackage that passed out of the Finance Committee last night? How many \njobs will it create?\n  The Heritage Foundation's Center for Data Analysis specifically \nstudied the Senate Finance bill, and the results paint a very clear \npicture of growth--growing the economy. The study shows that the \nFinance Committee package will raise the economy's growth rate in 2004 \nfrom 3.3 to 3.6 percent. That six-tenths of 1 percent may not seem to \nbe much, but what it does do is translate into an additional 437,000 \njobs in 1 year, in 2004 alone, and an increase in gross domestic \nproduct that year of more than $42 billion.\n  I want to remind my colleagues that outside of the White House, the \nSenate is perhaps the only place in Washington where one person \nliterally can make the difference. We have seen that play out in many \nof the votes thus far this year in our very closely divided Senate. One \nvote makes a difference.\n  So I say to each of my colleagues, please remember that the people \nback you, and how you participate in this debate and in growing the \neconomy is important to our constituents--constituents in your State \nbut indeed people all across the country. We will, through this bill, \nmake a difference in the lives of each and every one of our \nconstituents. Our constituents want to feel good again about the \neconomy. They want to be able to find a job or get a better job. They \nwant to be able to grow their businesses, most of which are small \nbusinesses, as we all know. They want a fighting chance to grab a piece \nof that American dream.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to move this jobs and growth package \nthrough the Senate quickly over the course of today. We can complete \nour job in this body in preparation for a final vote in the conference \ncommittee before we leave for the Memorial Day recess. In the form that \nis created over the next really 24 to 36 hours, building upon the very \nsolid package put forth by the Finance Committee, we will be able to \ncreate jobs and we will be able to put Americans to work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are in a position where there is a \nlot of anxiety about the economy. That anxiety probably started back in \nMarch of 2000, when we first saw a downturn in the manufacturing index, \nand the manufacturing index has been in a downturn for 33 months, at \nleast as far as it relates to employment.\n  There is anxiety that the economy might go back to mid-2000 and later \nin 2000 when Nasdaq lost half its value. Then September 11 happened. \nThere is anxiety about the war on terrorism, reinforced by the murder \nof Americans in Saudi Arabia yesterday. There is anxiety about the \neconomy because of the war in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan. As far \nas war and foreign relations are concerned, there is not a lot we in \nCongress can do about it because people expect us to fight a war \nagainst terrorists. They expect us to make sure that bases for \nterrorism training against American citizens are not maintained by \nprotection of foreign countries, such as Afghanistan.\n  Americans expect us to not allow a nation such as Iraq, where there \nhas been a great deal of evidence of the existence of weapons of mass \ndestruction that could be used against American citizens, to continue \nto exist, or a nation such as Iraq that supports terrorist \norganizations such as Hezbollah or Hamas, to create greater turmoil in \nthe Middle East, threatening the oil supply coming to the United States \nwhich will affect our economy. There is not much we can do about that, \nbut the American people expect us to do what we can.\n  Also, there are some actions we can take domestically that deal with \nthe anxiety about the economy, whether it\n\n[[Page S6149]]\n\nis related to the downturn of the domestic economy or whether that \ndownturn is related to our international relations, our international \nresponsibilities, or the protection of American citizens.\n  What we are doing today is responding, as best we can, through the \ntax policy of our country, to the anxiety about the economy. We have \nhad the good fortune of a President with vision, with ideas to \nstimulate the recovery and, in the process of this legislation, as \neconomists will tell us, create more than 1 million new jobs through \nchanges in tax policy.\n  We are responding to the issues that are on the minds of Americans, \nand those issues are the need to create jobs and bringing robust growth \nto the economy.\n  I have the good fortune of serving in the Senate at the same time we \nhave a President who has a tax policy that tries to accomplish what I \nhave been working for in the Senate as a member of the Finance \nCommittee for a much longer period of time than President Bush has been \nPresident of the United States.\n  As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, that good fortune gives \nme the opportunity to work for my goals simultaneously with the goals \nthe President seeks. Many times being a member of the Senate Finance \nCommittee--I was not chairman at that particular time--I found myself \ntrying to fight what I thought were bad ideas put forth by Presidents \nof the United States on tax policy. Today I have the good fortune of \ntrying to accomplish for President Bush good things for our economy \nalong the lines that I have tried to accomplish over a long period of \ntime. Not often do Senators have that opportunity.\n  On the other hand, we faced a challenge in meeting the President's \ngoals. As many of my colleagues know, several weeks ago the Senate \nagreed upon the size of the reconciled tax relief cuts for jobs and for \ngrowth. I join many of my colleagues in wishing the reconciliation \namount had been larger, and I believe we have put together a good \nproposal, given the limitation we face of the realities of compromising \non the budget which we adopted 1 month ago.\n  I am pleased that the Finance Committee was able to report out \nlegislation that received bipartisan support, although not as broadly \nbipartisan as I had hoped. While I wish the number of supporters from \nthe other side of the aisle had been greater for final passage, I think \nthe vote reflects broad bipartisan support for a significant majority \nof the provisions in this bill.\n  The vote also reflects a common goal: to see our economy strengthened \nby tax relief policies. At least three-fourths of this bill enjoys \nbipartisan support, for instance, with major parts of the income tax \npolicy that is in this legislation, meaning personal income tax policy.\n  I believe the bill before us today is a balanced package of \nconsumption and investment incentives that will provide short-term \nstimulus and provide the building blocks for meaningful future economic \ngrowth.\n  There is wide support for the provisions that accelerate the child \ntax credit, the marriage penalty relief, expansion of the 10-percent \nbracket, almost all of the marginal rates expanding small business \nexpensing, and providing much needed alternative minimum tax relief.\n  These six provisions make up approximately $300 billion of the total \npackage of economic growth proposals before the Senate and represent \nthe three-fourths of the bill that I described that had broad \nbipartisan support. Unfortunately, from the statements by a few of my \ncolleagues, one would never know about these items having broad \nbipartisan support.\n  I believe the American people sent us here to get the people's \nbusiness done. Sadly, despite a bill that provides so much benefit to \nworking families and will create over 1 million new jobs, there are \nmany who put partisanship first and turn the other song on its head: \naccentuate the negative and eliminate the positive.\n  Let me try to counter the efforts to eliminate the positive by \nbriefly taking Members through key provisions of the bill. I will \nemphasize first those that I can say categorically would have \noverwhelming support, meaning overwhelming bipartisan support, if they \nwere voted upon separately.\n  With regard to the child tax credit, we immediately bring the child \ntax credit to $1,000 per year instead of waiting for that to be phased \nin over the rest of this decade. In addition, we also accelerate the \nrefundable portion of the child credit.\n  In other words, we are going to speed up the giving of money to \npeople who have not even paid income tax so that they benefit from our \nemphasis upon helping families with children.\n  Finally, we simplify the definition of a child for several different \ntax programs. I know it is not imaginable to the average taxpayer that \nsomehow we would complicate the Tax Code by having half a dozen \ndifferent definitions of the world ``child,'' but we do have. We \nsimplified this by expanding who is eligible and making more families \neligible for certain tax benefits. This is what that means: Over $75 \nbillion that hard-working families will get to keep in their pockets. \nThus, by far and away the biggest part of this bill is direct benefits \nthat help middle and lower income families.\n  There is one more thing. Not only are hard-working families getting \nthe biggest benefits, they are first in line to get the benefits of \nthis bill because we include the President's proposal that would send \nchecks--rebate checks, if you want to call them that--to those who \nreceive the child credit in their 2002 tax year. The Treasury \nDepartment states that these checks will be sent out within 6 weeks of \nCongress approving this bill. So in just a few weeks, eligible families \nwill receive a check from the Treasury of up to $400 per child.\n  Why $400 per child? Because presently the child credit is $600 and it \nwould not reach $1,000 until later in this decade, gradually phased in. \nWe make that $1,000 credit effective right now for the year 2004.\n  Now, there is another very popular change in this bill that a vast \nmajority of this body believes should have been done a long time ago \nand was done in the year 2001 tax bill but phased in over this decade. \nWhat we do is provide marriage penalty relief of $51 billion in this \npackage to de-emphasize the penalty for people being married, meaning \nthey pay a higher tax bill than people who would have the same incomes \nnot being married. So these people will not be penalized for being \nmarried and having both husband and wife working.\n  It also enhances tax relief for those families where one spouse \ndecides to stay home and spend their time, rather than outside the \nfamily and the workforce, doing that work in the family, raising kids. \nAs my wife reminds me, raising the family is one of the hardest and \nmost important jobs, and that has been emphasized very effectively by \nthe President of the United States.\n  So the marriage penalty would have been phased in over this decade, \nand now, retroactive to January 1, 2004, we are going to have the \nmarriage penalty fully brought in under the 2001 tax bill policy.\n  There is another problem particularly for middle-income taxpayers, \nand that is how the alternative minimum tax is hitting an increasing \nnumber of American taxpayers. The bill before us actually ensures that \nfewer Americans will be subject to the alternative minimum tax through \nthe year 2005, and we devote $49 billion in this bill to addressing the \nalternative minimum tax.\n  I want to be candid with the taxpayers of America and tell them that \nwe are not doing in this bill, because of costs now, what we did in \n1999 when, during the Clinton administration, the Senate and House sent \nto the President a bill abolishing the alternative minimum tax. That \nwas vetoed by President Clinton. I am sure I am going to have Members \non the other side of the aisle saying we are not doing enough for the \nalternative minimum tax. I hope they remember that when it was not as \nfar down the road as it is now on covering more Americans being hit by \nthe alternative minimum tax, this Congress had the foresight to do away \nwith the alternative minimum tax and President Clinton vetoed it.\n\n  In this regard of how we handle the alternative minimum tax, we \neliminate more people from being hit by the alternative minimum tax \nthan we would have under the 2001 tax law.\n  In another area where we want to increase investment to create jobs, \nthe bill provides for increasing expensing of depreciable investment by \nsmall\n\n[[Page S6150]]\n\nbusiness. We increase that from a $25,000 a year write-off to a $75,000 \na year write-off, to encourage expansion and investment by small \nbusiness today and the new jobs that will result from that small \nbusiness investment.\n  The acceleration of the expansion of the tax brackets at the 10 \npercent bracket benefits all taxpayers and will mean thousands of \ntaxpayers no longer even owe Federal income tax. That 10 percent \nbracket relief reports $44 billion of revenue loss in this bill, \nmeaning that people hit by the 10 percent bracket will pay $44 billion \nless in taxes. This is another one of the provisions in the 2001 tax \nbill that would have been phased in over the next decade that we are \nbringing back effective January 1, 2004, fully implemented.\n  The reduction of tax rates at all other levels--and this does reduce \nmarginal tax rates back to January 1, 2004, rates that would have \notherwise been reduced gradually over the rest of this decade, making \nthose marginal tax rates fully effective this year. The reduction of \nthe top rate amounts to less than 7 percent of the total cost of this \npackage, although I fear that many speakers will have us think it is 93 \npercent from all the words spent on this matter.\n  The reduction of all tax rates will help the husband and wife who, \nafter years of hard work, have finally achieved good paying jobs and \nnow face the triple threat. That triple threat is the cost of paying \nfor their children going to college, saving for their own retirement \nand, oddly enough, probably helping their own parents in retirement.\n  The reductions of rates as well as expensing will help small business \nowners, as in my own city of Dubuque, IA, and small business owners \nacross the country. These small business folks are key to job creation. \nIf they hire more workers, if they expand their businesses, we are all \nbetter off.\n  That brings me to the point of who most benefits from the reductions \nof rates as well as small business expensing: The people who are hired \nby the small business owner. What this bill is all about is the \ncreation of jobs. Of all the people benefiting, it is going to be those \nwho want to work and will have an opportunity to work because of the 1 \nmillion-plus jobs that will be created by this legislation. These new \njobs and the people who will be in them do not show up on any of the \ncharts that we will see. They do not show up on the benefit table. But \nit is those people and their families who benefit greatly from this \nbill.\n\n  This is jobs creation legislation. This is based on the presumption \nthat if money is in the taxpayers' pockets and 110 million taxpayers in \nAmerica decide how that money is going to be spent or invested, it will \ndo more economic good, turn over the economy many more times, than if \nit comes through the Federal Treasury and 535 Members of Congress \ndecide how it will be divided.\n  Do not buy into the argument: How can we afford a tax cut when the \nbudget deficit is what it is. A lot of the same Members who are going \nto be bringing that issue forward are some of the same Members who \noffered amendments on the Budget Act or offered amendments on the \nappropriations bill in January to spend more money. A lot of the votes \non the budget took money away from tax relief in the budget and spent \nit somewhere else. Anyone who is concerned about the budget deficit \nought to have reduced taxes and put it against the bottom line, not \nspend it someplace else.\n  The conclusion can be drawn that a lot of Members expressing concern \nover the budget deficit are not really concerned about the budget \ndeficit but want more tax money coming through the Federal budget, \nthrough the Federal Treasury, so 535 Members of Congress can spend the \nmoney rather than 110 million American taxpayers having it in their \npockets.\n  I happen to believe how 535 Members of Congress spend the money is \nnot going to respond to the dynamics of our free market system, \ncompared to 110 million taxpayers making the decision of how that money \nis spent.\n  Much of the discussion I have spoken about, worry of the budget \ndeficit, is going to be related to discussion regarding the top rate \nand whether or not we should reduce the top rate from 38.6 to 35. \nRemember, that was already legislated in 2001 but not going to be fully \neffective until the year 2006. We made a judgment that putting money \ninto the pockets of people who will invest it and create jobs, \nparticularly small business owners, is better to do now, starting \nJanuary 1, 2004, rather than waiting until 2006.\n  For those listening, do not look exclusively at the number of \ntaxpayers impacted by those rates. Such an analysis fails to tell a \ncomplete story about the efficacy and efficiency of lowering top rates \nand seems to focus instead on who gets what in a distributional sense, \nnot the economic good that comes from the policy decisions.\n  In my opinion, the better way to think about it is to focus on: One, \nwhat most efficiently changes behavior of taxpayers; two, what provides \nincentives for the creation of jobs; and, three, what has the largest \nmultiplier effect on the economy. And by ``multiplier effect,'' I mean \nwhat is going to be done with the money by the 110 million taxpayers \nwho create jobs. That has to be one of two ways. Either they spend it \nand it enhances two-thirds of the economy related to consumer spending \nor it will be invested and, with investment, the creation of jobs.\n  We will hear a lot about distributional analysis of how this tax bill \nmight affect certain classes of taxpayers. It also ignores the fact \nthat successful businesses--in other words, profitable businesses that \npay proportionately higher taxes and the highest marginal tax rates--\nare the ones who will disproportionately add the most labor and \ncapital. This is an important point to keep in mind.\n\n  Everyone knows most of my livelihood outside of Congress or even \nwhile I have been in Congress has been from farming. But throughout my \nlifetime I have had jobs with small business people in the Waterloo-\nCedar Falls area of Iowa. I have had those jobs because I started out \nas a small farmer. If you are farming 80 acres, you cannot make a \nliving so you moonlight someplace else to provide income to support \nyour family. I had an opportunity to work at a little business called \nUniversal Hoist. We made grain-moving equipment for farmers and grain \nelevators to buy. That business is still operating in Cedar Falls. I \nworked 10 years, from 1961 to 1971, as an assembly line worker at a \ncompany called Waterloo Register Company. We made furnace registers. I \nhad the beautiful job of putting screw holes in those registers. Do \nthat for 10 years and you have a lot of time to think about public \npolicy, too, I guess. Regardless, that is what I did. That factory \nclosed down in 1971. It no longer exists.\n  The point I make about higher income people, they provide jobs for \npeople in my State. They probably provide a lot more jobs than the John \nDeeres and Maytags. These are outstanding businesses in my State and I \ndo not denigrate their contribution to the economy. I had jobs because \nof small entrepreneurs investing and creating a job for me that I could \nnot create for myself on an 80-acre farm. I created a part-time job on \nan 80-acre farm. Someone else invested money. These were middle-income \ntaxpayers, as I knew them at that time. It takes people with money to \ncreate jobs.\n  Also, people who have money have not always been rich. And they are \nnot always going to be rich. We have economic mobility studies that \nshow that. One might get the opinion from debate on this bill--and I \nhope I am accurately anticipating because I have heard these debates \nbefore. One gets the idea from the debates on class warfare that \nsomehow people who are poor in America are poor throughout their \nlifetime, and people who are rich are rich throughout their lifetime. \nPeople at the top levels have problems and they come down, and there is \ngreat mobility upwards in our society. I want people who discuss we are \nnot doing enough for the poor or we are doing too much for the rich in \nAmerica, I want these Members to understand the studies show as we \ndivide our working people into quintiles of income, these studies show \nthe people in the lowest quintile after 10 years have moved to the \nsecond, third, and fourth quintile, maybe some even up to the fifth \nquintile. But there is only 10 percent of the original 20 percent in \nthe lower quintile after 10 years. That is 2 percent of our workforce.\n  There is great upward mobility. Those studies also show a lot of \npeople\n\n[[Page S6151]]\n\nin the top quintile after 10 years are not in the top quintile. There \nis mobility downward.\n  What we are talking about in this legislation to create jobs, to give \ntax relief to American workers, is to give small business, and even \nlarge business, an incentive to create jobs in one of two ways: Either \ntake the money and invest it and create jobs rather than spending it \nfor you or for consumers to take their extra money and buy things and \ncreate consumer demand, in turn creating jobs.\n  It also has something to do with enhancing the capital-to-labor \nratio. That is because when capital is more available, when there is a \nsurplus of capital, that is when labor in America does its best because \nlabor is going to be much more in demand when there is a surplus of \ncapital. That is where labor is going to make its progress, with higher \nwages and more jobs being created. This bill will enhance the capital-\nto-labor ratio.\n  To further be definitive on what I have said as a philosophical \nstatement with statements that are backed up by studies that have been \nmade, we have, as far as cutting the marginal tax rate is concerned, \nstudies suggesting that a 5 percentage point reduction in the top \nmarginal tax rate would increase small business investment by as much \nas 10 percent. The Treasury has indicated that 80 percent of the \nbenefits from the top rate acceleration go to small business.\n  I will digress for a minute to talk about something that troubles me \nabout the debate on bringing down the top rate to 35 percent. Some \nfolks, especially those who have acquired their wealth through \nprofessions, big business, or inheritance, are the ones most violently \nopposed to reducing the top rate. It makes you wonder why these people \nso oppose bringing down the tax burden on businesses that they probably \ndo not even know about--small business.\n  I gave this some thought while I was out in the field helping to \nplant corn the other day. I asked myself, Could it be that they are \nenvious? No, that doesn't make sense because these folks generally have \nmore money than successful small business people.\n  I asked myself another question: Could it be they do not want others, \nmaybe those looking to make the transition from modest success to very \nsuccessful status, to make that transition that is possible given the \neconomic mobility of our society? Could it be that they see high taxes \nas a way to bar others from moving up? Could it be that they believe \nhigh taxes are the necessary tool to block successful small business \npeople? Could it be that these elitists want to block a class of people \nwho move up because of hard work rather than by pedigree? Could it be \nthat high taxes on small businesses is a way to sustain the status quo?\n  I hope that is not true, but it makes you wonder. I know in the \nheartland of America people do not resent or try to block success of \nthose who acquire it through developing small businesses. In my State \nof Iowa, the opinion of a successful small business person is very \nimportant, if not more important, than that of a corporate CEO.\n  I was amused to read some press reports about how K Street lobbyists \nand the Fortune 500 have reservations about this Finance Committee bill \nbefore us. There were too many revenue raisers, too many loophole \nclosers, too much to ask from big business.\n  I would like to ask a different question. Are we doing enough for \nsmall business and the people who want to hire them? I want to focus on \nthat question. Small businesses, as I have indicated, are engines of \ngrowth for our economy. In the recent past, they have been the source \nof most newly created jobs. I also continue to believe it is important \nto ensure that small businesses do not operate at a competitive \ndisadvantage vis-a-vis large corporations because they are forced to \npay higher marginal income tax rates. Currently, successful small \nbusinesses incur a 10-percent rate penalty when compared to their big \nbusiness counterparts. In other words, if you are not incorporated, you \npay the higher marginal tax rate of 38 percent. There is a bias in \nfavor of corporations away from small business, individual \nentrepreneurs, because of the 38-percent bracket on personal income \nversus the 35-percent bracket for the corporate tax rate.\n\n  Even common sense would tell you that does not make good economic \nsense. Why should you have a bias in the Tax Code against people who do \nnot want to incorporate?\n  I want to leave that issue now and turn to the last major part of the \nbill, and that is the part of the bill that provides for a partial \nexclusion of dividend income from taxes. As my colleagues know, the \nPresident called for a complete end to this double taxation of \ndividends. He would even go further, as I would, and say that double \ntaxation of anything is wrong, dividends or otherwise. I have to admit \nthat our bill is not a bill that is an absolute victory against double \ntaxation because the proposal as reported covers only 86 percent of \ndividend-receiving taxpayers and is a good step in the effort to \neliminate economic distortion resulting from that tax policy framework. \nWhen in full effect, this policy would ensure that dividends would be \nsubject to the top rate of 28 percent. All other ordinary income would \nbe subject to a top rate of 35 percent. This means that dividend income \nwould enjoy a significant preference over other forms of periodic \ninvestment income such as interest.\n  Let me note to my colleagues that we provide State fiscal relief in \nthis bill. A lot of Senators, over a 2-year period of time, have talked \nto me about the necessity of doing this, both members of the Senate \nFinance Committee as well as people even in my own Republican caucus, \nand people who are not on the Senate committee. They have been \nindicating to me that they view State fiscal relief as a key component \nto an overall agreement on taxes and on growth.\n  To be perfectly candid, we have Members of this body, right or wrong, \nwho are telling us if we don't have something in here for fiscal \nrelief, this bill is not going to get 51 votes to pass. Like it or not, \nthey have a great deal of leverage. So we are dealing with that and \nhopefully dealing with it in a responsible way, through programs where \nthere has been a Federal/State partnership, such as Medicaid. There are \nsome areas where there has not necessarily been a State/Federal \npartnership. These funds, under our agreement--and there will be an \namendment that fleshes this out to a greater extent--could be used for \neducation, health care, law enforcement, and essential Government \nservices. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on \nthis important issue as we start filling in the details of that that \nwill be part of an amendment offered later on.\n  I conclude by commenting briefly about the offsets that are in this \nbill.\n  Let me first note that there has been some surprise in the media \nabout the fact that these are offsets. I respond by saying that if the \nmedia is somehow shocked that we would have offsets, they haven't been \npaying attention to a lot of tax bills which have been going through \nhere. The fact is you are not going to get a tax bill through this body \nunder what you call regular order unless there is unanimous consent to \ndo it without a point of order. If there is a point of order, you have \nto have 60 votes, or you have to avoid a point of order, which is hard \nto do, by having offsets, meaning it would be revenue neutral.\n  As the President's own spokesperson stated, the President in his \nbudget provided several billions of dollars in offsets--not necessarily \nthe same ones we are using in this bill. In addition, my counterpart in \nthe House has stated that he will look to offsets to pay for \nimprovements in the international tax arena. Offsets are not new.\n  I will not discuss all the offsets at this point. But my colleagues \nshould know that many of these offsets deal with the scandals we have \nseen recently at Enron and many other bad actors in corporate America.\n  That is not denigrating corporate America because the bad actors are \na few compared to tens of thousands of legitimate, ethical, honest \ncorporations in America.\n  It is my view that while we are trying to help shareholders with \nreductions in dividends, we should also be closing down the loopholes, \nthe games and the gimmicks that executives have been playing. The \nshareholders and the workers--and many of the workers who also own \nshares--have been greatly\n\n[[Page S6152]]\n\nharmed by the actions of corrupt executives. This bill takes great \nstrides in ending these loopholes.\n  Thus, shareholders benefit greatly from the dividend deductions as \nwell as our efforts to end the fast and loose games being played in \nsome corporate suites.\n  I haven't thanked Senator Baucus yet for his continued efforts to \nwork with me despite our inability to find common ground on all the \nelements of this economic recovery package. Senator Baucus, ranking \nDemocrat and former chairman of the committee, has worked very hard to \nhelp me move this bill along even though he could not vote for it in \ncommittee. That is particularly in the tradition of our committee. \nRarely does a bill come to this floor where he and I are not on the \nsame side of the fence. Yet there are going to be a lot more bills \ncoming to the floor this year, as before, on which we are on the same \nside of the fence.\n  I look forward to continuing to work through our differences to \nproduce legislation that will be helpful and getting things moving \nagain as quickly and effectively as possible.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 555\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 555.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To increase the criminal monetary penalty limitation for the \n            underpayment or overpayment of tax due to fraud)\n\n       At the end of part I of subtitle C of title III add the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 335. INCREASE IN CRIMINAL MONETARY PENALTY LIMITATION \n                   FOR THE UNDERPAYMENT OR OVERPAYMENT OF TAX DUE \n                   TO FRAUD.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 7206 (relating to fraud and false \n     statements) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``Any person who--'' and inserting ``(a) In \n     General.--Any person who--'', and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(b) Increase in Monetary Limitation for Underpayment or \n     Overpayment of Tax Due To Fraud.--If any portion of any \n     underpayment (as defined in section 6664(a)) or overpayment \n     (as defined in section 6401(a)) of tax required to be shown \n     on a return is attributable to fraudulent action described in \n     subsection (a), the applicable dollar amount under subsection \n     (a) shall in no event be less than an amount equal to such \n     portion. A rule similar to the rule under section 6663(b) \n     shall apply for purposes of determining the portion so \n     attributable.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to underpayments and overpayments attributable to \n     actions occurring after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I very much thank my friend and colleague, \nSenator Grassley, chairman of our committee. He has done an excellent \njob working on this bill. As he said, I do not support the bill but I \ndo support the process and the will of the Senate to proceed; let \nSenators vote as they wish. That is, frankly, why we are standing \nhere--to get things done, although we may not always agree.\n  I now yield to the Senator from Illinois 15 minutes from the time on \nour side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Montana.\n  I would like to acknowledge my friendship and respect for the Senator \nfrom Iowa. We have been working together, as we will in the future. We \ncome from neighboring States and have a lot of neighboring concerns. I \nthink we will find common ground in the future to work on many issues. \nI look forward to that opportunity.\n  Let me tell you that today we couldn't be further apart. There is \nsuch a chasm and such a divide between those who support this bill and \nthose who oppose it. It really comes down to a very fundamental issue. \nIt is not a question of who is good and who is evil or who is right and \nwho is wrong. It comes down to the way you look at the world. The way \nSenator Grassley looks at the world as he describes it in his opening \nremarks and the way he puts the reasoning forward for this legislation \ndescribes a vision of the world. I have a different view of the world.\n  It comes down to this: From Senator Grassley's point of view, when it \ncomes to taxes in America, our Government should find ways to provide \nmore comfort, more help, and more financial assistance to the elite in \nAmerica, the investors who have made a lot of money, successful \nbusinesspeople--those who have done well in America, some by their own \nhard work, some by virtue of being born into a family with a lot of \nmoney. But the belief of the Senator from Iowa and those who support \nthe President's tax package is that those are the people who really are \nthe future and hope of America; if we can just make life more \ncomfortable for them, if we can give them more of our national \nresources, then the economy will move forward and all boats will rise. \nThat is their view of the world--help the elite and America will be \nbetter off.\n\n  On this side of the aisle, we see it a little differently. We kind of \nview the world in terms of the people who get up every morning and go \nto work and struggle--teachers, policemen, firefighters, people who own \nsmall businesses, those who get up and work every day for a paycheck \nand pay more in payroll taxes than they do in income taxes--and some \nwho are struggling under difficult family circumstances. From our point \nof view, if we focus on these God-fearing, middle-income, hard-working \nAmericans and give them a helping hand, give them an additional small \nslice of the pie so they can enrich their lives, we on this side of the \naisle believe that America will be stronger; these people will have \nstronger families, stronger neighborhoods, stronger churches, stronger \nschools, and they will spend their money building a stronger economy in \neach community.\n  We have two very different views of the world.\n  Senator Grassley, a Republican, sees the Bush tax plan as a way of \nhelping the elite. We on the Democratic side believe it is far more \nimportant to make certain that what we do is fair and balanced, \nparticularly when it comes to working families who are struggling to \nget by.\n  Senator Grassley said in his opening remarks that ``it takes people \nwith money to create jobs.'' I quote him. That is his point of view. \nThat is his philosophy. It takes people with money to create jobs. What \nhe overlooks is the fact that people who may not be rich, when given a \ntax break, will spend it. They will buy washers, dryers, refrigerators, \nand stoves in addition to a house, paying their bills, and making \ncertain their kids are taken care of and the school tuition is paid.\n  I suggest to the Senator from Iowa and those of his point of view \nthat it not only takes people with money to create jobs, but to create \njobs you ought to give people who are struggling every single day with \nthe burdens of family life a helping hand. In so doing, they will help \nus create jobs.\n  The Senator from Iowa said, incidentally, that this is about class \nwarfare; the speech I am giving is about class warfare.\n  A month ago, we had a visit from a man named Warren Buffett. He is \none of my favorites. You may have heard of him. He is one of the most \nsuccessful businessmen in the world. He lives in Omaha, NE. He owns a \ncompany called Berkshire Hathaway. He is extremely successful. Warren \nBuffett came to talk to us, as he does once in a while, about his view \nof the world. I always enjoy it. I think his annual report should be \nmust-reading for anybody interested in American business because he has \nsuch a refreshing and honest point of view.\n  We asked Warren Buffett, the second wealthiest man in America, about \nthis claim of class warfare and this tax bill. He said: You bet there's \nclass warfare going on, and my class is winning. He said: My class is \nwinning. And he is right.\n\n  This bill is designed so Warren Buffett and the wealthiest people in \nAmerica will get the tax breaks. Warren Buffett knows that is unfair. \nHe said that publicly. I think most Americans know it is unfair.\n  Take a look at this morning's New York Times. Consider this for a \nmoment: Despite all of the hectoring by\n\n[[Page S6153]]\n\nrightwing television, despite all of the best efforts of the President \nof the United States visiting America from one corner to the next, \ndespite all the speeches by Republicans in Congress, this is what the \nAmerican people think about the debate in which we are engaged.\n  Question to the American people, across the board: Which is a better \nway to improve the national economy: cutting taxes or reducing the \nFederal budget deficit? Simple choice. Well, 31 percent said: cut \ntaxes, which is what Senator Grassley, President Bush, and the \nRepublicans propose. But 58 percent said: reduce the deficit--almost 2 \nto 1.\n  The American people get it. They understand this cutting taxes is not \nthe answer to every problem, and yet that is all we hear from this \nWhite House.\n  Then they asked the American people: Have the reductions in Federal \ntaxes enacted since 2001 under President Bush been good for the \neconomy, bad for the economy, or have they made much difference? So \nthink about this, for a tax cut which most people usually applaud, they \nasked the American people: Take a look at the President's last tax cut. \nDid it help the economy or did it not? Those who said it was good for \nthe economy, 19 percent; those who said it was bad for the economy, 12 \npercent--not much difference: 63 percent.\n  We took $1 trillion out of the Federal Treasury, gave it to the \nwealthiest people in America, ran our deficit to record levels, and by \na margin of 63 percent to 19 percent the American people said it did \nnot make much difference to those who said: Good idea. Do it again.\n  Then they asked the American people: If adopted, do you think \nPresident Bush's latest tax cut will or will not make a significant \ndifference in the amount of money you have after taxes? Will: 33 \npercent; will not: 58 percent.\n  The American people understand. The winners in the Bush tax bill are \nthe elite in America. It isn't the working families and small \nbusinesses that will come out ahead. They are going to be saddled with \nthis deficit created by a tax cut when the country is in recession, a \ntax cut when we are still trying to find out how much we are going to \npay for the war in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan and the war against \nterrorism.\n  Then, the final question: Would a new tax cut be good for the \neconomy, bad for the economy, or won't have much effect? Good: 41 \npercent--not bad, huh?--and then those who said bad or won't have much \neffect: 52 percent. So a majority of the American people think it is \neither not going to have any impact or it is going to be bad.\n  They get it. They understand it.\n  I listen to my fiscally conservative Republicans come to this floor \nand say: For goodness' sake, don't mention the ``D'' word. Don't \nmention deficits. Deficits don't count anymore. Deficits aren't \nimportant. Why are you Democrats tied in knots over deficits?\n  Well, the reason they do not want to talk about it is because the \nrecord is so miserable. Look where we are ``Stuck in the Bushes'': \nFederal deficits, surpluses, and then deficits again. Here we have a \nrunup, from the first President Bush, a bad deficit situation; then the \nbeginning years of the Clinton administration, deficits, still red ink; \nfinally, at the end of the Clinton years, we break out of it, and for \nthe first time in over 30 years we start generating surpluses in \nAmerica; and then comes President George W. Bush, and here we go again, \nred ink for as far as the eye can see. My fiscally conservative \nRepublican friends say: It doesn't count.\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator aware of some statements made by some of our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle?\n  For example, I quote Senator Santorum. And this is from the \nPittsburgh Post Gazette on November 15, 1995:\n\n       The American people are sick and tired of excuses for \n     inaction to balance the budget. The public wants us to stay \n     the course towards a balanced budget, and we take that \n     obligation quite seriously.\n\n  I quote the majority leader at the time, Senator Trent Lott:\n\n       I think the most important thing really does involve the \n     budget, keeping a balanced budget, not dipping into Social \n     Security, and continuing to reduce the national debt.\n\n  I quote Senator Hagel, from the Omaha World Herald, on February 6, \n1997:\n\n       The real threat to Social Security is the national debt. If \n     we don't act to balance the budget and stop adding to the \n     debt, then we are truly placing the future of Social Security \n     in jeopardy.\n\n  Final quote--there are others--but the final quote I will give you is \nfrom Senator Judd Gregg. This is from the New Hampshire Sunday News, \nFebruary 1, 1998:\n\n       As long as we have a Republican Congress, we're going to \n     have a balanced budget, and if we can get a Republican \n     President, we can start paying down the debt on the Federal \n     government.\n\n  I give you these quotes.\n  Also, very soon, in the next few days, we are going to take up the \nissue of increasing the national debt by almost $1 trillion. So will \nthe Senator comment on these direct quotes from Republican leaders and \nthe fact we are being asked by the President of the United States to \nincrease the national debt by almost $1 trillion in the next few days?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Nevada, it is totally unfair to \ncall out the quotes of our Republican colleagues about deficits because \nhe has failed to take into account this new era of compassionate \nconservatism. Things have changed. The Senator from Nevada, in all \nfairness, should understand when Republicans stood on the floor of the \nSenate and the House and railed against deficits, it was before we came \ninto this new era where deficits don't count. We are now in a new era \nwhere the debt we are leaving our children is not important. What is \nimportant is giving tax breaks to the elite in America.\n  The Senator, once he comes to grips with this, once he comes to \nunderstand this, will really understand the Bush economic policy. But I \nsay to the Senator, he is in good company because I struggle with this \nconcept, and the majority of the American people do. This just does not \ncompute and it does not work.\n\n  For the President and his supporters to stand before us and say this \nBush tax plan is going to increase jobs--take a look at the job growth \nwe have seen in the last few years. Take a look, starting with \nPresident Truman, at all the job growth, and then take a look at what \nhas happened when we get to President George W. Bush.\n  The President told us, 2 years ago: If you will just let me cut taxes \non the wealthy, America is going to have more jobs.\n  Well, we have lost 2 million jobs. Sorry, Mr. President, you missed \nit by a mile.\n  Now he says, this time around, the best thing for us to do is more of \nthe same. I can tell you that more of the same is not good for America. \nTake a look at those who are facing long-term unemployment: 6 percent. \nIt is back to the highest rate--President Bush has not matched his \nfather's 7.5-percent unemployment rate, but he is creeping up there. It \nis higher and higher each year. That does not say much for his economic \nplan.\n  I think America gets it. The President, as Commander in Chief, is \nsounding retreat when it comes to the economy of America. He is walking \naway from the greatest challenge our families face today. It is not \njust the threat of terrorism; it is the threat of economic insecurity.\n  Let me be specific. The Republican plan does not address, does not \nspend one dollar, does not even concern itself with an overwhelming \nissue I find from businesses across Illinois: the cost of health \ninsurance. Go to any business--large or small--and ask them what they \nare facing. Ask them what the premiums are. They are going to tell you \nthat the health premiums are killing them, killing their \ncompetitiveness, killing their ability to offer health insurance \nprotection to their employees. Many of them are facing absolutely awful \nchoices they have to make.\n  Not one penny, not one word, not one provision in the Bush plan for \nbusinesses deals with health insurance, but the Democratic plan does. \nThe Democratic plan provides that we are going to increase the tax \ncredit, a small business tax credit for those offering insurance for \ntheir employees.\n  I will tell you, I will take that to any chamber of commerce, any \nmeeting of\n\n[[Page S6154]]\n\nthe National Federation of Independent Businesses--you pick it--and let \nthem decide which is better for the future of their business, a tax \ncredit for health insurance or reducing the tax rate on the wealthiest \npeople in America. I will take that referendum and I will go to the \nbank on that one. I know what the outcome is going to be.\n  What we believe is that there should be a tax cut, if there is going \nto be one, for every American taxpayer, particularly for those in lower \nincome categories. We should accelerate the child tax credit to $800, \neven higher than the Republicans have proposed. We should eliminate the \nmarriage penalty. We should have a small business health tax credit. We \nshould triple the amount that small businesses can expense. We should \nencourage business investment. We should make certain that we limit the \namount of this tax cut to what we can afford; otherwise, we are digging \nourselves deeper and deeper and deeper in this deficit hole.\n  The Republicans who push this tax plan have to face stubborn facts, \nand facts can be stubborn. The last time they got a tax cut through, \nthe American economy fell backward. We did not make progress. We lost \njobs. We lost opportunity. We lost a lot of hope in this country.\n  We need to move forward. We can do it with a sensible tax plan, one \nthat does not reward the elite but rewards working Americans across the \nboard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 more minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator would allow me to ask him a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Montana yield?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 5 minutes off the amendment to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator from Illinois aware that the Congressional \nBudget Office, the White House Council of Economic Advisors, and the \nprivate sector economists who helped the President analyze this \nproposal have stated that the President's tax break plan will weaken \nthe long-term health of our economy? This is from the Congressional \nBudget Office, the first part of April of this year. Is the Senator \naware that these institutions and individuals have so stated?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Nevada, the interesting thing \nabout that is--I was aware of it--this is the new Congressional Budget \nOffice that brought us the new economic concept of dynamic growth. The \nRepublican conservatives have been screaming for years that the \nDemocrats and those following their point of view were too \nconservative: We don't take into account what a tax cut will do, that \nit will just mushroom growth. Here comes the new Congressional Budget \nOffice. They are now believers in this new dynamic growth economic \nreligion, and they still don't buy it. As the Senator from Nevada said, \nthey believe as we do, that this Bush tax plan for the elite investors \nis not going to create jobs or create the kind of growth that we want \nto see. I think the Senator from Nevada has pinpointed one of the \nweaknesses in their argument.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator aware that in the State of Illinois the \nnumber of jobs lost since the beginning of the Bush administration is \nnearly 200,000, and last month alone it was almost 20,000 jobs?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am aware of it. Virtually every State has lost jobs. We \nhave lost over 20,000 manufacturing jobs in the last 12 months with the \nlast Bush tax cut. Adding insult to injury is the fact that this \nadministration resists providing additional unemployment compensation \nfor people who are out of work. When his father faced recession, five \ndifferent times we increased unemployment compensation, three times \nunder President Bush, and twice under President Clinton. We have only \ndone it twice in this situation.\n  To me, it is heartless to ignore what is happening to unemployed \npeople. They have lost good jobs. Some of them have been victims of \ncorporate scandals. They are in trouble, trying to find some way to get \nby. Every single day is a challenge. We find over a fourth of them have \nhad to leave their homes and move in with family and friends. We find \nover half of them struggling to pay utility bills. More and more of \nthem are paying less for food and clothing for their family and \nultimately many of them are losing health insurance--words Republicans \ndon't want to talk about, the cost of health insurance. That is an \nindication of what we should be focusing on in terms of our priorities. \nInstead, what we are doing is increasing the deficit at the expense of \nSocial Security and Medicare. That is not fair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be temporarily laid aside and that the amendment to be \noffered by the Senator from North Dakota be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 556\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself and \n     Mr. Baucus, proposes an amendment numbered 556.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Wold.\n       Tara Zimmerman.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me briefly describe the amendment I \noffer on behalf of myself and Senator Baucus. This amendment deals with \nrepealing the 1993 provision that would increase the amount of Social \nSecurity income received by a senior citizen to be reported for tax \npurposes. Let me describe the history of this a bit and then talk about \nwhy I believe we ought to do it.\n  For a good many years after Social Security was created, the Social \nSecurity receipts that a senior citizen would receive would not be \nrequired to be reported for tax purposes on their income tax return. It \nwas exempt income. Then at one point the Congress decided that one-half \nof the payments for Social Security that go to a recipient should be \ndescribed as income on their income tax return. So we went for a long \nwhile with 50 percent of the Social Security payments to senior \ncitizens being required to be reported for tax purposes.\n  In 1993, in a rather large piece of legislation that moved this \ncountry towards a different fiscal policy in a very significant way--\nthe results of which throughout the 1990s expanded the economy, created \njobs, did a number of things--one of the provisions was to increase \nfrom 50 percent to 85 percent the amount of income that would be \nrequired to be subject to income tax and reported on the tax return for \nsingle beneficiaries with incomes over $34,000, married couples income \nover $44,000. So moving that 50 percent to 85 percent now means that \nroughly 8 million senior citizens pay an average increased income tax \nof about $1,500 a piece per year. I propose that we repeal that \nprovision, go back to previous law which is a 50-percent reporting \nrequirement.\n  Let me talk for a moment about the Social Security issue and senior \ncitizens. There is discussion on the Senate floor--and there will be \nmuch more, I expect--that this tax proposal that comes to the Senate \nwill use all of the trust funds that are to be set aside for Social \nSecurity to pay for tax cuts. I don't think that is going to be \ndisputed. I don't think that is subject to contest. There will not be \nSocial Security trust funds if we pass this tax cut.\n  This is a circumstance where upper income Americans will receive very \ngenerous tax cuts and senior citizens will see their Social Security \ntrust funds depleted in order to finance it.\n  I mentioned yesterday that on page 4 of the Budget Act, which brings \nus to the floor under reconciliation, the description of what is \nhappening to the debt is it goes from $6.7 trillion to $12 trillion in \na decade.\n  Some say: That is not much to worry about. Don't worry about debt.\n  I don't understand that. The debt, of course, is going to be \ninherited by our children because they will inherit this economy and \nthis country. We are saying to them: We have a new plan. Our fiscal \npolicy plan will double the Federal debt to $12 trillion in 10 years.\n  I have never heard of a plan doubling the debt described as a \nsuccess. But that is what I am hearing in the Senate. This is a plan \nthat is gearing this country towards long-term economic solvency, \neconomic opportunity, growth, hope, and most especially jobs by \ndoubling the Federal debt to $12 trillion--a rather curious argument.\n  I managed to teach economics for a couple of years. I don't think \nthere is anything in any book anywhere that would have you teach this \nlesson. This is apparently a new form of economic theory.\n  I recall the book written by Tom Brokaw called ``The Greatest \nGeneration.'' I have visited with many of the folks described in that \nbook, the folks who lie on their belly on the sands of Normandy, \nrisking their lives for their country, seeing their comrades die in \nfoxholes beside them, those who were asked to go halfway around the \nworld to fight for liberty and did so without complaint, never asked \nfor much, but were told by this country a couple things: When you get \nback from serving your country, we will provide free health care for \nlife for you in the veterans health care system.\n  That turned out to be a promise this Congress is unwilling to keep, \nregrettably. They also were told: When you come back, there will be a \nSocial Security system you can count on; you can rely on. Of course, \nwhat is happening now is we have people who don't support that system, \ndon't believe we ought to keep the promise, don't believe trust funds \nought to include the word ``trust.''\n  If I can digress for a moment, I recall one day going to a veterans \nhospital in Fargo, ND, about which I have told my Senate colleagues \nbefore.\n  When we talk about the greatest generation and senior citizens, I \nwent to a veterans hospital on a Sunday morning to provide the medals \nthat had been earned by a Native American veteran. His name was Edmond \nYoung Eagle. He was dying of lung cancer. I learned later that he died \na week after I had been there. His sisters asked if we could get his \nmedals, and so I did. I presented them to him at the VA hospital that \nSunday morning. The doctors and nurses gathered, and his sisters were \nthere. We cranked up his bed so that he was in a seated position, and I \npinned the medals he had earned during the Second World War on his \npajama top.\n  Edmond Young Eagle never had much in life. He fought in Africa and in \nEurope, and he went where this country asked him to go. He risked his \nlife and served America with great distinction. He came back to live on \nthe reservation, and he never had very much, never had a very good \nlife. He had it pretty tough. That day, on a Sunday morning, having the \nmedals that he earned 50 years previously pinned on his pajama tops, \nEdmond Young Eagle, 7 days from dying of lung cancer, said: ``This is \none of the proudest days of my life.'' He didn't have much, but he \ndeeply valued the service he had given his country. I told him how much \nthis country valued the service he had provided and how proud we were \nof him.\n  Edmond Young Eagle and millions of others have answered the call to \nserve this country in so many ways. I talk about the greatest \ngeneration. Yes, it was the soldiers and it was ``Rosie the Riveter'' \nback then. Moving forward, so many people have served this country, and \nthis country made a bargain with them and a promise to them. We said to \nthem: If you will pay from your paycheck, every time you receive a \npaycheck, a tax that goes into a trust fund to fund something called \nSocial Security, when you reach retirement age, that Social Security \npayment will be there for you. Yes, we want you to save and invest \nyourself, but at least this will be a basic insurance retirement \npayment for you.\n  We have always made that promise. In fact, we changed that promise in \n1983 and said: You know what? Because the largest baby crop in the \nhistory of this country will retire after the turn of the century--and \nthat is called the war babies, the group of babies who came after the \nsoldiers came home after the Second World War and the largest \noutpouring of affection in the history of the country occurred, and we \nhad so many babies born, the largest baby crop in the history of \nAmerica. They will begin to retire now. When they retire and hit the \nretirement rolls, then we have maximum strain on the Social Security \nsystem.\n  So in 1983, we put in place a little different approach. The approach \nwas to say we are actually going to collect more money than we spend on \na current basis in order to have a trust fund\n\n[[Page S6156]]\n\nbalance that begins to save so that the resources are there when the \nbaby boomers retire. That is what the trust fund is about. I mentioned \nthat if we decide to increase the Federal debt--as is the case in the \nbill brought to the floor of the Senate, and as was the case with \nrespect to the Budget Act--from $6 trillion roughly to $12 trillion, \nthere won't be a Social Security trust fund. It is to say that that \nwhich is to be put away in a trust fund for Social Security will be \nused as an offset to provide tax cuts for Donald Trump. I know I should \nnot use his name, but he likes to have his name used. I think he is an \ninteresting guy, a good businessman and investor. He does very well. He \nputs his name on his buildings, so he certainly won't mind my using his \nname.\n\n  The question is, Should we decide that the trust funds we are trying \nto save for the future, which we need when the baby boomers retire, \nwill be used as offsets so that we can give Donald Trump, or others in \nthe upper income bracket in the country, large tax cuts?\n  Is that what you would sit around a table and decide as an American \nfamily that represents the priorities, values, and needs? Is that what \nyou would decide we ought to do now? Is that the urgency for our \ncountry in public policy? I don't think so.\n  In addition to trying to save money in a trust fund, in 1993 we \nchanged the mechanisms by which we assessed taxes, and especially with \nrespect to senior citizens. We said: We will require you to report more \nof our Social Security payments as income on your tax returns--from 50 \npercent to 85 percent. That means about 8 million senior citizens now \npay $1,500 a year in additional taxes.\n  I wish we had not done that in 1993. I voted for a bill that included \nit because it had a lot of things in it that put this country back on \ntrack, but I wasn't pleased that was in it. Twice since then, I have \nvoted to try to repeal it. Now if we are going to have a substantial \nchange in tax laws and evaluate who ought to get a tax break and who \nshould not, and where should we cut taxes or where should we not, \nperhaps we ought to consider this at the top of the list. Why not make \nthis change now? Why not go back to the 50 percent? That is where it \nwas. Why not say that senior citizens--those who reached their \ndeclining income years--are those who ought to get the tax breaks?\n  That is what my amendment does. It is fairly simple. Senior citizens \nare living longer and better lives. Really, people say we have all \nthese problems with Social Security and Medicare. Do you know what they \nare? They are problems of success. Just go back to the old life \nexpectancy. People are living longer and better lives. I know a woman \nwho is 89 years old. She bought a car a while back, and she used 5-year \nfinancing. God bless her. I have an uncle who is 81 years old. He runs \nin the Senior Olympic events. He has 43 gold medals. He runs the 400 \nand the 800. Thirty years ago when one reached 80 years of age, they \nhad to find a La-Z-Boy. You were then at that age where it was time to \nfind an easy chair because you were not going to run races or buy a car \nand finance it for 5 years.\n  Now things have changed in a very dramatic way. People are living \nlonger and much better lives. But it is true that as they live longer \nlives, they reach a period of time when their income declines. \nInevitably, they stop working and retire. Their income declines. As \nthey reach the declining income years, then the question of what kinds \nof taxes they pay is a very important question. Do they, as some are \nrequired, go into a grocery store, where the pharmacy is in the back, \nand have to ask themselves: Should I buy groceries first so I can see \nhow much I have left for prescription drugs? Of course, they make those \nchoices.\n  When they reach their declining income years, the question is, What \nshould their tax obligation be? How should we construct this tax \nobligation? My amendment is devastatingly simple: Let's relieve them of \nthat 30 percent in extra income on Social Security they are required to \nreport, which will save 8 million people $1,500 a year. These are not \nthe top-income folks. These are folks who have retired and now have \nless income than they had during their working years. In many cases, \nthey are folks who saved and are trying to help their kids and \ngrandkids. They have less income, and they are now in the last 10 \nyears, and they are required to pay higher taxes.\n\n  This provision will relieve them of some of that burden. I was \nthinking the other day about this tax debate because it is the case \nthat some will benefit and some will not. There is an old saying: When \nyou rob from Peter to pay Paul, you can always count on Paul being \ngrateful.\n  The fact is, this bill is going to make some people in this country \nvery grateful--but it is not the senior citizens, unless we pass this \namendment; it is the folks at the very top of the income ladder. We \nhave people come to the floor of the Senate and say the big priority \nhere is to exempt dividends from taxation.\n  First of all, most dividends are not double taxed. I will make that \npoint. Second, if you want to talk about double taxation, why talk \nabout double taxation just for the top of the income heap--those who \nclip coupons to get unearned income to the tune of millions of dollars \na year? Why talk about them being exempt? Why do you have a philosophy \nthat says let's exempt investment and tax work? What kind of value \nsystem is that? Nobody is saying let's exempt work, let's just exempt \ninvestment. I don't understand that.\n  The tax system ought to be about values. But if you are talking about \ndouble taxation, which I think is the principle by which some brought \nto the floor this issue of dividends, how about double taxation of \nSocial Security? That is a good example. Wages. We tax on your wage, \nyou put some money away, and then you come back and get a Social \nSecurity payment, and you have to pay a tax on part of that. It is 85 \npercent now. I propose 50 percent. Double taxation on Social Security. \nIs that more or less important? I guess you could talk about almost \nanything, could you not? Go buy a car this afternoon. You pay taxes on \nthe wages you earn, and when you buy a car, they are going to charge a \nbig old excise tax. Double taxation.\n  So the question I have is, When some people apparently got bottled \nwater and sat around a big old mahogany table and started thinking, the \nbiggest problem in America is double taxation so let's try to get rid \nof that, how did they come up with the notion that dividends \nrepresented that priority? Were there people smoking Cohibas there who \nwere getting a lot of dividends and said: The biggest problem for me is \nthat I get $10 million of dividends and, by God, that is double \ntaxation? Is that where that came from?\n  Or were there perhaps some senior citizens who were supposed to be \nthere and their chairs were empty? I assume they would have said: \nDouble taxation? Here is an example of double taxation. Help us.\n  No, that is not the priority. The priority is not about helping them. \nThe priority is helping the folks at the top and then saying: And if we \ndo that, we are going to create a massive amount of new jobs in \nAmerica.\n  We have heard this argument before--massive new jobs--new jobs. Jobs \nis a four-letter word, but it is a good one, as long as jobs are \npresent someplace. We went through this with a very large tax cut 2 \nyears ago, and now we have 2.3 million fewer jobs. It might be because \nother events happened. They certainly did.\n  One wonders, if the first dose of medicine makes you sick, whether \nyou ought to trot out the same bottle and label another batch to an \nunsuspecting public. Is there a time perhaps when we decide maybe the \nway we create new jobs in America is to put the economy back on track \nand say we are not going to double the debt, we are not going to run \nthe largest deficits in history, and we are not going to tell the \nworking folks who represent, in my judgment, the engine of our economy \nand of our country: By the way, you do not matter much.\n  I will finish my remarks. I am going afield. The fact is, in the \nSenate, you speak when you have the opportunity to do so.\n  My amendment deals with senior citizens. I am trying to describe some \nof the circumstances that would persuade senior citizens to think they \nhave not been treated fairly in this bill, and this is a way to remedy \nthat.\n\n[[Page S6157]]\n\nIt seems to me both political parties have something to offer this \ncountry that is constructive in discussing taxation and economic \npolicy. I happen to think those on the Republican side are a little \nbetter at trying to make sure we tamp down spending. They are a little \nbetter at that than we are. Sometimes I do not think they have the \njudgment they should have when they tamp down spending, but the fact is \nthey are a little better at it than we are.\n  It seems to me we are a little better at the notion of how you do \nthings that give people confidence in the future that can provide the \nbuoyancy, the growth, and the lift to the American economy. Getting the \nbest of what both parties have to offer is better than getting the \nworst of either. I think often we get the worst either party can offer \nthis country.\n  My proposal is just to begin to amend this tax bill. I am not saying \nthe bill is worthless. There are some provisions in this bill that have \ngreat worth, some provisions I support. The child tax credit and \nothers, I think, make sense. We should do what is contained in these \nprovisions, even as we try to put this economy on track so that the \nnumbers add up.\n  There is not any way the numbers add up. My colleague, Senator Conrad \nfrom North Dakota, has spoken on the floor at great length about this \nissue. We also were together yesterday at a presentation. Even as we do \nthese things, some of which have great worth and some of which, in my \njudgment, are just waving a flag to the upper income folks in America \nto say our party is still with you--those on the other side of the \naisle--it seems to me you need to do them in the context of saying to \nthe American people that the future of this economy is not going to be \na future mired in debt and choking on yearly deficits.\n  I will make one final point. As we do this, understand that what is \nbeing proposed now is the largest deficits in history, in fiscal \npolicy, on top of the largest trade deficits in history. Those two \nproblems together potentially can cause very significant problems for \nthe value of this country's currency.\n  As Mr. Friedman says in ``The Lexus and the Olive Tree,'' when the \nelectronic herd runs and begins to move to other currencies, it has a \nprofound impact on your economy, and we should be concerned about that.\n  To come back to my amendment, this amendment is about priorities--\nwhat is important and what is not; what should we do and what should we \nnot do. It seems to me one of the high priorities for us in dealing \nwith reducing taxes ought to be to say to senior citizens, among them \nthe greatest generation and others who are struggling and who are \ntrying to make sure they get through these difficult times, those who \nhave reached their lowest income years: We are going to repeal that \nportion of the law that was passed 10 years ago. We are going to do it \nbecause we believe the 8 million people who are now required to pay \n$1,500 apiece in additional taxes ought to be relieved of that burden.\n  As I indicated, I have on two previous occasions voted to repeal this \ntax. It has never gotten done. I know there is disagreement as to \nwhether it should get done. I believe it should get done because, \nfrankly, this is double taxation. It is not just dividends. It is this \nas well.\n  I am proud to offer this amendment with my colleague, Senator Baucus \nfrom Montana, and I assume many other colleagues would like to \ncosponsor it before they vote. I hope we have a vote on it.\n  I did not mention this will be paid for by offsets. We would not \naccelerate the scheduled rate reductions in the highest rates, and we \nwould strike the dividend income relief in the bill. We do not increase \ntaxes. If someone stands up and says what you are going to do is \nincrease taxes with your offset, that is not the case. There is no \nincrease in taxes in this amendment, but we do not accelerate the top \nrates and, at the same time, we decide not to proceed with the dividend \nincome tax relief in the bill, the bulk of which goes to upper income \nAmericans.\n  I hope, perhaps, this amendment will be accepted on a voice vote. If \nthat is not the case, we will have some debate and then I am hoping we \nwill have a successful record vote. Perhaps I will be inspired to speak \nagain after I have heard the debate on this amendment. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Senator from Alaska has asked for \ntime to speak as in morning business for whatever time she needs. I \nwill be glad to yield time to the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding the Senator is asking \nthat in the form of a unanimous consent agreement she speak in morning \nbusiness.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Off our time, not extra time.\n  Mr. REID. I am not going to object to this request, but I do want \neveryone to understand that the majority leader asked that we expedite \nthe tax bill. We are trying to do that, but speaking in morning \nbusiness is not going to expedite consideration of this bill. There is \nlimited time. We have 7 hours on our side. We are going to try to spend \nall 7 hours on tax matters. I want everyone to understand this when the \nmajority leader is asking why this is not moving more quickly\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Let me explain why the distinguished Senator from \nNevada is wrong. We are going to take it off the time on the bill, not \nextra time. This will come off the 7 hours we have on the bill.\n  I yield whatever time the Senator from Alaska may consume. I \nunderstand she is only going to take about 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has that right. Without \nobjection, the Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n\n\n                       National Police Week 2003\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I do appreciate the \nconsideration of my colleagues and the chairman in allowing me a brief \nopportunity to speak. I do recognize that taking this time out of the \nvery important consideration of the legislation that is before us is \nsignificant, but I remind Members that the events that happened last \nevening, at the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, are equally \nsignificant. I will take a few moments this morning to speak to that.\n  Last evening, some 10,000 law enforcement officers, representing all \ncorners of our Nation and foreign lands, gathered at the National Law \nEnforcement Officers Memorial to pay tribute to 377 of their colleagues \nand comfort their survivors.\n  Each of the 377 honorees bears the distinction of having lost his or \nher life in the line of duty. The attendees represented a cross-section \nof many different agencies that make up the law enforcement community, \nincluding Federal law enforcement officers, State troopers, municipal \ncops, sheriff's deputies, corrections officers, game wardens, and \nNational Park Service rangers. Most came in uniform. Many were joined \nby their spouses. Many were joined by their children, not only those \nwho are old enough to understand, but also the little ones.\n  At dusk, thousands of candles were lit, and the names of each of the \n377 departed officers was read.\n  The purpose of this annual event is not to reflect on the events that \nprematurely ended the lives of these brave officers, but those who \ncreated this memorial remind us that ``It is not how these officers \ndied that made them heroes, but how they lived.''\n  This year, the names of three Alaskans were added to the memorial. \nTwo of the three died in the line of duty in 2002, while the third died \nin the line of duty in 1917, in the days when Alaska was still a \nterritory. This third individual was added to the memorial as a result \nof diligent research by the City of Seward, AK and its police \ndepartment. I would like to introduce these exemplary Alaskans to the \nSenate.\n  Correctional Officer James C. Hesterberg, was known as ``Jamie.'' At \nage 48, he was killed in the line of duty. A 19 year veteran of the \nAlaska Department of Corrections, he was contemplating retirement in \nSeptember 2003. On November 19, 2002, Officer Hesterberg, and his \npartner, Officer Dennis Nilsen, were transporting seven prisoners to \nthe Spring Creek Correctional Center by van on a snow and slush covered \nhighway. Their van was struck by a large semi truck, killing Officer \nHesterberg and four prisoners.\n\n[[Page S6158]]\n\n  Officer Hesterberg was the first employee of the Alaska Department of \nCorrections ever to die in the line of duty. He leaves behind his wife, \nDebra, his three children, Scott, Catherine and Mark, his mother and \nfather, and many good friends and fellow officers. The people of Alaska \nmourn his loss. Jamie's commitment to protecting Alaska's citizens and \nto fulfilling the mission of the Department of Corrections will not be \nforgotten.\n  Thomas Patrick O'Hara, at age 41, was a protection ranger and pilot \nfor the National Park Service at Katmai National Park and Preserve in \nthe Bristol Bay region of Alaska. On December 19, 2002, Tom and his \npassenger, a Fish and Wildlife Service employee, were on a mission in \nthe Alaska Peninsula National Wildlife Refuge. Their plane went down on \nthe tundra. When the plane was reported overdue, a rescue effort \nconsisting of 14 single engine aircraft, an Alaska Air National Guard \nplane, and a Coast Guard helicopter quickly mobilized. Many of the \nsingle engine aircraft were piloted by Tom's friends. The wreckage was \nlocated late in the afternoon of December 20. The passenger survived \nthe crash, but Ranger O'Hara did not.\n  Tom O'Hara was an experienced pilot with 11,000 hours as a pilot-in-\ncommand. He was active in the communities of Naknek and King Salmon \nwhere he grew up, flying children to Bible camp and coaching young \nwrestlers. Tom provided a strong link between the residents of Bristol \nBay and the National Park Service.\n  Tom leaves behind his parents, Dan and Sharon O'Hara, who are in \nWashington, DC, today and who are distinguished leaders in the Bristol \nBay region, his wife Lucy, and three children, Jonathon, Nicole and \nHeidi. I also had an opportunity to meet with his brother this morning. \nThe deputy director of the National Park Service characterized Tom as \none of its finest and he will be missed deeply by all of us.\n  The third Alaskan, Charles H. Wiley, came to Seward from California \nto work on the construction of the Alaska Railroad. He was appointed to \nthe post of night marshal in April 1917. On the evening of October 2, \n1917, Marshal Wiley went to the Overland Hotel in Seward to investigate \nan incident. Marshal Wiley knocked first, but entered the hotel room \nwhen nobody answered. He was met by a round of gunfire. Marshal Wiley \ndied two days later.\n  I thank the Chair for allowing me to share a bit of the lives of \nthese brave Alaskans. I want to thank the organization Concerns of \nPolice Survivors and the staff of the National Law Enforcement \nOfficers' Memorial for their hard work in organizing the candlelight \nmemorial last evening.\n  To the children of Jamie Hesterberg and Tom O'Hara, I to say, your \nfathers lost their lives doing something important for Alaska and the \nNation. Public service is an honorable profession and I hope that each \nof you will consider making it a part of your lives. In valor, there is \nhope.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak as in morning business for up to 5 minutes and that \nthe time be charged against the majority's control of time on S. 1054.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I shall not \nobject, but I want to clarify with the Chair, do I control the time on \nthe amendment on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does, and the Chair recognizes the \nSenator from Minnesota as the first person seeking recognition.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, following the presentation, then, it would \nbe my opportunity to yield time; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. My dear friend from Iowa was wrong in saying that the time \nwould be used up anyway, and here is the point I am making: We have \nbeen asked to move the tax bill. That is what we should be doing. We \nhave turned down a number of requests on this side of people wanting to \nspeak, no matter how important it might be, on issues other than those \nrelating to the tax bill. The time used on the bill talking about \nmorning business, no matter how important it might be, does not deal \nwith the tax issues of this country. The majority leader has asked us \nto cooperate in trying to move this bill along. It is obvious as the \nday is clear that we are not moving this along when we are talking \nabout extraneous matters. That is the point I am making. I have no \nobjection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                    bring your daughter to work day\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, today I am engaging in my own version of \n``Bring Your Daughter to Work Day.'' As we all know, this day does not \nfall on May 14, nor does it involve the daughter bringing along 40 of \nher friends, but this was the unique situation I faced today when my \ndaughter Sarah stopped by my office with some of her schoolmates from \nthe Twin Cities Academy in St. Paul, MN.\n  Like many other students from across the Nation, seventh and eighth \ngraders from the Twin Cities Academy are in Washington this week for a \nschool trip. Their plans include visiting the countless museums and \nmonuments throughout the city, a Capitol tour, and also the chance to \nbe with us today in the Senate Chamber.\n  I want to again welcome Sarah and her schoolmates to the Senate, and \nI am glad they have the opportunity to observe the activities of this \nbody.\n  In honor of their visit, I want to talk a while on the importance of \nyoung people understanding how Government works. So that they can \nbetter follow along, and since I trust the students are familiar with \nit, I am going to use parts of the Twin Cities Academy mission \nstatement as an example.\n  The Twin Cities Academy mission stresses collaboration between the \nschool, parents, and the community to develop each child's talent, \npotential, and character. When this process succeeds, the mission \nstatement says that the end result is a group of productive citizens \nwho will contribute to sustaining American democracy.\n  Thomas Jefferson, one of the great leaders and legislators of this \nNation, had a vision for public schools and the role they were to play \nin America, to create a public of informed and engaged citizens capable \nof sustaining the Republic he and his colleagues had formed. Twin \nCities Academy had modeled its vision after these ideals, and they are \ncommitted to fostering productive citizens, as stated in its mission.\n  Having a strong history program at school is a good thing for young \npeople like my daughter Sarah. Students need to understand how the \nthree branches of Government work together. Also import is having the \nopportunity to come to Washington and witness first hand the rights and \nduties of citizens. It helps them realize what it means to celebrate \nfreedom, to celebrate opportunity, and to be an optimist and have a \nhopeful spirit.\n  My good friend and colleague Senator Alexander understands the \nimportance of sharing these values with the next generation, which is \nwhy he introduced The American History and Civics Education Act, an act \nwhich will help us ensure young people grow up learning what it means \nto be an American. I was pleased to have the opportunity to cosponsor \nthis legislation.\n  When their school trip comes to an end, I hope that my daughter Sarah \nand her schoolmates have thoroughly enjoyed all that they experienced \nin Washington, particularly my version of ``Bring Your Daughter to Work \nDay.''\n  I mentioned earlier in this statement how I hoped to give them an \nunderstanding of how Government works. If these Twin Cities Academy \nstudents were to look up the word ``understand'' in a thesaurus, they \nwould see as a synonym the word ``appreciate.'' I hope at the end of \nthe day, these students have even a greater appreciation, not just \nunderstanding, of this great institution and our process of Government \nthat makes us the greatest Nation in the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the managers of the bill and \nthose controlling time that there\n\n[[Page S6159]]\n\nis no requirement that the Senator speak on this legislation when \nyielded time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator.\n  The amendment the Senator from North Dakota is offering, that I \ncosponsor, is a tax cut amendment. Most Members of this body like to \ncut taxes. That is what this amendment is all about. It is cutting \ntaxes.\n  Second, which group is getting the benefit of the tax cut under this \namendment? Under the amendment offered by the Senator from North \nDakota, cosponsored by myself, it is senior citizens who get the \nbenefit of the tax cut.\n  I join the Senator in offering this amendment. It repeals the 1993 \ntax of Social Security benefits, the tax this body imposed on certain \nsenior citizens in 1993.\n  We are currently debating a $350 billion tax cut reconciliation bill. \nThis bill is about priorities, about values. That is what budgets are \nabout. Part of the budget is $350 billion in tax cuts. The budget we \nare working under that was adopted by the Congress set those numbers. I \nam pleased there was a commitment to limit that reconciliation bill \nthrough conference to $350 billion. That was the commitment made by \ncertain key Senators on this side.\n  It is within this tax reconciliation bill we debate and decide how \nthe changes in revenues and outlays affect our constituents. The debate \nis about who the $350 billion benefits: do we give more money to some \ntaxpayers or others? The choices are real. We are here to make \ndecisions. We are here to decide.\n  We need to make sure our Nation's seniors receive a significant \nbenefit. If this bill before the Senate will allocate benefits to \ncertain groups, certainly senior citizens in our country should be a \nmain beneficiary of a tax reduction. This amendment offered by the \nSenator from North Dakota is just that, a tax reduction for senior \ncitizens. It repeals the 1993 provision which imposed taxes on certain \nsenior citizens.\n  The bill reported by the Finance Committee provides a tax break for \ntaxpayers with dividend income. That proposal costs $81 billion over 10 \nyears out of the $350 billion. That proposal provides a few seniors, \nnot very many, a few with a small amount of tax relief; 77 percent of \nseniors in our country will receive no relief, no tax reductions, under \nthe Finance Committee bill on dividends; 77 percent of Americans do not \nreceive any of the $81 billion that will go to very few Americans, the \nmost wealthy, the least in our country.\n  In contrast, our amendment will provide 8 million seniors with a \nsignificant tax cut. All the cost of this goes back to America's \nseniors. That means $150 billion over 10 years is put back into the \npockets of our senior citizens.\n  The current law enacted in 1993 has two significant flaws. First, in \n1993 we changed the rules in the middle of the game for people \nreceiving Social Security benefits. I will never forget. Suddenly that \nwas enacted. It came out of the blue, an additional tax on our senior \ncitizens and their benefits. We began to tax Social Security benefits \nat a higher rate for individuals at certain income levels.\n  The second flaw in 1993, we failed to adjust the income levels for \ninflation. For the past 10 years, there has been no adjustment. This \nmeans more and more seniors will be subjected to this tax as each year \npasses. We need to correct those flaws.\n\n  Again, this debate is about choices. We make choices here. Life is \nmaking choices. We think the choice here is clear. If we have $150 \nbillion to spend, spend it on seniors. As such, we offset the cost of \nour amendment to repeal the tax to Social Security benefits. That is \nthe purpose of the underlying amendment by striking the dividend \nproposal in the bill and also striking reductions in the top rates.\n  Again, this is a tax cut amendment. Those seniors I mention are \ncurrently paying that tax. We are proposing that tax be repealed. That \nis a tax cut amendment. It is being paid for by a promise to the \nfuture. Those provisions of the Finance Committee dealing with \ndividends are not currently in effect. They are future promises, we \nsuggest, to be repealed so our seniors get the benefit of the repeal of \nthe taxes imposed upon them in 1993.\n  A couple of numbers: Repealing the 1993 tax of Social Security \nbenefits gets an average of $1,500 into the hands of 8 million seniors. \nContrast that with the dividend proposal in the Finance Committee bill. \nThe dividend proposal in the bill gets an average of $19,000 to fewer \nthan 5,000 seniors. Again, what is better: $1,500 in the hands of 8 \nmillion seniors or $19,000 in the hands of the most wealthy, only 5,000 \nseniors? And fewer than 1 million taxpayers, regardless of whether they \nare 65 or 25, would benefit from the top rate reductions. Remember, \nthere are 130 million filers in America. Fewer than 1 million taxpayers \nwho are not seniors, who are between 65 and 25 get reductions from the \ntop rate reductions.\n  Members on the other side of the aisle have supported this in the \npast. Repealing the 1993 Social Security tax is a better choice for our \nconstituents than enacting dividend proposals in the top rate \nreductions contained in the underlying bill.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nNevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the amendment offered by the Senator from \nNorth Dakota will be voted on as it stands. If there is any suggestion \nthat there will be an offer or attempt to second-degree the amendment \nor somehow not give us a straight up-or-down vote, we will continue to \noffer this second-degree amendment on other things. There will be a \nvote on this amendment.\n  It would be to everyone's best interest to get that out of the way as \nquickly as possible and vote on this very important amendment offered \nby the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. \nConrad.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be named as a \ncosponsor of the amendment of my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I wish my colleague a happy birthday. This \nis his birthday, and I hope it is a happy one for him. I hope what \nhelps make it a happy birthday is this amendment passing.\n  This is a good amendment. This is reversing a tax increase previously \nimposed on recipients of Social Security. That was part of a deficit \nreduction plan back in the 1990s that helped get us back on track. We \ndid that. Now in the context of this bill, since there will clearly be \ntax reductions, we ought to do it in a way that is fair and balanced \nand that recognizes a tax increase previously imposed that could be \nreversed at this moment.\n  My colleague mentioned what is happening to the Federal debt under \nthe President's budget plan. This chart shows it in graphic form. The \ndebt of the United States is absolutely skyrocketing. It is over $6 \ntrillion now, and it will be over $12 trillion in 10 years if the \nPresident's plan is adopted, including the overall tax bill before the \nSenate.\n  All of this is at the worst possible time. Right now, the trust funds \nof Social Security and Medicare are running surpluses. The blue bar is \nthe Medicare trust fund; the green bar is the Social Security trust \nfund; the red bars are the tax cuts, both those enacted already and \nthose proposed. You can see that when the trust funds that are now \nrunning big surpluses turn cash negative within the next decade, at \nthat very time the cost of the tax cuts proposed by the President \nexplode, driving us deep into deficit and deep into debt. That is right \nas the baby boom generation retires, right as we are least able to have \ndeficits. You don't have to take my word for it or the word of the \nCongressional Budget Office; this is the President's own analysis of \nthe long-term effects of his plan.\n\n  Some have said these deficits are small. The deficits currently are \nat record levels. We are going to have the biggest deficit this year we \nhave ever had in our history. That is right here.\n  But look where we are headed, according to the President's own \nanalysis. This is from his budget document. It shows deficits now are \nsmall compared to what they will be, even though they are at record \nlevels now. These are the biggest deficits we have ever had, and they \nare tiny compared to what is to come if we adopt the President's plan, \nbecause the costs of\n\n[[Page S6160]]\n\nthe retirement of the baby boom generation explode at the very time the \ncosts of the President's tax bill explode.\n  Some on the other side are saying if you cut taxes you are going to \nget more revenue. Let's do a reality test. They said that 2 years ago. \nThis was the range of possible outcomes, looking forward, that was \ngiven to us 2 years ago by the Congressional Budget Office. They \nadopted the midpoint of this range. That was what told them we were \ngoing to have nearly $6 trillion of surpluses over the next decade.\n  Republicans said, Oh, wait a minute, that is too conservative. If you \ncut taxes, as we did 2 years ago, you will get much more revenue. They \nare making the same claim now: If we cut taxes again, we will get more \nrevenue.\n  Let's look back at history. Let's look at the record. What it shows \nus is here is what actually happened. This is what the projections \nwere; this is the midpoint of those projections that said there would \nbe nearly $6 trillion of surpluses. This red line is what has actually \nhappened. We didn't get more revenue. We didn't get more surpluses. We \ngot less revenue and no surpluses. Instead, we got deficits, massive \ndeficits, record deficits. Now we get the same old song: Let's just do \nanother big round of tax cuts; we will get more revenue.\n  It didn't work last time. It didn't come close to working. In fact, \nwe just got the latest numbers from the Treasury Department. Revenue \nthis year is running $100 billion below the forecast made just 7 months \nago. They said, based on the tax cuts of 2 years ago, we would get more \nrevenue. We are not getting more revenue. In fact, if this trend \ncontinues this year, we will have the lowest revenue as a percentage of \nour gross domestic product since 1959.\n  All those who claimed we were going to get more revenue were wrong. \nThe President was wrong. Our Republican colleagues who told us we were \ngoing to get more revenue with the big tax cut enacted 2 years ago were \nwrong. They were not wrong just by a little bit; they were wrong by a \nlot.\n  That is why some of the most distinguished economists in the country \nare telling us that this tax cut plan is not going to do the job. These \nare the names of the economists who signed this statement. Ten of them \nare Nobel laureates in economics, the most distinguished economists \nAmerica has produced. This is what they say:\n\n       The tax cut plan proposed by President Bush is not the \n     answer to these problems--of weak economic growth.\n       Regardless of how one views the specifics, there is wide \n     agreement that its purpose is a permanent change in the tax \n     structure and not the creation of jobs and growth in the near \n     term. The permanent dividend tax cut, in particular, is not \n     credible as a short-term stimulus. As tax reform, the \n     dividend tax cut is misdirected in that it targets \n     individuals rather than corporations, is overly complex, and \n     could be, but is not, part of a revenue-neutral tax reform \n     effort.\n       Passing these tax cuts will worsen the long-term budget \n     outlook, adding to the nation's projected chronic deficits.\n\n  They conclude:\n\n       To be effective, a stimulus plan should rely on immediate \n     but temporary spending and tax measures to expand demand, and \n     it should also rely on immediate but temporary incentives for \n     investment.\n\n  It is not just 10 Nobel laureates. This morning a distinguished \nRepublican economist was quoted in the Washington Post reacting to a \nplan to phase-in and later sunset the President's dividend proposal. \nHere is what he wrote in a website editorial:\n\n       Administration sources admit that dividends will likely \n     decline relative to today under this plan between now and \n     2005.\n\n  Dividends are going to decline.\n\n       How can that be a harmless event, given that increases in \n     dividend payments are viewed to be so wonderful?\n\n  This Republican economist, distinguished Republican economist whom \nthey have called to testify before committees of Congress repeatedly \nconcluded:\n\n       Clearly, this proposal is one of the most patently absurd \n     tax policies ever proposed.\n\n  This is from a Republican economist whom they have called repeatedly \nbefore committees to testify on economic proposals.\n  It is not just 10 Nobel laureates. It is not just a distinguished \nRepublican economist. It is even the people they have hired to do the \nanalysis of their plan, Macroeconomic Advisers, hired by the White \nHouse, hired by the Congressional Budget Office to do macroeconomic \nforecasting. Do you know what they say? The President's plan will give \nyou a little boost, less than half of 1 percent of additional GDP, \nuntil 2004. Then look: straight down. That is what this policy \nprovides. It hurts economic growth. In fact, past 2004 it is worse than \ndoing nothing. That is a great economic growth plan. That is a great \njobs plan. It is worse than doing nothing, according to the people they \nhave hired to give them advice on what the results will be.\n  It is not just those Nobel laureates, it is not just a distinguished \nRepublican economist, it is not even the firm the Congressional Budget \nOffice and the White House have hired to do macroeconomic analysis. \nThis is the chairman of the Federal Reserve: ``Greenspan Says Tax Cut \nWithout Spending Reductions Could Be Damaging.''\n  He is saying:\n\n       With a large deficit . . . you will be significantly \n     undercutting the benefits that would be achieved from the tax \n     cuts.\n\n  The President of the United States is not proposing cutting spending. \nHe is proposing increasing spending and he is proposing massive tax \ncuts when we already have record deficits. There can only be one \nresult: massive deficits, massive debt, that will hurt economic growth, \nthat will hurt the economic security of the country, and finally, on an \namendment that involves Social Security, that will take virtually every \npenny of Social Security surplus over the next decade to pay for these \ntax cuts. What a profoundly mistaken policy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 20 minutes \non the amendment. The Senator from Iowa has 1 hour.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was unable to hear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 20 minutes. \nThe Senator from Iowa has an hour.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask if the Senator from Iowa wishes to use some of his \ntime at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I consume.\n  I have enjoyed listening to this debate. It is just like being in \nanother world. The reason I say that is, why do you think that we tax \n85 percent of Social Security income for certain Americans in the \nhigher income tax brackets--I would say even in the middle-income tax \nbrackets--at 85 percent? That was done in 1993. Do the people who have \njust spoken forget that every one of them voted that increase, to have \nthe Social Security income be taxed at 85 percent of that income that \nhas to be reported? Every one of the people who have spoken are \nresponsible for that level of income reporting of 85 percent being on \nthe tax books. Why do they want to repeal what they are responsible for \npassing? During the debate on the tax bill, every one of the Democratic \nSenators now serving in the Senate, except for Senator Bingaman from \nNew Mexico, voted to have this money taxed. Now they are trying to take \nit out.\n\n  On June 24, 1993, there was an amendment offered by Senator Lott to \nchange the amendment which was in the Democrat tax increase bill at \nthat time to not report 85 percent of Social Security income for \ntaxation. The rollcall shows that the motion to table was agreed to 51 \nto 46. The 51 Members who voted at that particular time were the ones \nwho were voting to keep the level of Social Security income that was \ntaxed at 85 percent and which needed to be reported. Every Democrat \nstill serving in the Senate voted to table Senator Lott's amendment. \nEvery Republican voted not to table the Lott amendment, which meant \nthat every Republican was voting against that. We had the support of \nSenator Bingaman--the only Democrat from whom we had support.\n  They wonder why I am amused? If they think it is so bad today, why \ndidn't they think it was bad 10 years ago? And we wouldn't even be \ndebating this issue. It looks to me as if they want to maybe detract \nfrom the mistakes of the past. I don't know.\n\n[[Page S6161]]\n\n  But also, earlier this year, on an amendment by Senator Bunning to \nthe Budget Act, the very same Members opposing this amendment voted \nagainst the very same amendment when Senator Bunning offered it. What \nhas happened in the last month? Do they realize that maybe the vote at \nthat time was wrong and they have to have cover? I don't know. But \nevery one of the Members who are proposing this amendment or speaking \nfor it voted just the opposite way on Senator Bunning's amendment. That \namendment was defeated 48 to 51.\n  But there are bigger things to worry about than how people voted in \nthe past. I want the public to understand that there is some game \nplaying going on here. We are talking about serious business as well. \nWe are talking about a jobs bill before the Senate to give tax relief \nto American working men and women so they can have more money in their \npockets.\n  To get the cover that some people need for previous votes, they are \ngoing to take tax decreases away from middle-class Americans to pay for \nthat. I will be a little more specific on that in just a minute.\n  I have to repeat something I said in my opening remarks. We just \nheard a speech on the debt situation which might be forthcoming if we \ngrow the economy. Reducing taxes is one way to grow the economy and \nwill not have the debt situation we found with the growth we had in the \n1990s. We paid down the national debt $550 billion.\n  We hear about this debt situation. My friends on the other side of \nthe aisle are worried about the debt. They said if we adopt the \nPresident's plan, we are going to have greater debt. If they are so \nconcerned about the debt, why didn't they offer all of their amendments \non the budget bill about a month ago? They wanted to take money away \nfrom the tax reduction aspect of the budget. It begins at the bottom \nline. They took money away from tax decreases and spent it someplace \nelse. If they are concerned about the national debt, it seems to me--\nand they believe that one more dollar coming into the Federal Treasury \nis going to reduce the national debt--they shouldn't have been offering \namendments to spend it someplace else. But they are very consistent in \ndoing that. Amendment after amendment after amendment took money away \nfrom the tax reduction figure in the budget, which this bill is a \nresult of, and spent it someplace else.\n\n  Do you know why? I think there is a difference in philosophy between \nmy party and the other party. That difference in philosophy is very \nbasic to this debate going on today. I just think people ought to \nrealize that this is not a Republican-Democrat fight, or some little \ncat fight over some little bill in the Senate.\n  There is the difference between one party that believes money in the \npockets of 110 million taxpayers is going to do more economic good if \nthe 110 million taxpayers spend it or invest it than if I, Senator \nGrassley, and 534 others here in DC are going to make that decision. We \nhave to believe that if the money is in the pockets of 110 million \ntaxpayers and they spend it or invest it, it is going to do more \neconomic good. It is going to turn over more times in the economy. It \nwill respond to the dynamics of our free market economy rather than a \npolitical decision being made about what to do with it.\n  Obviously, I believe people on the other side of the aisle have the \nattitude that we in Congress know better than they do how to spend the \ntaxpayers' money. If we are going to have a tax reduction, that will \nmean less money for us to spend. But it ignores the economic good that \ncomes from private sector investment and private sector spending as \nopposed to public sector spending.\n  I think there is very much an inconsistency here. What we are talking \nabout is a $430 billion tax reduction package--net $350 billion. As we \nhave been told, we have been led to believe that this is responsible \nfor doubling the national debt. This tax package is only one-half of 1 \npercent of all the dollars that are going to be collected by the \nFederal Government under existing tax law over the next decade. That is \ngoing to be $24.7 trillion. Tell me things are so tight here in \nWashington, DC, that somehow one-half of 1 cent on the dollar left in \nthe taxpayers' pockets is going to be responsible for doubling the \nnational debt. No. What is going to be responsible for doubling the \nnational debt--if it were to happen; I don't think it is going to \nhappen--is not because the people of this country are undertaxed; it is \nbecause this Congress overspends.\n\n  There again I would remind the Senator from North Dakota, the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Budget Committee, the President's \nplan does not follow the pattern of the last few years, where back to \nback we had 9-percent increases in domestic discretionary spending each \nof those years. But the President's program, plus the budget of this \nCongress, has domestic discretionary expenditures not at 9 percent but \nat 4 percent. Now, yes, that is an increase. That is an increase, but \nthat is an increase that is sustainable over the long haul. Nine-\npercent budget increases are not sustainable.\n  We are in a situation where nothing around here surprises me anymore. \nThe very people offering this amendment are the same ones who created \nthis tax increase back in 1993. As I indicated, they even voted against \nrepealing the tax just 2 months ago on the budget resolution.\n  I think this is an amendment that is trying to fool the American \npeople. Just about every Member on the Republican side has vehemently \nopposed the Democrats' 1993 tax increase on Social Security. Except for \nSenator Bingaman, every Democrat in the Senate today voted for that \nback in 1993. Now they want to try to cover up their votes supporting \nthis tax, and they want to do it by destroying the underlying jobs and \ngrowth bill.\n  This is how they destroy it: The Dorgan amendment strikes our efforts \nto reduce all marginal tax rates above 10 percent. The efforts to \nreduce marginal tax rates for the middle class are eliminated by this \namendment. As a result, a single mom making $40,000 in taxable income \nwill see no reduction in the tax on her small pay increase. A family \nwith taxable income of $70,000 will see no reduction in their marginal \ntax rate.\n  The Dorgan amendment takes away our bill's tax cuts for middle-income \nAmericans. The Senator from North Dakota says this isn't a tax \nincrease. I would like to have you tell that to the single mom, who is \none of the targets of this amendment, who, on her pay raise, will not \nsee a reduction in her tax. A vote for this amendment is, in fact, a \ntax increase, no matter how the authors want to try to dress it up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this was an interesting and clever \nargument to listen to. I have great respect for my colleague who chairs \nthe Finance Committee. We have worked on many issues together. But I \nlistened to his argument, which was more about motives with respect to \nthis amendment than it was about merits.\n  It is, I guess, perfectly plausible to talk about the motives of \nothers. I won't do that at this moment, but he was describing the \nmotives of people dealing with this amendment. Let me talk a bit about \nthe merits and correct some of the misstatements, if I might, and then \ndescribe why this is an important amendment.\n  Let me take the last point first. My colleague says this is going to \ntake away the tax cuts for middle Americans. Nonsense; simply untrue. \nIs this going to take away the tax cuts for the child credit, which is \ngoing to be very significant to that single mom? Does this take that \naway? The answer is no.\n  So if someone says this takes away the tax cuts for middle Americans, \nthey are wrong, just wrong. It is not supported by the facts. I will go \nthrough a whole list of others that this does not take away.\n  This does take away the tax cut that accelerates the rate reductions \ngoing down to the 28 percent. It is not all those above 10 percent, as \nmy colleague suggested. But let me go back to the top and take his \narguments one by one.\n  The Senator from Iowa is right, this was put in place 10 years ago as \npart of a large plan. I was not happy it was there 10 years ago, but it \nwas part of a plan we passed.\n\n[[Page S6162]]\n\n  Twice, since that time, I have supported efforts to get rid of this \ntax on Social Security--the 50 percent to 85 percent--but we have been \nunsuccessful. The question now is, Are we willing to cut taxes now by \nabolishing the 85 percent back down to 50 percent? That is the question \nfor us now.\n  As a result of the 1993 new economic proposal, which included this \npiece, we had unprecedented economic growth that turned this country \naround, turned the biggest budget deficits then into the biggest budget \nsurpluses we have ever had. Now, we have people who are still huffing \nand puffing that it really was not the result of that economic plan, \nbut, notwithstanding that, the fact is, that put this country back on \ntrack. This piece was a part of it. I am not pleased it was, but it \nwas. As I said, I voted previously to try to get rid of this piece. Now \nwe have the opportunity.\n  If the prospect of the majority is to come to the floor of the Senate \nand say, let's have very large tax cuts, the question is, it seems to \nme, Where do you start? Who benefits most? Wouldn't it be a good thing \nto cut these taxes so 8 million senior citizens who are paying $1,500 a \nyear more in taxes as a result of that change 10 years ago would be \nable to begin to pay less as a result of our repeal of that provision?\n  My colleague said: Gee, there was just an amendment offered by \nSenator Bunning on the floor of the Senate that dealt with this very \nissue. Total nonsense. It was offered during the budget debate, and the \nbudget debate did not have anything to do with what we were going to do \non specific tax cuts. That can only be done with respect to the Finance \nCommittee and on the floor of the Senate.\n\n  The Bunning amendment was a proposal to increase the overall tax cut \nby $146 billion. But the Bunning amendment--if I just ask you to go \nread it--says nothing about this issue that I have as a matter of the \namendment today. I assume my colleague will say: Everybody knew what he \nwas doing. No, you can't do that during a budget debate. There is no \nvote during the budget debate that is going to affect what the Finance \nCommittee does to cut taxes at some point later. So the Bunning issue \nis a specious issue.\n  We are told this is a jobs bill, and we are also told by my colleague \nas to this ``debt situation,'' don't worry so much about that because \nwe are going to grow the economy and the debt isn't going to happen. \nThis reminds me of that old joke in the movies: Who are you going to \nbelieve, me or your own eyes? Well, let's take a look with our own eyes \nhere.\n  When somebody says, this doubling of the Federal debt, from $6 to $12 \ntrillion, is probably not going to happen, let me refer you to the \nbudget that was passed by this Senate, embraced by the previous speaker \nand all on his side of the aisle, I believe--or almost all--except two. \nOn page 4 of that conference report, they say, if they get all they \nwant--they grow the economy, they create the jobs, they get all they \nwant in budget and appropriations and tax cuts and so on--they say they \nwill have a $12 trillion debt in the year 2013. This isn't a case of, \nwell, if we grow the economy, the debt situation will not happen. No. \nThis is what they predict will happen if they get all they want.\n  So I would refer you to page 4 of the conference report, that you \nvoted for--I say to those who voted for it--and ask yourselves: Were \nyou creating a plan and supporting a plan that doubles the Federal \ndebt? The answer is yes. Case closed. No more discussion about that, I \nam sorry.\n  Now, the question was asked: Do we want to repeal this or don't we \nwant to repeal this? The reason I have offered the amendment is, yes, I \nthink we ought to repeal that provision. I did not like that provision \nwhen it was put in, but it was. It was part of a larger plan we all \nprotected in order to make that plan work. The fact is, I did not like \nit then. I do not like it now. I think we ought to repeal it.\n  The question now is not, What did you think about someone doing that \n10 years ago? The question is, In the year 2003, do you support \nrepealing this provision or don't you?\n  This, in fact, is a tax cut for senior citizens, 8 million of them \nwho have reached their declining income years and who have earned the \nopportunity to go back to the provision we used to have where 50 \npercent of their Social Security payments are counted as income for tax \npurposes rather than the 85 percent. That is what my proposal does.\n  We are told that what this larger tax bill is about is putting money \nin the pockets of American taxpayers. That is true. It will be \nborrowed, of course. We are going to borrow money to provide tax cuts. \nBut if we are going to provide tax cuts, it is perfectly appropriate to \nask the question: What are the priorities? Who ought to be first in \nline? Those at the very top of the income ladder who earn the biggest \ndividends, should they be first in line? Is that who edges up to the \ntrough here? Or perhaps should we take a look at the issue of the tax \nburden on senior citizens and especially the income they receive from \nSocial Security?\n  If this is about putting money in the pockets of the American \ntaxpayers, I say without respect to the motives of those who disagree \nwith me, if the motive is to put money in the pockets of senior \ncitizens who have had to pay a higher tax than they should have to pay, \nthis amendment gives you the opportunity to vote yes or no.\n  We can have people stand and steam and bluster about other people's \nmotives, but in the end, we will vote on this. And the vote is going to \nbe, do you believe we ought to relieve senior citizens of this tax \nobligation they have had to pay? In my judgment, the answer ought to be \nyes. My hope is that enough colleagues will join me so we can make this \nkind of affirmative change that will be helpful to cut taxes for 8 \nmillion senior citizens to the tune of $1,500 a year. These are taxes \nthat ought to be cut. I hope my colleagues will support this amendment.\n  One more time. There are a lot of mirages created in this Chamber, a \nlot of word castles being built: We will grow; we will create jobs; we \nwill grow the economy; we will expand all these things that we hear \nabout.\n  It is not contestable that we have a fiscal plan passed by one vote \nin this Congress that says: Let us borrow a great deal of money, \nprovide very large tax cuts mostly to upper income folks, double the \nFederal debt from $6 to $12 trillion, increase funding on defense, \nincrease funding for homeland defense and security, and then shrink \ndomestic discretionary and at the same time double the Federal debt. \nThat is a legacy we will leave to our children if everything goes as is \npredicted.\n  I happen to think this fiscal policy makes little sense. If we are \ngoing to cut taxes, let's make sure we have a priority in terms of the \nvalue system we want to exhibit as we cut taxes. I say those who have \nreached their declining income years and who are now paying higher \ntaxes because of this provision put in 10 years ago deserve the \nopportunity to see this provision repealed, and my amendment does \nexactly that.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, there isn't anybody in this body for whom \nI have higher respect and more affection than the Senator from Iowa. I \nmust say when I listened to his arguments against this amendment, \nvirtually nothing was said that addressed the merits. In fact, there \nwere some statements which were a little bit misleading. Lawyers like \nto call them red herrings. That is when you say something to try to get \npeople off track so they don't think about the subject at hand. It is \ncalled a red herring.\n  One of the red herrings we heard was that Democrats voted against \nthis amendment in the past, and it was Democrats who voted for this \nincrease in Social Security taxes back in 1993. That was 10 years ago. \nThat is a different time, a different situation, different \ncircumstance. Back then the Congress voted to reduce deficits, and that \nwas part of a large deficit reduction package. This is 10 years later, \n2003. We are faced with the question, within a $350 billion tax bill, \nhow should the tax cuts be allocated. That is the question before us.\n  Many of us believe it is a far wiser policy that seniors receive more \nof the tax benefit as a result of the cuts than is the case under the \nSenate Finance Committee bill. That is why we think the 1993 provision \nshould be repealed\n\n[[Page S6163]]\n\nbecause then seniors will receive significant benefits if it is \nrepealed, and we believe that is a higher priority than giving a lot \nmore dollars to very few Americans who are the elite, the extremely \nwealthy Americans.\n  Repealing the 1993 tax on Social Security benefits gets an average of \n$1,500 in the hands of 8 million Americans. Eight million seniors will \nreceive, on average, a benefit of $1,500 under our amendment. \nOtherwise, if this amendment does not pass, then by contrast, under the \ncommittee bill, which gives dividends to all Americans tax free, a few \nseniors, 5,000 seniors, will get $19,000.\n  We are saying there should be a better priority; that is, the money \nshould be given to people who are going to spend it. It should be \nspread out more evenly rather than have the benefits, as in the Finance \nCommittee bill, so heavily skewed to the Nation's elite. This should \nnot be an elite bill. This should be an American bill. This should be a \nbill for Americans, and American seniors should be included as the rest \nof America.\n  There are other provisions of the bill that give tax benefits other \nthan to seniors. We believe seniors should get a significant part of \nthe benefit. I strongly urge passage of the amendment.\n  The Senator from Iowa also said there is a difference in philosophy: \nOne party wants to put money in the pockets of people; the other does \nnot.\n  That, too, is not a valid argument. We are talking about whose \npockets this money should be put into, if you want to put it in those \nterms. We on our side are suggesting that the people whose pockets \nshould receive the money are the seniors, that they should receive the \nbenefits, much more than is the case in this bill. In this bill, the \npeople who receive the money, whose pockets get the money, are the \nelite, the wealthy elite of America generally. That is not right. That \ndoesn't work. It is not fair. It is not American. We believe this \nshould be a bill that is more evenly balanced for all Americans.\n  For all those reasons, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. \nIt is good for America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask how much time remains on the \nDorgan amendment on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 45 minutes; the \nSenator from North Dakota has 7 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Forty-five minutes on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I rise to address a couple of issues that have been \npresented before we go to other people who want to speak. This is on \nthe Dorgan amendment. It might be in the form of asking rhetorical \nquestions or what have you. But first of all, I want to say to my \nfriend from Montana, the distinguished ranking member of this \ncommittee, that for this farmer to be called a lawyer, if he were not a \ngood friend of mine, I would take offense.\n  Regardless, before us is this amendment that reduces the amount of \nSocial Security income that must be reported for taxation. One of the \nissues I didn't mention in my debate against the amendment is the fact \nthat all the money raised from this tax goes into the Medicare health \ninsurance trust fund. We all know the Medicare Program is in much more \nserious condition than the Social Security Program.\n  The Medicare trust fund has a drop dead date of 2026. The Social \nSecurity trust fund has a drop dead date of 2042. None of those dates \nare anything that I am making light of, that they are so far off that \nwe should not be concerned. We have to be very concerned. But people \nought to understand that to the extent this amendment is adopted, it \nwould take money out of the Medicare health insurance trust fund. And I \ndon't think we ought to be doing anything to weaken the Medicare trust \nfund. I would rather refer to a point made by the two Senators from \nNorth Dakota, most often made by the sponsor of this amendment. I \ncannot help but ask both of these Senators who are trying to make an \nissue about this bill by saying that this bill will increase the debt. \nSomehow that just doesn't add up, when you consider the thrust of their \namendment.\n\n  How does this amendment they have before us reduce the debt? The \nbottom line of the bill is exactly the same with or without the Dorgan \namendment. In other words, it costs the same as the underlying bill. \nSo, again, we have people speaking on three sides of a two-sided coin. \nSenator Dorgan's amendment will increase the debt, so I don't hear any \nmore about increasing the debt on the part of the underlying bill, \nbecause with their amendment, we end up exactly in the same place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. MURKOWSKI). The Senator from North Dakota \nis recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, my colleague from Iowa just won a debate \nwe were not having. That is an interesting thing to do. I wasn't \nproposing this amendment as one that would dramatically reduce the \nFederal debt. I never suggested that or proposed it.\n  My point is, we lost on that issue when my colleague and his party \npassed in the Senate this budget which, on page 4, says they want to \ndouble the Federal debt from $6 trillion to $12 trillion. They passed \nthat without my vote. I didn't support it. But I didn't propose this \namendment saying it will reduce the Federal debt. I am saying this: \nSince they won, and since they are going to cut taxes, the question is \nof choice and priority: Which of the taxes ought to be cut? Which ought \nto be cut first?\n  My amendment simply says I think it is more important to cut these \ntaxes for senior citizens--8 million of them who pay $1,500 a year, at \nthis point, more than I think they should pay. I think the priority \nought to be to cut taxes for them at this point. Is it more important \nto do that than to, as I said earlier, cut dividend taxation? I think \nit is. I think those individuals are in the highest income levels.\n  Again, I hope Donald Trump won't mind, but since he names everything \nafter himself, and he is a very successful businessman, he probably \ndoesn't mind my using his name. He is at the top of the income ladder, \nand God bless him. But it is a reasonable thing to ask: what is the \npriority? Is it providing tax exemptions that will provide large tax \ncuts to those at the top or to provide tax exemptions for senior \ncitizens who have reached the lower part of their income in their lives \nand are struggling to make it?\n\n  What I propose has nothing to do with the debt. This doesn't reduce \nthe debt. I am not saying it does. If we are going to cut taxes, the \nquestion ought to be one of choice and priority. That is what this \namendment is. I am going back to the question of debt because it is the \nvery reason I voted against the budget in the first place. We cannot \ncome to the floor and say this debt situation ``isn't real'' because it \nmay not happen because we have this policy or plan that will grow the \neconomy, and if and when we do these debts won't appear.\n  I am sorry, that just doesn't wash. This plan is a plan that says if \nwe get all we want, if we get this economic growth, if we create these \njobs, if our plan is approved, we will then double the Federal debt. \nAre we concerned about that? You bet your life we are. Are some others \naround here concerned about it? No. There is a lot of thumbing of \nsuspenders and saying, ``Aw shucks, this doesn't matter.'' Well, it \nmatters. Our kids and their kids will inherit this debt. It will be \ntheir burden to pay this.\n  We just came through a war, and God bless the soldiers we called on \nto ask to fight that war. This country is enormously blessed that it \nlasted only a very short time. But I think it is very unusual that \nAmerica sends her sons and daughters to war but says we don't choose to \npay for it at this point. It is a very costly enterprise. Nobody is \nsaying we ought to pay for this. What we said was: When you come back \nfrom the war, you can come back to the welcome arms of your family and \nthen inherit the burden of paying the costs. That is my point about the \ndebt and deficit.\n  Have I used my 7 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I yield myself 5 minutes off the bill. \nFor the record, I want to make a correction. I know it was an oversight \nby the Senator from Iowa when he mentioned that the Medicare trust fund \nwill be somewhat in jeopardy in future years.\n\n[[Page S6164]]\n\nThat is true, but I know it was an oversight when he failed to state \nthat, under the terms of our amendment, the trust fund will be made \nwhole through transfers from the general fund over to the Medicare \ntrust fund, so it will be made whole or kept whole and held harmless \nunder this amendment.\n  I know that was an oversight, but I wanted to say that for the \nrecord.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Madam President, my understanding is that when I asked whether I had \nused the 7 minutes, the response was not accurate and that there are, \nin fact, 3 minutes left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I knew I talked fast, but I didn't think I finished all 7 \nminutes then. I thank the Presiding Officer and the Parliamentarian as \nwell.\n  I wanted to make a point in response to something said earlier that, \nwell, if this amendment passes, the tax cuts for American families will \nbe gone. That is simply not the case. I will describe that I don't, \nwith this amendment, change the child tax credit. That moves to $1,000. \nIt has nothing to do with that. That stays in place. I don't propose \nchanging expensing to $75,000. That stays in place. The increase in the \nAMT, the alternative minimum tax, exemption stays in place. \nAcceleration to the 10 percent bracket stays in place. Acceleration to \nthe 15 percent bracket stays in place.\n  My point is that a lot of things are said on the floor of the Senate, \nand they are often said by someone who might mean them, but they might \nbe mistaken. It is a mistake to say that this amendment somehow, in \nsome way, jeopardizes tax cuts to most American families. It doesn't. \nIt simply does not.\n  The only question the Senate will be voting on with respect to this \namendment is the following: Do we, at long last, repeal the provision \nput in place 10 years ago? And, yes, many voted 10 years ago for that \nlarge package and put the country on track, and that led to awfully \ngood economic times. But do we repeal that provision? I felt 10 years \nago it would be better not to have that provision in the package. I \nhave on two occasions voted to repeal it. Let's try again.\n\n  If we are on the floor saying there will be very large tax cuts, \nlet's ask the question: Should this tax cut be one of them, a tax cut \nfor senior citizens that says to them the $1,500 in additional taxes \nthat 8 million of you are now paying, because we changed the rules on \nwhat percent of the Social Security receipts you get should be reported \nfor tax purposes, should that be cut? The answer is yes.\n  While we are talking about double taxation, yes, some dividends--\nfewer than 50 percent--are subject to double taxation in this country, \nbut all of this is double taxation--all of this. Senior citizens pay a \ntax on their wage when they are working. When they retire, they get a \nSocial Security benefit and pay a tax on now 85 percent of that. That \nis double taxation.\n  If, in fact, the culprit we are chasing is double taxation, why do we \nstart with dividends first? What about double taxation that results in \nSocial Security recipients being taxed while they work on the same \nincome we will now tax when they retire? It does not make any sense to \nme. The only question is not one of motives of someone who might be \nsupporting this or offering it, as my colleagues suggested a moment \nago, the question is when the roll is called, do you believe we ought \nto repeal this tax increase that senior citizens face? My answer is \nyes, let's repeal this tax increase. That ought to have a priority over \nother provisions in the bill.\n  One last point. The Senator from Montana clarified the point with \nrespect to Medicare. I appreciate he did that. I failed to do it. This \nbill does not jeopardize the Medicare trust funds at all. They are \nrestored in the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by Senator \nDorgan that would cut taxes for 8 million of our seniors that pay \nSocial Security taxes.\n  This boils down to a question of priorities. If we are going to pass \na huge tax cut as the majority insists, who would we rather provide the \ntax cuts to? This amendment would provide tax relief to senior citizens \nwho pay taxes on their Social Security benefits. Those who oppose this \namendment apparently would rather provide tax breaks that mostly go to \nthe wealthiest among us. They apparently would rather cut taxes on \ndividends that studies show will disproportionately benefit upper \nincome folks. They apparently would rather accelerate tax cuts for \ntaxpayers in the top bracket making over $300,000 a year. I would \nrather cut taxes for seniors than do these things.\n  I will support the Dorgan amendment as a major improvement to the \nunderlying bill reported by the Finance Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be temporarily laid aside so the Senator from Nevada may \noffer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Nevada.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 560\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask that amendment No. 560 be reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 560.\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To ensure that Social Security surpluses are not raided in \n             order to fund tax cuts on corporate dividends)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. MECHANISM TO PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY\n\n       (a) Certification.--\n       (1) In general.--Each year, beginning in 2003, when the \n     Final Monthly Treasury Statement for the most recently \n     completed fiscal year is issued, the Secretary of the \n     Treasury shall--\n       (A) certify whether there was a on-budget balance or \n     surplus in that fiscal year; and\n       (B) estimate whether there would be an on-budget deficit in \n     any of the succeeding 10 fiscal years if section 201 of this \n     Act takes effect January 1 of the following year.\n       (2) Estimate.--The calculations for the estimate under \n     paragraph (1)(B) shall be consistent with the baseline rules \n     specified in section 257 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Act of 1995, except for the assumption that \n     these provisions take effect and remain in effect \n     permanently.\n       (b) Delay in Dividend Tax Cut.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law or this Act, section 201 of this Act shall \n     not take effect until January 1 of the year following--\n       (1) a certification by the Secretary of the Treasury \n     pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(A) that no on-budget deficit \n     existed in the preceding fiscal year; and\n       (2) an estimate by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant \n     to paragraph (a)(1)(B) that no on-budget deficits will occur \n     in any of the 10 succeeding fiscal years even if section 201 \n     takes effect.\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I can remember as a little boy my \ngrandmother getting what she referred to as her old-age pension check. \nThat is what she called it. We have refined the name. That is not \npolitically correct anymore. We now refer to someone receiving a Social \nSecurity check.\n  The Social Security check my grandmother received gave her dignity. \nShe had eight children. The children helped her, but my grandmother, a \nproud widow, did not want to feel dependent on people, even her own \nchildren. I repeat, that old-age pension check gave her dignity. It \ngave her independence. She had money of her own that she could spend. \nShe was unable to work. My grandmother, for all the time I remember \nher, could not walk very well. She was very heavy and did not move \naround very well. But that check still gave her the ability to feel \nfree to do things on her own.\n  Social Security is the most important, the most successful social \nprogram in the history of the world. There has never been a program \nthat has worked as well as Social Security. In addition to helping my \ngrandmother as it did, Social Security has other important effects. It \nhelps those who are widows.\n\n[[Page S6165]]\n\n  I have said on this floor before and I will repeat it, I was in my \nSenate office in the Hart Building, and a woman was there representing \nan agency from Nevada. It was obvious she was very anxious to make her \nflight. I asked: You can make your plane easily; why are you so \nnervous? She had to get home to her children. She proceeded to tell me \nshe was a widow. She was a young woman. I asked her what happened to \nher husband. He was murdered. Social Security steps in in situations \nsuch as that to help widows and orphans. Social Security also helps the \ndisabled.\n  Social Security is more than a check for my grandmother. It is a \ncheck for the widow whose husband was murdered. It is a check for \nsomeone who has a debilitating disease and cannot work. Social Security \nis an important program. Our Social Security program is the envy of the \nrest of the world. It is a program that came about during the Great \nDepression, the brainchild of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and the \nprogram has been remarkable.\n  Not every Member of this body is committed to protecting Social \nSecurity. That is a fact. The former majority leader of the Senate, my \nfriend, the distinguished Senator from Kansas, Mr. Dole, is proud of \nthe fact he voted against Medicare. He acknowledges, as do a number of \nother distinguished Republican leaders, that Social Security and \nMedicare are bad programs.\n  I carry in my wallet--I still have them here; I have read them so \nmany times and I am not going to do it again--quotes from Republican \nleaders--Gingrich, Armey, Dole, and there are others who are not as \nnearly forthright as these three men who acknowledge their dislike for \nthese programs, but we know there are people in the other body who do \nnot like these programs. We know there are people in this body, \nSenators who do not like these programs.\n  As has already been stated on this floor by the distinguished Senator \nfrom North Dakota, the former chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator \nConrad, part of this tax program of the majority is simply to do away \nwith programs they cannot defeat head up. They cannot get rid of \nMedicare and Social Security with votes on the Senate floor. So these \ntax programs will starve domestic discretionary spending and cause us \nto cut back and maybe even eliminate, if they get what they want, these \nimportant programs.\n\n  I repeat, not every Member of this body is committed to protecting \nSocial Security. The amendment I have offered will give Members an \nopportunity to show not only seniors, but others, that Social Security \nis a program believed to be important to this country.\n  Young people believe in Social Security, and there has been this myth \npropounded by the majority that Social Security is about to go broke. \nSocial Security is not about to go broke. We need to do things in the \noutyears, probably around 2040, to make Social Security a better \nprogram than it would be without our help, but even if we did nothing, \nSocial Security recipients would be able to draw 75 to 80 percent of \ntheir benefits. We need to do something.\n  What is being done is exactly the wrong approach. The Republican tax \nbill that is before this Senate--call it growth and opportunity, call \nit whatever you want--is a tax bill that is devastating to the security \nof this country. It is devastating to the Social Security program.\n  My amendment is very simple. It says Congress cannot raid Social \nSecurity surpluses to fund tax cuts on corporate dividends. It is as \nsimple as that. The Social Security trust fund is being raided as we \nspeak.\n  During the Clinton years, we came to the conclusion that it was not \nappropriate to mask the yearly deficit with Social Security surpluses. \nSo we had an accurate accounting system. When we talked about there \nbeing a surplus, there was a real surplus. What we have here is a \nreport in the newspapers by the administration of what the deficit is, \nbut that deficit is masked because of Social Security surpluses.\n  As we speak, there are huge amounts of money coming in to the Social \nSecurity trust fund, and these moneys are not being spent. There is a \nsurplus.\n  As the late Senator Moynihan and I, in a dialog in the Senate one \nafternoon, talked about, it should be a Social Security trust fund, not \na Social Security slush fund.\n  It is being used as a slush fund to cover deficits. The deficit this \nyear will approach $600 billion. So I believe that we should protect \nSocial Security. We used to have debates going on about lockboxes. What \nwas a lockbox? A lockbox was a box that the Social Security surpluses \nwere in and it could not be raided. We said: You cannot have the key to \nunlock that lockbox for Social Security surpluses. That debate is gone. \nNobody talks about it anymore because everyone knows this \nadministration has not only given the key away to the lockbox but \nthrown away the lockbox. Social Security surpluses are raided every day \nin this country.\n  The last 3 years of the Clinton administration there were huge \nsurpluses, retiring hundreds of billions of dollars of debt. Now we \nhave the direct opposite. We are creating hundreds of billions of \ndollars of debt, and in the next few days we are going to be asked to \nvote upon increasing the national debt ceiling by a trillion dollars, \napproximately, some 980-odd-billion dollars. Round it off to a trillion \ndollars.\n  My amendment is about priorities. Are we going to protect Social \nSecurity or are we going to take the money raised with payroll taxes \nand use it for a tax cut for the elite of this country?\n  Every worker pays payroll taxes. Yet every worker will not benefit \nfrom a corporate dividend tax cut. So it hardly seems right that we \nwould support using payroll tax money to fund a tax cut that will \nbenefit a select few of the elite of this country.\n  A short time ago the county assessor from Washoe County, NV, Reno, \nNV, came to my office. He came for one reason, to tell me: Please, \nSenator, do not do anything to allow this dividend tax cut to go \nthrough. It will devastate Washoe County. How we build roads, bridges, \nand schools is through floating bonds. That is how we do our assessment \ndistricts, to put in water systems, curbs and gutters. If the dividend \ntax cut goes through, State and local governments are going to be \ndevastated. They will not be able to raise money as they did before.\n  So as far as I am concerned, this dividend tax cut is not good for \nour country. In just 6 years, the baby boom generation will begin to \nretire and our senior population will double--almost double from 44 \nmillion to 77 million. We need to make sure that we are prepared to \nmeet the obligations we have made to our parents, our grandparents, as \nwell as our children and our grandchildren.\n  When the Bush administration came into office, there was a projected \n$5.6 trillion 10-year surplus. Some say it was over $7 trillion. Now, \nthe Government will have a record of a $1.8 trillion deficit, and maybe \na $2 trillion deficit, and spend every dollar of the $2.2 trillion \nSocial Security surplus over the next 10 years.\n  Before Social Security, 1 in 3 older Americans lived in poverty. \nSocial Security has reduced that number to 1 in 10. Over the past few \ndecades, millions of older Americans have been lifted out of poverty by \nSocial Security.\n  I believe Social Security is one of the greatest success stories in \nthe history of our country. I have already stated that.\n  As I said, Social Security is something everyone in this country \nwants to believe is going to continue to be as successful as it has \nbeen. Yet it is a success story that will be rewritten with a tragic \nending if we decide to plow ahead with the corporate dividend tax cut \nbefore we meet our commitment to future generations. If we are going to \nbuild on the success of the Social Security Program, we cannot allow \nCongress to raid the Social Security surplus in order to fund corporate \ndividend tax cuts. New tax cuts will run up debt, make it harder for \nSocial Security to meet its future obligations, and further threaten \nits long-term solvency. Simply, this means future generations of \nseniors can look forward to uncertain retirements. For many, this will \nmean retirements into poverty.\n\n  Social Security is a guarantee of some measure of security in \nretirement. It is not everything, but it is a guarantee of some \nsecurity in retirement. The collapse of corporations like Enron and \nWorldCom underscore the importance of maintaining this guarantee and \nnot forcing workers to depend entirely on pensions for their retirement \nsavings.\n\n[[Page S6166]]\n\n  We have just started to see what is happening to the retirements of \npeople who have worked all their lives. For example, in the airline \nindustry we have real concern about the future. Are they going to be \nable to maintain their programs so people can draw their benefits? The \nairline industry is only one. We have battled with the steel industry, \ncoal miners. We have had all kinds of problems and that is only a small \nportion of what is probably going to happen in the future.\n  Not everyone agrees on how to approach Social Security reform. But \none thing is certain, nearly every single Social Security reform plan \nthat has been proposed requires additional resources, not less \nresources. In fact, the plan recommended by the President's own \ncommission to strengthen Social Security required over a trillion \ndollars. What has happened to that? The true question is, Where does \nSocial Security rank on the page of important issues voted on? Will \nthis Senate say that protecting Social Security is more important than \ngiving a dividend tax cut to the elite of this country? I hope the \nanswer is yes. I hope people vote to put Social Security first. I hope \nevery Member in this body agrees we should not raid Social Security \ntrust fund dollars so we can offer tax cuts for the elite of this \ncountry.\n  Let's show our seniors and future generations we are serious about \nfulfilling our obligations to them. It is time, and this amendment is \nthe time to demonstrate that Social Security is a top priority for this \nCongress and for the Nation.\n  A constituent said it best in a recent e-mail that he wrote to me. I \ndo not know if that is a proper term for e-mail, but I received it. He \nsaid:\n\n       Tax cuts are nice . . . but if we can't depend on what the \n     Federal Government promises, then what is left for us to \n     believe in?\n\n  Of course, that was referenced directly to Social Security.\n  I hope we will join to do the right thing for the millions of people \nwho are on Social Security, the millions of people who will go on \nSocial Security, and for those people who recognize that this program \nis the most successful social program in the history of the world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is not a \nsufficient second.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, the arguments we hear for various \namendments are very interesting. It is kind of like the other side is \ngoing in a circle. In regard to the amendment of the distinguished \nSenate minority whip, the Senator argues against the jobs bill because \nSocial Security funds are used.\n  Well, let's compare that argument to the arguments Senator Dorgan was \nusing. How does the Senator from Nevada think the Dorgan amendment he \nsupports is paid for? As the Senator from Montana pointed out, general \nrevenues will be used to cover the costs of the Dorgan amendment.\n  We are in a deficit situation. Everybody acknowledges that. So where \ndoes the Senator think these revenues will come from? They will raid \nthe Social Security trust fund to pay for the Dorgan amendment.\n  Once again, it seems to me the other side is trying to be on three \nsides of a two-sided coin. Maybe if we keep this up long enough with \ntheir circular arguments they will be supporting the jobs bill when we \nfinally get to final passage.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I personally think we should have a real \njobs bill. For example, there has been a lot of talk about how many \njobs this tax bill will create. Let's analyze this.\n  There is no dispute that for every $1 billion we spend on public \nworks projects--for example, building highways, roads, bridges, dams, \nwater systems, sewer systems--for every $1 billion we spend, we create \n47,000 jobs. The math is simple. By spending just a few billion dollars \ncompared to the multitrillion-dollar tax program that has been \nrecommended, we could create many more jobs. Those are direct, high-\npaying jobs. Every $1 billion, 47,000 jobs. Multiply that and it comes \nout to lots of jobs, especially those that would be created indirectly.\n  I hope some day we have a real jobs bill, instead of what we are \ntalking about, jobs and growth; call a pig a horse all you want, but it \nis still a pig. You can talk all you want about this tax bill and how \nmuch growth it will create; the fact is it is a program for the elite \nof this country.\n  Simple and direct to the point, it is what it is. It is an effort to \ndevastate the ability for domestic discretionary spending and cause \ntremendous harm to programs such as Social Security and Medicare.\n  I hope when we vote on this measure there will be a resounding yes \nvote. I understand there will be a technicality raised because, under \nthis rule, germaneness is a very tight rule and it will require 60 \nvotes. That is not such a high burden.\n  We should be able to have 60 Senators vote to put Social Security \nbefore giving tax cuts to the elite. My amendment goes only to the \ndividend tax cut. I hope we have support on that. If 60 Senators do not \nagree to support Social Security over a dividend tax cut, I feel very \nsorry for the remainder of the session and what it will do to the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I yield such time as he might consume \nto the Senator from Utah to either speak on the pending amendment or to \nspeak on the bill.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator withhold for a brief minute?\n  Madam President, there are Senators wondering what will happen this \nafternoon. It is my understanding that the distinguished Senator from \nIowa will propound a unanimous consent request that we will have a vote \naround 2 p.m.; is that right?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am prepared to do that. The answer is, yes, we will \nhave a vote at 2 o'clock, but I don't want to propound the unanimous \nconsent right now.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding, though, that we will have a vote, \ntry to have a unanimous consent agreement and vote on the Dorgan \namendment and the Reid amendment, and the Senator from Iowa may raise \npoints of order against those.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I could make the unanimous consent request and then \nraise a point of order later.\n  Mr. REID. That is right.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent, \nnotwithstanding the remaining debate time, it be in order for me to \nraise a point of order against the pending Reid amendment No. 560; \nprovided further that Senator Reid then be recognized and ordered to \nmove to waive. Finally, I ask consent that the vote in relationship to \nthe amendment occur at 2 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I yield such time as the Senator from \nUtah might consume.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I thank the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee for his support.\n  We continue to hear about jobs in this debate and the question of \nwhat creates job. We heard the assistant Democratic leader say for \nevery $1 billion we put into the economy, we get 47,000 jobs. I am not \nsure what study produced that number, but if it were absolutely true, \nany time we wanted we could say, let's appropriate another $1 billion \nand get another 47,000 jobs. If we need to put 470,000 people to work, \nappropriate $10 billion and go buy the jobs--as if jobs are used cars \nsitting in a car lot which can be purchased if you have enough money.\n  Unfortunately, the economy is not that simple and does not work that \nway. Jobs are created by two things. No. 1, enterpreneurism, risk \ntaking, somebody does something. A human activity is required. No. 2, \naccumulated capital. Jobs come because somebody accumulates enough \ncapital to fund the risk taking. In many instances the risk that is \nbeing taken is that the capital will be lost.\n  If we look at the creation of jobs through this prism, that it \nrequires\n\n[[Page S6167]]\n\nrisk taking and it requires accumulated capital, we see things a little \ndifferently. It is not a matter of the Federal Government spending $1 \nbillion to purchase 47,000 jobs. It is a matter of the Federal \nGovernment creating an atmosphere in which those who are willing to \nrisk their accumulated capital--or in the case of borrowing, somebody \nelse's capital--and produce the jobs that come out of that activity.\n  If I may be personal, I will outline my own experience as an \nentrepreneur in risking some accumulated capital and creating some \njobs. I was given the award as Entrepreneur of the Year by Inc Magazine \nin 1989 for the Rocky Mountain area. Frankly, I had not thought of \nmyself as an entrepreneur prior to that time when I received the award. \nI sat down and said to myself, Self, let's draw up a little tally of \nwhether or not I have, indeed, been involved in entrepreneurial \nactivities in my life. Because I had not kept track before, I did that \ninventory. I was a little surprised at what I found. I had been \ninvolved in 11 different startup or turnaround activities. That is, 11 \ndifferent attempts to create new economic activity where none had been \nbefore. Then I tallied up the record of success.\n\n  Four of these efforts failed outright. The money represented by the \naccumulated capital being risked in our attempt to create new jobs did \nnot work. The money was all lost. Four of these efforts were sold \nwithout having succeeded or failed. In other words, we started it, we \ngot it going, we decided to bail out before we found out whether or not \nwe were going to make it, and someone else took us out. We neither made \nmoney nor lost money. We lost money in the sense of our opportunities \nin the period of time we were working on these efforts was gone, but at \nleast we did not lose the accumulated capital with which we went into \nthe venture.\n  That left only 3 out of the 11 that had been successful. \nInterestingly enough, enough money was made out of those three to cover \nall of the expense of the other eight. Enough jobs were created out of \nthose three to compensate for everything that went down the drain with \nthe other eight. I decided, having done this 11 times in my life, I \nguess I did deserve to be called an entrepreneur, a risk taker.\n  Now, I will focus on one of those companies with which I was \ninvolved, to make the point that cannot be stressed too often or too \nstrongly in this debate. I was recruited to be the chief executive \nofficer of a company that at the time had four full-time employees. It \nwas doing somewhere between $250,000 and $300,000 per year. Frankly, \nits long-term prospects were not all that bright, if you looked solely \nat where it was. It was not making any money. It was just barely able \nto support those four full-time employees, and it probably couldn't \nhave afforded me.\n\n  Indeed, when I became the CEO, I was part-time and I was paid a \nconsulting fee rather than a CEO's salary because the company couldn't \nhandle that.\n  That was in 1984. The reason I point out that year is because that is \nthe year many of our friends who are discussing this bill in \napocalyptic terms would describe as part of the Decade of Greed. The \nDecade of Greed, as that phrase is used--usually in the Democratic \nParty and on the editorial page of the New York Times--refers to that \nperiod of time when Ronald Reagan was President of the United States \nand the top marginal tax rate was ultimately brought down to 28 \npercent.\n  Think of it, how greedy rich Americans were that they demanded, and \nRonald Reagan and the Republicans responded, a tax rate of 28 percent. \nWhy, that is terrible. We should clearly have moved away from that, and \nwe have. The tax increase that occurred under President Bush the first, \nand then the tax increase that occurred under President Clinton, has \nbrought us up to the rates they now insist are right and proper, an \neffective marginal tax rate--when combined with the Medicare tax--of 42 \npercent on the Nation's highest paying taxpayers.\n  They say 42 percent is about right; 42 percent shows the rich are \npaying their fair share. They say 28 percent is giving in to the \ndemands of the greedy and isn't life much better when the effective \nrate is 42 percent.\n  Now they say President Bush the second is trying to bring us back \ndown into the area of the Decade of Greed. He is not going as far as 28 \npercent, but he is going to bring us down to 35 or 32, depending on the \nbrackets. He is going to bring us down away from the 42 and back toward \nthe attitudes of the Decade of Greed.\n  So, as I say, back to my own experience. We were building that \nbusiness in the Decade of Greed. I can assure you, no one in our \ncompany was earning a six-figure salary. We couldn't afford to pay that \non the amount of revenue we got. But we had high hopes. We were taking \nbig risks. I signed a guarantee on the bank loan that would have cost \nme my house if we had not been able to pay it, and every other \nshareholder in the business did the same thing. We were on the line. At \nthat point, that was the only real asset I owned. But I signed it \nbecause I believed we could make it go.\n  We were on the line then, for losing our houses--talk about taking a \nrisk--in order to get the accumulated capital that we needed to build \nthat business in the form of a business loan. It was $75,000.\n  Madam President, $75,000 doesn't sound like a lot of money, but when \nyou are going to lose your house, $75,000 is a huge amount of money. It \nwas added to $75,000 that had been there before I showed up, so the \ntotal debt of the company was $150,000, and they were going to take \nafter me to take $150,000 out of my house and I didn't have $150,000 in \nequity in the house. We had to add it all up with everybody else's \nhouses to get to the $150,000, and then the amount on top that the bank \nwanted.\n\n  We were successful. I will not bore the Senate with the details of \nwhat happened, but we were successful. Madam President, 6\\1/2\\ years \nlater, when I stepped down as the CEO of that company, prior to my \ndecision to run for the Senate, we were doing $80 million a year.\n  The debt had grown from the original $75,000 to $7.5 million, but we \ndidn't care about the debt because we had more than enough money to \ncover it. As a percentage of our sales, as a percentage of our profits, \nthe debt was now de minimis. I make that point because the argument has \nbeen made on the floor today that the debt of the United States is \ngoing to go from $6 trillion to $12 trillion and isn't that awful?\n  The answer is, yes; that is awful if the U.S. economy is not going to \ngrow. Then the debt is going to double. But if the U.S. economy is \ngoing to double in size in the period that the debt doubles in size, \nthe debt will be no more of a problem in 10 years than it is now. And \nnow the debt as a percentage of the economy is lower in the United \nStates than it is in any other industrialized nation. The other \ncountries of the world would kill to get the kind of debt-to-GDP \nrelationship we have already. So I am not alarmed by the statistic that \nhas been quoted on the other side because I have lived with it \npersonally.\n  I have seen the debt of the company over which I presided go from \n$75,000 to $7.5 million, and I recognize that the $7.5 million was a \nbenign figure whereas the $75,000 was threatening to shut us down \nbecause the sales of the company had gone from $300,000 to $80 million. \nThe margins had gone from zero--at $300,000 we weren't making any \nmoney--to 20 percent before taxes, so we had an aftertax margin of \nabout 10 percent. Twenty percent of $80 million is $16 million. We had \na $16 million pretax profit, which makes it very easy to service a $7.5 \nmillion debt. So let's not talk about the debt figures in the aggregate \nand scare everybody with relationships that make no sense.\n  However, back to the point of the marginal tax rates. As we built \nthat business from $300,000 a year to $80 million, we did it during the \nDecade of Greed when the top marginal tax rate was 28 percent. That \nmeant of every pretax dollar we earned, we got to keep 72 cents of it \nto finance the growth of the business. We went from 4 full-time \nemployees to over 700 in that period. We created 700 new jobs, and we \ndid it without a dime of Federal money. Nobody walked out and said: \nHere is your portion of the $1 billion we are going to use to purchase \n47,000 jobs.\n  The way the Federal Government helped us was they said to us, for \nevery pretax dollar you earn, you get to keep\n\n[[Page S6168]]\n\n72 cents. We funded the growth of that company, from 4 employees to 700 \nemployees, out of the earnings of the company.\n  Just for a moment, look at what would happen if we had founded that \nin 1994 instead of 1984. The Federal Government would have said to us, \nin 1994: For every pretax dollar you earn, you get to keep 58 cents \nbecause we are going to take 42 cents. The difference between 58 cents \nand 72 cents would have made, for that company, the difference between \nrapid growth and stagnation. I am not saying we couldn't have made it \nunder the effective tax rate of 1994, but I am saying, with great \ncertainty, that it would have been much more difficult and the growth, \neven if it had come, would have been much slower. In other words, the \nnumber of jobs created would have been substantially less with a \nmarginal tax rate of 42 percent than it was with a marginal tax rate of \n28 percent.\n  In the spirit of full disclosure I should point out that once I left \nthe company, it then grew from 700 jobs to 4,000, and I have to say \nthere is a direct cause and effect relationship. Getting me out of \nthere made it grow substantially faster.\n  The point of focusing so firmly on a single firm and the experience \nis this: We were an S corporation. That is a tax designation which \nmeans that the profits of the company flowed through the company to the \npersonal tax returns of the investors. I would show at some point in \nthat situation a private tax return--a 1040--of over $1 million of \npersonal income.\n  You can say: Good Heavens, he is the richest man around. He is \nearning $1 million a year. No. I was earning my salary, which was \n$140,000. Then I was reporting my share of the company's income so that \nthe income didn't get taxed twice. If the company had paid taxes at the \ncompany level, and then had given me my share of the income, the \ncompany would have paid taxes and I would have paid taxes.\n  Does this sound familiar? That is what this debate is about with \nrespect to the taxation of dividends. We could have avoided taxation of \ndividends because we had a small enough number of shareholders to \nqualify as an S corporation as opposed to the C, referring to the \nchapters in the Tax Code that describe all of this. But I was not \ntaking home $1 million a year. I was not taking home after tax $1 \nmillion a year. All the company gave me of the million dollars that the \ncompany put on my personal tax return was 28 percent; in other words, \nenough to pay the taxes that were being reported on my form. But the \ncompany kept the other 72 cents to grow the business.\n  That was true of every other shareholder in the company. We had five \nshareholders, every one of whom was reporting over $1 million a year in \npersonal income but who were in fact receiving only their salaries and \ngiving back to the company 72 cents out of every dollar they were \nreportedly receiving. That is how we were able to grow the company.\n  That same pattern still exists even though it was badly damaged when \nwe went to a 42-percent marginal tax rate in 1993. There are still S \ncorporations and sole proprietorships and partnerships where the owners \nof the company receive a tax form saying they have $1 million or \nwhatever their share of the profit of the enterprise might be, but they \ngive back everything except that which is necessary to pay the taxes.\n  That means there are small businessmen who have tax returns that very \nquickly get into the top marginal rate. They are small businessmen who \nare struggling, and increasingly small business women who are \nstruggling to make the business grow, only being able to keep 58 cents \nout of every dollar they earn. They may report tax returns that put \nthem in the top 1 percent of taxpayers, but they are not Michael Jordan \nor Donald Trump. They are doing their best to get along with a little \nbusiness that employs 5 or 6 people and the business is earning \n$200,000 plus the salary they pay themselves. They need that $200,000 \ndesperately back in the business to keep it growing. But Uncle Sam \ncomes along and says: The business may be earning $200,000--that shows \nup on your personal tax return--we are going to take $84,000 of that \n$200,000 in taxes. Good luck making the business grow.\n  If there are entrepreneurs good enough and working hard enough, they \ncan make the business grow, but they have to delay hiring that extra \nperson because they are paying $84,000 out of the $200,000 instead of \npaying at the 28 percent that we paid when we were making our business \ngrow.\n  When we talk about, the rich don't need this tax cut, the rich don't \nneed to have their effective rate rolled back from 42 percent to, say, \n35 percent, and Donald Trump doesn't need that, let's make him pay his \nfair share, or Michael Jordan doesn't need that, let's make him pay his \nfair share, we are ignoring the fact that it is the small businessman \nand the small businesswoman hiring the extra employee, be it in Alaska, \nUtah, or Colorado, or wherever it is, who will drive the opportunity \nfor new jobs to be created all over the country.\n\n  Most of the new job creation in this country comes from small \nbusiness. That is a truth that has been repeated over and over on this \nfloor. Everybody says they are in favor of small business. Everybody, \nregardless of where they sit on the floor, says small business is the \nbackbone of the American economy. They are right.\n  One of the reasons other industrialized countries, such as Germany, \nFrance, Japan, and others, have been unable to see their economies grow \nat the rate ours does is that they have been unable to see their job \ngrowth come anywhere close to the rate of ours because they don't have \nsmall business. They don't have anything like the network of small \nbusiness and entrepreneurial activity that is the hallmark of the \nAmerican economy.\n  It is right and proper for us to come to the floor regardless of \nparty and tell everybody how much we love small business. But it is \ndeceptive to say that this is a tax cut for the Michael Jordans of the \nworld when we realize that the primary economic activity of rolling \nback the top marginal rates will be for the small business men and \nwomen of this country, if they could ever get back to the level of \neffective tax rates during the decade of greed, who could create the \nkind of jobs that were created in that period, could create the kind of \nmomentum that was created in that period.\n  Back to my company, it was founded in 1984. They say when I stepped \ndown as the CEO in 1991, we had gone from 4 employees to 700, and we \nhad created the momentum that produced that growth in that period where \nthe top marginal rate was 28 percent. That momentum carried forward \ninto the 1990s. That carried forward to the point where they eventually \ngot to 4,000 jobs instead of 700.\n  We hear in this Congress that some of us in this Congress took credit \nfor that. Some in this Congress looked at that and said: The Clinton \nincrease to an effective rate of 42 percent has created jobs. This \ncompany went from 700 to 4,000; that was created by President Clinton; \nthat was created in the Clinton administration. I submit to you it was \ncreated in the Decade of Greed. It was created when Ronald Reagan \nhelped the Congress get the effective rate down to 28 percent when we \nlaid the groundwork and sowed the seeds for the kind of explosive \ngrowth for which the harvest took place in the 1990s.\n  I submit that by establishing a top marginal rate of 42 percent in \nthe 1990s, when that momentum of growth was going on coming out of the \n1980s, we are now harvesting an opposite kind of situation. Small \nbusiness faced with an effective tax rate of 42 percent, where they can \nonly keep 58 cents out of every pretax dollar to help grow the \nbusiness, is growing more slowly than they were. Just as the excitement \nof the 1990s was harvest of the low tax period of the 1980s, now some \nof the problem in 2000-plus is the harvest of the high tax rates of the \n1990s.\n  What we have to learn around here is that there is a lag in fiscal \npolicy. People ask me, What is the difference between fiscal policy and \nmonetary policy? Very simply, monetary policy is what the Federal \nReserve does about the monetary supply, and fiscal policy is what the \nCongress does about taxes.\n  We can pass a tax bill and say, We handled this problem. But the \nreality is what we have done in a tax bill either for good or ill is \nsow some seed that will be harvested later on.\n  As we look back over what was done in 2001, we begin to understand \nsome of\n\n[[Page S6169]]\n\nthe things about the sowing of seeds. In 2001, we had a balanced tax \ncut--balanced politically, not economically. The political balance \nsaid: We have to put some money in people's hands immediately because \nthere are those who insist that is the thing that will cause the \neconomy to grow. So let's put money in customers' hands right away. \nThat was the genesis of the $300-per-person rebate.\n  Then there are those who said: No, we have to bring down the top \nmarginal tax rate, for all of the reasons I have been discussing. For \nsmall business to create new jobs, for all those S corporations that \nare reporting on their personal tax returns the corporate income that \nis placed there, we have to see to it those people get back down into \nthe level where they can create jobs at the same energy and same rate \nin which they were creating jobs in the late 1980s.\n  All right. What have we learned in the 3 years since we passed the \n2001 tax cut? We learned that amount of money that went out in the \nrebate had little or no impact on creating jobs. All of us took credit \nfor it. We stood out in front of the Capitol, we waved the $300 check, \nand we had our pictures taken. We had people come up to us in airports \nand shopping malls and say: Thank you, Senator. I got my $300. That is \nterrific. But the economic impact of that, looking back on it, was \nnegligible. Why?\n  Didn't you want all those people to go out and spend that money? Yes. \nAnd a very large percentage of them did not. What do you mean? Did they \nput it in their mattress? No. They paid down their Visa card. They paid \ndown their MasterCard. They lowered their own personal amount of debt, \nwhich was a prudent thing for them to do. But that did not produce very \nmuch economic activity.\n  Also, if you take the total amount of money involved in that rebate, \nand then compare it to an economy of $11 trillion, you realize we were \ntalking about a tiny percentage. There was no leverage in that amount \nof money. And while it was a good thing to do, and it helped a lot of \npeople--and I am glad they got their credit card debt down by an extra \n$300--it did not produce any jobs. And that is what we are talking \nabout.\n  However, simply the promise that the top marginal tax rate would come \ndown did, in fact, cause some small businesspeople to say: All right, \nthe effect is not immediate, the relief is not here right now, but I \ncan see it coming, and I can plan on it.\n  The most important quality a small business man or woman has to have \nin order to succeed in business is the ability to somehow, some way \ncorrectly see the future because every business enterprise is involved \nin selling in the future. No business enterprise survives on the basis \nof what it did in the past. It is all tied to what it can see in the \nfuture.\n  So as these small business men and women looked out into the future, \nthey said: This 42-percent effective rate that came in with President \nClinton is going to start to come down. And as I make my plans for what \nI will do, as I try to invest and I try to create jobs in the future, I \ncan plan on that coming down. And the mere anticipation and sense of \ncertainty that came out of being able to plan for a reduction in the \namount of money that Uncle Sam would take out of their businesses \ncaused some beginning stirrings in the small business community toward \nthe creation of new jobs. But those stirrings were not enough.\n\n  We are in recovery, but the recovery is far from robust. Chairman \nGreenspan calls it a ``soft patch.'' And the soft patch, unfortunately, \nhas gone on longer than he or any of the rest of us would like.\n  So how do we get out of this soft patch? The most important thing we \ncould do is say to these small business men and women: Guess what. You \nwere planning on this reduction in the amount of money Uncle Sam takes \nout of your entrepreneurial activity in a few years. We are going to \nmake that reduction effective right now. As a matter of fact, we are \ngoing to make it effective January 1, 2003.\n  All right. Now, as I make my plans as a small businessman, I can say: \nI am going to be able to keep more than 58 cents. I will be able to \nkeep 60 cents, 62 cents, maybe even 65 cents. Now I can plan on having \nthat much more money coming out of my enterprise. I can go hire that \nextra person. I can go buy that extra piece of machinery, which means \nthat the manufacturer of the machinery can hire an extra person. Now \nthat I see that marginal rate coming down, and coming down more rapidly \nthan was promised in 2001, I can react accordingly. And now we can \nstart to see the small business job machine get cranked up.\n  We all need to understand this about economics: Economics turns on \nincentives. No one will invest in an enterprise where the Government \nwould take 100 percent of the profits because there is no incentive. \nYou say, all right, the Government will take only 99 percent of the \nprofits, and there is still no incentive. So the Government says, all \nright, we will take 80 percent of the profits. Well, maybe you begin to \nget my interest now. The Government will only take 50 percent of the \nprofits. All right, now there is an incentive for me to invest.\n  In the 1980s, the Government said to small business, we will only \ntake 28 percent of the profits, and you saw a period of job growth, job \ncreation, and economic expansion unparalleled in our history. And, \nbased on my own experience, I believe it was an impetus and an inertia \nof job creation that carried over into the 1990s, for which the \nCongresses and the President in the 1990s took credit.\n  But the inertia, as I say, has changed because the incentive got a \nlittle less in 1991 when President Bush went to Andrews Air Force Base \nand said: Let's tell the small business man and woman we are going to \ntake more of their pretax money away from them. And there was a sense: \nWell, we better not buy that new piece of machinery. We better not hire \nthat new person. We are going to have a problem.\n  And then President Clinton said: Let's tell the small business man \nand woman we are going to take even more in 1993, and bring the top \nmarginal tax rate up to the level that I have described.\n  You sow the seeds of incentive, you reap the fruits. If the incentive \nis to invest, if the incentive is to hire, if the incentive is to take \nrisk, you get the benefits of higher economic activity and higher job \ncreation. If you sow the seeds of negative incentive that says the \nFederal Government will take more of your money than it has been, you \nreap the rewards of higher unemployment and slower economic activity.\n  It always takes time. It never happens, in fiscal policy, overnight. \nBut I submit we are now in a position where we need to move clearly and \nfirmly back toward the time when the incentive was to invest, when the \nincentive was to take risk, when the incentive was to build a small \nbusiness.\n  I think it disingenuous, therefore, to attack all of the reduction in \nthe marginal tax rate as if every single tax return that shows income \nbeing taxed at the top marginal tax rate is coming from a Michael \nJordan or a Bill Gates or a Donald Trump.\n  It ignores the fact that the majority--I don't have the exact \nstatistic; I have heard it as high as two-thirds, but it varies from \ntime to time--of the tax returns filed in the top marginal tax rate are \ntax returns with small business income on them, tax returns such as the \none I described for myself when I had my salary on there and then I had \nan extra million dollars as my share of the company's profits \ntransferred on to my tax return, none of which money I saw, none of \nwhich money I got because all of which had to go back to the company to \nhelp it grow and help it create jobs.\n  Let us understand that this is not a debate about whether Bill Gates \nshould get a tax cut. This is a debate about whether small businessmen \nand small businesswomen all across this country should get an incentive \nto hire, an incentive to invest, an incentive to build for the future, \nwhether to plant seeds of growth which will yield a significant harvest \nfor us later on. I believe the sooner we can plant those seeds, the \nbetter off we will be.\n  I believe the lesson of the tax cut of 2001 tells us that what we did \nthere, however salutory, was not good enough and not strong enough, \nthat it has not gotten us through the soft patch that it was supposed \nto help with, and we need to get on with this.\n  For that reason, I will support a cut in the top marginal tax rate, \nand I will\n\n[[Page S6170]]\n\nrejoice in the years to come as new jobs are created, new economic \nactivity occurs, and, yes, new tax revenues start to roll in to the \nFederal Government. At that time whoever is in the Senate will take \ncredit for those tax revenues, whoever is in the Senate will take \ncredit for the good economy that we have. And whoever is managing \nPresidential campaigns will say it was President this or President that \nwho was personally responsible for it.\n  We should understand that the economy is much more sophisticated than \nthat. We should do what we can to let the economy do its work by \ncreating the incentives that will produce the two things that produce \njobs: risk taking and accumulated capital. This bill moves in the \ndirection of rewarding both.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have the deepest affection for my friend \nfrom Utah. He lives in a different political world than I do. He just \ndid a stunning job in his debate, but he was debating himself. The \nmatter pending before the Senate is whether we should have tax cuts for \nthe elite--that is, dividend tax cuts--or whether those moneys should \nbe kept for Social Security. That seems pretty simple to me.\n  I did mention, and the Senator from Utah responded briefly, that my \nproposal to have public works projects is not in keeping with his idea \nof how to create jobs. The only way to create jobs, he said, is through \nentrepreneurship.\n  Well, Frainer Construction of Nevada, Helms Construction of Nevada, \nGranite Construction, Las Vegas Paving--large by Nevada standards--are \ncompanies that believe in entrepreneurship. Every road they build, \nevery water project they work on, every bridge they repair is \nentrepreneurship. What is the difference in these huge tax cuts that go \nto the elite, that create no jobs, as I will shortly show? If past \nexperience means anything, I think we are better off directly doing \nsomething.\n  My friend from Utah has acknowledged that there is not going to be \nanything happening in the near future. He is talking about future \nPresidents taking credit, future Congresses. He has acknowledged that \nnothing is going to happen in the near term with this foolish tax cut \nthat has been proposed.\n  All this talk about growth and jobs, as this bill is intended to do, \nsimply will not work. I direct my friend to a few people on this chart. \nThese are the economists who support the Bush tax plan. You can see \nthem on the left hand side, few in number. The economists opposing the \nBush tax plan are 450 in number. Those who support the plan are 13 in \nnumber. Those opposing are 10 people who have won Nobel Prizes for \ntheir work. We have, in fact, professors from the University of Utah, \nGail Blattenberger, Samuel Jameson, David Kiefer, Thomas Maloney, James \nM. Rock, Norman Waitzman, all distinguished scholars from Utah who are \non this chart who say this tax plan the President has proposed is not \ngood.\n  The question before the body--the vote will take place at 2--is \nwhether this body will vote to have a tax cut for the elite as it \nrelates to dividends or whether Senators will vote to protect Social \nSecurity. The Social Security debate has left this body since \nRepublicans became the party that dwells in the White House. We used to \ntalk about a lockbox. Not only the key has been lost but the whole \nlockbox has been thrown someplace we can't find. Social Security is not \npart of the equation anymore. Suddenly deficits don't matter.\n  I say to my distinguished friend who was a courageous soldier for the \nUnited States, somebody who was valiant in battle and who I have the \ngreatest respect for as a legislator, I want to bring to his attention \nsome of the problems that exist with this new philosophy that deficits \ndon't matter.\n  I refer the distinguished Presiding Officer to a statement he made on \nthe 6th of February 1997, in the Omaha World Herald:\n\n       The real threat to Social Security is the national debt. If \n     we don't act to balance the budget and stop adding to the \n     debt, then we are truly placing the future of Social Security \n     in jeopardy.\n\n  I ask my friend, when he comes down to this table in 40 minutes and \nvotes, to remember what he said in 1997. This is clearly an indication \nthat we are driving this country into a terribly difficult situation as \nit relates to the deficit.\n  Deficits don't matter? I hope they do. But apparently there has been \na new philosophy from the other side of the aisle.\n  We are going to be asked in a few days to increase the national debt \nby almost $1 trillion. I hope people will be more concerned about the \ndebt. I agree with the statement made by the Senator from Nebraska.\n  I believed the chairman of the Federal Reserve System when he told us \nin the Appropriations Committee that the most important thing we could \ndo is get rid of the deficit. We did that. We took him at his word. As \na result of that, we had years where we paid down the debt to the tune \nof $600 billion.\n  When the Bush administration took office, they promised to eliminate \nthe national debt and spur the economy with a massive tax cut for the \nelite. I didn't vote for that tax cut because I thought it would do \nexactly what it has done. I have been through the years in the past \nwhen we were told that the trickle down theory was a great one and \nwould help the country economically. It didn't then, and it didn't \nduring the Bush 2 program. This plan has failed the vast majority of \npeople in America who are worse off than 2 years ago when this man took \noffice.\n  Since this administration took office, the economy has lost almost 3 \nmillion private sector jobs. The economy has shed 500,000 jobs in the \npast 3 months alone. About 9 million people are looking for work. The \nunemployment rate is 6 percent. The number of unemployed workers has \nincreased 47 percent since the President took office. A growing share \nof the unemployed workers are long-term unemployed. In February, nearly \n2 million people had been unemployed for 6 months, which is triple what \nit was before this man became President. The Bush administration is on \ntrack to post the worst job creation record of any administration in \nalmost six decades. This tax cut raids Social Security, and that is \nwhat this amendment is all about.\n  I have been here long enough to know that the majority are not very \nindependent. I believe--and I hope my belief is unfounded--that come 2 \no'clock people will march down here and vote against this amendment. \nThey will vote that it is not germane. It takes 60 votes. We know the \nrules of germaneness. They will march down here just like lemmings over \nthe cliff and throw Social Security to the wind, I am sorry to say, but \nI think that is what is going to happen.\n  Even without the new tax break for the elite, this Government will \nspend every dollar of the $2 trillion Social Security surplus over the \nnext 10 years--even without this. So with this, it will be done more \nquickly.\n  The real reason for the deficit is the tax cut--the tax cut \npreviously made, which I voted against. It is not easy to vote against \ntax cuts. People love them. It will be used against me in my campaign. \nThat is the way it is.\n  The Congressional Budget Office says that only 14 percent of the \ndeficit is as a result of homeland security and defense spending. Over \n10 years, Federal spending on interest on the public debt will amount \nto $2.4 trillion. Of course, every dollar directed toward interest is \ndiverted from Social Security. It is diverted from Medicare, education, \ndefense, and homeland security.\n  The additional interest burden on a family of four will be $30,000. \nThat is the additional burden. State and local governments are in the \nmidst of the worst fiscal crisis since World War II. Last month, the \ncumulative 2004 budget shortfall was about $54 billion. A billion of \nthat is in the small State of Nevada. State and local governments, \nwhich bear primary responsibility for most education, health care, and \nfirst responder expenditures, will bear the brunt of the consequences \nof this irresponsible tax plan.\n  The second phase gets even worse. Sixteen States have cut education \nprograms in elementary schools. In Nevada, the Clark County School \nDistrict is considering going to a 4-day week for kids because it is \nhaving trouble paying for a 5-day week. Twenty States have cut health \ncare programs, even though we are living in a heightened risk of \nbioterrorism and SARS. It makes no sense to just chop to pieces\n\n[[Page S6171]]\n\nour State public health budgets. But that is a consequence of what is \nhappening in this administration.\n  What is wrong with this plan we are being asked to approve? It fails \nto help working people, for one thing. Our top priority is to create \njobs. I will say it again, Mr. President--creating jobs. The moneys \nthat would be given in these public works projects, which are not new \njobs--I bet in the States of Utah and Nebraska there are many projects \non the drawing board that simply cannot be completed because there is \nno money to do it--roads, water and sewer projects, bridges, dams, all \nthose activities. They are on the drawing boards now and would go \nforward tomorrow if there were money to do it.\n  As I indicated before, for every billion dollars spent, 40,000 jobs \nare created. Those are direct jobs, all high-paying jobs. These people \nwould buy refrigerators, carpets, cars, all kinds of consumer items. \nThere are a lot of indirect jobs as a result. The Republican plan fails \nto help working people. It fails to preserve Social Security. It offers \nno relief to the 9 million Americans who want to work but cannot find a \njob.\n  People on the other side refer to this as a ``jobs and growth \npackage.'' As I said earlier today, you can call a pig a horse, but it \ndoesn't matter how many times you call a pig a horse, it is still a \npig. Or you can call a horse a pig; it doesn't matter; that animal is \nstill a horse. You can call this program jobs and growth all you want, \nbut it doesn't make it a jobs and growth program. Calling this a jobs \nand growth program--there could not be anything further from the truth.\n  The CBO, the White House Counsel of Economic Advisers, and the \nprivate sector economists who helped the President analyze this \nproposal have stated that his tax break plan won't create jobs and will \nweaken the long-term health of this country. In fact, some economists \nhave forecast that the plan will cause an annual .25 percent drop in \nGDP and will result in a loss of almost a million jobs in the next 10 \nyears. That is in addition to the jobs that have already been lost. \nThere are the 400 economists there on the chart. And I am sure there \nwould be more if we spent a little extra time. So 400 economists, \nincluding 10 Nobel laureate prizewinners, signed a statement warning \nthat the President's plan would do long-term harm to the economy, \nadding to the Nation's projected deficits.\n  Mr. President, you were not standing there alone saying deficits \nmatter. Some of your colleagues also felt the same. A number of very \ndistinguished colleagues felt the same. For example, somebody for whom \nI have the greatest respect, Trent Lott--we worked together on the \nfloor very closely for 4 years--said on the 27th day of January, 2002:\n\n       I think the most important thing really does involve the \n     budget--keeping a balanced budget, not dipping into Social \n     Security, and continuing to reduce the national debt.\n\n  He gave that quote to the Chattanooga Free Press. What has changed? \nNothing has changed in a little over a year. Senator Judd Gregg--here \nis a man who has wide-ranging experience. He served in the House of \nRepresentatives, he was a Governor, and now he is a Senator. He said to \nthe New Hampshire Sun News on the first day of February 1998:\n\n       As long as we have a Republican Congress, we are going to \n     have a balanced budget. And if we can get a Republican \n     President, we can start paying down the debt on the Federal \n     Government.\n\n  What has happened to that? Do deficits not matter anymore? Obviously, \nthey don't. We are going to be asked to increase the national debt a \ntrillion dollars in a few days.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Illinois for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Nevada, it is not just a question \nof the national debt--which is bad enough--that has to be repaid, and \ninterest has to be paid on it, not just by us but by our children and \ngrandchildren, but is it not a fact that the money we are putting into \nthe President's program for tax breaks for elite investors in America \nis coming out of the Social Security trust fund, out of the Medicare \ntrust fund? These are trust funds that are going to struggle with more \nand more elderly Americans needing their help, and we are going to give \na tax break to wealthy people at the expense of Social Security and \nMedicare. Is that not a part of the problem as well?\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend in answer to his \nquestion, the Senator is absolutely right. What is happening boggles my \nmind. I am certainly not a genius, but I did OK in school, and I can \nunderstand some basic facts. How can people, for whom I have the \nhighest respect, say one thing about deficits mattering and Social \nSecurity mattering and vote for this awful program?\n  I say to my friend, the distinguished Senator from Illinois, what I \nsaid earlier today. I believe this is all part of a program to do away \nwith some of these programs in which we really believe. I repeated in \ndifferent words what the Senator said today in responding to a \nstatement made by the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee. \nI said the same thing to the distinguished junior Senator from Utah. \nThey live in a different world than I live in. It is as simple as that. \nThey live in a different world. They care about the trickle down \ntheory. I do not. I do not think it has worked. Over the years I have \nseen it trying to work where you give money to the elite of this \ncountry. It does not trickle down.\n  We have significant problems in the State of Nevada. We are battling \nbudget problems in the little State of Nevada, and the Republican \nGovernor in the State of Nevada--I am sure it was very difficult for \nhim--because there is no alternative because of the unfunded mandates \nthe Federal Government passed on to the State of Nevada, is trying to \nfind ways to create new revenues. I say the word, the Republican \nGovernor of the State of Nevada has asked for new taxes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if I may ask the Senator from Nevada, if \nthe argument has been made by the Republicans that if we give the \nPresident another tax cut for elite investors and wealthy people that \nthis will somehow create jobs, is it not fair for us to look back and \nsee how successful the President was the last time he made this \npromise?\n  If I recall correctly, we gave this President a $1 trillion--some say \n$2 trillion--tax cut just 2 years ago. If I am not mistaken, we have \nlost jobs. Under this Bush administration, we have lost somewhere in \nthe range of 2 million jobs. In my State of Illinois, under the Bush \nadministration, we have lost 191,000 jobs, 20,000 manufacturing jobs in \nthe last 12 months.\n  If the President's plan of tax cuts for wealthy people is exactly the \nmedicine to cure our problems, how do we explain the fact that the \neconomy is still so sick 2 years after the President tried this tax cut \nthe first time?\n  Mr. REID. I respond to my friend, I voted against the first tax cut. \nIt was not an easy vote. Just on general principle you want to vote for \ntax cuts. I believe the payroll taxes are something most people pay \nmuch more than they do in income taxes. I would like to figure out some \nway to give them a break from payroll taxes. I think there are ways we \ncan reduce taxes.\n  At first glance, you do not want to vote against a tax cut, but I had \nan inkling, I had a belief, I had a conviction that doing what was done \nwith the first big tax cut would throw this country into an economic \ndownturn, and that is what it has done.\n  When the Bush administration took office, they promised to eliminate \nthe national debt and spur the economy with a massive tax cut for the \nwealthy. They failed to deliver. Most people are not better off; they \nare worse off than they were 2 years ago, I say to my friend.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield for a question from my friend from \nUtah without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I ask the Senator, if he is interested, if I gave him \nthe names of another 400 economists who were in favor of the Bush tax \ncut if he would put them on his chart? Such names are available.\n  Mr. REID. I respond to my friend from Utah, I borrowed this chart \nfrom somebody else. I am not much on this chart business, but I know \nthat if there are that many who favor the tax cut, you should do your \nown chart.\n\n[[Page S6172]]\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. I further ask, Mr. President, a question of the Senator \nfrom Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I yield for a question. I will do that.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Reference has been made by the Senator from Illinois to \nthe effect of a $2 trillion tax cut. Is it not true that what we are \nasking for in this bill is that the effect of that tax cut be made now \nbecause the effects of that tax cut, as you get up to the number of $2 \ntrillion, was stretched out over a number of years and, in fact, the \nmarginal tax rate cut that has actually occurred now, to which the \nSenator from Illinois referred, has been minimal and we are trying to \naccelerate the effect?\n  It does not seem to me fair to say it failed and, by the way, we have \nnot had any effect from it. The reason we have not had the effect is \nbecause they have not been put into effect.\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to respond to the question. First, it seems \na little unusual to me, the huge tax cuts written by the Republicans \nand passed virtually by Republican votes, with very few Democratic \nvotes, now they are saying the tax cut was not big enough and not quick \nenough. So now what we are going to do is come back with a bigger tax \ncut and I guess they say it is not quick enough.\n  The majority has written both tax bills. I voted against the first \ntax cut, and I will vote against the second tax cut because I believe \nthe tax cut certainly is not going to help Social Security. Remember, \nthe issue before the Senate today, and we are going to vote on it at 2 \no'clock, is whether this body should give tax cuts to the elite of this \ncountry in the form of reducing the tax on corporate dividends or \nwhether that money should be put back in Social Security. That is the \nissue before the Senate. It is a very simple issue.\n  I have talked about what I think is wrong with the plan in general. \nRemember, my statement has been directed toward what I feel is a very \npertinent question: Does this body, the Senate, want to preserve Social \nSecurity or destroy Social Security? The vote at 2 o'clock will take \nthat into consideration.\n  I believe when we had discussions on the Senate floor dealing with \nlockboxes and keys to lockboxes that it was a good discussion because I \nfelt very strongly that we should do something to preserve Social \nSecurity.\n  It is interesting to me that there was a constitutional amendment \noffered on the Senate floor to balance the budget. It was offered by \nRepublicans. I offered a counter amendment. I said that is a great \nidea, let's do it, but we are going to do it without using the Social \nSecurity surpluses. That was not enough for my friends on the \nother side of the aisle. My amendment received 44 votes. I was six \nvotes short. I wanted a constitutional amendment to balance the budget \nbut not use the surpluses of Social Security. The majority disagreed. \nThey wanted to use Social Security surpluses to balance the budget. \nThat is unfair. I have no regret having done that.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I yield to my friend for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to speak for a moment to this. Is it not a \nfact that we are only a few years away from the baby boom generation \nshowing up for Social Security? Isn't it the height of irresponsibility \nfor us to be dragging this Nation deeper in deficit at the expense of \nthe Social Security trust fund when we know that parents and \ngrandparents are going to be asking for the Social Security benefits \nwhich they paid for a lifetime? Isn't the same true when it comes to \nMedicare, that these same senior citizens will need Medicare to make \nsure they are healthy, independent, and lead strong lives as long as \npossible, and what we are doing is jeopardizing Social Security and \nMedicare to provide tax breaks for the elite investors in America?\n  How in the world can you rationalize that once we have a promise to a \ngeneration that has paid for over 40 years into Social Security? I \nwonder if the Senator from Nevada can remember when President George W. \nBush came to us with his first tax cut, he said: This should be easy. \nWe are going to have a surplus over the next 10 years of $5.6 trillion. \nFor goodness' sake, you do not need the money in Washington to waste on \nprograms. Send it back home to the families so they do not have to pay \ntaxes.\n  A lot of people were enthralled by this message. I was not. Neither \nwas the Senator from Nevada. Today, is it not a fact, I ask the Senator \nfrom Nevada, that same projection over 10 years has gone from the \nPresident's $5.6 trillion surplus to a $1.8 trillion deficit and that \nthis bill will make the deficit even worse over the next 10 years?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is absolutely right. The baby boom generation \nis upon us.\n  Our senior population will nearly double from 44 million to 77 \nmillion in just 6 years. That is what it is all about. I am just \nstunned by--I believe in intellectual consistency, and I try to be \nconsistent on what I do in my legislative voting on the Senate floor. I \ntry to remember statements I have made, so I do not want to be \ninconsistent, to say something today that is inconsistent with \nsomething I said previously.\n  What has happened to our friends on the other side of the aisle who \ncared so much about deficits and balancing the budget, who offered a \nconstitutional amendment on the Senate floor to balance the budget? Of \ncourse, they wanted to use Social Security surpluses, but still they \nwere concerned about balancing the budget.\n  Senator Rick Santorum, the junior Senator from Pennsylvania, who is \none of the leaders on the other side of the aisle, is quoted in the \nPittsburgh Post Gazette:\n\n       The American people are sick and tired of excuses for \n     inaction to balance the budget. The public wants us to stay \n     the course towards a balanced budget, and we take that \n     obligation quite seriously.\n\n  Take it quite seriously, when we are going to be asked to increase \nthe national debt in a few days by a trillion dollars--by a trillion \ndollars; not a billion, not a million but a trillion? Where are all of \nthese statements? What happened to them? What happened to the \nconsistency? Why all of a sudden do deficits not matter, the national \ndebt does not matter, Social Security does not matter, Medicare does \nnot matter, education does not matter, just give tax cuts to the elite \nand it will all be fine?\n  It is going to take care of all the environmental problems we have in \nAmerica today. We do not have to worry about Superfund, endangered \nspecies, clean air, clean water. Just cut taxes. That takes care of it \nall.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Nevada, if we have now reached a \npoint in our history where deficits do not count, can you not also \nconclude from that statement that it does not count that our children \nand grandchildren will have to pay off that debt; that it does not \ncount that the money coming out of Social Security is going to be at \nthe expense of our parents and grandparents--and some of us will be \nknocking on those doors in just a few years? If deficits do not count, \nthen, frankly, we are counting out millions of Americans who count on \nus to be financially responsible, fiscally responsible.\n  This bill is fiscally irresponsible. It was irresponsible 2 years \nago. It devastated the economy. It added to our deficit. It has created \nmore problems economically than this country has seen in many years.\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada this: Do we have a Democratic \nalternative we are going to offer on the floor of the Senate that is \nsmaller in scope but more focused on the issues we are hearing about, \nfor example, that addresses the costs of health insurance for \nbusinesses? Has the Senator met any business leader in America today \nwho has not told him that the cost of health insurance is breaking the \nbank?\n  I say to the Senator from Nevada, if we are going to have a tax cut \nto invigorate the economy, tell us what the Democratic alternative \nwould do and the scope of it and whether or not it reaches the level \nsuggested by the Republicans.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Illinois has raised a question, and I am \nsure the people watching this have the same question, which is: Okay, \nyou do not like the Republican plan. What is your idea?\n\n  Well, we do have an idea. It costs much less money and has a direct \nimpact. We would want a new wage credit, which would provide $300 for \neach adult in a family; $300 for the first two\n\n[[Page S6173]]\n\nchildren. We want to accelerate the child tax credit to $800 from the \ncurrent $600. It eliminates the marriage tax penalty. It provides \nmarriage penalty relief for recipients of the earned-income tax credit, \nwhich by the way, Ronald Reagan said was the most important tax policy \nthis country has ever had, the earned-income tax rate. What is that? It \ncreates a desire for people to work rather than try to go on, say, \nwelfare, because they can actually make money by working with their \nhands.\n  Ronald Reagan loved this program, the earned-income tax credit, and \nwe want to make it even more important.\n  We want to have a 50-percent tax credit to help small businesses pay \nfor health insurance premiums. These estimates are not exact, but there \nare from 21 million to 25 million Americans with no health insurance. \nThere are millions more who are underinsured. Now, this is not going to \nanswer all the problems, but it sure is a step in the right direction. \nIt will help small businesses pay for health insurance premiums.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Just so it is clear, I ask the Senator if the Democratic \nplan provides a tax credit for small businesses to pay for health \ninsurance? The Republican plan provides no benefit for the health \ninsurance cost to small business. That is as clear as can be. Has the \nSenator from Nevada found in that Republican approach any help for \nsmall businesses to pay for health insurance?\n  Mr. REID. As I mentioned, the answer to all of the problems--\nenvironmental problems, better schools, homeland security--is cut taxes \nfor the elite of this country. That will handle everything. I am sure \nthat is their reasoning for this no-tax policy on health insurance.\n  In answer to the Senator's question, we would allow small business \nexpensing that I think is very important. That is in the Republican \nplan. I think it is important we have that in ours. We want a bonus \ndeduction for businesses on depreciation rules. We want a 20-percent \ntax credit for businesses that invest in the broadband high-speed \nInternet infrastructure. We want $40 billion direct relief to States \nand local governments. It is so important we do that.\n  As I mentioned to the Senator earlier in responding to one of the \nquestions, the State of Nevada is devastated because of unfunded \nmandates. Leave No Child Behind, as I said, according to the State \nlegislature, is leaving lots of kids behind because they have no money \nto implement all the testing requirements and things that our school \ndistricts are being forced to do. They do not have the money to do it.\n  Homeland security, we have all kinds of burdens upon us as a result \nof 9/11, and I think we should be helping with that.\n  With our tax plan, which we are going to have a chance to vote on and \nwhich I think is going to be offered by the Senator from Louisiana, we \nare going to have an opportunity to do something about unemployment \nbenefits. Our plan calls for unemployment benefits. I think that is \nextremely important.\n  Our plan is so much better. It creates over a million jobs right \naway. It is a program that has something the working men and women in \nthis country will benefit from. We had a meeting with one of the most \nsuccessful businesspeople in the country, Warren Buffett, a man who is \na study in how entrepreneurship should work. We have heard a lot about \nentrepreneurs in speeches on the other side.\n\n  He is what the free market system is all about. When asked a direct \nquestion about what he thinks of the Bush tax cut plan, after he wiped \nthe smile off his face, he said: You know, if this tax cut plan passes, \nnext year I will receive--and this figure might not be exact but real \nclose--an extra $390 million for me, Warren Buffett.\n  He said: I do not need that. I do not want that. It is not going to \ncreate jobs. What we should do, if there is $390 million to go around, \nis give 390,000 people a thousand dollars.\n  He said: They will spend that. That will help the economy.\n  That is the difference between our plan and their plan. The Warren \nBuffett understanding of what our economy is all about is about people \nspending money.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Nevada, does this not reflect the \nbasic difference in outlook and vision from the Republican side of the \naisle to the Democratic side of the aisle, that Warren Buffett--who \nhappens to be the second wealthiest man in America and happens to be a \nDemocrat, by his own professed political faith--understands that \nhelping elite investors in America is not the key to a strong economy, \nyet that is what the Republicans return to time and time again?\n  We believe, as Warren Buffett believes, if we want to strengthen \nAmerica's economy, have faith in America's working families, give them \nthe helping hand they need to cope with the reality of life, the \ndemands of life, and provide a helping hand to the unemployed who, \nthrough no fault of their own, are out of work. There are three times \nas many long-term unemployed in America today--that is, those out of \nwork for over 6 months--than when President George W. Bush took office. \nHis economic plan has failed, and what we are hearing again is this \nvision that the way to help the unemployed, the way to help the working \nfamilies is to give to Warren Buffett a $390 million tax break. It is a \nwide chasm of thought between the two sides of the aisle.\n  I would argue, for those who want to make up their mind, take a look \nat what happened to the President's last tax cut. It did not work. It \nprovided some assistance for the wealthy, but it did not create jobs. \nIt did not revive the economy. And this time the President says we need \nto rerun that play, we need to try it again and again at the expense of \nSocial Security and Medicare.\n\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada, as we listen to people such as Warren \nBuffett talk about this issue, how would the Senator respond to our \nRepublican critics who say: There you go again, class warfare; that is \nall you Democrats want to do, set the wealthy off against the people \nwho are not so wealthy?\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada, in this coalition of the willing that \nwe would put together in this class warfare, wouldn't we include an \nawful lot of people today who are struggling to make ends meet, a lot \nof seniors who face cuts in Social Security for their own benefits, a \nlot of people who do not have health insurance because their businesses \ncannot afford it? I suggest the coalition on our side of class warfare \nis a pretty broad one across America. I ask the Senator to respond.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, in parroting something the Senator said \nearlier today, those people on the other side of the aisle who are \npushing this tax plan are not evil people; they are not bad people. \nThey are good people. They just live in a different political world. \nThey live in a world where they are willing to change their political \nphilosophy according to who is in the White House. People who used to \nsay that deficits matter now say they do not matter. People who said we \nhad to balance the budget no longer say we have to balance the budget. \nThey simply are not willing to approach the world the way I think the \nworld needs to be approached.\n  I think I am right. I believe I am right. Everyone is entitled to \ntheir opinion. I have a little substantiation. I have 10 Nobel \nlaureates who believe I am right, that this tax cut is not good; it \nwill not help the economy. However, no one has to accept these Nobel \nlaureates. Ask the Congressional Budget Office. They, the Republicans, \npicked who runs that, we did not, and the Congressional Budget Office \nsays it will not help anything.\n  I say to my friend from Illinois, this vote we will take in a few \nminutes is an example of the difference in philosophy between what is \ngoing on with the majority and we, the Democrats. What we are saying is \nthe dividend tax cuts for the elite of this world should not go \nforward. That money should be saved for Social Security. That money \nthat will go to elite people is coming out of the Social Security trust \nfund.\n  If there was ever an example of how we should vote for constituents, \nit is now. Do you vote for people who want to maintain the strong \nSocial Security Program or do you vote for the people who are going to \ngive big tax cuts to Warren Buffett? There is a simple answer to the \nquestion.\n\n[[Page S6174]]\n\n  Remember the vote today at 2 p.m.: Dividend tax cuts or saving Social \nSecurity. It is as simple as that. We recognize that anyone can puff it \nany way they want; anyone can slam it any way they want. That is what \nthe vote is about. The first vote we will take on this tax cut bill is \nwhether you are going to vote for Social Security or the wealthy of \nthis country. It is as simple as that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I understand we will vote in 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, this has been an interesting dialog and \ncertainly does show a different point of view on that side of the aisle \nas opposed to this side of the aisle.\n  The Senator from Nevada summed it up pretty well when he said it is \nall about spending. That is exactly what it is. The question is whether \nyou are trying to do something to stimulate the creation of jobs or \nwhether you want to throw money out and spend it, such as $40 billion.\n  What we are talking about is doing something about the economy. It \nseems as we go through this, we do not ever recognize the situation we \nare in. One of the reasons we have a problem is that sources of revenue \nhave been reduced substantially because the economy has weakened. They \ndo not talk about that. That is why we are doing some of the things \nthat are different than we may have done before. Revenues registered in \n2000 were over $2 trillion, and they fell to the low $2 trillions; and \nin 2002 we are $1.8 trillion because the economy is not working. What \nwe are trying to do is to stimulate that economy, of course.\n  There is talk about doing everything for Warren Buffett. That talk is \nnot true, and it has nothing to do with what we are seeking to do. Do \nyou think acceleration of the 10 percent regular income tax rate is \ngood for Warren Buffett? I don't think so.\n  What we are talking about is raising the amount of money that is tax \nfree for people in the bottom line. We are talking about the \nacceleration of the regular income tax cuts that were put into place to \nmake it happen more quickly.\n  What we are trying to do is stimulate the economy. Do you think \nacceleration of the marriage penalty tax is for Warren Buffett? I don't \nbelieve so. It is for everyone. On the question of fairness in taxation \nfor people who are single or married, Warren Buffett has nothing to do \nwith it.\n  Acceleration of child tax credit that is Warren Buffett? I don't \nbelieve so.\n  How about small business expensing? This is one of the most important \nthings we can possibly do with regard to the economy. It has nothing to \ndo with Warren Buffett.\n  What we really have is a real declaration of difference in what we \nare seeking to do. We are seeking to recognize the situation we are in, \nrecognize that part of the reason for reduced income is the economy, \nand that instead of spending, we are seeking to create jobs.\n  It is time for a vote.\n  On this bill, Mr. President, this language is not germane to the \nlegislation now before the Senate. Therefore, I raise a point of order \nunder section 305(b)2) of the Congressional Budget Act, 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is in order at this time.\n  Mr. REID. Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act, I \nmove to waive the section of the Budget Act for the pending amendment, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) and the Senator \nfrom Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``Aye''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 44, nays 53, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 147 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--44\n\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--53\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Edwards\n     Kerry\n     Sarbanes \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 44, the nays are \n53. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained, and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the pending amendment?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I yield whatever time the Senator from \nLouisiana would desire to have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Madam President, I ask the Chair to notify me if I go for \n10 minutes. I do not want to go more than that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator yielding time from the bill?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Chair and I thank my distinguished ranking \nmember, the Senator from Montana, for yielding me this time.\n  My colleagues, let me just say that the bill the Finance Committee \nhas brought to the floor is a tax cut piece of legislation which also \nraises significant amounts of taxes on American citizens. Tax cuts are \na wonderful thing to do, for those of us who are elected officials. It \nis great to say we have cut taxes by x billions of dollars, to send out \na press release to our constituents back home saying we cut taxes by x \nbillions of dollars.\n  It is also important to read the fine print. The fine print in this \nlegislation tells the rest of the story. And the rest of the story is \nthat, among other provisions in the bill, there is a provision that \nincreases taxes by $35 billion on American citizens.\n  Tax cuts have to be done in one of two ways. You can cut taxes by \nincreasing the size of the deficit and passing it on to the next \ngeneration. This bill does that. We have the largest deficit \nprojections we have ever had in the history of our country. And now we \nare saying, on top of that, we want to make it larger. We are going to \nhave a tax cut in order to make the deficit larger in the hopes that it \nmay generate some jobs. That is one way to pay for the tax cut.\n  The other way is to raise taxes in other areas. This bill does that, \ntoo. Lo and behold, during the markup of the Senate Finance Committee, \nthere was a provision that had not had 1 day of hearings, had not had 1 \nhour of hearings--in fact, it had not had 1 minute of hearings because \nit was never brought up in the committee--to discuss a $35 billion tax \nincrease on American workers who work overseas, sometimes in very \ndifficult parts of the world. That tax break they got was\n\n[[Page S6175]]\n\nbeing eliminated--totally eliminated--without one word of discussion, \none day of hearings about whether this was the right thing to do, or \nabout whether it should be to this extent, whether it should be less \nthan this, or anything.\n  In addition to increasing the size of the deficit, we have in just \nthis one provision a $35 billion tax increase on American workers. Why \ndo American workers get a credit for working overseas? Because, No. 1, \nthey are not in this country. They don't enjoy the benefits and the \nsecurity of living in this country, and, therefore, the argument \ncorrectly says that in order to encourage American workers to have jobs \noverseas instead of hiring foreign citizens, the Tax Code says that we \nare going to give American workers an $80,000 tax exemption on wages \nthat they earn overseas. In many cases, they work in very dangerous \nplaces. In most cases, they don't get the privileges and the security \nof living in the United States.\n  The paper just today talks about seven such Americans who lost their \nlives in Saudi Arabia because of a terrorist activity. That is just in \none country.\n  At the appropriate time I will be offering an amendment to strike the \ntax increase of $35 billion in the legislation which is currently \nbefore this body. We have had expressions of support for my amendment \nto take out the elimination of this tax credit for American citizens \nfrom the Chamber of Commerce, from the National Association of \nManufacturers, from the National Foreign Trade Council, from the \nFinancial Executives International, from the U.S. Council for \nInternational Business, from the Association of General Contractors of \nAmerica, from the American Council of Engineering Companies. To show \nthat the support is there from companies other than business-oriented \ncompanies, we have nonprofit organizations such as the Catholic Relief \nServices, with which the Chair is familiar, and the International \nRescue Commission that have expressed support for retaining section 911 \nwhich the current bill eliminates.\n  The point is, we are going to have to find a way to reinstate. We \nwill have to find a way to cover $35 billion because tax cuts are not \nfor free. We have to pay for them. That is the problem this bill \npresents.\n  My amendment would reduce the amount of the dividend tax exclusion \nabove $500 to 5 percent instead of the 10 percent that is currently in \nthe bill. I think that is a fair tradeoff. It makes no sense to say: We \nare going to give, for example, a dividend tax exemption for the people \nin my State of which only 8 percent would be affected by it in order to \nhave a tax increase on over 400,000 other American citizens who work in \nfar off places around the world.\n  It makes no sense to say: All right, we will help a small number, and \nwe will adversely affect a very large number. The type of people we are \nadversely affecting are wage earners who work month to month, many of \nthem earning $50,000, $60,000, $75,000 a year to help pay for tax \nbenefits for those who are relying on dividends as a part of their \nincome, many of which go to the very highest income earners.\n  In Louisiana, 92 percent of the citizens are not affected by the so-\ncalled double taxation on dividends. We ought to get rid of it, but we \nought to find a way to pay for it. Only 8 percent of my citizens are \naffected by the tax on dividends. Quite frankly, most people who earn \ndividends put them in retirement accounts or put them in investment \nportfolios that are already tax exempt.\n  Ninety-two percent of my people in Louisiana are not affected by it \nat all. Yet in order to pay for something that only adversely affects 8 \npercent of the citizens in Louisiana, we are going to eliminate a \nforeign tax credit that will be adverse to literally hundreds of \nthousands of people, over 400,000 people.\n\n  The type of people we are affecting are really Americans who are \nworking overseas for relatively modest salaries in far off places doing \nimportant work that ultimately creates jobs in this country. We have \nhad many statements from organizations that have workers working \noverseas who say, look, if this exemption is gone, we will have to \nterminate those American workers and give the jobs to foreigners \nworking in their own country. We will be having foreign citizens hired \nby American companies doing work that is now currently done by American \ncitizens. That is not good tax policy.\n  We could have argued in the Finance Committee, if we wanted, move in \nthat direction. We should have had hearings on it. We never had one \nwitness come in and say, look, this section 911 of the Tax Code is bad \npolicy; we need to change it.\n  It came up overnight because someone said, here is a nice pay-for. \nLet's raise $35 billion. Let's increase taxes by $35 billion in order \nto pay for the dividend tax cut which, in most cases, affects only a \nvery few American workers and American citizens.\n  As I have said, the groups that support retaining 911 are contracting \ngroups, oil and gas company groups, but also some of them are \norganizations and groups that I read, for instance, the Catholic Relief \nServices, the International Rescue Commission, workers who we have to \ndepend on for doing humanitarian work on behalf of the United States \naround the world. If this provision is taken out of the current Tax \nCode, you will have foreign citizens replacing American workers to do \nwork for American relief agencies around the world. What kind of a \nmessage does that send to the world when all of the workers for the \nCatholic Relief Services of the United States are foreign workers? We \nneed these American workers in these areas.\n  My amendment will preserve section 911 and we will offer it at an \nappropriate time. It should receive a majority of the support of our \ncolleagues, both Republicans and Democrats. There is a very simple way \nto pay for it--by simply not increasing the dividend tax deduction as \nmuch as the current bill does. We can accomplish this in a fair manner. \nIf someone wants to talk about this later on, about a pay-for, someone \nwants to eliminate this rate for American workers, if someone wants to \nmake an argument that it is appropriate to have a $35 billion tax \nincrease on American workers, let them make the case in the appropriate \nforum which is the Senate Finance Committee. Don't let it be slipped \ninto the bill overnight as a pay-for for something that is questionable \nas far as short-term tax policies.\n  At the appropriate time, I will offer an amendment to preserve this \nprovision which is very important to American workers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, an amendment will be offered tomorrow \nwhich Senator Breaux has already spoken in favor of. I wanted to speak \nin support of the language that is in the bill. I am speaking against \nthe amendment which will be offered by Senator Breaux tomorrow.\n  The policy issue presented by repeal of section 911 is whether \ntaxpayer dollars should be used to underwrite an employer's cost of \nsending employees overseas. Section 911 excludes from tax the first \n$80,000 of foreign wages and additional foreign housing costs that are \npaid for by the employer. Under normal tax rules, these amounts would \nbe taxable. According to the latest IRS data, 358,000 taxpayers claim \nthis exclusion, yet repeal of the exemption raises $35 billion.\n  The reason repeal raises so much is because many U.S. citizens living \noverseas don't pay tax to either the United States or even to the \nforeign country. The section 911 is skewed heavily towards upper-income \ntaxpayers. The more a person owns, the more they can exclude free \nforeign housing.\n  Section 911 then is a subsidy to an employer for the costs of sending \nemployees overseas. Section 911 only applies to private sector \nemployees who move overseas of their own free will. It is not available \nto government or military employees stationed overseas who are \nobviously there through somebody's command and not by their own choice.\n  Most employers offer their overseas employees ``tax equalization'' \npackages which guarantee the employee will not pay more taxes working \noverseas than they would pay if they were working within the United \nStates.\n  Section 911 reduces the amount of tax an employer has to reimburse \nunder those agreements, making it then a help to the employer as much \nas to the employee.\n  Why does this make any sense? Obviously, I feel it makes sense or it\n\n[[Page S6176]]\n\nwouldn't be in this bill that I present to the Senate. If an employer \nsends an employee from Florida, which has no income taxes, to \nMassachusetts, which has very high income taxes, we do not provide such \na subsidy.\n  Why do we subsidize moving employees overseas? I think sending \nemployees overseas should be a business decision, not a tax decision. \nRepeal will not cause U.S. citizens to be double taxed. A U.S. citizen \nwho earns income that is taxed by a foreign country is allowed to \nreduce their U.S. taxes for any foreign income taxes paid. A foreign \ntax credit is not allowed, however, for foreign property and gas taxes \nand levies for social programs sponsored by the governments of foreign \ncountries.\n  We do not subsidize those taxes or those policies. Many claim U.S. \nexports are enhanced by sending U.S. personnel overseas. However, there \nis no basis for such a claim. Whether a U.S. company uses U.S. products \nin its foreign operations is a business decision of the U.S. employer. \nIt is not determined by the nationality of the foreign manager.\n  It has come to our attention that certain nonprofits, charities, and \nreligious organizations use section 911 to further their overseas \nactivities. We plan to work with these organizations to exempt these \nactivities.\n  Section 911 is a tax loophole that forces you and me, as well as \nevery other taxpayer out there throughout the United States, to \nsubsidize high-paid corporate employees and their companies. It is \nunfair, and the Congress needs to fix it, and the legislation before us \nfixes it.\n  The Breaux amendment, if agreed to, would take that fix out of this \nlegislation. Everyone voting for the Breaux amendment will be voting \nfor these tax benefits the rest of us are paying for.\n  So obviously, tomorrow, I urge the defeat of the Breaux amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I yield the Senator from Pennsylvania such time as \nhe may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 569\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, it is my understanding the Senator from \nPennsylvania wishes to offer an amendment. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe pending amendments be set aside so the Senator from Pennsylvania \nmay offer his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter], for himself, \n     Mr. Grassley, and Mr. Bennett, proposes an amendment numbered \n     569.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To urge the Senate Finance Committee and the Joint Economic \n  Committee to hold hearings and consider legislation providing for a \n                               flat tax)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title V as the following:\n\n     SEC.  . FLAT TAX.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The current Internal Revenue Code, with it myriad \n     deductions, credits and schedules, and over 17,000 pages of \n     rules and regulations, is long overdue for an overhaul.\n       (2) The current Internal Revenue Code has over \n     6,900,000,000 words compared to the Bible at 1,773,000 words, \n     the Declaration of Independence at 1,300 words, the \n     Gettysburg Address at 267 words, and the Pledge of Allegiance \n     at only 31 words.\n       (3) It is an unacceptable waste of our nation's precious \n     resources when Americans spend more than 5,800,000,000 hours \n     every year compiling information and filling out Internal \n     Revenue Code tax forms. In addition, taxpayers spend \n     $194,000,000,000 each year in tax code compliance. America's \n     resources could be dedicated to far more productive pursuits.\n       (4) The primary goal of any tax reform is to promote growth \n     and remove the inefficiencies of the current tax code. The \n     flat tax will expand the economy by an estimated $2 trillion \n     over seven years.\n       (5) Another important goal of the flat tax is to achieve \n     fairness, with a single low flat tax rate for all individuals \n     and businesses.\n       (6) Simplicity is another critically important goal of the \n     flat tax, and it is in the public interest to have a ten-\n     lined tax form that fits on a postcard and takes 10 minutes \n     to fill out.\n       (7) A comprehensive analysis of our tax structure has \n     concluded that a flat tax of 19% could be imposed upon \n     individuals and be revenue neutral.\n       (8) If the decision is made to include deductibility on \n     items such as interest on home mortgages and charitable \n     contributions, the flat tax would be raised from a 19% to a \n     20% rate to accommodate the deductions and remain revenue \n     neutral.\n       (9) The flat tax would tax business at a 20% rate on net \n     profits and be revenue neutral and lead to investment \n     decisions being made on the basis of productivity rather than \n     for tax avoidance.\n       (10) The flat tax would lead to the elimination of the \n     capital gains tax. This would become a powerful incentive for \n     savings and investment--which translates into economic growth \n     and expansion, more and better jobs, and raising the standard \n     of living for all Americans.\n       (11) The flat tax would lower the cost of capital by \n     allowing businesses to write off the cost of capital purchase \n     in the same year the purchase was made as opposed to \n     complying with complicated depreciation schedules.\n       (12) By eliminating the double tax on dividends, the flat \n     tax eliminates the distortions in the tax code favoring debt \n     over equity financing by businesses.\n       (13) The flat tax would eliminate the estate and gift tax. \n     With the elimination of the estate and gift tax, family-held \n     businesses will be much more stable under the flat tax \n     system.\n       (14) As tax loopholes are eliminated and the tax code is \n     simplified, there will be far less opportunity for tax \n     avoidance and fraud, which now amounts to over $120 billion \n     in uncollected revenue annually.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Senate Finance Committee and the Joint Economic \n     Committee should undertake a comprehensive analysis of \n     simplification including flat tax proposals, including \n     appropriate hearings and consider legislation providing for a \n     flat tax.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am offering this amendment on behalf of Senator \nGrassley, Senator Bennett, Senator Thomas, Senator Sununu, and myself. \nThis amendment calls for consideration by the Senate Finance Committee \nand the Joint Economic Committee of tax simplification including a flat \ntax.\n  The essence is set forth in the brief resolution clause:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the Senate Finance \n     Committee and the Joint Economic Committee should undertake a \n     comprehensive analysis of simplification including flat tax \n     proposals, including appropriate hearings and consider \n     legislation providing for a flat tax.\n\n  Madam President, this is a subject that I have addressed virtually \nevery year since introducing a flat tax proposal in the spring of 1995. \nThe flat tax proposal was introduced in the House of Representatives by \nCongressman Armey in the fall of 1994. After extensive consideration \nand analyses of these proposals by two distinguished professors from \nStanford, Professors Hall and Rabushka, it seemed to me that it was \nlong overdue that a serious effort be made to simplify the U.S. Tax \nCode.\n  At the present time, we have a Tax Code which has grown to 6.9 \nmillion words. That is the count in the year 2000. When the Tax Code \nwas counted in the year 1955, there were 744,000 words. There are 325 \nforms to be filled out, and the American taxpayers spend more than 5.8 \nbillion hours each year preparing them. And it is estimated by the Tax \nFoundation that $194 billion is spent each year in complying with the \ntax laws. I have seen other estimates that place the issue of \ncompliance as high as some $800 billion.\n  But there is no doubt that the Federal Tax Code and the forms are \nburdensome, onerous, and unduly complicated. The vast majority of \nAmericans require professional help to fill out a tax return. Some \npeople say even a Philadelphia lawyer cannot figure it out. I am \ninclined to agree with that.\n  Senator Grassley, may the record show, concurred with my last \nstatement. He has never been a devotee of a Philadelphia lawyer. The \nCongressional Record is replete with comments to that effect with \nreference to one of his colleagues who was elected in the same year, \n1980.\n  Back to the subject at hand, Albert Einstein said: The hardest thing \nin the world is to understand the income tax. That is quite a statement \nfor Albert Einstein to make. I think it shows what the complications \nare.\n  We are considering now a tax proposal that will probably end up in \nthis body as $350 billion because the distinguished Senator from Iowa, \nMr. Grassley, has said that is his word on what\n\n[[Page S6177]]\n\nis going to come back out of the conference. The House of \nRepresentatives is talking about $550 billion. The President's original \nproposal was $726 billion. I support the full proposal offered by the \nPresident.\n  When we consider that we have a $10 trillion economy, and we are \ntalking about $726 billion or $550 billion or $350 billion over a 10-\nyear period, and looking at a gross economy of $10 trillion a year now, \nand over 10 years it will amount to $140 trillion, it is questionable \nas to what the impact would be of any tax cut. But I think the \nPresident's proposal is worth a try. I am prepared to vote for that \nfigure--the highest figure we can have for this body on a conference \nreport.\n  What should be done is to take, finally, some bold, innovative action \nand at least consider tax simplification and a flat tax. It has never \nbeen considered or analyzed, and there are some very thorough \ncomprehensive distinguished studies.\n  The leading study, by Professors Hall and Rabushka, analyzed the \nrevenue picture and concluded that, at 19 percent, the flat tax would \nbe revenue neutral. That would be eliminating all deductions.\n\n  In the flat tax legislation that I have introduced, I have retained \ntwo deductions. I introduced the flat tax again this year in advance of \nApril 15, on April 11. We were not in session on April 15. During the \n104th, 105th, and 106th Congresses I introduced the flat tax \nlegislative proposal to coincide with income tax day. The proposal I \nhave introduced retains the deduction for home interest and charitable \ncontributions. So I have taken the two items that are the most popular \nand that cost money. That requires the flat tax to be raised from 19 \npercent to 20 percent.\n  It may be that the Finance Committee or the Joint Economic Committee, \nin their wisdom, would want to have other deductions, or perhaps no \ndeductions, leaving it at the flattest rate of 19 percent.\n  This, Madam President, is a tax return form under the flat tax. It is \ngenuinely the size of a postcard and could be filled out in some 15 \nminutes. Similarly, for the corporate tax, the calculation has been \nmade that it would be revenue neutral at 20 percent. Today, there is an \nenormous amount of time with the lawyers, the accountants, the tax \nspecialists, figuring out loopholes, figuring out tax avoidance, where \nit is legal, contrasted with tax evasion, where it is illegal.\n  If, once and for all, we directed our attention to what is \neconomically productive--that is, what makes sense from an economic \npoint of view, without regard to the tax consequences--there would be a \nburst of energy and productivity, and it would do wonders for our \neconomy. That is the way to stimulate the American economy, instead of \ntinkering at the edges, which is what many of the tax modifications \nhave been.\n  The flat tax would expense all so-called capital investments by \ndeducting them immediately in the first year. If that were to be done, \nthere would be a tremendous stimulus for entrepreneurs to invest in new \ncapital instead of having to depreciate it over a long period of years \non complicated depreciation schedules.\n  The flat tax eliminates the estate tax, capital gains tax, and the \ndouble taxation of dividends. For families of modest means and their \nconflicting schedules, they would pay less under a flat tax. The \nvarious schedules that have been proposed are complicated and sometimes \nconflicting. That is why I would like to see the hearings on a \ncomprehensive analysis, to really find out what it would mean at all \nlevels.\n  Today, when the loopholes are applied, the sky is the limit. The \nwealthiest people, who earn the most money, can avoid paying taxes \naltogether, and that would be eliminated. There is a tremendous amount \nof money lost through fraud. That, too, would be reduced substantially, \nif not virtually eliminated with a flat tax proposal. So, in essence, \nmy point is when we have had so much controversy and argument in the \nCongress of the United States about the $726 billion over 10 years, and \n$550 billion over 10 years, and $350 billion over 10 years, the way to \nreally give the economy a shot in the arm is to eliminate all of this \nnonproductive time filling out tax returns and the numerous forms \nattendant thereto and allow American ingenuity to focus on what makes \neconomic sense, productivity sense, and not what you can do by \ncontortions and gyrations to reduce your tax bill.\n  It would be a godsend if on April 15 we sat down and filled out a \npostcard. We will all go through it. The flat tax is something which is \ncertainly worthy of consideration and study.\n  My best judgment is that the flat tax would be very worthwhile, but I \nwould want to reserve my best judgment today on a study that I have \nmade. I would like to see the Finance Committee and the Joint Economic \nCommittee undertake the kinds of hearings and analyses which would give \nappropriate consideration.\n  Today the Internal Revenue Code constitutes cruel and unusual \npunishment. A flat tax would be an enormous step forward.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, besides being willing to accept the \namendment offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania, I add that there \nare some portions of this bill which further make the Tax Code more \ncomplex. We often do that as we are trying to, on the one hand, balance \nthe budget or fit within certain budget restrictions and, on the other \nhand, help a certain tax policy which, in effect, adds a lot more \ncomplexity to the code. Regrettably, the code is going to be much more \ncomplex after this legislation is passed, and it will be passed, than \nis the code today.\n  We did, however, include one measure of tax simplification at my \nbehest. It is small, but it is important, I think. There are many \ndefinitions in the code. There is a definition of a child for the \npurpose of the child tax credit or the earned-income tax credit or as \nan exemption as a dependent or for purposes of a head-of-household \nexemption. It depends on how many children the household has in terms \nof what additional credits or exemptions that head of household has. \nThere are five definitions in the code, each different for each of the \nconditions I mentioned. We simplified that situation.\n  We said, whether it is earned-income tax credit, the child credit, a \ndependent for the purpose of exemption or head-of-household exemption, \nthe definition of child is the same. That will make the code a bit \neasier for taxpayers and practitioners.\n  I appreciate the amendment offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania. \nIt is helpful always to look for ways to simplify the code. I am not \nterribly encouraged we are going to get the code simplified very much \nin the next several years. It would be great if we could. We should \nmake those efforts. If history is any guide, regrettably the President \nand the Congress together are making the code more complex every year.\n  Some day the straw will break the camel's back. The code, in my \njudgment, is going to collapse. It is going to get so complex and \nfinally people are going to get fed up and make significant changes. We \nare not there. I do not think that will occur for several years.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania is a step in \nthe direction toward forcing us in the Congress to grapple with the \nundue complexity of the code, whether the flat tax, consumption tax, \nvalue-added tax--who knows what is the right approach; that is to be \ndecided another day--or just stay with our current code and make a lot \nof simplifications. For example, phasing out so-called Peps and Peases. \nThat is the section of the code that says we will give you a tax break \non the one hand but take them away on the other. We will give a tax \nbreak, but it phases out in a few years. There are lots of provisions \nin the code like that. One major simplification would be to get rid of \nthose provisions.\n  I compliment the Senator for advancing the ball and thinking more \nabout simplification. I thank him for offering the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I note for the record, in a brief \ncolloquy with the Senator from Montana, his thrust at simplification I \nthink is a hallmark of what we are looking for. That is one of the \nprincipal objectives,\n\n[[Page S6178]]\n\nperhaps the principal objective, although it goes alongside trying to \nincrease productivity and growth.\n  When I talked to the Senator from Montana briefly in showing him the \namendment, I added a modification which would call for simplification \nincluding the flat tax, but in the resolve clause, to call for that \nsimplification.\n  I appreciate the comment by the Senator from Montana. I hope he will \njoin me in this amendment. It advances the ball not anywhere near the \ngoal line, but I think everyone will agree there has never been a \nserious study of this proposal, and I hope there will be some impetus \ngiven by this amendment. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I am a cosponsor of the amendment by \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania. I very much support this amendment. I do \nnot think we have a hard time convincing the people of this country \nabout the complicated aspects of the Tax Code and the need for \nsomething more simple to replace it. There seems to be an overwhelming \nconsensus on the part of the American people about that point.\n  What we need a national dialog about--and I think this amendment \nencourages that dialog--as well as a study is what is going to take its \nplace. Seventy percent of the people think the present Tax Code ought \nto be thrown out, partly because of how complicated it is and because \nit may be viewed as unfair. There does not seem to be that sort of \nconsensus as to what takes its place.\n  For instance, I have had opportunities to see surveys where \napproximately 20 percent of the people want a national sales tax and 30 \npercent of the people want a flat rate income tax. Maybe Congress ought \nto show leadership and follow up on that 20 percent or 30 percent, but \nI do not think that is going to happen until we get some consensus \namong the American people that is in the 40-percent range of what ought \nto take the place of the present income tax mess.\n  The amendment before us is very useful from the standpoint of \nencouraging congressional committees to do the proper work, but I \nbelieve in the final analysis, to get the consensus that it is going to \ntake to bring about a simplified tax system, replacing the present \ncomplicated system, is when it becomes part of the national debate \nbetween two candidates for President.\n  For instance, ideally, we have President Bush seeking reelection next \nyear, and he would make an issue out of how complicated the Tax Code is \nand offer an alternative. Ideally, a flat rate income tax along the \nlines of what Mr. Forbes did a few years ago when he was running for \nthe Republican nomination and made this type of reform a major plank of \nhis campaign. Ideally, we would have a Democratic candidate who says \nthe current progressive system, even though it is a mess, is what is \nbest for the country. Then we will have a winner out of this that shows \na clear division of keeping what we have, which I hope does not happen, \nor coming up with something new.\n  That mandate from an election will move the people and the people \nthen will move the Congress. Being chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, I should not have to wait for that to happen, but it seems \nthat we have so much work before us dealing with short-term issues that \nwe do not spend time on the long-term policies, which this amendment \nencourages.\n  I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for his amendment. I am going \nto obviously vote for it. I hope it is adopted overwhelmingly, but I \nhope it has an impact beyond what we in the Congress will be called \nupon to study. I hope it has an impact on the next Presidential \nelection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, we do not want this vote now. We want \nto have this vote later.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be temporarily set aside so I might offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 570\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 570.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To ensure that the limit on refundability shall not apply to \n    the additional $400 child credit for 2003, to make the dividend \n    exclusion effective for taxable years beginning in 2003, and to \neliminate the increase in the dividend exclusion from 10 percent to 20 \n                    percent of dividends over $500)\n\n       On page 19, lines 12 and 13, strike ``(20 percent in the \n     case of taxable years beginning after 2007)''.\n       On page 26, lines 18 and 19, strike ``(80 percent in the \n     case of taxable years beginning after 2007)''.\n       On page 26, lines 21 and 22, strike ``(80 percent in the \n     case of taxable years beginning after 2007)''.\n       On page 27, line 19, strike ``2003'' and insert ``2002''.\n       At the end of subtitle C of title V, insert:\n\n     SEC.   .

Madam President, this amendment is designed to take \neffect earlier rather than later and provide substantially more \nbenefits than the tax bill that is presently before us. It is designed \nto help stimulate the economy with more wallop, more punch, earlier \nrather than later.\n  How does it do that? Two ways. First, it would speed up the dividend \ntax relief. It would make it take effect earlier rather than later. \nSecond, it would simplify the mechanism that will be sending checks out \nto people who qualify for the child tax credit. So, there are two ways \nthat this amendment will help provide more income relief, more quickly, \nto more Americans, than what\n\n[[Page S6179]]\n\nis contained in the bill. It is an improvement upon the bill.\n  First, with respect to speeding up the dividend relief, the dividend \nproposal in this bill is not effective until the year 2004. Many \nprovisions of this bill take effect in 2003, but the dividend \nprovisions of the bill do not take effect in 2003; rather, a year \nlater, in 2004. I suspect it is to save revenue. There will be no \ndollars injected into the economy, as a consequence of the dividend \nproposal, in the year 2003. It will be later, in 2004, and even then it \nis going to take some time for Americans to change their tax returns to \ntake advantage of this change.\n  As I stated earlier, we are here today because the economy demands \nthat we act quickly to help our anemic economy. Let's see what we can \ndo to help create more jobs. To rebuild the economy. To rebuild \nAmerica.\n  In my State of Montana, we desperately need jobs. Many of our high \nschool and college graduates are leaving Montana. Why? Because they \ncannot find a job in the State. They go elsewhere. There is a better \nchance of finding a job in one of the larger cities. But, even that is \ndifficult. Lack of jobs is a national problem, it is not just a problem \nin Montana. I think over 2 million jobs have been lost in the last \ncouple of years because of an anemic economy. We want to get moving \nquickly. We want to get moving earlier than we otherwise would. We \nshould seek policies to help the economy grow as soon as possible.\n  I disagree with the current dividend proposal for several reasons. \nOne, it creates a three-tiered regime. It makes the Tax Code even more \ncomplex. It creates a three-tiered regime for investment income. \nInterest income would be fully taxed, as it is today. Capital gains \nwould be taxed at about half the rate of ordinary income, as it is \ntoday. But we now add a third complexity of taxation of investment \nincome, and that is dividend income which would fall to the new regime; \nthat is, the first $500 of dividend income would be excluded from one's \nincome tax, and then, beginning in later years, in 2004, the next 10 \npercent of dividend income would be excluded, and then in the year \n2008, 20 percent of dividend income would be excluded. A new layer, a \nnew complexity, certainly with respect to investment income.\n  My point is, if we are going to include a dividend proposal in this \nbill, why not make it take effect earlier? Our economy needs the boost \nright now, not when taxpayers file their returns in 2005. The dividend \nprovision takes effect in 2004 but, frankly, it does not really take \neffect until 2005 when people file their tax returns. The dividend \nproposal has no stimulative effect in the year 2003. Most people do not \neven get the benefit in 2004. Most individual taxpayers will have to \nwait until they file their tax returns in 2005 to reap the benefit of a \ndividend exclusion in the bill.\n\n  My amendment will advance the effective date of the dividend \nprovision in the bill to January 1, 2003--this year. This means \ntaxpayers will get relief for dividends they receive this year.\n  I have my doubts whether the dividend tax relief has much stimulative \neffect generally, but some will praise the economic virtues of dividend \ntax relief. I ask, if there are virtues, why wait? Make the proposal \neffective for 2003 at least to provide the possibility that the economy \nwill see some benefit.\n  The second provision in my amendment will get more dollars to \nfamilies by simplifying the distribution of the increased child credit \nthat we passed this year. The President has proposed accelerating the \nfull $1,000 child credit to 2003. It is currently $600. The President \nhas proposed accelerating that, the full $1,000 to take effect this \nyear, 2003. Instead of making taxpayers wait until next spring when \nthey file their tax returns to get the credit, the President has \nproposed sending the checks out this summer for the $400 increase in \nthe credit. That is the same provision which is included in the Finance \nCommittee bill. I support the acceleration of this credit for working \nfamilies. It is the right thing to do. I think sending this increase \nout to taxpayers right away also makes good economic sense. Why wait? \nThis gets money into the people's hands immediately so they can spend \nit. This will spur consumption and boost the economy, which is exactly \nwhat we should be doing in this bill.\n  My concern, however, deals with the millions of families who will not \nreceive the full $400 check due to refundability limits. I might remind \nour colleagues that a couple of years ago, when we sent out the so-\ncalled $300 check for individuals and the $600 check for married \ncouples, a lot of people did not get the $300; married couples did not \nget the $600. Why? Because of the tax brackets the taxpayer happened to \nfall into when they did the calculation to find out what portion of the \n$300 an individual might receive. If the taxpayer had a lower income, \nthe taxpayer might not receive the full $300. It was a mess. Some got \nthe full $300, some did not. It was a mess.\n\n  Under current law, the credit is partially funded. Families can take \npart of the credit if they pay payroll taxes but do not have income tax \nliability. Not the whole credit, but part of it. The amount that a low-\nincome family can get refunded is to increase in 2005. The President's \nproposal did not accelerate the refundability of the credit. \nFortunately, during consideration of the bill, the Finance Committee \nadopted an amendment offered by Senator Lincoln. Her amendment was to \naccelerate the refundability of the credit. This will allow many low-\nincome families to see some benefit from the increased tax credit. \nHowever, even with the inclusion of the refundability amendment, many \nlow-income families will not be eligible to receive the full $400. \nMillions of working families who have incomes between $10,000 and \n$20,000 will not get the full $400 check. They will receive a partial \ncheck. Again, people are not getting what they are promised.\n  We are increasing the child tax credit from $600 to $1,000 to take \neffect in 2003 and telling people they get an additional $400 in 2003 \nand many will not get it. We tell them that is the law, but they will \nnot get it because their incomes are in certain brackets. Those whose \nincomes are between $10,000 and $20,000 will get less than the full \n$400 and receive only partial checks, and they will not know how much \nunless the IRS tells them how much the following year.\n  That does not make sense. The families who are most likely to spend \nthe check, those who spend most of their income, will not get the full \namount.\n  My amendment guarantees each and every working family eligible for \nthe child credit would get the full $400 check. This fulfills two of \nthe goals of the stimulus package, getting more money out of the door \nimmediately and getting it to the people who will spend it, lower \nincome people. These two changes to the bill will inject an additional \n$15 billion into the economy in 2003 and 2004, more than provided for \nin this bill. That makes sense. The additional dollars in the next 2 \nyears will help create more jobs, help boost demand, and help rebuild \nthe economy.\n  To pay for the modifications, my amendment merely eliminates the \nincrease of the dividend exclusion from 10 percent to 20 percent in the \nyear 2008. To repeat, in the bill, the 10 percent exclusion is \nincreased to a 20-percent exclusion, and does not take effect until \n2008. I say that is too far off. Let's repeal the increase that is \nscheduled to take effect in 2008 and take that $15 billion and dedicate \nit to the working families. That will take effect in the early years, \n2003 and 2004. We could make the dividend proposal, therefore, \neffective now, not later.\n  The current provisions in the bill provide that the dividend \nexclusion does not take effect until 2004, not 2003. This amendment \nleaves in place the 10-percent exclusion that is still in place but \ntakes effect a year earlier; that is, 10 percent above the $500 goes \nin. We are simply saying that the exclusion in 2008 will still be 10 \npercent. That is so far off. Why schedule an increase that does not \ntake effect until 5 years from now?\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Briefly, it moves \nmoney upfront. It does not change the total amount of the bill but \nmoves it upfront a little more so there is more stimulative effect in \nthe short run. Thus, the bill does what it is purported to do, which is \nto create more jobs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield myself such time as I might consume.\n\n[[Page S6180]]\n\n  I find it necessary to explain what our legislation does because a \nlot of times there are explanations about it that are not very \naccurate. One of the impressions is our bill is not very well balanced. \nOur bill does, in fact, attempt to strike a good balance between \nconsumption on one hand and investment on the other hand. We do this to \nprovide incentives such that we can provide both short-term economic \nstimulus and the building blocks for meaningful future economic growth.\n  The refundable tax credit outlined in the amendment before the \nSenate, which I oppose, would be paid irrespective of whether a person \nhad any income tax liability at all. If the person owes no tax, we are \nto view this proposal as effectively refunding payroll taxes. But we \nalready have a provision that refunds payroll taxes. It is called the \nearned-income credit and the child tax credit. This proposal, the \nBaucus amendment, a refundable tax credit proposal, would be \nduplicative of the earned-income tax credit and the refundable child \ntax credit to refund payroll taxes for those with insufficient income \nto have tax liability with the result of encouraging people to work as \nopposed to receiving welfare or unemployment compensation.\n  In my estimation, such refundable credits do not provide incentives \nto work. They do not create jobs, and they do not stimulate the \neconomy.\n  Providing incentives to work, creating actual jobs, and stimulating \nthe economy are the purposes of the legislation from the Senate Finance \nCommittee that I presented.\n  Job creation is a handup, not a handout. It is a handup to help \npeople out of poverty. Refundable tax credits are handouts which may \nhave just the opposite effect. We should ensure that we are providing \nbuilding blocks for long-term growth and the economic stability that \ncomes from that growth.\n  I appreciate Senator Baucus's support for our dividend proposal and \nhis desire to accelerate into this year. However, acceleration means we \nsubject more dividends to double taxation because the exclusion never \nreaches 20 percent. In other words, ours goes from 10 percent through \nthe year 2007; 2008 to 2013, it is 20 percent, whereas his proposal \nalways stays at 10 percent.\n  People invest in stock for long-term gain. We need to provide long-\nterm tax relief. This bill contains a lot of short-term stimulus \nalready.\n  I appreciate the points he has raised regarding the child credit. The \nlargest item in this bill is the child credit, and that amounts to over \n$95 billion. It includes a simplification of definition that Senator \nBaucus has already mentioned. In addition, I note we expand the \nrefundable portion of the child credit that targets help to the low-\nincome families he seeks to assist with his amendment.\n  I appreciate his position. I believe our bill provides proper balance \nin encouraging the economy.\n  Finally, I note this amendment violates section 202, page 35 of the \nBudget Act, so I will be raising a point of order later on.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I yield myself an hour on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Would the Senator from Massachusetts yield? I do not \nintend to object, but we have always been promised copies of \namendments. I assume the Senator is going to offer an amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 544\n\n    (Purpose: To provide for additional weeks of temporary extended \n   unemployment compensation, to provide for a program of temporary \n  enhanced regular unemployment compensation, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I intend to do that right at this very moment. I have \nsent an amendment to the desk, and I ask for its immediate \nconsideration. It is amendment No. 544.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator, it requires \nunanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask Senator Kennedy, would he speak without our \nconsenting to the hour so we could look at the amendment for a while?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am prepared to accommodate the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee. We had a general concept of an hour. I will not personally \ntake an hour. We have 25 cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator may proceed to \ndebate.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair. I was asking them what time they \nneed, and I will let the chairman know in just a very few minutes who \nintends to come over here and exactly how much time we need.\n  I intend to speak about 20 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, this amendment is of enormous \nimportance to the matter we are debating in the Senate, which is \nbasically legislation that is targeted on strengthening and improving \nour economy.\n  We all know when the Senate of the United States has acted in the \npast to strengthen and improve our economy, on a number of very \nimportant occasions we have had a very positive impact. Later in the \ndiscussion and debate, we will have what is called a Democratic \nalternative, which will provide what I consider to be a very compelling \namendment that will result in stimulating the economy and really \nprovide additional jobs.\n  It will be fairly balanced in helping hard-working Americans. It will \nassist small businesses with accelerated depreciation and will also \nprovide assistance to the States so they can use funds to provide for \nthe No Child Left Behind legislation, and perhaps offset some of the \nanticipated cuts in Medicaid and also deal with some of the other State \npriorities.\n  One of the most important aspects of economic recovery that this \nunderlying proposal that has come out of the Finance Committee is \nmissing is a provision to deal with the millions of Americans who are \ncurrently unemployed as a result of economic policy. We have seen at \nother times in our country when we have taken action here in the \nSenate, going back to the early 1960s. We had economic stimulus \nprograms and we had the longest period of economic growth and price \nstability, in the early period of the 1960s, that we had had up to that \ntime in this century.\n  Then, in 1993, we also took action here on the floor Senate and we \nhave had the longest period of economic growth, again with price \nstability, and the creation of some 22 million additional jobs.\n  We on our side are strongly committed to taking steps that are going \nto revive our economy, stimulate the economy. We will have an \nopportunity to debate that later in the afternoon.\n  This amendment is targeted on those Americans who have lost their \njobs through no fault of their own but because our economy is in \nstagnation. At other times in American history, we have responded to \nthe needs of these families. These are hard-working American families \nwho have played by the rules, have paid into the unemployment \ncompensation fund, and now are entitled to benefit from it.\n  Without this amendment, starting at the end of May there are going to \nbe 80,000 workers a week who will lose their unemployment compensation. \nThis is an emergency, and it is a matter which I hope we will address \nand will have the strong support of Republicans and Democrats alike.\n  Effectively, this amendment extends the temporary unemployment \ncompensation program through November. The program is currently \nscheduled to prohibit any new enrollees after May 31, leaving 80,000 \nworkers a week to run out of their benefits. It provides 26 weeks to \nall eligible workers, with an additional 7 weeks available to the \nStates with the highest unemployment. That would be some six States as \nof today. It provides an additional 13 weeks to unemployed workers who \nhave exhausted their initial 13 weeks of extended benefits prior to the \nenactment, and it does provide help and assistance to low-wage workers.\n\n[[Page S6181]]\n\n  It provides temporary funding for States to implement alternative \nbase periods. What we mean is, in a number of instances workers should \nbe entitled to unemployment compensation. But if they seek part-time \nwork, they lose all eligibility for unemployment compensation in almost \nevery state. Yet they want to go back to work to provide for their \nfamilies, and all this does is permit the States to make these \nadjustments so they can go back to work, maybe part-time, and not lose \ntheir unemployment compensation. The amendment also provides some \ntechnical provisions to add just for the railroad workers to permit \ngreater parity.\n\n  Historically, unemployment insurance has been a bipartisan issue. In \nthe recessions of the late 1950s, President Eisenhower proposed a \ntemporary program of extended unemployment assistance. In the recession \nof the early 1970s, President Nixon signed into law two extensions of \nunemployment compensation. In the mid-1970s, President Ford proposed a \ntemporary Federal extension of benefits. In the early 1980s, President \nReagan signed into law four unemployment extensions. And in the early \n1990s, President Bush, after twice vetoing unemployment extensions, \nultimately saw the importance of this policy and signed into law three \nextensions. Each of these 1990 extensions, some for 26 weeks of \nbenefits, received overwhelming bipartisan support.\n  In November of 1991, we passed an extension by a vote of 91 to 2. In \nFebruary of 1992, we passed, by a vote of 94 to 2, a bill to provide 26 \nweeks of benefits to most States, 33 weeks in high unemployment States. \nMany of the Senators currently in this body voted for that extension, \nwhich today they are calling unprecedented. We have seen, over the \nyears, Republicans and Democrats alike have supported this legislation.\n  In July of 1992, the vote was 93 to 3; in November of 1993, 79 to 20; \nand in the last 2 years we have had a number of bipartisan votes. The \nTemporary Federal Unemployment Benefit Program passed, 85 to 9, in \nMarch of 2002. This is not a partisan issue. Layoffs do not \ndiscriminate by party. This is a matter of fairness.\n  I urge our colleagues to put aside partisanship and to support this \nparticular proposal.\n  There are those who raise these kinds of questions in opposition to \nthis program. They say people want handouts. They do not want handouts. \nThey want jobs. People want jobs, but there are not any jobs in the \neconomy. There is only one job available for every three unemployed \nworkers. The Democrats have a plan to create the jobs. But today we \nhave to help the millions of people without jobs because of the bad \neconomy. They need help paying the mortgage and putting food on the \ntable.\n  Some say the unemployment rate isn't high by historic standards, and \nonly a few States have reached the trigger for extended benefits. But \nwe know that we have now 2.5 million fewer jobs than we had some 2 \nyears ago. Look at this. We had 2.8 million additional unemployed over \nthe period of these last 2 years; 6 million unemployed in January of \n2001; and we have 8.8 million as of April this year.\n  We have seen over this period of time the fact that the total number \nof private sector jobs has decreased by 2.7 million--2.7 million jobs \nlost. We had 111.7 million in January 2001, and 109 million now.\n  We are seeing a significant increase in the total number of the \nunemployed, and we have also seen a reduction in the total number of \njobs that are out there. These are hard-working Americans. We are \ntrying to get the economy into an expansion. But at this particular \ntime they are hurting. That is why we need to have an extension of the \nunemployment compensation.\n  Let me mention who these people are and what the state of our economy \nis at the present time.\n  All Americans understand the economy has been deteriorating for more \nthan 2 years. President Bush claims the tax cut for the rich will \ncreate jobs. We tried that his way in 2001. We lost 2.5 million jobs. \nAlan Greenspan and Warren Buffett and the Nation's leading economists, \nincluding 10 Nobel laureates, all agree that the President's plan is \nthe wrong prescription for the sick economy. Average Americans are \nhurting. It is time for a change. We need an economic plan that helps \nour fellow citizens and which creates new jobs. Yet, there is not a \npenny in this bill to provide the unemployment compensation for the \nAmericans laid off prior to the time the new jobs are created. \nUnemployment benefits expire in just 2 weeks for many of these workers.\n  This amendment is cosponsored by 13 of my colleagues. I ask unanimous \nconsent that they be listed as cosponsors on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, this amendment provides for allocating \n$12.7 billion from the acceleration of the upper tax bracket reduction. \nThis effectively does not change the law. The President's 2003 bill \nasks for an acceleration of the reduction of the tax brackets for 2001 \nand 2002, and this defers that. In fact, it collects some $35 billion. \nWe use $12.7 billion of that to pay for this extension.\n  Our workers take pride in doing a good job and providing for their \nfamilies, putting their children through school, and saving for a \nsecure retirement. But for millions of Americans that dream is gone. \nYears of saving and sacrifice have disappeared with a single pink slip. \nInstead of looking to a bright future, now they must look in their \nchildren's eyes, and say, I am sorry; you can't go to college; you \ncan't buy new shoes. We can no longer afford to stay in this house. In \nfact, since losing their jobs, one in every four have moved to less \nexpensive housing or moved in with their friends or their families.\n\n  These are the figures about the impact on the family because of \nunemployment. We are talking about Americans who have worked, want to \nwork, and are being laid off because of economic conditions. They have \ncollected unemployment compensation for a period of time, which is \nabout a third of their pay. Now they are in danger of losing that at \nthe rate of 80,000 Americans per week at the end of this month.\n  It is interesting that we now have 18,000 American servicemen who \nhave returned from Iraq and are now on the unemployment line. Now they \nare receiving unemployment compensation because the jobs were not there \nwhen they came back. That number is growing every single week because \ntheir jobs have effectively been eliminated.\n  The unemployment impact on the family is that more than 3 in 4--77 \npercent--of the unemployed Americans say the level of stress in their \nfamily has increased. Two-thirds--65 percent--of those with children \nhave cut back in spending for all of their children; 26 percent say \nanother family member has to start a job or increase the work hours; \nand 23 percent have had to interrupt their education or that of a \nfamily member--one-quarter of all the unemployed now. That is happening \nin America. We have an opportunity to do something about it with this \nbill by just deferring the upper tax rates--not cancelling them out but \ndeferring those. Now we have the financial hardship on the unemployed. \nMore than one-half of the unemployed adults have had to postpone \nmedical treatment--57 percent--or cut back on spending for food--56 \npercent. One in four--26 percent--had to move to other housing or move \nin with their friends or relatives. Thirty-eight percent have lost \ntheir telephone service. These are hard-working Americans who have lost \ntheir telephone service.\n  Without this amendment, 80,000 per week will lose all kinds of help \nand assistance from unemployment compensation.\n  This is what is happening to them already.\n  Thirty-eight percent have lost their telephone service. Twenty-two \npercent are worried about losing their phone service. More than a third \nhave had trouble paying gas or electric bills.\n  That is just the beginning. If you look at the number of workers who \nhave lost their health insurance, one-half of them have already lost \ntheir health insurance when they were laid off, and the others who have \nbeen able to retain their health insurance are in danger of losing \nthat. One-third of the unemployed covered by health insurance have lost \ntheir benefits as a result of just being unemployed. The rest of them \nare going to lose that when they lose their unemployment compensation.\n\n[[Page S6182]]\n\n  In fact, since losing their jobs, one in every four have moved into \nless expensive housing or moved in with friends or families, more than \na third can't pay their electric and gas bills, and more than one-half \ncut back on their food.\n  One-half million men and women have joined the unemployment lines in \nthe past 3 months. That is 500,000 fellow Americans who have joined the \nunemployment lines in the last 3 months. No end is in sight.\n  In Massachusetts, the jobless rate has jumped to a 9-year high--5.7 \npercent. Nationally the unemployment rate has reached 6 percent, with 9 \nmillion Americans out of work and 2 million of those out of work for \nmore than 6 months.\n  These Americans are not the first priority--they are not even a \npriority--in this administration's tax reduction program because there \nis not a nickel in extended unemployment compensation for any of these \nworkers who have lost out.\n  In fact, in this economy with no jobs, they have learned a lot about \nbeing second-class citizens with second mortgages and secondhand \nclothes to make ends meet. Our first priority on the economy is to get \nthese working Americans back to work--not just to reward the wealthy. A \nmajor part of that effort must be help for the unemployed.\n  The current Federal unemployment benefit program runs out at the end \nof this month. With a continued troubled economy, this extension cannot \nbe business as usual. Our amendment extends the current program for 6 \nmonths, but it also helps the 1.1 million Americans who are long-term \nunemployed and the hundreds of thousands who are part-time and low-wage \nworkers who would otherwise get no help.\n  Our amendment provides 26 weeks of benefits to out-of-work Americans, \njust as we provided during the last recession in the bipartisan bills \nsigned by the first President Bush.\n  Nearly 1 million more private sector jobs have been lost during this \nrecession than over the same period of the early 1990s recession. The \nimpact in the 1990s, in terms of workers being able to find jobs, was \nnot nearly as bad as it is currently, and yet we did twice as much for \nthem.\n  It is inconceivable why we are not willing to take the steps to help \nour fellow Americans when they have already paid into the fund. These \nworkers have contributed to the fund. The fund is in surplus today. All \nwe are asking is, let's use that fund that is in surplus today to \nassist them during this period of transition. This should be a no-\nbrainer. This ought to be embraced overwhelmingly.\n  Where are the votes that we received in the early 1990s--by 90 \nvotes--with bipartisanship. And still we have the reluctance by our \nfriends on the other side to support this program.\n  In the last recession, we also made sure that workers who ran out of \nFederal benefits but still could not find work were not left out in the \ncold. Today, one in five unemployed workers has been out of work for \nmore than 6 months. In January, we left out 1 million of these long-\nterm unemployed without jobs and without any safety net. Today, there \nare 100,000 more. Our amendment provides 13 more weeks of benefits for \nthese long-suffering Americans.\n  Clearly, we owe it to all Americans who have lost their jobs in this \neconomy to provide help while they look for new jobs. They paid into \nthe unemployment compensation. They have to be out looking for jobs or \nthey do not qualify, and they are doing that, and still they are going \nto be left high and dry without this amendment.\n  The actions in recent months to extend the benefits have left out too \nmany workers, particularly compared to America's response in the past. \nIn 1975, 75 percent of unemployed workers were eligible for \nunemployment benefits, compared to only half of such workers last year. \nAnd that is because unemployment insurance has not been updated to meet \nthe changing times; and that is because our good friends on the other \nside have changed the terms of who was going to be eligible. Isn't that \namazing. You are only going to find half of all unemployed workers who \nare eligible, even though they are certainly similar in terms of their \nworking and contributing. Many of the unemployed who fail to receive \nbenefits are part-time and low-wage workers. Part-time and low-wage \nworkers pay into the system, and they should be able to rely on it \nwhile searching for new jobs. Our amendment offers the States the \noption--does not require it; it offers the States the option--to \nrequest Federal assistance to provide benefits for these workers.\n  Out-of-work Americans have worked hard all their lives. They have \npaid into the unemployment insurance fund, which has $21 billion. We \ncannot now say to these citizens: Now that you are out of work, \nstruggling to pay your bills, we will not let you collect on your \ninsurance policy.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment which will provide a \nlifeline to those hurt the most by the protracted economic downturn. \nThe extension runs out in just 2 weeks. We cannot wait. Congress must \nact now to provide the assistance out-of-work Americans deserve.\n  We may have some difference on the floor of the Senate about who has \nthe best economic stimulus program. And we do have significant \ndifferences--significant differences--but we ought to be able to agree, \nwhether you support the Republican or the Democratic program, that we \nare not going to hold unemployed workers hostage until it kicks in and \nprovides job opportunities for workers. We ought to all be able to \nagree to that. We have done that in a bipartisan way historically.\n  The trust fund is in surplus. People are hurting. They are our fellow \nworkers. We cannot deny them the kind of hand they need and they have \nbeen working with over the course of their working lives. We should \naccept this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have cleared this with the distinguished \nchairman of the committee. I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be temporarily set aside so the Senator from Massachusetts \nmay offer his amendment.\n  Will the Senator from Massachusetts call up his amendment?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I call up my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] for himself, \n     Mr. Daschle, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Reed, Mrs. \n     Clinton, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Levin, Mrs. Murray, \n     Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. \n     Dodd, proposes an amendment numbered 544.\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time used \nby the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts be charged against the \ntime on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, how much time does that leave on this \namendment on the side of the minority?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-six minutes.\n  Mr. REID. So the Senators from Washington and Rhode Island will have \n36 minutes, or whatever time they need.\n  I ask Senator Kennedy, will you yield time to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield such time as he may use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the Kennedy \namendment. I am amazed that at a time when there are over 1.1 million \nworkers who have exhausted all their unemployment benefits--who are \nlooking for work, who are not finding work--at a time when our fund to \npay for these benefits is in surplus by billions of dollars, we are not \nextending this program.\n  This is perhaps the last chance we will have. The program expires in \njust a few days. Yet we are here on the floor of the Senate talking \nabout many other things: tax benefits for affluent Americans who are \ndoing quite well.\n\n[[Page S6183]]\n\nBut we are not responding to the demands, the needs of countless \nnumbers of our fellow citizens. I am just amazed this would happen.\n  This UI, temporary Federal unemployment insurance program, will \nexpire at the end of May. What is happening in our economy today is \nthat people are desperately looking for jobs, but the economy is \nchanging. As I go about Rhode Island, I do not find lots of people who \nsay: Well, I don't want to take a job because these benefits are so \ngood. These benefits are a fraction of what these people were making \nwhen they were working. They are hardly sufficient to pay the mortgage, \nto pay for their children's needs, to pay for all the items they have \nto buy each and every day.\n\n  What has happened in the economy, in our case in Rhode Island, is we \nused to be a manufacturing center where there were 20 or 30 or 40 \ndifferent manufacturing plants all requiring foremen and supervisors \nand vice presidents for human resources. Those factories have been \nclosing. Work has been going overseas.\n  In many cases, it is not a question of losing a job nowadays; it is a \nquestion of the company going away, leaving the small towns of Rhode \nIsland and southern New England and the small towns of North Carolina \nand South Carolina, leaving people highly skilled but with no place to \nwork.\n  These are the true victims of this current economic malaise and \nrecession. And we are not responding by simply giving them some more \ntime, giving them resources to pay the debts that pile up every day in \nevery family in this country? I think it is just appalling.\n  Madam President, 1.1 million workers have exhausted their benefits \nand have not found work. That is the current situation. We have to help \nthem. The unemployment rate today is 6 percent. That rate is higher \nthan when this temporary program was initiated in March of 2002. It is \nhigher today than when the program was extended in January 2003. Yet we \nare not extending the program. The situation is worse, but our response \nis not appropriate to that situation.\n  Over the last 3 months, 540,000 private sector jobs have been lost \nand the economy has lost, since the beginning of the recession, a total \nof 2.7 million private sector jobs. This is not a question of jobs \nbeing there and workers being unwilling to take those jobs.\n  As a result, we only have one recourse--frankly, they only have one \nrecourse: They must have these benefits. And we must provide these \nbenefits.\n  Private payrolls are 2.4 percent below their level in March 2001 at \nthe beginning of this recession. The job losses in this recession now \nexceed those in the recession of 1990.\n  One other very compelling point is, on average, if you look at the \nrecessions in this century, at least, job losses tend to bottom out \nafter 15 months and are erased within 2 years. The persistent job \nlosses in this recession are at the 25-month mark--25 months, not 15 \nmonths--and as a result, in that dimension, this is the worst \nrecession, most severe recession since the 1930s in terms of the \nduration of long-term unemployment.\n  The latest employment report paints a bleak labor market picture for \nthe future.\n  There are 8.8 million unemployed Americans, but we only count on our \nunemployment rolls those Americans who are actively seeking employment. \nThere are millions more who are unable or so frustrated by the lack of \njobs that they are not actively seeking--4.4 million Americans. They \nwant a job. There is no real prospect, and as a result they are not \neven counted.\n  Then add to that the number of Americans--4.8 million--who work part \ntime. They want to work full time but they work part time because there \nare no full-time jobs.\n  Then throughout these numbers, there is this persistent overhanging \npopulation of long-term unemployed Americans, about 1.9 million jobless \nfor more than 26 weeks, about 20 percent of the total unemployed. This \nis a number that is not going down; it is persistent. These are the \nindividuals who need our help, and we should help. We must help. Yet \nthe bill that comes before us today, the bill that is supposed to \nstimulate the economy, ignores all of these millions of Americans. \nFrankly, I can't think of a more efficient way to stimulate the economy \nthan to continue extended unemployment benefits. It puts money in the \nhands of working families. That money is not going to be hoarded. That \nmoney will not be spent on impressionist art. That money is going to be \nspent immediately at Kmart and Target and Wal-Mart.\n  So this is not just about fairness. This is about getting the economy \nmoving again, at least in a very direct way. I believe we have to do \nthis. We have to do it now. The time literally is running out. As \nSenator Kennedy pointed out, even today's program is less generous than \nprograms in the past. Indeed, the fund has over $20 billion of assets \nthat were contributed by these people when they worked. They paid into \nthese funds. Now they are simply asking in their time of need to be \nsupported, to be helped. It is not fair to ignore them.\n  There is no good economic argument to say we should not do this. \nFirst, it is stimulative. It puts money directly in the hands of \nAmericans who will spend it. That is the best stimulation we can find. \nSecond, the notion that these people are just sitting around because \nthey don't want to work is preposterous. These people, many of them our \ncontemporaries, in their forties and fifties, would love to work simply \nfor the sake of working but, more importantly, because their expenses \nfar exceed whatever payment they will receive from this unemployment \ncompensation fund. We have to do something and we have to do it now.\n  Alan Greenspan, in January of 2002, dispelled this whole myth that \nthe administration is trying to foster that this program is not any \ngood, it is not worthwhile; they are just sitting around; it \ndiscourages people from finding jobs.\n  He said:\n\n       [C]learly, you cannot argue that somebody who runs past the \n     26-week level is slow for not looking for a job or not \n     actively seeking to get re-employed. There are just no jobs \n     out there.\n\n  This is January 2002. The situation is worse today.\n\n       And consequently, to adhere to the 26-week limit doesn't \n     serve its actual purpose, which is essentially to prevent a \n     misuse of the unemployment insurance system. So I've always \n     been in favor of extending benefits when the job market \n     itself begins to dry up.\n\n  Frankly, this is the Sahara of the job market that we see today. It \nis very dried up.\n  That was January 2002. It is worse today. Yet we are not responding \ntoday. Since January 2002, we have lost over three-quarters of a \nmillion more jobs. There is no economic argument against this \namendment. In fact, all of the economic arguments, all the arguments on \nfairness, all the arguments about letting people get access to the \nbenefits before they find work again argue strenuously for this \namendment. I urge my colleagues to support the Kennedy amendment.\n  I yield back whatever time I have to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise today in support of the Kennedy \namendment, and I hope my colleagues will see that the essence of this \namendment is about setting priorities in America.\n  Yes, we are discussing a tax bill that could end up including $350 \nbillion in tax cuts directed at the most wealthy people in America. \nWhile we are doing that, we are doing it in the face of the fact that \nmillions of Americans are unemployed and that their unemployment \nbenefits are running out.\n  So what are we saying by setting this priority, setting a bill in \nmotion out of the Senate that some Members believe is going to help \nstimulate the economy, that it will really start us on the right track? \nAnd instead of paying attention to the very people who have helped \nbuild this economy, those in the aviation sector who lost their jobs \nbecause of the downturn in aviation after 9/11, those who lost their \njobs because of corporate manipulation in the energy crisis, who lost \ntheir jobs because of those market schemes and manipulations, and those \npeople who are simply just out of a job because of 9/11 and the economy \nhas not returned, we are saying, we don't have a plan to help you. \nInstead, we want to propose one of\n\n[[Page S6184]]\n\nthe biggest tax cuts in history hoping that somehow this will trickle \ndown to help you.\n  The point is, when in our history as a country have we proposed a \ndividend tax cut as a way to stimulate the economy? Yet we have had two \nof the last administrations, a Democrat and Republican administration, \nwhich said one of the best things we can do during times of high \nunemployment is to make sure we extend unemployment benefits. Why is \nthat? Well, it is quite simple. For every dollar spent on unemployment, \nit generates $2.15 of stimulus. This is a proven economic plan. For my \nState in Washington, where over 100,000 people would be impacted by \nthis amendment and would qualify, we are talking about real numbers. We \nare talking about millions of dollars to our economy over the next \nseveral months that can help pay mortgage payments, health care costs, \nand as Senator Kennedy said, keep the lights on at home in a region of \nour country that has seen some of the highest energy rates in a long \ntime.\n  What we are doing in this amendment Senator Kennedy is proposing is \nputting forth an idea of how to help stimulate the economy that has \nbeen tested and proven successful by two administrations, both \nRepublican and Democrat. Instead, we are saying we are not going to \ninclude this in this package.\n  I must remind my colleagues that we came to this brink in December of \nlast year. While some of us might think we rectified it when we came in \nin January, there were people in my State, as those unemployment \nbenefits were curtailed in December, who did lose their health care \nbenefits. They did lose the ability to take care of the health care \nneeds of their families. I am sure there were people who probably even \nlost their homes because of that time period, because of the \nuncertainty, because of our lack of commitment for these unemployed \nworkers. So here we are at the same point again, 2, 3 weeks away from \nhaving this unemployment benefit extension evaporate on May 31 and no \ncommitment, no commitment to say we will extend unemployment benefits, \nagain at a time when we have had administration after administration \nsay, in times of tough economic situations and no job growth, the best \nthing we can do is keep the stimulus going by making sure there is \nunemployment.\n  So where are we? Well, as we know, the impact over the last 2 years, \nthe private sector has lost more than 2 million jobs. Unemployment has \njumped by 50 percent. As a State that has 7-percent unemployment now \nand as a region, the Pacific Northwest, with Oregon, Washington and \nAlaska, that has the highest unemployment in the country, this is no \nsimple matter. This is about priorities. This is about whether we are \ngoing to take care of the working families who have helped build this \neconomy and sustain them until job opportunities increase again.\n  We will look for other opportunities to make sure the training \nprograms and the educational opportunities are there to retool the \nworkforce for the jobs of the future.\n  One of the amendments we were successful in getting on the budget \nbill earlier in setting our priorities was to say that we should not \ncut the job training programs. We still have people in Washington State \nwho are willing to hire this workforce that has been laid off, but they \nwant them to be retooled. They want them to gain expertise. What better \ntime to do that than now, as they are working through their \nunemployment, to offer to give them training benefits, make sure they \nare retooled for the economy of the future--whether it is in \nnanosciences, in biotechnology, in new aviation construction, in new IT \nfields, or in nursing where we have over 130,000 openings for nurses in \nthis country, and the people who want to have those jobs. Instead, we \nare allowing outside people to come in and take them because we are not \nwilling to take care of American workers. This is not a priority. We \nare simply saying instead of giving the largest tax cut in history, and \npassing this out of the Senate, knowing that thousands of workers are \ngoing to lose their benefits in 3 weeks, we believe we should give them \nthat helping hand.\n  Make no mistake. Nobody in America wants an unemployment check. They \nwould rather have a paycheck. But until we can guarantee to these \npeople that we are going to get them that paycheck, we better extend \nthat opportunity, from a trust fund that they have paid into, the \nthings that they and their employers have paid into, the opportunity to \nsustain them and benefit our economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 7 minutes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 18 minutes 7 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Montana, 10 \nminutes to the Senator from Connecticut, and 4 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Iowa, Mr. Harkin.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I see Senator Dodd ready to speak. I suggest that he \nspeak, and I will speak after him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts \nfor yielding me some time. I have just a few observations.\n  First of all, on the amendment being offered by our colleague from \nMassachusetts, it has been said by others, by my colleague from \nWashington, and my colleague from Rhode Island, and certainly the \nSenator from Massachusetts, as well, that this is difficult for many of \nus to understand. I have served in this Chamber for more than two \ndecades now. I don't recall another time when we had a downturn in the \neconomy, where we had as many as 2 million jobs lost in the last 27 \nmonths, where 80,000 workers a week are losing their benefits. I don't \nrecall under any administration--I have served here under Republican \nadministrations and Democratic administrations, and I have served when \nthis Chamber was controlled by Democrats and also under Republicans, \nand in the House also with both Democrats and Republicans; I know of no \nother time in the more than two decades I have been here where in a \nmoment like this we would not provide an extension of unemployment \nbenefits.\n  It is truly shocking to see a piece of legislation designed to offer \nrelief to people, allegedly, through the tax cuts the President is \nsuggesting, with no assistance to the unemployed. We literally have \nthousands of people who are facing difficult times, whose ability to \ntake care of their families, and to make ends meet have been hindered. \nWe are talking about putting people back to work and getting them jobs. \nWe are talking about 80,000 people a week running out of benefits. And \nyet we find no space in the legislation to provide assistance to them. \nI am really stunned in many ways that this is not part of this effort.\n  I can only hope our colleagues, regardless of political party, will \nendorse the Kennedy amendment as part of this package. The \nadministration says they are still deciding whether an extension of \nunemployment insurance is necessary. What do they need to know? Well, \n80,000 people a week are losing their benefits. They are hard-working \nAmericans trying to hold together families, pay mortgages, pay car \npayments, keep their kids in school. What do we need to know when \n80,000 people a week are losing their benefits? Why can we not provide, \nin this legislation, which involves billions of dollars, some relief \nfor these people?\n  Our unemployment insurance amendment would protect the unemployment \ninsurance safety net for 4 million out-of-work Americans. So I \nsincerely hope the managers of this bill, and others, would see fit to \nprovide some space here. In my State alone, 58,000 people who are out \nof work would be helped by the Kennedy amendment; in California, \n562,000; in Florida, 161,000.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a State by State list, totaling the 4 \nmillion people who would be benefitted by this amendment be printed in \nthe Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nFOUR MILLION AMERICANS WILL BENEFIT FROM THE ECONOMIC SECURITY AMENDMENT\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n

low-wage workers, the total is 4.4\n  million. We do not have state-by-state break-downs for those workers.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I really cannot believe that at this \nmoment in our history we would pass a bill that would not provide help \nto the many, many Americans who need it. Let me also say, because I \nknow we are under time constraints--and I am probably not going to have \na chance to have any extended time for discussion of this later--that I \nwill speak briefly on an amendment that I have filed and intend to \noffer later, to reduce the tax cut package to increase resources for \nprograms designed specifically to assist middle- and low-income \nfamilies with the cost of higher education--and those are the Hope and \nLifetime Learning tax credits and the Pell Grant program. And, I also \nwould have an equivalent amount of resources go to deficit reduction.\n  If we are serious about having this bill contribute to our economic \ngrowth, then we ought to dedicate these resources to higher education. \nI don't need to lecture anyone in the Chamber about the value of \nproviding higher education opportunities for people. Yet, in spite of \nhis rhetoric, the President's fiscal year 2004 budget includes cuts in \nthe maximum Pell Grant available to low-income students, and he would \ndo nothing to expand the Hope and Lifetime Learning credits, which are \nspecifically designed to help middle-income families. Nothing could be \nmore devastating to a family than to discover that they cannot afford \nto send their son or daughter to college, regardless of their child's \ntalent, determination, or ambition. Or others who want to continue \nlearning throughout their lifetime of learning, but cannot, because \ninstead of helping them, we decide to provide a tax cut that primarily \nbenefits the wealthiest among us. For us to say to middle-income \nfamilies that your opportunity to send a child to college is going to \nhave to take a back seat to providing a tax break to the top 1 or 2 \npercent of income earners is something I don't think we ought to do.\n  So I am going to try, with this amendment, to focus our attention on \nhigher education. Of course, last week, we discovered the Government \nhas reported that the unemployment rate jumped to 6 percent. There are \neconomists in the country who believe the unemployment rate, by the \nfirst quarter of next year, will hover near 8 percent. It is beginning \nto become clear to this Senator that this possibility, as farfetched as \nit may have seemed a few months ago, is not so farfetched at all if we \ndon't do something to stem the tide here.\n  Nothing in this legislation is designed to do that. Now we are going \nto have, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the largest \nsingle deficit ever accumulated in the history of the United States of \nAmerica. What a record that is. This is, of course, just 27 months \nafter we came off of a period of economic growth, of accumulating \nsurpluses, and putting our country on sound fiscal footing. Yet in 27 \nshort months, we have gone from surpluses to the record high deficits \never accumulated in this country's history. That is an incredibly \nstunning record, not to mention the more than 2 million jobs that have \nbeen lost.\n  In the midst of this massive tax break which will go mostly to the \nfew elite in the country, we are also going to be raising the national \ndebt to a point where it is almost a trillion dollars more than the \npresent national debt. If you are out there paying mortgage payments, \ncar payments, and student loans, you don't need to have a Ph.D. in \neconomics to know that as you accumulate these deficits and debts \neventually interest rates are going to start to go up.\n  When interest rates go up, that is a tax increase on average \nAmericans. When you start paying more for that house payment, that car \npayment, that student loan that your child may need in order to receive \na higher education, that is a tax increase for middle Americans. If we \ndo not stem this tide and become more fiscally responsible, then those \ninterest rates are going to have a huge impact on literally millions of \nAmericans.\n  Again, you do not need to have me lecture about that point. I think \nmost Americans understand it. We have seen periods in our recent past \nwhen that has happened. We are going to see it again, in my view, if \nthis proposal is adopted as presented.\n  Two years ago when we were debating the tax cuts of 2001, we were \ntold we could expect almost $6 trillion in surpluses over the next \ndecade. Instead, we are now getting record high deficits. Two years ago \nwe were told that if we enacted the President's tax cut plan, we would \nvirtually pay off the publicly held debt by 2008. We are headed in \nexactly the opposite direction.\n  How many more signals do we need to get this Chamber to understand \nthat as we are digging this hole deeper and deeper, we need to pull out \nof the hole. Instead, we are just as determined to dig that hole deeper \nto the point where we will be spending years trying to recover from \nthis mistake.\n  After this Chamber passes part of the President's so-called growth \nplan, and after we vote to increase the debt by almost $1 trillion, how \nmany more trillions of dollars are we going to have to increase the \ndebt limit to in order to make room for this irresponsible tax cut \naffecting such a small percentage of taxpayers?\n  Let's consider what breaks people get. Again, I do not have to \npresent all of the charts here, but so people understand what I am \ntalking about, according to the Urban Institute Tax Policy Center, \nthose who have incomes above $1 million will receive, on average, a tax \ncut of $64,400. For those in the middle-income spectrum, their tax cut \nwill be $233. That is what we are about to adopt at a time when we are \ndriving the deficit hole even deeper; and at a time when we are denying \nan extension of unemployment benefits to the 80,000 people a week who \nhave and will be exhausting their benefits.\n  It seems to me that we are headed in the wrong direction on both \nfronts. The Kennedy amendment would extend unemployment benefits. The \nvery least we ought to do in this Chamber is to say to hard-working \npeople: When you are caught up in an economic downturn, Republicans and \nDemocrats alike in recent history have extended a hand to these \nfamilies and said: Through no fault of your own, you have ended up in \nthat situation. This Congress is not going to ignore you. This Congress \nis not going to pretend you do not exist.\n  We are saying nothing about those people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. This tax cut is way too excessive, in my view, and will \nbenefit a small percentage of income earners, creating deficits from \nwhich we will spend years recovering as it squeezes our ability to \nprovide help to working families and for education. I urge the adoption \nof the Kennedy amendment. I ask for an additional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. We have 20 hours for debate on a reconciliation bill, which\n\n[[Page S6186]]\n\nmay be the most significant debate we are going to have in this \nCongress. Twenty hours--that is all we get to talk about the importance \nof what we are about to do. I am deeply disappointed. We are \nconstrained in the Senate of the United States to have a more \nmeaningful debate about something as important as this.\n  I, again, urge adoption of the Kennedy amendment to at least provide \nrelief for those who have lost their jobs and ought to have some help \nto provide for their families.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask all Senators to heed the words of \nthe Senator from Connecticut. I think he is accurate. I think he is on \ntarget.\n  The amendment before us, of which I am a cosponsor, is very simple. \nThe answer of whether it should be adopted is also very easy.\n  Getting to the point, the question is, Should we extend unemployment \nbenefits to those millions of Americans who do not have jobs and whose \nunemployment insurance is about to expire?\n  The provisions in Federal law that give unemployment insurance \nbenefits will expire in a few weeks. The number of unemployed people is \nrising. These are people who have lost their jobs not because of their \nfault but because they have been laid off, because the economy is \nanemic. They lost jobs because their employers are laying them off.\n  The question is, Should the Congress extend unemployment benefits? \nShould they extend unemployment benefits to these hard-working men and \nwomen who are not making a lot of money? They are basic wage earners. \nShould we extend unemployment benefits? To ask the question is to \nanswer it: Of course, we should.\n  I hear from the other side that maybe they will not look for jobs \nbecause they are getting additional benefits. They are not getting more \ndollars in benefits, they are just getting more weeks during which they \ncan receive about $200 a week while they are looking for a job. The \nobvious answer to that charge is these are not good times. Two-hundred \ndollars a week is not a lot of money. I daresay no Member of this body \ncan live on $200 a week. We are so used to living on more than $200 a \nweek. I see the Presiding Officer smiling, knowing there is probably a \nlittle truth in that. I am suggesting we should do the obvious and \nextend unemployment benefits.\n  Another argument I hear against this proposal is that it is not a \nstimulus to extend the period during which people get unemployment \nbenefits. Of course it is a stimulus. Those people are going to spend \nthat $200-a-week check. Of course, they are going to spend it. \nEconomists will tell us that for every $1 of unemployment benefits, \nthere is a multiplier effect of $2.15 to the economy; that is, for \nevery $1, an additional $2.15 is spent in the economy. It is pretty \nsimple.\n  I also think it is pretty simple because we are paying for this by \nrepealing the top bracket, repealing the acceleration of the reduction \nof the top tier. Some people say: That is a small business bracket. \nThose people are all small business people. We should do this to \nstimulate the economy.\n  That is totally wrong. It is totally incorrect. Less than 5 percent--\nprobably 2 or 3 percent--of the people who receive benefits in the top \nbracket are small businesses. Let me put it differently; 2 to 3 percent \nof small businesses in America are in that top bracket. Just 2 to 3 \npercent. Most of the people in the top bracket are not small business. \nThey are other people. They are very wealthy people. I have nothing \nagainst wealthy people getting a tax break. Everybody should get a tax \nbreak. It would be wonderful if we all could get a tax break.\n  We are elected to make choices and set priorities. The economy today \nis not in great shape. This bill before us is designed and intended to \nstimulate the economy by reducing taxes. I suggest the right course \nwould be, instead of giving the elite a tax break right now--a lot of \nthem tell me they do not want it; they do not need it--take some of \nthat money and extend unemployment benefits.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 4 minutes.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we will extend unemployment \ncompensation. We will support an extension, though, of current law. We \nwill do it before its expiration at the end of May. But this amendment \ngoes beyond extending unemployment compensation as it is written in \ncurrent law.\n  This is unprecedented for sure, and I also think it is an unjustified \nexpansion. There might be legitimate debate on that point, but there is \nno legitimate opposition to a statement that this is unprecedented.\n  Also, this extension and this change in law comes at a time when \nunemployment is not as high as it has been in previous recessions. The \ncurrent unemployment rate is 6 percent. That is compared to 7 percent \nat times during the 1990s and more than 8 percent during the 1980s.\n  It was in the 1990s at 7 percent, in the 1980s at 8 percent. Those \nhappen to be the last two times that Congress provided extended \nbenefits.\n  I also point out the unemployment rate right now in 23 States is \nlower than it was 1 year ago. When it comes to people who have \nexhausted benefits, this amendment would provide 26 weeks of Federal \nbenefits even without regard to the duration of State benefits. So this \nviolates an insurance principle that we followed for a long time \ninherent in the unemployment program, and it violates it by breaking \nthe link between the time someone has worked and the time that person \ncan collect unemployment benefits.\n  This amendment additionally would also allow someone who worked as \nfew as 20 weeks to collect as much as 26 weeks of federally-funded \nbenefits.\n  This amendment also deals with part-time workers. In offering this \namendment, what they forget at the Federal level is that we already \ngive States the option of covering part-time workers. So why a national \npolicy of covering part-time workers when this has been historically a \nState program that has been financed through some Federal taxation? \nThere are a lot of details left to individual States to decide. It is \nnot possible for us to legislate at the Federal level the conditions \nthat exist in various States for deciding whether part-time workers \nshould be included.\n  This provision would allow those seeking only part-time work to \ncollect unemployment benefits. What this basically means is a worker \ncould turn down a full-time job and continue collecting unemployment \nbenefits.\n  There is a provision of this amendment that changes policy in regard \nto low-wage workers. This is another provision under Federal law where \nStates already are given the option of doing this. This provision would \nrequire States to use what is referred to as an alternative base \nperiod. That means using the most recent quarter to calculate benefits.\n  In 1997, this was offered to the Senate and we voted 85 to 15 to \noverturn a Federal court decision that would have required the States \nto use the most recent quarter. In other words, Congress decided in \n1997 against a court decision doing what this amendment does. We \ndecided 85 to 15 to leave it to the respective States, as has \nhistorically been the case, to make this decision of using an \nalternative base period.\n  So as I mentioned, I will support, and I believe the Senate will \npass, an extension of current law for unemployment benefits before it \nruns out.\n  This amendment is paid for in a way that discourages job creation. \nRemember, the fundamental purpose underlying this legislation is to \ngive incentive for investment for the creation of jobs. So how is this \namendment paid for? By attacking small businesses, by delaying the tax \nrelief that is in this bill for 80 percent of those who are taxed at \nthe 39 percent rate. Remember, we reduce the highest marginal tax rate \ndown to the same as the highest corporate tax rate. Why? Because there \nshould not be a bias in our tax law against small entrepreneurs, \nunincorporated entrepreneurs.\n  As we have been told so often by Joint Tax and by the White House, 80 \npercent of the benefits go to small business. Now, that does not mean \nall small business is taxed at the 39 percent level, but by reducing \nthis we are taking away a bias against small business. There should not \nbe an 11 percent penalty for being an unincorporated small business. It \nis unfair. When we had a lower marginal tax rate for small\n\n[[Page S6187]]\n\nbusiness at 28 percent for the top individual rate, as we did after \n1986 until it was raised, we had a 5 percent differential between the \ncorporate rate of 33 percent and the highest individual rate of 28 \npercent. During that period of time, we had an explosion of small \nbusiness, setting the stage for the massive growth we had in the \neconomy in the 1990s.\n  What does this amendment do? It will kill the opportunity for job \nexpansion that we have prepared in lowering the marginal tax rate for \nself-employed people, doing away with the bias in favor of corporations \nso that where 80 percent of the jobs are created in small business, \nthere will be an incentive to create new jobs.\n  The National Bureau of Economic Research shows that the surest way of \nexpanding small business is from their own equity, by reducing the \nmarginal tax rates, which is going to encourage the sort of investment \nthat creates jobs.\n  The Senators who have offered this amendment are complaining about \nlost jobs, but then this amendment undermines the very provisions of \nthe basic bill that will create the jobs we need.\n  Obviously, I urge the defeat of this job-killing amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment being \noffered by Senator Kennedy to extend and authorize additional \nunemployment benefits.\n  This is a tumultuous time for millions of Americans. Our economy is \nstruggling right now and millions of Americans are down on their luck. \nBusinesses and manufacturing plants are closing, the stock market is \ndown and most importantly, jobs are being lost. It is critical that we \nin Congress, at a minimum, do what we can to help every day Americans \nhurt by this downturn, especially the increasing number of people who \nare unemployed and having trouble getting back into the workforce.\n  There are currently over 8.7 million unemployed Americans--the \nhighest number in a decade. Since January 2001, the national \nunemployment rate has risen from 4.2 percent to over 6.0 percent. Since \nPresident Bush took office, the United States has lost over 2.7 million \nprivate sector jobs--the most of any President in modern history. The \ndownturn has especially hit my home State of Michigan hard. Michigan \nhas an unemployment rate of 6.7 percent--among the highest in the \nNation. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Michigan lost \n17,700 jobs just last month--the most of any State in the country. That \nbrings the total number of Michigan jobs lost since the Bush \nAdministration took office to over 178,000.\n  Earlier this year, Congress extended Federal unemployment benefits \nfor an additional five months to June 1, 2003. However, Congress did \nnot authorize additional Federal benefits. Therefore, over 1 million \nworkers who already had exhausted their 13 weeks of federal \nunemployment benefits and received no benefit from what Congress did \nearlier this year. Now is the time to assist those workers and all \nother Americans who are on the verge of exhausting either their state \nor federal unemployment benefits and in some cases, both.\n  It is ironic that during the week the Senate is taking up the \nPresident's ``Jobs and Growth'' package--the majority is not addressing \nthe immediate need for job assistance for millions of Americans. \nInstead of pressing Congress for a ``robust'' tax cut to help the \nwealthiest Americans, the President should be fighting for additional \nunemployment benefits for working families who need them and will spend \nthem, stimulating the economy. That is why I support Senator Kennedy's \namendment to authorize an additional 13 weeks of Federal unemployment \nbenefits, including coverage for those one million workers who have \nalready exhausted their benefits. Senator Kennedy's amendment also \nexpands unemployment coverage to low-wage and part-time workers. \nFinally, the amendment extends the Federal unemployment benefit program \nthrough November 2003 to accommodate new enrollees.\n  This is not just about doing what is right. It is also about doing \nwhat is helpful to our economy. It is elementary economics that \nproviding additional unemployment benefits is a great way to jump start \nour stagnant economy. The money we are talking about here is money that \nwill be spent. According to a 1999 Department of Labor study, every $1 \ndollar invested in unemployment insurance generates $2.15 in gross \ndomestic product. So we are going to be putting money into the hands of \npeople who need it, people who will spend it, people who will help the \neconomy.\n  Over 47,000 Michigan residents have exhausted their Federal \nunemployment benefits as of February of this year. If we fail to act, \nin 2 weeks, over 1.1 million Americans, including nearly 54,000 \nMichigan residents, will be without unemployment insurance benefits. \nThis is unacceptable, especially given the fact that the Federal \nunemployment insurance trust fund currently has a surplus of more than \n$21 billion. The contrast couldn't be more evident than in this debate. \nInstead of pushing for a huge tax cut sharply slanted to upper income \nfolks, I would hope that the Senate will show real leadership and \nsupport unemployment insurance that benefits working families.\n  The President accuses us of engaging in ``class warfare.'' Well, what \nhe calls class warfare, I call reality. Under the President's tax cut \nplan, the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans are expected to receive an \nannual tax cut of about $90,000 a year, or a little more than $1700 a \nweek. Under the Kennedy amendment, unemployed workers in my home state \nof Michigan would receive a maximum benefit of $362 a week. This bill \nwill put money into the hands of people who need it and people who will \nspend it. That's good for our economy and it helps sustain the jobs \nthat other people do have. The Senate should unanimously adopt this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have the highest regard for my friend \nfrom Iowa, but for him to characterize this as a job-killing amendment \nis just beyond the pale. The fact of the matter is that less than 5 \npercent of small businesses are in the top bracket that will be \nrepealed under the amendment. That is a very conservative estimate.\n  Second, when we are talking small businesses under terms of this \namendment, we are talking about law firms, we are talking about \npartnerships of all kinds. We are talking about dental partnerships and \ndoctor partnerships. When people use the word ``small business,'' it \nconjures up a 15 or 20-person operation that is working hard to make \nends meet. When we talk about small business, however, we must be clear \nas to which small businesses are in that top rate. Less than 5 percent \nof all small businesses pay that top rate, so we are not hurting small \nbusiness with this amendment, by any stretch of the imagination.\n  Second, this roughly 5 percent of small businesses includes the mom-\nand-pop small businesses we have all talked about, but also the \npartnerships like law firms and dental partnerships. I do not think the \nlatter really conjures up what we are talking about when we talk about \nhelping a small business. Maybe we are, but I think most Americans are \nnot. That is a fact I want to get in the record, that really so few \nsmall businesses are in that top rate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendments be temporarily \nset aside so that the Senator from Arkansas may offer her amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, and I will be \nvery brief.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I want to follow up. I know the chairman of the committee \nis here, and I missed a little of the discussion because I had to step \noutside the Chamber with some police officers from my State. I will \ntake a minute or so and obviously then move to the amendment of the \nSenator from Arkansas.\n  I understand the chairman made a statement about this issue of \nunemployment insurance at some point. I wonder if the distinguished \nchairman of the committee might share with Members when that might \nhappen and why we cannot do it now. We know this is a growing problem, \nand we always delay these things. When 80,000 people a week are running \nout of benefits, we have had more than 2 million people\n\n[[Page S6188]]\n\nlose work since the President came into office, why not extend \nunemployment insurance on this bill? It would be a great gesture to the \nAmerican public. My question is, simply, to ask if the chairman of the \ncommittee might respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time on the amendment has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that immediately following \naction on S. 1054, the Senate turn to consideration of legislation \nintroduced by the majority leader or his designee to extend emergency \nunemployment benefits until November 30, 2003; that the bill be \nconsidered as read three times and passed; further, that the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with all this to occur without \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. This is the first I have heard this. I don't know what \nthis is all about. Pending a better understanding of the request, I \nrespectfully object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Is there objection to setting aside the pending amendment?\n  Mr. DODD. Further reserving the right to object, I ask unanimous \nconsent that I be allowed to proceed for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I want to know why this could not be adopted as part of \nthis passage. We have an amendment here right now to do it. This is the \ntime to do it. We all care about this and have people in every State \nadversely affected. Why wait another series of weeks? Why not do it \nright now and adopt the Kennedy amendment and move this issue beyond us \nand deal with the rest of the bill? That is my question to my \ndistinguished chairman.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will answer his question, if I am \npermitted.\n  Two reasons: One, this amendment is not germane to this bill; two, it \ngoes to the expansion of unemployment benefits as opposed to extension \nof existing benefits.\n  Mr. DODD. I further understand that the bill the chairman is talking \nabout would not expand this at all but really just extend it; is that \ncorrect? So we will have a debate about that, obviously.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the chairman for responding.\n  I am sad in a way, and maybe the amendment will be adopted by \nmajority if that is the case and we can move beyond this.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside and the Senator from Arkansas be recognized to offer her \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 578\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, with the amendment set aside, I call up \nmy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mrs. Lincoln], for herself and \n     Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \n     Levin, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kennedy, and \n     Mr. Dodd, proposes an amendment numbered 578.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To expand the refundability of the child tax credit)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title V, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. FURTHER EXPANSION OF CHILD TAX CREDIT REFUNDABILITY.\n\n       (a) Expansion of Child Tax Credits.--\n       (1) In general.--Clause (i) of section 24(d)(1)(B) \n     (relating to portion of credit refundable), as amended by \n     section 106(b) of this Act, is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(i) the sum of--\n\n       ``(I) 5 percent of so much of the taxpayer's earned income \n     (within the meaning of section 32) as is taken into account \n     in computing taxable income for the taxable year which \n     exceeds $5,000 and is less than $13,250, and\n       ``(II) 15 percent of so much of the taxpayer's earned \n     income (within the meaning of section 32) as is taken into \n     account in computing taxable income for the taxable year \n     which is more than $13,250, or''.\n\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by this subsection \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2002.\n       (3) Application of EGTRRA.--The amendment made by this \n     subsection shall be subject to title IX of the Economic \n     Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 to the same \n     extent and in the same manner as the provision of such Act to \n     which such amendment relates.\n       (b) Delay of Dividend Exclusion.--Subparagraph (B) of \n     section 116(a)(2) (relating to partial exclusion of dividends \n     by individuals), as amended by section 201 of this Act, is \n     amended by striking ``2007'' and inserting ``2010''.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank all of my colleagues for their attention today \nbecause I believe I brought something to the floor that is of the \nutmost importance to American families.\n  I compliment the chairman of the Finance Committee. Having worked \nwith limits on a multitude of issues, he is always reaching out and \nworking hard with all the members of the Finance Committee. I applaud \nhim for his efforts in working with me early in the committee to \naccelerate the child credit we have in this stimulus package. The \nacceleration of the child credit is very important in terms of reaching \nout to families and providing them the utmost resources to be able to \ncare for their families, to be able to do what they need to do not only \nin taking care of their families but playing a role in stimulating this \neconomy.\n  We certainly know that with our businesses and industries operating \nat roughly 70 percent, it is critical, if these industries are going to \ncreate the jobs we want created for the sustainability of growing this \neconomy, that they have a demand. They are going to need people \ndemanding their products and services, and that will be critical. The \nway to do that is to provide families the resources and the means with \nwhich to provide for their families.\n  That acceleration we provided in the committee went a long way in \ndoing that. My hope is we will continue to move in that fashion, in the \nright direction of providing families the resources they need, the \nhard-working American families who are out there today working hard to \nprovide for their families.\n  This amendment does that through the expansion of the child credit. \nBasically, what we do is expand the child credit refundability by \nlowering the earnings threshold to $5,000. This is a reasonable request \nin light of what we are talking about--again, assistance to families in \norder to raise their children and provide for their needs, as well as \nstimulating the economy.\n  I point out to my colleagues, there are 8 million children from \nworking families in this great country at the very bottom of the income \nscale who get no benefit from the current child care tax credit, 8 \nmillion children in this country we are trying to raise in working \nfamilies who get no benefit from this child tax credit; 4.4 million of \nthose 8 million children would benefit from the child credit under the \namendment I have offered today.\n  By providing tax relief to those who need it the most, our amendment \nwill have a direct and meaningful stimulative effect on the economy.\n  I am joined in this amendment by several other cosponsors: Senators \nRockefeller, Bingaman, Breaux, Daschle, Levin, Cantwell, Pryor, \nKennedy, Dodd, and I think many others, when they realize what we are \ntrying to do and the effect we can have on their States and, more \nimportantly, the working families who are out there every day trying to \nmake ends meet. The families of these kids play by the rules. These are \nindividuals who are working. They go to work every day at extremely low \nwage jobs. They pay significant payroll, State, and local taxes, excise \ntaxes, and property taxes. Oftentimes they struggle to make ends meet, \nyet they get no benefit from the child tax credit.\n  Now, I hope my colleagues will indulge me for just a moment. One of \nthe things many reflect on is that raising children is probably one of \nthe most important and expensive undertakings that anyone has. We do it \nfor good reason. We talk about what a great nation we live in. We talk \nabout how wonderful it is to be a part of the greatest\n\n[[Page S6189]]\n\ncountry on the face of this Earth. Then we think about the face of our \ncountry tomorrow. Who will be the face of this country tomorrow? What \nwill it look like?\n  The face of this country, tomorrow and in the future, will be shaped \nby how well we raise our children today. That is what I am asking my \ncolleagues to focus on. It is not just our children. I don't just worry \nabout my children and their well-being. I worry about the other \nparents' children who are out there, who will be the coworkers with my \nchildren, who will be the leaders of tomorrow. They will be the face of \nthis country when we are working in a global economy with multitudes of \nnations across the globe. These are the children we are raising today.\n  My colleagues, we have an opportunity today to give a hand to these \nparents in raising these children with a simple child credit, a \nrefundable child credit. These are people who are hard-working. To be \neligible, they have to be in a job. They have to meet an earnings \nlimit. They have to have children. We are not just giving a freebie; we \nare reaching out to these hard-working parents and saying let us help \nyou shape the face of this country tomorrow.\n  Just one more indulgence. As I talk about raising children and the \nimportance of that face of tomorrow, I reflect on the time I have spent \nin my State visiting with and shadowing some of our low-income workers, \nparticularly some single moms who have been out there working. They are \nworking parents with children in childcare, struggling with challenges \nof childcare and transportation. There are multitudes of challenges \nthey face.\n  I look at what I spent my time doing during the Easter break, during \nthe 2 weeks we are off from Congress, home in our States. I spent a lot \nof time on the road, visiting with children, parents, chambers of \ncommerce, Rotary groups, development groups, planning districts--all of \nthose different groups. But I also switched my hat around for a few \ndays and spent some time myself out there as a mother, as a parent.\n  I went to the store after looking at the fliers and seeing where the \nsales were, and I thought about what I did with my time and my \nresources. I thought that with two growing boys, age almost 7, I had to \nreplace wornout blue jeans, wornout tennis shoes, that I wrote a check \nto my school for their lunchroom tab, the fact I wrote a check to make \nsure they would be on the Little League team and made sure they had \ntheir uniforms. I looked at the other things, the county summer \nprograms I wanted to include them in so they would have good \nactivities, exercise, and grow just like any 7-year-old little boy \nought to be growing.\n  I looked at what we did. We didn't go to Disney World. We didn't do \nanything expensive. They went fishing with their grandfather and spent \nsome time with their cousins and grandmothers. But I looked back at the \ntime and the resources I spent in molding and shaping those two little \nboys. Let me tell you, it was no different than any other working mom.\n  If we want to stimulate this economy, if we want to develop a nation \nwith the kind of leadership and future I think everyone in this body \nwants us to have, then it is absolutely critical that we look at \nexpanding that child credit to these working families.\n  Under the current law, the President's proposal, and the Finance \nCommittee bill, a working family with earned income of $10,000 gets no \nbenefit from the child credit. Our amendment today would give such a \nfamily with two children a total benefit of $500. This does not seem to \nbe much money to many of us perhaps, but it amounts to a significant \nincrease in the amount of money available to these families to provide \nfor the most fundamental needs for their children. Again, we are \ntalking about basic needs that also will drive the economy. These \npeople are not going to be able to participate in stimulating the \neconomy if they don't have the extra resources they need. These are \nworking individuals.\n\n  Children have a variety of needs at a variety of ages, the most \nfundamental of them being shelter, food, clothes, education, and health \ncare, and $500 can make a substantial difference to a family with an \nearned income of $10,000 or less. This sort of benefit can go a long \nway in helping these families raise their children, encouraging them to \nexcel in their jobs and to set a good example.\n  It is the least we can do for these struggling and impoverished \nfamilies who, again, are working hard every day earning money and at \nthe same time trying to care for their children. They have the same \nkind of love and compassion, the same kind of ability to give them the \nbasic needs that every one of us tries to have every day.\n  I just implore my colleagues, please look at this opportunity we have \nbefore us today, an opportunity to reach out to working American \nfamilies who are struggling day in and day out to do what is right. \nThey are struggling to do what is right by their children, perhaps \nsimply out of their own compassion and love for their children, not \nknowing that we as a nation are depending on those children to be the \nleaders and the providers, the employees of tomorrow.\n  I ask my colleagues to take a look at this amendment. Recognize all \nwe are doing is postponing the 20 percent exclusion on dividends--only \npostponing it for 3 years, postponing that exclusion in order to mold \nand shape the future of this country.\n  I would like to share with my colleagues in just a few of my \nneighboring States what they would see. Arkansas would see the number \nof added kids, when we move to that $5,000 threshold, an increase in \nArkansas of 60,000 children we could cover. I look around at my \nneighbors: Mississippi would see 100,000 children additionally covered. \nIn Tennessee, you would see 108,000 children eligible who would not be \neligible otherwise. In the State of Texas, my neighbor to the south, \nyou would see 467,000 children added with a benefit if we passed this \namendment.\n  I implore my colleagues to really take a look at what our purpose is \ntoday, what we have been striving to do. Let's not just try to \nstimulate the economy but use the opportunity we have in growing this \neconomy to grow this great country. I daresay there will not be anyone \nin this Chamber who could argue with me that the future of this country \nlies in the future of our children.\n  Once again, we have a tremendous opportunity. I hope my colleagues \nwill realize that 4.4 million of the 8 million kids who are left out \nunder the current bill would begin to benefit from a child credit under \nthis amendment. By providing this tax relief to those, again, who need \nit the most, we will have a direct and meaningful stimulative effect on \nthe economy. Let me tell you, just as I did as I turned my hat around \nand became a mother during my break time, these families will spend \nthose dollars. They will spend them on our greatest asset this country \ncould possibly have, and that is our children.\n  I thank you for the time. I yield the floor and encourage my \ncolleagues to support my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we all owe the Senator from Arkansas a \ndebt of gratitude for a lot of leadership she has shown in this area, \nnot only on the present bill that is before us, because she did get \nsome amendments adopted in committee. She voted for our bill on final \npassage. I appreciate very much that being the case because it made it \na bipartisan piece of legislation. But also, she has expressed the same \nconcern because she was a member of the committee, 2 years ago, when we \npassed the existing tax law that we are adjusting now to bring it up to \ndate and fully implement it in 2003, rather than as we decided 2 years \nago, to implement it over a 10-year period of time. She was very active \nin these areas in that basic legislation.\n  So she is very consistent in expressing concerns about families of \nlow income, and particularly low-income families with children. I wish \nI could do all the things she asked us to do, but we have to craft \nlegislation that is pretty well balanced. One of the largest parts of \nour bill is the $95 billion that is provided for families with \nchildren.\n  Obviously the Senator from Arkansas would like to make this more \ngenerous. I wish we could. But I don't feel we can. The provisions that \nare in this $95 billion have been, to a great extent, because of the \nwork of the Senator from\n\n[[Page S6190]]\n\nArkansas. It includes expanding benefits for low-income families, a \nprovision that is included in great part because of the hard work of \nthe Senator from Arkansas. Moreover, this legislation creates a new \nbenefit.\n  But I think that the exception I take to her amendment is just \nbasically because it hurts the balance of this bill between investment \nand spending.\n  I appreciate the Senator's work on these matters. It would be subject \nto a budget point of order. I will raise that at the appropriate time. \nI will not do it taking exception to policy but taking exception to \nwhat can be accomplished at one time, and the fact that we are trying \nto have a balanced package between investment and spending. I think it \nwould put us over the balance on the spending side.\n  For that reason, I will raise that point of order but do it without \nprejudice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am going to yield to the Senator from \nOklahoma what time he might consume either on amendments or on the \nbill.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague, the \nmanager of the bill, chairman of the Finance Committee. I want to make \na few comments concerning unemployment compensation.\n  It is my understanding that the chairman said he would not object to \nand he is trying to facilitate a clean extension of the current \nunemployment compensation program. That is what the Senator from New \nYork, Senator Clinton, and I did twice on this floor. We did it last \nDecember and early this year. The first piece of legislation we passed \nthis year was the clean extension of the unemployment compensation \nprogram. That is a 13-week Federal program.\n  Senator Kennedy is being consistent. He is trying to make a 13-week \nprogram into a 26-week program. That costs $12.7 billion. A clean \nextension costs $5.6 billion. We will agree with a clean extension. We \nwill not agree with doubling the program.\n  Keep in mind this is a 13-week program. Current law is a 13-week \nFederal program on top of up to 26 weeks of State benefits. That is a \ntotal of up to 39 weeks. That is a total of 9 months. If we adopted \nSenator Kennedy's amendment, that would be a 26-week State program, and \na 26-week Federal program, the second part of it paid 100 percent by \nthe Federal Government. That is a year. In addition to that, there are \nadditional weeks for high unemployment States.\n  This is not going to pass. It was tried several times on the floor of \nthe Senate last year and it never passed. It is not going to pass this \nyear. We are not going to double the program. We will be happy to work \nwith our colleagues to extend the current law. We will not double or \ntriple this program.\n  I appreciate the work of the chairman of the Finance Committee and \nother Members who want to truly give assistance to people who are \nunemployed and who need temporary assistance. But we don't want to turn \nit into a year-long program. If we did that, frankly, the trust fund \nwould be running out of money if another extension was passed. That \nwould be very foolhardy.\n  I also tell my colleagues that a budget point of order lies against \nSenator Kennedy's amendment. A germaneness point of order lies against \nSenator Kennedy's amendment. We should be trying to work to create \njobs. That is really the essence of what the President's proposal is--\nand the chairman of the Finance Committee--to help create jobs and not \njust write checks for the unemployed but create an environment that \nwill be more conducive towards investment, more conducive to encourage \npeople to make investments to create jobs. That is what we are trying \nto do.\n  We do that several different ways. One is to reduce tax rates. \nSomebody says that is a tax cut for the wealthy. I disagree. By the \ntime we are finished, the maximum rate is 35 percent. I believe that is \nstill more than a third--still a lot more than 31 percent--which was \nthe maximum rate when President Clinton was elected.\n  In 2001 they cut taxes for the wealthy and reduced the maximum rate \nfrom 39.6 to 38.6, 1 percentage point. President Clinton raised it, and \nmany in this Congress raised it from 31 percent to 39 in 1 year \nretroactive. By the time we are done, the rate is going to be 35 \npercent, which is still almost 20 percent higher than it was when \nPresident Clinton was elected.\n  I just want to make a few additional points. Also in the chairman's \nmark we have expensing for small business. They will be able to expense \nitems up to $75,000. We are looking to maybe even accelerate that \nsimilar to a provision in the House. That will create an incentive for \nsmall business so people can write off that investment in the year that \ninvestment is made instead of amortizing over years. That will create \njobs because more people will make that investment.\n\n  We are also talking about eliminating this very unfair double \ntaxation on dividends. Why should we tax distribution of corporate \nprofits at the second highest rate in the world? That makes no sense \nwhatsoever.\n  The President has proposed that we eliminate double taxation. \nPresident Carter said in the past we should eliminate the double \ntaxation of corporate dividends. I hope we will be able to do that, and \nI expect we will be presenting an amendment to enhance or strengthen \nthe dividend proposal that is before us today which would actually \neliminate the double taxation of dividends. We tax dividends now at the \nsecond highest rate in the world, higher than France, Belgium, and \nItaly. We don't need to do that. We can fix that in this bill today. By \ndoing so, we will be encouraging a much better environment for \ninvestment, and encourage, I think, a much greater prospect for the \nstock market. I think the stock market would improve substantially and \nas a result, therefore, there would be more equity, more equity \ninvestments, more private sector jobs. That ultimately should be our \ngoal.\n  I urge our colleagues not to be mislead by Senator Kennedy's \namendment. Let's pass a clean extension of the unemployment \ncompensation program. We can do that by unanimous consent. We passed \nthe previous one by unanimous consent, or we can have a recorded vote. \nWe can do that outside the reconciliation bill. We can do that and have \nit on the President's desk, and extend the present law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes off of the \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to respond to the Senator from \nOklahoma, and urge my colleagues to support the Kennedy amendment.\n  What are workers to do in terms of supporting their family if they \nexhaust the 39 weeks of unemployment insurance benefits that they are \neligible to receive? Senator Kennedy's answer is that under the current \ncircumstances we provide an additional 13 weeks of benefits.\n  The labor market is not improving. It is worsening. The unemployment \nrate is rising, not falling. This notion that there are jobs to be had \ndoes not square with the facts. The economy is continuing to lose jobs. \nWe lost 48,000 jobs last month. We have lost over half a million jobs \nalready this year. The unemployment report stated that almost 9 million \nworkers were unemployed in April. Just under 2 million workers have \nbeen unemployed for 27 weeks or more. The number of long-term \nunemployed is as high as its been since January 1993.\n  The average duration of unemployed has risen to 19.6 weeks. This is \nthe longest average duration reported during this recession, and it is \nthe highest level in almost 20 years. What are these people to do?\n  The Kennedy amendment is very simple. It says that providing some \ncontinued support for those who have lost their jobs through no fault \nof their own is more important than providing some\n\n[[Page S6191]]\n\nof these tax cuts that are proposed in this legislation.\n  It makes sense for the individuals, and it makes sense for the \neconomy. We are talking about trying to stimulate the economy. Extended \nunemployment insurance benefits are scheduled to stop and that will \nwithdraw that much purchasing power out of the economy.\n  So I urge my colleagues to be supportive of this amendment. We face a \nworsening economic situation. Unemployment is rising. The opportunities \nin the job market are shrinking. We need to provide help to our workers \nand to their families to help them through this very difficult period. \nThe Kennedy amendment seeks to do that.\n  The unemployment insurance trust funds have surpluses of almost $20 \nbillion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I yield myself 30 more seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The unemployment insurance trust funds have surpluses \nof approximately $20 billion. These moneys were paid into the trust \nfund for the announced purpose of paying unemployment insurance \nbenefits in an economic downturn. Now we have an economic downturn. We \nhave people out of work. We have the job market worsening, not \nimproving. These surpluses ought to be used for the purpose for which \nthey were intended; and that is, to provide extended unemployment \ninsurance benefits. And those benefits ought to come ahead of any of \nthe tax cuts.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Kennedy amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be temporarily set aside so the Senator from Washington can \noffer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 577\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 577.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Ms. Cantwell], for herself, \n     Mr. Nelson of Florida, and Mr. Baucus, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 577.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise today, along with my \ncolleagues, Senator Nelson of Florida and Senator Baucus, to offer an \namendment to revise and extend the research and development tax credit.\n  I know my colleagues will be familiar with this amendment, but I want \nto clarify three things this amendment does. First, it will extend the \nresearch credit through June 30, 2014, which is the end of this \nreconciliation period. Second, it will increase the rates of the \nalternative incremental credit; and third, it will create a new \nalternative simplified credit for qualified research expenses.\n  This language is identical to the language that was originally \nincluded in S. 664, introduced by Senator Hatch from Utah and \ncosponsored by 27 bipartisan Senators. The amendment pays for this tax \ncredit by eliminating the underlying legislation's section reducing the \ndividend tax credit.\n  Since its increment in 1981, the research tax credit, I believe, has \ndemonstrated that it is a powerful incentive for companies to increase \nresearch spending. The tax credit lowers the cost of doing research in \nthe United States, so it encourages companies to continue to make \ninvestments in critical R The bottom-line benefit is that research \nand development creates new jobs in the United States.\n  The current R tax credit is expected to expire on June 30, 2004. \nMany of my colleagues know we play this annual game of continuing to \nsay the R tax credit is important, but not renewing it on a permanent \nbasis, thereby saying to companies and organizations: You don't know \nwhether you will actually get this research credit or not. It is \nimportant for companies to have access to this information because the \nkind of planning it takes to do research and development, to increase \nproductivity in America, is not necessarily done in 1 year or 2 years. \nThe major investments in nanotechnology and biotechnology, in software, \nand in the computer sciences take several years of investments. So what \nwe are talking about is giving businesses the predictability they want \nto see in research and development so they can move ahead.\n  The long-term nature of these research projects, I believe, is \nsomething Congress should recognize today and make part of a priority \npackage for reinvigorating America. This is a tried and true program, \nagain, for creating jobs in America.\n  In this tax cut bill--we are trying something that is new, \neffectively saying, let's cut taxes on dividends for individuals, and \nhope it trickles down to create jobs in America. We know the R tax \ncredit works--it works, and it works effectively.\n  The point I want to make to my colleagues is, what we need to \nunderstand, is the changing nature of businesses today in an \ninformation economy. So many of the businesses that have been the great \nengines of growth in the 1990s are companies that now spend 27 percent \nof their overall dollars on research and development. So research and \ndevelopment has become a bigger percentage of a company's overall \nplans, and predictability about that research and development has \nbecome more important.\n  That is why two years ago Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan \nGreenspan told a Senate Budget Committee:\n\n       Had the innovations of recent decades, especially in \n     information technologies, not come to fruition, \n     productivity growth during the past five to seven years, \n     arguably, would have continued to languish at the rate of \n     the preceding twenty years.\n\n  So here was someone in charge of advising us on Federal investment \nand tax policy basically saying these companies have been able to \ninvest in R, and have gotten us to that productivity rate we are so \ninterested in. So why aren't we including that in this package--\nsomething we know is tried and true, something we know many \norganizations have come before us to argue for, asking, why not make \nthis permanent? So in my amendment, we expand that tax credit through \nJune 2014--which will help the economy turn around.\n  I would like to enter into the Record comments--I have no idea where \nmy colleague will be on this particular amendment, but I would like to \nenter into the Record, or reenter into the Record, I guess--comments \nfrom my colleague from Utah, who I think spoke eloquently on this \nparticular issue. As my colleague from Utah said:\n\n       As it stands, companies have to take account of the fact \n     that Congress could allow the credit lapse for a few months, \n     as it did a number of years ago. So companies hedge their \n     bets, they spend a little less on R, and our economy \n     suffers as a result. By contrast, permanence helps planning. \n     The sooner we make this permanent, the sooner companies can \n     begin to enlarge and expand their research and development \n     units, and the sooner their innovations will strengthen \n     economic growth.\n\n  He quoted a variety of studies that I think are very important. He \nwent on to say:\n\n       A permanent extension of this credit may seem costly in \n     terms of lost revenue. However, when you consider the value \n     this investment will create for our economy, it is a bargain. \n     In fact, one study estimates a permanent research credit \n     would result in our gross domestic product increasing by $10 \n     billion after 5 years and by $31 billion after 20 years.\n\n  The Senator is quoting a study and analysis of various economists who \nare saying this is really how we get to productivity in our economy. I \nam quoting the Senator because I believe in what he said.\n  I understand my colleagues may not think that now is the time for \nthis particular amendment. I argue that it is exactly the time for this \namendment because let's think about it. Who has created jobs in the \nlast decade? Who has stimulated our economy to move\n\n[[Page S6192]]\n\nforward? It is a lot of companies that have invested in R It is the \nMicrosofts. It is the Amazons. It is the variety of companies from my \nState and others that have made the investments which increase the \nproductivity of their workforce, where they can then hire new people as \nnew products and services are delivered.\n  That is something with which we have had good experience. I want to \nget back to 3.5-percent economic growth. I know the economic engine \nthat will take us there will be these companies and corporations that \nknow about producing product and services in an information age \neconomy. What they tell us is important to them, is making permanent \nthe R tax credit. They say this because there is currently no \ncertainty--they come to us every few years to try to understand whether \nwe are going to give them these tax credits.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a statement from the \nR Credit Coalition.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Research Equals Jobs Growth and Economic Growth\n\n\n  now is the time to strengthen and make permanent the r tax credit\n\n       Productivity growth in recent years has been driven by the \n     combination of accelerated technical progress and the \n     resultant investment in tangible capital assets, research and \n     development, human capital, and public infrastructure.\n       Technological innovations have accounted for more than one \n     third of our nation's economic growth during the last decade \n     and are critical to sustained growth in the future.\n       With government support, private investment in R would \n     fall short of the socially optimal amount. (Congressional \n     Research Service, ``Small Business Tax Relief: Selected \n     Economic Policy Issues for the 107th Congress'' (RL31052))\n       The research credit creates jobs. More than 90 percent of \n     the costs eligible for the credit are salaries and wages paid \n     to researchers. The only way for a company to increase its \n     credit is to increase its R payroll in the U.S.\n       First authorized in 1982, the credit has been reauthorized \n     8 times (with a gap from June 1995 to June 1996). The current \n     credit expires in June 2004. However, its effectiveness is \n     limited because businesses cannot rely on it in their long-\n     term planning, and most R projects are long-term.\n       In order to provide stability and broaden the reach of this \n     proven incentive, Congress should make the credit permanent, \n     increase the rate for the alternative incremental credit \n     (AIRC), and provide an alternative simplified credit \n     calculation to induce even more research-intensive businesses \n     to undertake additional research spending.\n       A bolstered and permanent R tax credit is essential to US \n     competitiveness. In a global economy, many companies can \n     choose where to conduct their R A 2000 study based on OECD \n     data that measures the impact of government fiscal support \n     for R shows that Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Canada, \n     Australia, and Japan each provide more generous--and \n     permanent--fiscal incentives for R investment than those \n     provided for by the United States.\n       Private investment in R results in new medicines, medical \n     technologies, cleaner manufacturing technologies, advanced \n     weapon systems and other tools in the war on terror.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. They write:\n\n       Growth in our high tech economy depends on solid R, and \n     there is no good reason to delay making the credit permanent. \n     A permanent tax credit will go a long way to providing the \n     planners and investors the certainty that they need.\n\n  Another document by that same coalition states that research jobs \nthat are created by this R are quite significant; that more than 90 \npercent of the costs eligible for credits from the R tax credit go \ndirectly into salary and wages of researchers. So the only way for the \ncompany to go ahead and increase the credit is to get an R payroll. \nThat is what we are talking about, getting the R payroll.\n  We are sitting here discussing how we are going to move forward. I \nknow my colleagues have a variety of ideas. We all probably have ideas \nthat we think are an avenue or path within this tax proposal that will \nbe effective. I know as somebody who has been in the private sector, \nhas seen a company grow from 10 people to 1,000 people in a short time, \nthe major focus of that company was in research and development.\n  Let's turn our attention to those very companies that we think are \nthe basis for our future. We still see great growth and opportunity in \nmedical devices and research. We see great opportunities in \nbiomedicines, as I mentioned, in nanosciences, in computing sciences, \nin supercomputing. We see great opportunity in energy technology, in \nthe new energy economy we think will be so important. We certainly see \nfrom the State of Washington how the great investment in software and \ncommunications technologies can move our country forward.\n  Let's take this amendment that I believe is a bipartisan amendment \nsupported by many of my colleagues and say that this is a priority. \nLet's not make these organizations, which have been the engine of job \ncreation, continue to come back to us as we pass the largest tax cut \nwithout including something that the very job creators have told us \nthey need to move forward.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Let's make the \nresearch and development tax credit permanent.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator from Washington yield me 10 minutes?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I yield the Senator from Montana as much time as he \nneeds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, the R tax credit has been an issue \nbefore us for quite some time, almost as long as I can remember since I \nhave been in the Senate. The basic questions are, Should we extend the \nR tax credit and, second, should we make it permanent? Much too often \nthe Congress has decided, yes, to extend the credit, which I agree \nwith, but not to make it permanent. For the life of me, I cannot \nunderstand why we have not made this credit permanent.\n  I have introduced legislation, bipartisan legislation, which Senator \nHatch and myself introduced, to make the R tax credit permanent. \nSimilar legislation has also been introduced in the other body by \nCongresswoman Nancy Johnson and Congressman Robert Matsui, along with \nother members of each of their parties. This is bicameral. It is \nbipartisan. We believe very strongly that the research and development \ntax credit should be made permanent. In fact, there are about 28 \nsponsors of our legislation in the Senate. It is about evenly divided \nbetween both sides.\n  I would like to make a couple of points. The very bottom line is, \nthis amendment will very much help the American economy. Making the R \ntax credit permanent will give U.S. businesses, particularly in the \ntechnology sector, the confidence that those companies can invest in \nresearch and development and not have to keep guessing whether Congress \nis going to extend or not extend this tax credit.\n  I can remember years past, sometimes we would extend it and other \ntimes the Congress would not extend the R tax credit. There would be \na hiatus. I have forgotten how long those gaps were, but, as I recall, \nthey were in the nature of 8 months, 10 months, something like that. \nTechnology companies were wondering, is Congress going to extend the \ncredit? They have in the past. Maybe they will in the future--but will \nthey? This causes great uncertainty in the business world.\n  The R tax credit has a proven track record. It lays the foundation \nfor technological innovation which in turn is an extremely important \ndriving force in the American economy.\n  Most economists look to productivity gains. When there are \nproductivity gains in the economy, the economy grows. When we have had \nhigh productivity gains, our economy has done quite well. In fact, it \nis important to recall the words of Chairman Alan Greenspan of the \nFederal Reserve who said, the reason why our economy has continued to \ngrow so well is because of advances in technology that occurred in \nAmerica and also in the world, which dramatically increased \nproductivity in our country. This is one of the main reasons the \neconomy grew at such a rapid rate in the 1990s.\n  Granted, some of that was, as the Chairman would say, irrational \nexuberance. There was a bubble in effect at the time. There were too \nmany people investing because the idea sounded good, without looking \nclosely and directly at the bottom line, whether it was a good \ninvestment or not. Nevertheless, it is very clear that technology was a \ndriving force in the 1990s.\n\n[[Page S6193]]\n\n  There is extensive research showing that tax credits are a very cost-\neffective way to promote research and development. The General \nAccounting Office, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Congressional \nResearch Service, the National Bureau of Economic Research, and many \nothers have found significant evidence that the R credit stimulates \nadditional domestic R spending by U.S. companies. Perhaps more \nimportantly, the R investment tax credit benefits American companies \nand American workers.\n  A full 75 percent of the R credit dollars are used for salaries of \nemployees associated with R activities. These are good paying jobs. \nThese are not service industry jobs at the local fast food store. These \nare very high paying jobs.\n  Seventy-five percent of the R tax credit dollars are used for \nsalaried employees associated with R activities. R activity creates \nsome of the most intellectual, stimulating, high-paying, high-skilled \njobs in the country, encouraging individuals to pursue advanced science \nand math degrees in order to obtain these job opportunities. That \nclearly is a big plus for our economy. They create more disposable \nincome for employees which provides additional indirect returns to the \neconomy.\n  There are ripple effects. Innovations achieved through R make a \ncompany much more productive, enhances its competitiveness. Downstream \ncompanies are also helped. Once a company develops a new product \nbecause of research, in most cases, downstream companies get benefits \nas well--to say nothing of the national security benefits. The more our \ntechnology companies engage in research and development, the more \nlikely it is that we are going to have technological advances and \ndevelopments that help our national security. That, too, is a given.\n  There is no doubt that if R is going to decrease generally, \nnational security is also going to decline. Did you know that the \nUnited States lags far behind other countries in giving incentives to \nbusinesses to invest within its own borders? Most of our trading \npartners offer very generous tax and nontax incentives to encourage \ncompanies in their countries to invest in R These incentives lower \nthe cost of investing in R outside of the United States and give \ncompanies receiving these benefits outside the United States a \ncompetitive advantage over U.S. companies that don't benefit from \nsimilar incentives.\n  In 2000, the United States ranked ninth behind other nations, in \nterms of the amount of tax credit allowances for business R spending \nat large manufacturing firms. Countries that provide more generous R \ntax benefits than the United States include Spain, Canada, Portugal, \nAustria, Australia, the Netherlands, France, and Korea.\n  This disparity encourages U.S. companies to locate more R \nactivities offshore, resulting in a permanent loss of technology \nadvancements, loss of jobs, and a loss of industrial innovation in the \nUnited States. Once R moves offshore because of other countries \ngiving a tax comparative advantage, then what happens? Then companies \ntend to manufacture in those same locations and often use available \nlabor in those markets, rather than American workers. Once you are in a \nlocation for a period of time, you are more likely to stay. You learn \nthe procedures and the ropes and you feel comfortable. The country \nstarts to be comfortable with you and they start giving you more \nincentives to stay there. It starts to cascade and go downhill.\n  I remember years ago, in Saudi Arabia, I was talking to officials \nthere, and the big question was, Who is going to provide the technical \nadvice in setting up a phone system in Saudi Arabia? Is there going to \nbe a big German company, such as Siemens, or an American firm? Which \nfirm will provide the technological specifications for a telephone \nsystem in Saudi Arabia? Well, guess what happened. A U.S. company lost; \nthe big German company won. What is even more important about that? \nGuess who built the telephone system? You got it, the German company.\n  In this case, I am talking generally about R going offshore. Once \nyour foot is in the door offshore, there is a strong likelihood that \nthere are going to be other benefits that will accrue to those other \ncountries, not to the United States.\n\n  The timing of this proposal is very important. There is new data \ncompiled for R Magazine that projects that U.S. companies spending on \nR will be mostly flat this year, 2003. This makes for flat growth for \nthe second year in a row. This compares with 2001, when R spending \ngrew by 5 percent over the previous year. Investment in R is not a \nfunction of simply economic uncertainty. Businesses often invest less \nin R because of the expense and the long-term planning requirements \nand the difficulty of capturing all or some of the returns from the \ninvestments.\n  Many economists generally agree that without government support, \nprivate sector investment in R often falls short of the optimal level \nof spending necessary to provide maximum benefits to the U.S. economy. \nThere has to be some government assistance. I might add that other \ncountries certainly provide a lot more government assistance to their \ncompanies than we Americans do for our own U.S.-based companies--at \nleast in the area of R\n  One can debate the degree to which there should be any government \nsupport to the private sector. I believe there should be support in \nsome cases. In this case, when it comes to R, it is clear that we \nwant to maintain productivity advantages, technological advantages, and \ngood jobs for American workers. We want to be as competitive as we can \nbe in the world because that benefits the United States not only in the \nshort term, but very much in the longer term.\n  Investments by U.S. businesses in research and development can prove \nvery costly over time. Leading edge competitors in Europe and Japan \ncontinue to gain ground.\n  To sum up, we are presented with a great opportunity. What is it? \nThat opportunity is to make our current R tax credit permanent--at \nleast as much as we can under the constraints of the bill; second, we \nalso have an opportunity to modify the tax credit to include the \nadditions suggested by the Senator from Washington that will make the \ncredit even more meaningful, including the incremental changes in the \ncredit rates and the addition of a third credit option that is in this \nlegislation.\n  Madam President, this is a no-brainer. I cannot, for the life of me, \nunderstand why this amendment won't pass. That is not just a glib \nstatement that rolls easily off my tongue into the Senate Chamber. I \njust think that if the tradeoff is between research and development on \nthe one hand, and helping American companies with more incentives to do \nmore R on the other hand, compared with the accelerating reduction of \nthe top rate or, in the alternative, of the dividends proposal, we have \nto make choices as to which is more likely to help this country get \nmore jobs in the short term and in the long term.\n  I think the answer to that question is pretty easy and clear, and \nthat answer is by making the R tax credit permanent. So I argue very \nstrongly in favor of this legislation and this amendment offered by the \nSenator from Washington. She is on the right track. I think we should \npay attention to what she says. She is from Washington. The State of \nWashington is the home to a lot of high-tech companies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair and I thank my good friend from \nWashington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, first of all, I think it is pretty \nunanimous in this body about the need for the R tax credit, and I \nthink it enjoys pretty broad support. I suppose it is not a case of \n``if'' we will do it; it is a case of ``when'' and exactly how. I would \nsay there is probably not much disagreement within this body yet. I \nhave visited with my colleagues so much during this debate about the \npurposes of the legislation and the balance that we brought to this \nbetween investment and enhancing consumer spending, and between those \nthings that are tax reductions versus tax expenditures, it is this \nbalance that I want to preserve in this legislation.\n  Every attempt we have had, as well intended as it is, obviously, \ntakes away\n\n[[Page S6194]]\n\nfrom the job creation aspects of our tax reduction. It is to do \nsomething special and, in many cases, is worthy, but it detracts from \nthe overall approach to our legislation. So this is another example \nwhere I must rise in opposition to an amendment, but not because of the \ngood intent or because I have a disagreement with the amendment, but \nbecause of how it is accomplished. And most of that is on the side of \nwhere they take the money to pay for the proposal in this amendment, or \nany other amendment that we have had before us.\n  I am very confident that we will extend the R credit this year. I \ncall the attention of my colleagues to the fact that the President has \nproposed extending it in his budget. I note that the extension is paid \nfor in this amendment by eliminating partial exclusion of dividends, \nand this exclusion of dividends is meant to encourage the investment we \nare talking about here.\n  Obviously, the amendment on R is a tax incentive to encourage R, \nand it takes a lot of R to get jobs, but it is a very indirect way of \ncreating jobs, whereas we believe the dividend exclusion, at least if \nit were fully implemented the way the President proposed, and I know \nour underlying legislation does not do that, but at least the way the \nPresident proposed, according to economists, would create 400,000 new \njobs, besides making our capital costs for our industry much more \ncompetitive with those of our competition internationally because our \ncost of capital is as high as that of any nation with which we compete.\n  If we were to adopt the President's program, it would put us in the \nmiddle of the advanced nations for cost of capital and make us much \nmore competitive.\n  This detracts from the investment efforts in our legislation which is \nwhere the money is being taken to pay for the R amendment.\n  I say to the Senator from Washington that I look forward to working \nwith her at another time--not this time--to extend the R credit down \nthe road.\n  There is another point that should be made about the R credit, and \nthat is that it does not benefit all businesses and taxpayers equally \nor apply as broadly as do the provisions of this underlying growth bill \nthat I have been trying to demonstrate is a well-balanced bill to \ncreate jobs. It is well balanced between larger businesses and smaller \nbusinesses, particularly where it brings equity between a corporation \nform of business and individual proprietorship form of business. It \ndoes that by eliminating the bias in favor of corporations that is in \nour present tax system.\n  I look at R credit as not benefiting all businesses equally as our \nunderlying bill does. The R credit provides a benefit to a limited \nnumber of large corporations in certain industrial sectors. While the \npurpose of the R credit is very important, as it encourages higher \nlevels of technology development and innovation which brings about \ngreater productivity, it does not help small businesses that will \nprovide so many new jobs for the economy under our underlying \nlegislation.\n  I ask the Senator from Washington to think about whether or not she \nhas checked with organizations or their tax representatives that \nsupport R credits. I think the last thing they would want to happen \nis for the extension to lose at this time. If they want their \nextension--and I am sure they do, and I have indicated a willingness to \nwork on this--they should be working with the Finance Committee and not \nagainst it as we try to accomplish this goal.\n  Right now, I have to consider this amendment counterproductive in \nthat it slashes job-creating provisions to give generous tax breaks to \nlarge corporations to do research and development. Many may ask: Why do \nrich corporations need a tax break to do something that is essential to \ntheir business anyway?\n  As I indicated, I do support the R tax credit, but I also support, \nmore importantly and more eminently, the provisions of this bill which \nare more broad based in helping to create jobs and doing it in a \nbalanced way, not in the targeted way of this amendment.\n\n  There is nothing wrong with the amendment. It is just the wrong time \nand wrong place. I ask my colleagues to vote against it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I have the utmost respect for the Senator from Iowa \nand his comments about the R tax credit amendment and his great work \non trying to put together a package to bring before the Senate. It is \nclear that my colleague from Iowa has had a tough challenge working \nwith a variety of people, and I am sure he will face an even tougher \nchallenge working in conference with the House of Representatives and \nthe White House on their priorities.\n  I respect his commitment to working on the R tax credit expansion \nor permanency and I take him at his word that he is very earnest and \nwill work towards this.\n  I guess the reason we are bringing this up today is that we do have a \nfundamental difference about how to move forward with the economy and \nwhere the White House is on this proposal. What I am trying to say is \nnot extension of R, but permanent R tax credits are a better \neconomic stimulus than what the current underlying proposal gives to \nthe American public.\n  Let's think about it: A dividend tax cut that would give some money \nback to investors who may or may not reinvest that versus companies \nthat have proven they have taken the R tax credit and turned that \ninto new products and services, and have hired people to, in fact, do \nthe R which we are talking about. I think we can easily look at \nhistory and say corporations have done a better job of that because \nthey know what products and services can be created in the marketplace \nand have used this incentive to do that.\n  The second point I wish to make is that small businesses can take \nadvantage of this credit. In fact, in the past decade we saw a lot of \nincreases in productivity by large corporations because they were able \nto take advantage of research and development and new technologies, and \nthey were able to deploy that, while small businesses that had less \nflexibility, not as much revenue, and had smaller operations had a much \nharder time making those productivity improvements.\n  I have heard from small businesses throughout our State that said: I \nam a subcontractor, or I do business with some of the larger companies \nin the State, but our computer systems and our software do not \ncommunicate. The way I now have to talk to my customers and providers \nof service I work with throughout the State is being challenged by new \nsystems and operations, and I need to upgrade and move forward. So \nsmall businesses, to maintain their competitive edge, also need help in \nthe research and development area.\n  Oftentimes it is the small business that is created prior to becoming \na large organization. As I said, the companies that grow from 10 jobs \nand take advantage of R tax credits and then grow to 1,000 jobs are \nthe very companies about which we are talking. So both small and large \ncompanies will benefit.\n  The third point is that this is about priorities. In an information \neconomy, it is very important for us to keep our deficits down and to \nget access to capital.\n  Think about it. In the industrial age, when we were making \nautomobiles, Mr. Ford said: Just give me the hands. I do not even need \nthe brain that goes with it.\n  Why? Because it was about a manufacturing process, that was not \nnecessarily about the worker, and the increase in productivity. The \nprocess and system had been set in place.\n  Well, the information age is just the opposite of that. It is all \nabout new ideas in a global economy where information flows quickly and \ncompetition is created quickly, and whether we are going to maintain \nour competitive edge by making the right levels of R investment.\n  Actually, the U.S. economy is so strong in biotechnology, in \npharmaceuticals, and in software. Why? Because we make the investment \nin R that keeps that technological advantage in an information age.\n  So while some of my colleagues, argue that a dividend tax break is an \nissue of fairness, I say there are lots of things about our Tax Code \nthat I do not think are particularly fair. But\n\n[[Page S6195]]\n\ngiven the 7 percent unemployment rate in my State of Washington, with \nover 2 million jobs lost and no sight of what we are going to do to \nstimulate the economy that will create jobs, it is imperative to make \nthis tax credit permanent now.\n  My colleague has offered to look at this at another time. But the \nissue is, are we going to make it permanent at another time? In an \ninformation age this is the best thing we could do for companies that \nare spending almost 30 percent of their company's overall expenses in \nR An information economy means so many new products and services are \ngoing to come into creativity by thousands of ideas floating around, \nthings that we never even imagined before--who thought 20 years ago we \nwere going to be buying our books online or communicating with global \nmedia through the Internet? But those are the products and services \nthat have been created. The good news is we are at the infancy of this \ninformation age. So let's take advantage of that. Let's harness that \ninformation age economy with one of the best tools we have to encourage \nthem, and that is make permanent the R tax credits so those products, \nthose services, those job-creating activities, will take place in our \neconomy.\n  If we asked economists, or asked businesspeople, sure, they would \nlike both. I am sure there are people who would say: Give us the \ndividend and give us the R tax credit. But ask them to prioritize, \nand I have no doubt they would say the R tax credit is more important \nbecause they know it will give them certainty and predictability in a \ntime and age where research and development is going to be the way for \nus to continue the productivity.\n  Make no mistake, that opportunity for productivity is great. We had \ngreat increases during the industrial age--a constant 3\\1/2\\, 4, 5 \npercent economic growth in the last decade. If we harness the ability \nfor new products and services by making the right level of investment \nin research and development, we can have that kind of productivity \nincrease and we can have that kind of GDP.\n  For all of us here, we want to get back to that. We want to get back \nto having families who have jobs and communities that are healthy and a \ngovernment that can own up to its responsibilities in the future for \nSocial Security and Medicare. So let's make the investment now.\n  This is about making a priority statement today. It is about saying \nthat R tax credit has a higher priority and ranking over some of the \nproposals that are in this bill, and that it will benefit both small \nand large companies, and ultimately will benefit many Americans by \ngetting them employed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip is recognized.\n  Mr. REID.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To accelerate the elimination of the marriage penalty in the \n                         earned income credit)\n\n       After section 107, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 107A. ACCELERATION OF MARRIAGE PENALTY RELIEF FOR EARNED \n                   INCOME CREDIT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 32(b)(2)(B) (relating to joint \n     returns) is amended by striking ```increased by--'' and all \n     that follows and inserting ``increased by $3,000.''.\n       (b) Inflation Adjustment.--Clause (ii) of section 32( \n     j)(1)(B) (relating to inflation adjustments) is amended to \n     read as follows:\n       ``(ii) in the case of the $3,000 amount in subsection \n     (b)(2)(B), by substituting `calendar year 2003' for `calendar \n     year 1992' in subparagraph (B) of such section 1.''.\n       (c) Conforming Amendment.--Section 303(i)(2) of the \n     Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 is \n     amended by striking ``2004'' and inserting ``2003''.\n       (d) Adjustment of Highest Individual Income Tax Rate.--In \n     lieu of the rate specified for taxable years beginning during \n     calendar year 2003 and thereafter in the last column of the \n     table contained in section 1(i)(2) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986, as amended by section 102(a), the Secretary of \n     the Treasury shall adjust such rate for 1 or more of such \n     taxable years to provide such revenues as are necessary to \n     equal the loss in revenues which would result in the \n     enactment of the amendments made by subsections (a), (b), and \n     (c) of this section.\n       (e) Effective Dates.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the \n     amendments made by this section shall apply to taxable years \n     beginning after December 31, 2002.\n       (2) Conforming amendment.--The amendment made by subsection \n     (c) shall take effect on January 1, 2003.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, when we passed the last big tax \npackage in 2001, we included in the bill a title called ``Marriage \nPenalty Relief.''\n  That title had three sections aimed at easing the burden faced by \ntaxpayers, who find themselves paying higher tax bills after they get \nmarried than what they would have paid if they had stayed single.\n  One of these provisions increased the standard deduction for married \ntaxpayers, so that it would equal twice the amount of the standard \ndeduction allowed single taxpayers, making marriage an advantage.\n  The second provision increased the size of the 15 percent income tax \nrate bracket for a married couple to twice the size of the \ncorresponding bracket for a single taxpayer.\n  The third provision addressed the marriage penalty in earned income \ntax credit, and provided for a larger credit for married couples. All \nthree of these provisions were phased in gradually, not becoming fully \neffective until 2008 or 2009.\n  The bill under consideration today accelerates the scheduled phase-in \nof two of the three marriage penalty relief provisions we adopted in \n2001.\n  The standard deduction marriage penalty relief is accelerated to \n2003. And the expansion of the 15 percent rate bracket for married \ncouples is similarly accelerated to 2003.\n  There is no acceleration, however, of the marriage penalty relief for \ntaxpayers who claim the earned income tax credit. The earned income tax \ncredit, the EITC, provides an income supplement for low-income workers.\n  It is one of the Nation's most effective anti-poverty programs. It \nwas the brainchild of the late Senator Russell Long, whose death we \nsadly recognized yesterday, who characterized it as a ``work bonus'' \nand Senator Long called it one of his proudest accomplishments.\n  However, the way the EITC is presently structured can result in high \nmarriage penalties. Two single, low-income workers may be entitled to a \nmuch smaller EITC from their combined incomes when they get married \nthan what they would have gotten separately had they stayed single.\n  Take, for example, a man and a woman, each with an income of $15,000, \nand each with one child. If they are single, each can claim an EITC \nbenefit of roughly $2,750, a total of $5,500.\n  However, if they get married and combine their incomes, the EITC that \nthey can claim is only $1,200. This is a marriage penalty of $4,300, 14 \npercent of their combined income.\n\n  Think of a young couple who finds they have an unexpected pregnancy. \nIf they get married, they have to pay an additional $4,300 in taxes. \nThat is not a very good situation.\n  The 2001 tax bill addresses this problem by increasing the EITC \nallowed to married low-income taxpayers. But this provision is \ngradually phased-in and does not become fully effective until 2008. So \nwe have a gap.\n  My amendment calls for acceleration of the phase-in of the EITC \nmarriage penalty relief. It will benefit working families with incomes \nbetween $15,000 and $37,000.\n  I propose to pay for this amendment by paring back the reduction in \nthe top rate in an amount sufficient to pay for this amendment. This \nwould mean a relatively modest decrease in the reduction in that top \nrate. We believe it is less than one-quarter of 1 percent.\n\n[[Page S6196]]\n\n  I have been involved in trying to fix the problems of the marriage \npenalty since the 1970s, when I co-sponsored the first bill with \nCongresswomen Millicent Fenwick, who was a pioneer in fighting this \nproblem. I would like to remember her.\n  If we are going to accelerate marriage penalty relief, we should do \nit for the poorest of the poor. These people really feet the effects of \nthe marriage penalty.\n  In testimony before the Senate Finance Committee two years ago, a \nrepresentative from H. and R. Block, which prepares returns for many \nlow-income taxpayers, expressed the opinion that the EITC marriage \npenalty had a real detrimental effect on the choices of low-income \ntaxpayers.\n  In other words, it deters marriage and adversely affects family life.\n  The EITC marriage penalty relief is also the most effective economic \nstimulus of any of the marriage penalty relief provisions. It is \ntargeted at low- and middle-income workers, who are most likely to \nspend any additional funds.\n  A considerable amount of this bill is targeted to help the very \nrichest taxpayers. Roughly $35 billion goes towards reduction of the \ntop income tax bracket, which doesn't kick in until a couple's income \nis over $300,000.\n  Another $80 billion goes toward the exclusion for dividends, which \nwill not affect most taxpayers. In my state of Vermont, about seventy \npercent of the taxpayers have no dividend income.\n  My amendment is modest. It costs about $4 billion over several years. \nWe can make room for this amendment in this bill. We should not \noverlook those who need help the most.\n  I urge my fellow senators to support this amendment, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding the Senator has completed debate on \nthis amendment.\n  I recognize the Senator from Kentucky, who, as the gentleman he is, \nvery graciously allowed the Senator from Vermont to go first.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my \nremarks, Senator Bunning be recognized to offer an amendment for \nhimself, Senator McConnell, and others, regarding taxation of Social \nSecurity benefits; provided further that there be 1 hour equally \ndivided in the usual form. I further ask consent that following the \nconclusion of time, the amendments be set aside and the Senate proceed \nto vote in relation to the Bunning amendment, to be followed by a vote \nin relation to the Dorgan amendment, No. 556, at a time determined by \nthe majority leader, after consultation with the Democratic leader; \nfurther, that no amendments be in order to the amendments prior to the \nvotes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent when the Senate resumes \nconsideration at 9:15 of S. 1054, on Thursday, May 15, that all time \nunder the statutory limit be expired; I further ask consent that the \nSenate then proceed to a series of stacked votes on or in relation to \nthe pending amendments in the order offered, beginning with the Bunning \namendment, provided that there be 2 minutes equally divided for closing \nremarks prior to vote in relation to any of the amendments pending from \nWednesday's session.\n  I further ask consent that following the disposition of the pending \namendments and any other offered amendments, the bill then be read a \nthird time, the Senate then proceed to the consideration of H.R. 2, all \nafter the enacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 1054, as \namended, if amended, be inserted in lieu thereof, the bill then be read \na third time and the Senate then proceed to a vote on passage of the \nbill, with no intervening action or debate. I further ask consent that \nfollowing that vote, the Senate insist on its amendment, request a \nconference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to appoint \nconferees on the part of the Senate with a ratio of 3 to 2. Finally, I \nask consent no points of order be waived by this agreement.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. As I said earlier this morning, we have two of the most \nexperienced Senators that we have in the Senate managing this bill. We \nwould not be at the point we are today but for the good work of the two \nSenators, the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Montana. It \ndoesn't matter how you feel about the underlying bill, the work that \nhas been done on the floor by these two men here today has been \noutstanding, and that is why we are able to enter into this agreement. \nThere is no objection on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nfollowing passage of H.R. 2, the Senate proceed to Calendar No. 86, \nH.R. 1298, the Global AIDS bill. I further ask unanimous consent that \nonly relevant first-degree amendments be in order; further, that only \nsecond-degree amendments which are relevant to the first-degree \namendment to which they are offered, when offered, be in order; that \nupon disposition of all amendments the bill, as amended, if amended, be \nread a third time and the Senate then vote on passage of the bill \nwithout further intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, just to summarize very quickly, let me \nrestate what the assistant Democratic leader said. A lot of discipline \nand organization has taken us very successfully to this point. We \nencourage people who are going to be offering amendments either tonight \nor tomorrow to report that and discuss that with the two managers of \nthe bill.\n  At 9:15 tomorrow morning, all time will have been exhausted and we \nwill start at 9:15 with our voting on whatever pending amendments there \nare based on what has been carried out so far today and tonight. We \nwill be looking at those amendments starting at 9:15 in the morning. If \nadditional amendments arise, they will be considered after the \ndisposition of all of the pending amendments. We will have final \nconsideration and passage of this bill tomorrow at the conclusion of \nthat sequence of votes.\n  Immediately following passage, we will go to the global HIV-AIDS \nbill, and I intend to complete that bill this week as well.\n  Thus, tonight we expect no further rollcall votes and our voting will \nbegin at 9:15 sharp tomorrow morning.\n\n[[Page S6197]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. One area of clarification: I am confident there is no \nproblem. We want to make sure motions to waive would also be in order \non these amendments that are pending.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we understand that. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nKentucky is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 589\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n  The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Bunning], for himself and Mr. \nMcConnell, proposes an amendment numbered 589.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal the 1993 \n            income tax increase on Social Security benefits)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n\n sense of the senate on repealing the 1993 tax hike on social security \n                          benefits section   .\n\n     SECTION   .\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       The 1993 tax on Social Security benefits was imposed as \n     part of President Clinton's agenda to raise taxes;\n       The original 1993 tax hike on Social Security benefits was \n     to raise income taxes on Social Security retirees with as \n     little as $25,000 of income;\n       Repeated efforts to repeal the 1993 tax hike on Social \n     Security benefits have failed; and\n       Seniors rely on Social Security benefits as well as \n     dividend income to fund their retirement and they should have \n     taxes reduced on both sources of income:\n       (b) Sense of the Senate--\n       It is the Sense of the Senate that the Senate Finance \n     Committee should report out the Social Security Benefits Tax \n     Relief Act of 2003, S. 514, to repeal the tax on seniors not \n     later than July 31, 2003, and the Senate shall consider such \n     bill not later than September 30, 2003 in a manner consistent \n     with the preservation of the Medicare Trust Fund.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I am offering an amendment as a sense of \nthe Senate on the Social Security tax; that the 85-percent tax repeal \nbe set at a certain time during the year 2003 and final consideration \nof the bill be no later than September 30, 2003. I want to bring the \nSenate up to date on this specific tax.\n  Prior to 1993, seniors were taxed on 50 percent of their Social \nSecurity benefits if their incomes were above a certain level. This \nmoney went back into the Social Security System. In 1993, Congress \npassed a provision requiring that 85 percent of a senior's Social \nSecurity benefits be taxed if certain income levels were met. This \nadditional money went back into the Medicare system. This tax was \nunfair to seniors back in 1993, and it certainly is unfair today.\n  The amendment I am offering as a sense of the Senate allows the \nFinance Committee to pass legislation by July 31, 2003, which repeals \nthis unfair tax to our seniors and requires the Senate to act on this \nlegislation no later than September 30, 2003.\n  I am offering this amendment to counter an amendment that would \ndestroy the very bill that is before us. An unwise amendment by the \nSenator from North Dakota would repeal this tax and thus reduce the \namount of tax reduction for our country and for our citizens.\n  I want to try to put this in a little perspective for the American \npeople, for my fellow Senators, and you, Mr. President.\n  In the overall aspects of the budget bill, the total amount as far as \nthis bill is concerned is a reduction of $350 billion in tax \nreductions. Our economy is a $10 trillion-per-year economy. How \nminuscule is the tax reduction? If you look at the overall bill as a \n10-year bill, and the overall economy as a 10-year economy, we are \nlooking at about $120 trillion, and we are talking about $350 billion \nin that $120 trillion economy as a tax reduction.\n  If the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota is agreed to, we \nwill have no tax reduction, not even a dividend tax reduction, as \nminuscule as it is, and not any of the advanced tax reductions we \npassed in the year 2001.\n  If we want to take action to create jobs, and if we want to do it as \nquickly as we can, my amendment allows us to vote on the reduction in \nthe Social Security tax from 85 percent to 50 percent later on--after \nwe get this job-creating incentive bill into conference, out of the \nSenate, and back to the floor of the Senate for a final vote.\n  I want you to know that seniors age 65 and older depend on taxable \ndividends. These are real Americans who need this money because they \nare on fixed incomes. They have to scramble and scrimp to have enough \ndollars to live on fixed incomes. This will allow just a portion of \nthat dividend income to be tax free. Seventy-one percent of all taxable \ndividends go to Americans who are over age 55. With the rising cost of \nprescription drugs, seniors depend on this income from dividends. If we \ncan make just a little bit of it tax free, that will be a big help for \nthose senior citizens--15 percent of seniors' total income, but 50 \npercent of dividend income in this country comes to those senior \ncitizens.\n  Under the President's package, 99.8 million seniors would have saved \n$936 a year. That was the President's proposal. We cut that more than \nin half.\n  I just think it is a wrongheaded way to approach the reduction of \nthis ominous tax on senior citizens, particularly those who definitely \nhave no other income except Social Security.\n  I hope the Senate will consider this as a sense of the Senate to make \nsure we get to this bill before the end of this legislative calendar.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I commend my friend and colleague from \nKentucky, Senator Bunning, for his excellent amendment.\n  What we are hearing from the other side of the aisle is that they do \nnot want the dividend exclusion, and they want to finally address an \nissue they created 10 years ago, which is this additional tax on Social \nSecurity recipients. But they are saying, you can't have both. And, as \nthe Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Bunning, has pointed out, most seniors \ncan benefit from both. Obviously, they all benefit from Social \nSecurity, and they would like to not have this Clinton tax on Social \nSecurity continued any longer; second, seniors account for only 15 \npercent of the total income in America, but they get 50 percent of the \ndividend income.\n  So I gather what Senator Dorgan is saying is, we are going to take \naway the dividend exclusion from seniors in order to finally reduce the \nSocial Security tax which we put on 10 years ago.\n  What the Senator from Kentucky is saying is: We want to do both. And \nwe ought to do both. We should never have levied this Social Security \ntax in the first place, 10 years ago, for which neither of us voted. \nAnd we ought to now do the dividend exclusion as close to the \nPresident's suggested manner of doing that as possible.\n  June could be a pretty good month for seniors around here. If we \ncould get the dividend exclusion through, get rid of the Social \nSecurity tax, and begin to address prescription drugs, which is on the \nagenda of the majority leader for June, I say to my friend and \ncolleague from Kentucky, we would have a pretty good month around here \nfor seniors, pretty soon, wouldn't we?\n  Mr. BUNNING. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So this Bunning amendment makes it clear that we would \nlike to act on the repeal of the Social Security tax hike of 1993, and \nwe will do that in the very near future.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield to my friend from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. As the Senator knows, I offered this very same amendment \non the budget bill to repeal the Social Security tax from 85 percent to \n50 percent, and the very same people who would support that today voted \nunanimously against it on the budget bill.\n  So the inconsistency that the Senator from North Dakota shows today \nis something I have a very big problem understanding. If you are for it \ntoday, and you want to take these away from seniors, and you also want \nto take tax away from seniors, you ought to have been consistent and \nvoted to take it away during the budget resolution debate we had on the \nfloor.\n\n[[Page S6198]]\n\n  I know this Senator voted with me on the budget resolution when we \ntried to repeal it. And I hope we are able to get this amendment \naccepted.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I know the Senator from Kentucky agrees with me that \nwe ought to do all three. We ought to get rid of this Clinton Social \nSecurity tax. We ought to do a significant dividend exclusion that is, \nto the maximum extent possible, permitted under our overall ceiling in \nthe growth package. And we ought to begin to address prescription \ndrugs, which the leader has indicated we are going to do in June. If we \ndo those three things, I would say we are well on the way to providing \nthe kinds of relief for seniors--both on the tax side and on the \nprescription drug side--that they richly deserve, that we have talked \nabout for entirely too long around here and have never done anything \nabout.\n  So let me conclude by commending my friend and colleague from \nKentucky for an excellent amendment. I hope it will be approved \noverwhelmingly. I thank him for his continuing contribution to this \nwhole Social Security debate. The Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Bunning, \nwas the chairman of the Social Security Subcommittee of the House Ways \nand Means Committee and is now on the Senate Finance Committee, and is \none of the real experts on Social Security in America.\n  When Senator Bunning talks about Social Security, we all listen, and \nonce again he has proposed an excellent idea which I fully support. I \nthank him and commend him for his outstanding work.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I think the Democrats have the next \nopportunity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Bunning amendment is pending. There is 1 \nhour evenly divided.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I understand Senator Bunning yields back his time.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Yes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes on the amendment to \nSenator Rockefeller.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Thank you, Mr. President, and I thank my friend and \nleader from Montana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 578\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak about an amendment which was offered \nearlier. I am particularly proud to be cosponsoring, with Senator \nBlanche Lincoln of Arkansas, and others, improvements to the child tax \ncredit. I will speak on it very briefly.\n  I think it is one of the most valuable provisions. I thank the \nchairman of the Finance Committee--while I see he is still in the \nChamber--for accepting one of Senator Lincoln's amendments on the child \ntax credit. It is a particularly welcome addition.\n  I think common sense tells us that if we put money in the hands of \npeople who will indeed spend it, and will spend it on clothes and \nkitchen utensils, and all kinds of other items, there is a stimulative \neffect.\n  But quite apart from that, almost half of the benefits of this child \ntax credit go to families who make less than $50,000. In the State that \nI represent--this Senator represents the State of West Virginia--only \n20 percent of the people make more than $50,000 a year. So this is very \nwelcome.\n\n  The bill we are looking at, what is in the package, makes very \nimportant improvements to the child tax credit. Basically, it increases \nthe value of the credit from $600 to $1,000, which is real money, as \nthey say, for real people, who need it and deserve it.\n  I was happy that we did this. I was grateful that it was accepted by \nthe Finance Committee chairman. It is going to have a big effect.\n  I will say this: Refundability will go from 10 percent to 15 percent \nof earnings above $10,500. That means families can benefit from this \nbill more than otherwise would have been the case. On the other hand, \nthe bill still does not do anything--and I have to say this in \nfairness--for 72,000 kids who do not qualify for any child tax credit \nin West Virginia because their parents do not have enough income to \nqualify on a low-income basis.\n  But all things being equal, as they rarely are in this life, one has \nto take what one can work out in the democratic process. And the \nFinance chairman was extremely fair and helpful. Obviously, the Senator \nfrom Arkansas was outstanding in her leadership on these matters.\n  I am proud to a be a cosponsor of the amendment that Senator Lincoln \noffered today that will expand the reach of the child tax credit to \nmore of our nation's poorest families. In my own state, 27,000 more \nkids would qualify for the child tax credit. This amendment would \nincrease the amount of the child tax credit that can be refunded to low \nincome parents. Specifically a parent would qualify for a child tax \ncredit equal to 5% of earnings between $5,000 and $13,250.\n  These folks whom we are helping are at risk. That is important. And I \nam very proud this is happening. I ask my colleagues to support this \namendment when it comes up for a vote on tomorrow.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Montana \nwhatever time he might consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \noffered by Senator Bunning be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 593\n\n   (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow the \n  expensing of broadband Internet access expenditures, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to this \nbill, and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Burns], for himself, Mr. \n     Rockefeller, Mr. Baucus, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Johnson, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 593.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today with an amendment \nthat is offered by Senator Rockefeller and myself that provides some \nincentives to accelerate the deployment of broadband high-speed \nInternet access across the country. There are other cosponsors of the \namendment. My colleague from Montana, Senator Baucus, is a cosponsor. \nSenators Clinton, Kennedy, and Johnson of South Dakota also are \ncosponsors.\n  Broadband has always been of interest to both Senator Rockefeller and \nmyself. Both of us serve on the Commerce Committee. We have worked on \nthis a lot. We both represent States that have quite a lot of rural \noutdoors. What this amendment does is affords tax incentives for the \nbuildout of broadband. Although many urban and suburban areas now have \naccess to broadband connections, many rural areas across the country \nand, of course, in Montana do not. That places rural areas at a \ndisadvantage in a number of ways.\n  Just for economics, why should folks in rural areas be denied access \nto the Internet, or the Internet economy as some would say, just \nbecause they live where they do to merchandise and to exchange ideas in \nthis economy and find some way to supplement their primary income? We \nhave people who market their grain and livestock every day through the \ncommodity markets around the world. In terms of educational \nopportunities in rural areas, why should a young person, just because \nhe is born in Garfield County, MT, be denied the same educational \nopportunities as those who were born and raised in the more urban areas \nwhere their curriculum is broadly taught.\n\n[[Page S6199]]\n\nThese young folks deserve the same opportunity. Distance learning is an \nimportant part of the education system in rural areas. Broadband is the \ntechnology that takes them those distances.\n  In the area of health care, I have 14 counties in Montana that do not \nhave a doctor. People receive their health care from physician \nassistants and in other ways. We know from rural demographics that the \nfolks are getting older, so our health care for the elderly is very \nimportant, and part of that is supplied by broadband technologies.\n  Our amendment would create a temporary tax incentive for providers in \nthe form of expensing, allowing an immediate deduction of a capital \nexpenditure in the first year of service rather than depreciating that \ninvestment over time. In the case of the current generation broadband \ninvestments in rural and underserved areas, the bill would allow a 50 \npercent expensing on the investment, with the rest to be depreciated \naccording to the normal depreciation schedules. And where the providers \nbuild out next generation broadband networks, which are typically more \nexpensive, the bill would provide for 100 percent expensing in that \nyear.\n  Our amendment would have a tremendous impact on the economy. In fact, \nwe know it would. For instance, Robert Crandall, an economist at the \nBrookings Institute, has estimated that accelerated deployment of \nbroadband would generate $500 billion in economic growth annually. I \nthink we would all be delighted to have that happen. I believe we \nshould take the steps to allow it to do so. This amendment is a very \nimportant step in that direction.\n  This is an opportune time to take advantage of such a provision. \nCurrently South Korea and Japan are ahead of the United States in \nbroadband deployment. I believe it is extremely important that the \nUnited States avoid falling behind in telecom and Internet technology, \nand the financial incentive of the type provided by this legislation \nwill help us ensure that we will not.\n\n  As we take a look at this issue, this means new technologies on the \nwired system but also on the wireless system. It says technology \nneutral, which means it allows the new technologies that are being \noffered and the R work going on with new technologies, it allows \nthose technologies to be deployed and taken advantage of. Just \nremember, 50 percent expensing for investments in rural and underserved \nareas of current generation broadband technologies. It provides 100 \npercent expensing for the investments in the next generation of \nbroadband technologies in rural areas.\n  It is technology neutral. It makes no difference if you are using a \nmedium copper wire, coaxial cable, optical fiber terrestrial wireless, \nsatellite or something else. If you deliver the threshold speeds, you \nare eligible for the benefit. And it sunsets after 1 year. The intent \nis not to provide a permanent benefit to the telecom sector but, \nrather, an incentive to build out new infrastructure within a short \nperiod of time.\n  Think of the generation of business and our economic setup and the \njobs and the job climate in that area in the first year of deployment. \nIt is a very important amendment. Not only do we deliver better and \nquicker services to rural America, but we put a lot of people to work.\n  I hope more of our colleagues will join with Senator Rockefeller and \nme in supporting it, and I hope we can work with Senator Grassley to \ninclude this in the jobs and growth package.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add as cosponsors of the \namendment Senators Baucus, Clinton, Kennedy, and Johnson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I rise in support of the amendment offered by Senator Burns and a \nnumber of others. This is an amendment I have been working on for many \nyears. At times it has had 75 cosponsors. It is one of those amendments \nthat always comes up. Everybody knows it should get done and it never \nseems to. The answer to that is you keep trying. You just keep trying.\n  For individuals, businesses, schools, libraries, hospitals, there is \nno end to the need for this amendment. We did the E-rate. The E-rate is \nstill being done. But we all know we have moved past that. We need much \nfaster telecommunications now.\n  What the Burns-Rockefeller broadband amendment does is it says to \nbroadband providers, if you will extend your networks to hard-to-reach, \nunderserved and/or rural areas, you will get a break on your taxes. As \nthe distinguished Senator from Montana indicated, it also encourages a \nleapfrog to the next generation. It has two different categories of tax \nbreaks depending upon what generation of broadband you are dealing \nwith. In any event, it is going to be faster than the DSL and cable \nmodem services most typical today.\n  The best thing is to say that you don't obviously get a tax credit \nunless you make a whole lot of things happen in this amendment. There \nis nothing automatic about it. You have to make an investment. You have \nto buy new equipment. You have to pay people to install that new \nequipment.\n  I am very pleased to join with my friend from Montana in what I think \ncan very well be described as the future competitiveness of America. He \nmentioned South Korea and Japan. He is absolutely right. We all \nremember what happened with the VCR. We had it all, then all of a \nsudden we had none of it. We do not want this to happen in the most \nimportant form of telecommunications. I hope my colleagues will support \nthe Burns amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I urge the Senate to support this \namendment to accelerate broadband high-speed Internet access across the \ncountry. The widespread availability of broadband technology is \nessential to maintaining our technology leadership in the world.\n  The spread of the information revolution to rural communities and \nunderserved areas in our cities depends on affordable access to the \nInternet. For too long, these regions have been unable to enter the \ninformation age because of their location and the high cost of making \nservice available. One of our greatest challenges is to close this \ngrowing economic gap in access to computers and the Internet. If we do \nnot act to close it now, the ``digital divide'' will soon become an \nunacceptable opportunity gap.\n  The broadband tax incentive is an important step in developing a \nnational broadband policy. The incentive has widespread support in \nCongress because it goes to those who bring broadband to places beyond \nthe current reach of the private sector.\n  Many of us joined our colleague, Senator Moynihan, when he first \nintroduced legislation along these lines 3 years ago. Last year, the \nbill had 65 cosponsors from both sides of the aisle, and a companion \nbill in the House had 227 cosponsors. Our colleagues clearly support \nthis idea, and we hope that it will be enacted.\n  In Massachusetts, I have seen how broadband has transformed the \neconomy of the entire Berkshire County region in the western part of \nthe State. Like many rural areas across the Nation, the Berkshires were \nnot an area that could easily attract private investments in Internet \naccess. But business and government leaders worked out an initiative \ncalled Berkshire Connect, a partnership with Internet providers to \nbuild a multimillion-dollar network of microwave towers and fiberoptic \nlines linking the county's villages and small cities with fast Internet \naccess.\n  That project put the Berkshires on a more equal footing with the rest \nof the global marketplace because the Internet helps to level the \nplaying field between large and small businesses and rural and urban \nareas. I am confident that passage of the broadband tax incentive will \nbring similar success stories across the Nation for residents and \nbusinesses.\n  Another prime broadband application is telemedicine. A fascinating \nmoment occurred in medicine 2 years ago when a surgeon in New York \noperated by remote control on a patient in France using robot arms at \nthe patient's location, and the operation was successful. Broadband \ntechnology can enhance the medical miracles, but it needs a very high \nbandwidth connection for those kinds of applications. You can't perform \nremote-control surgery over a narrowband connection.\n\n[[Page S6200]]\n\n  Broadband's potential is immense, and I commend my colleagues from \nMontana and West Virginia for their leadership. This is the kind of tax \nincentive we need, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma \nsuch time as he may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my friend and colleague from Iowa for his \nleadership and chairmanship of the committee. I am going to briefly \ndescribe an amendment that Senator Kyl and myself, Senator Grassley, \nSenator Lott, and several others will be offering tomorrow to enhance \nthe dividend portion of this bill. The dividend portion that we now \nhave in the bill is for 10 years; $500 per person would be excluded \nfrom taxation, plus for the first 5 years, an additional 10 percent; in \nthe second 5 years, an additional 20 percent on top of 500.\n\n  I stated publicly that I think that leaves a lot to be desired. So \nthe amendment we will be offering tomorrow will enhance that, improve \nthat. It would say for all taxpayers, for dividend exclusion, our \neffort is to eliminate double taxation of dividends. Unfortunately, we \nfind ourselves presently where we tax dividends more than almost any \nother country in the world. Now we are, as a free enterprise, as \ncapitalistic as anybody in the world, but we tax the distribution of \nprofits, i.e., dividends from corporations, higher than almost anybody, \ni.e., dividends, higher than Great Britain, France, and Italy. Japan is \nbasically tied with us.\n  We tax dividends at 35 percent of the corporate level and whatever \nthe individual taxpayer's rate is. So if the taxpayer is at 38.6, it is \nthat amount plus 35. So their tax is 73 percent; almost three-fourths \nof the distribution of profits is taxed. That makes no sense.\n  Many people, including President Jimmy Carter, said that is wrong and \nit needs to be changed. I believe several people--Democrats and \nRepublicans--have said that is unfair and is too high of a tax and it \nneeds to be fixed. Now we have a President who said we should fix it. \nThere are different ways of doing it. He is proposing that we exclude \nit from income for individuals.\n  Unfortunately, the bill that came out of the Finance Committee didn't \ndo that. It said let's exclude the first $500 for individuals plus 10 \npercent, then 20 percent. I think we can do a lot more. I think we can \ndo a lot better. If we do a lot better, we will have a much more \npositive impact on the stock market and on the economy. When I say the \nstock market, certainly I believe what we are proposing will have a \nsignificant increase on the stock market--maybe 10, 15, 20 percent. \nThat is positive and real. Why would that be? If somebody is investing \nin stock under present law and they own a company and they get a \ndistribution and it is taxed on top of being taxed at the corporate \nlevel, they may realize it is not a very good investment. A lot of \npeople buy growth stocks that pay very little, if any, in dividends \nbecause they don't want to go through this scenario. They don't want to \npay capital gains.\n  The House at least said let's tax capital gains and stock dividends \nequally. They reported out a bill and said let's tax capital gains and \nstocks at 15 percent; and for some lower incomes, maybe lower than \nthat, at 5 percent. That is a significant step in the right direction. \nThe President said let's eliminate double taxation of dividends.\n  The proposal we are going to be offering tomorrow says let's do that. \nIn year 2003, let's exclude 50 percent. In year 2004, 2005, and 2006--\nfor the next 3 years--let's make it 100 percent. We can do that. Then \nwe sunset it. This is sunset after 4 years. If I am wrong and the stock \nmarket doesn't react positively--if it is not a positive thing, we will \nknow it after 4 years. It makes sense to try it. The President has a \nproposal and many economists have said you should eliminate double \ntaxation of dividends, and this is a way of doing it. We can do it.\n  We will have a provision, also as part of this amendment, to adopt \nthe House provision dealing with expensing items. You might say, what \ndoes that mean? The present law is that a small business that invests \nbasically $200,000 or less per year can expense $25,000. The Finance \nCommittee said let's raise that to $75,000 and allow people with a much \ngreater income to qualify as a small business. They said let's triple \nthat, up to $75,000, and we will do that for 10 years.\n\n  The House said let's try this, make it $100,000, and do it for 5 \nyears. In other words, if a business wanted to write off 100 percent of \ntheir investments, up to $100,000, they could do so if it is done in \nthe first 5 years. It doesn't cost much over 10 years because it \nsunsets after 5 years. Somebody might say we did that when we did the \nbonus depreciation and it generated positive economic investment. This \nis another way of encouraging small business, and we increase the level \nup to $400,000 for this 5-year period. That is what the House has done. \nThe House passed it. I think there is wisdom there. Every once in a \nwhile, we can say they did something right and we can emulate it. I \nthink they have a good provision.\n  I used to be a small businessperson. I owned a janitorial service, \nand I used to have a manufacturing company. I believe these provisions \nwill create jobs. So we are proposing in our amendment that we adopt \nthe House expensing provision, the so-called section 179. And they also \nhave created a new dividend proposal that will have a 50-percent \nexclusion in 2003 and 100 percent in the years 2004, 2005, and 2006.\n  I thank my friend and colleague, Senator Kyl, and several other \nmembers, Democrats and Republicans, who have had significant input. I \nbelieve it will help make a significant economic impact.\n  When you step back and say, what are we doing in the bill that will \nhelp the economy, shake it up, improve it, and create jobs, I believe \nthe two things I mentioned, in addition to the acceleration of rates, \nare the three things that will positively create jobs, have a positive \nimpact on the stock market, on wealth, investment, and will encourage \npeople to make investments, get money out of banks or CDs that are not \npaying any interest to speak of and put it to work, help it create \njobs. I believe all three of these provisions will do so.\n  I am speaking tonight before it is introduced because it looks as if \nall debate should be transpired on the amendments tonight because we \nare going to have significant votes tomorrow. I thank my colleague \nagain, the chairman of the committee, for his work and cooperation, for \nhis leadership on this bill, and for his support in helping us to try \nto come up with a more robust package that would create more jobs in \nthe process. That is what we are trying to do--have a jobs creation \nbill. I think by adopting this amendment tomorrow we will help improve \nit dramatically.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set the \npending amendment aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 594\n\n (Purpose: To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to enhance \nbeneficiary access to quality health care services in rural areas under \n                         the medicare program)\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 594.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I put before you not a tax amendment, \nbut I am addressing a funding crisis that affects rural America. I am \ntalking about the issue of Medicare.\n  We have heard a lot about relief to States and about Medicaid during \nthis debate, and legitimately so. But there has been no discussion of \nthe role Medicare plays in keeping our health care infrastructure \nstrong in rural States like mine.\n  Today, our rural health infrastructure is falling apart. Hospitals \nand home health agencies in rural areas lose money on every Medicare \npatient they see. Services are being slashed\n\n[[Page S6201]]\n\nand staff are being cut, all to make ends meet and keep the facility \nopen--but not to keep it open with the quality of care that ought to be \nthere, or to meet necessarily all the needs of the community.\n  Medicare formulas penalize rural physicians in 30 States by reducing \ntheir payments below those of their urban counterparts for the very \nsame service. Small physician clinics, and especially solo \npractitioners, who are facing rising malpractice premiums on top of the \nMedicare formula inequities are on the verge of closing up shop. My \namendment takes important steps toward correcting geographic \ndisparities that penalize rural health care providers.\n  I will summarize some of the key provisions of the amendment. On \nhospitals, we eliminate the disparity between large urban hospitals and \nsmall urban and rural hospitals by equalizing inpatient-based payment. \nThe hospitals in my State and in other rural areas are paid 1.6 percent \nless on every discharge. That is a $14 million loss every year in my \nState.\n  We received bipartisan support to temporarily end this inequity in \nthe fiscal year 2003 omnibus appropriations bill, but it is time to end \nthis inequity in a permanent way.\n  We also revise the labor share of the wage index for inpatient \nhospitals. The wage index calculation is killing our hospitals in rural \nareas. They have to compete with larger hospitals in the big cities for \nthe same small pool of nurses and physicians. But because of the \ninequity in the wage index, these hospitals are not able to offer the \nkinds of salaries and benefits that attract health care workers. This \namendment would reduce the labor share of the wage index from 71 \npercent to 62 percent.\n  We strengthen and improve the Critical Access Hospital Program which \nhas been so successful in keeping open the doors of some of our most \nremote hospitals. We also create a low volume adjustment for those \nsmall rural hospitals that are not able to benefit from the Critical \nAccess Hospital Program. These hospital corrections are not partisan \nrhetoric. They are supported by the nonpartisan Medicare Payment \nAdvisory Committee, by the CMS administrator in a recent letter to the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee, and by 31 bipartisan Members of the \nSenate rural health caucus.\n  For doctors, my amendment ends once and for all the penalty Medicare \nimposes on doctors who choose to practice in rural areas of our \ncountry. Medicare adjusts payments to doctors downward based on where \nthey live, but, in fact, the value of a physician's service is the same \nin Brooklyn, IA, as it is in Brooklyn, NY, but the Medicare formula \ndoes not think so. My amendment changes that and sets a floor for all \nphysician payments that will end the negative adjustment doctors in \nIowa and 30 other States currently face.\n  My bill also provides assistance to other rural health care \nproviders, such as ambulance services and home health agencies which \nmillions of seniors in rural areas rely on every day.\n  Providers in rural States, such as Iowa, practice some of the lowest \ncost, highest quality medicine in the country. This is widely \nunderstood by researchers, academics, and citizens of those States, but \nit is not recognized by the impersonal formulas of Medicare. Medicare \ninstead rewards providers in high-cost, inefficient States with bigger \npayments that have the perverse effect of incentivizing overutilization \nof services and also poor quality.\n  My legislation is paid for not by taking resources away from our \ngrowth and jobs package, nor by taking money away from those high-cost \nStates that I mentioned, but by other modifications to the Medicare \nProgram that make good policy sense.\n  I want to emphasize that because every other amendment we have had \nbefore the Senate today has taken money out of the tax package to spend \nsomeplace else. My amendment does not affect the tax provisions of this \nlegislation.\n  This amendment represents a fair and balanced approach to improving \nequity in rural America. I urge my colleagues to support its adoption \ntoday. For those of us from rural States, our doctors, hospitals, and \nwhole communities are counting on us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield such time as the Senator from Maine may \nconsume.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I believe we are about to have an \nagreement on the order for proceeding, but I need to consult with my \ncolleagues, so I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time for that purpose?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Senator from Maine suggested the absence of a \nquorum.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask that time be taken equally from \nboth sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, under the rules, as I understand them, the \nauthor of the amendment has control of her time, which is 1 hour.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendments be laid aside so \nthat the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, may offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask if the Senator can yield me 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I inform the Senator from Iowa that he has \n1 hour.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate that. I will not take an hour.\n  Parliamentary inquiry: The Senator asked that the amendments be set \naside; right?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 595\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Mr. President, I will speak to my amendment in a moment. \nBefore I do, I wish to make preliminary comments about the tax bill \nbefore us which the President and the Republicans have called a jobs \nand growth package and they say it is to grow the economy. I certainly \nagree that the economy is in dire straits and we are in desperate need \nof taking action. That is true.\n  Since President Bush took office, the United States has lost 2.6 \nmillion jobs, more than 36,000 of those in my State of Iowa. \nUnemployment rates, including long-term unemployment rates, continue to \nrise. That is a fact. The economy is in a shambles. Unemployment \ncontinues to go up. This is not just some academic process. It is \ncausing real hardship for millions of Americans and families who are \nwithout a job and without health care coverage.\n  Senator Specter and I had a hearing in our appropriations \nsubcommittee talking about the lack of access and affordability of \nhealth care. You can read the story of the man who testified, Mr. \nKurilko. He was referred to in the Wall Street Journal. He is 57 years \nold, worked 37 years on a job. He now has a heart problem, diabetes. He \nis out of a job. He and his wife now face the prospect of losing their \nlife savings because his health care costs, just for insurance, are \nover $2,000 a month. This is a man who worked in a blue-collar job, a \nsteel mill, all of his life.\n  That is what is happening in America today. Families without work, \nand the high cost of health care, go without coverage, and they see \ntheir life savings vanishing before their eyes.\n  We see it affecting other areas of our economy, our families, and our \nStates. The tuition fees in Iowa have increased sharply at our public \nuniversities. However, the tuition does not make up for the shortfall \nin the loss of State funding. We are seeing cuts to critical public \nhealth initiatives, including those that help indigent dialysis \npatients, and a program that helps immunize low-income kids.\n  Public schools in Iowa have cut 350 teachers statewide. Schools are \nforced to share nurses and counselors and eliminate programs such as \nmusic and art and enrichment classes entirely from their schools.\n  In our hearing this morning, we had a teacher from a small school in \nIowa testify. The cost just in her school district for health care \ncoverage went up 61.5 percent over the last year.\n  As he said, they are now approaching the point where their health \ncare costs are going to equal the salary of a first-year teacher. So \nthis is the real America that is happening in my State, in every State, \nto people who have worked all their lives and now do not have any \nhealth care coverage. Our schools are being cut. Our infrastructure is \ndeteriorating in this country, as well as our bridges, roads, sewer, \nand water systems.\n  What is the answer before us for growth and jobs in our economy? An \nenormous tax cut, in large part for the wealthy in our country. That is \nthe answer. If I believed this tax bill before us would help the \neconomy, create the jobs we need, and help provide health care \ncoverage, I would be all for it. But the fact is, we have tried this \nbefore.\n  In 1981, under President Reagan, we had a supposedly big supply side \ncut in taxes. We lost 1.3 million jobs in the two years after the \npassage of that bill. Then OMB Director David Stockman called it a \nriverboat gamble. Guess what. Working Americans all over this country \nlost that gamble. In 1982, part of that measure was reversed and the \nFederal Reserve sharply dropped interest rates allowing for things to \nstart to get better.\n  After much hard work in the 1990s, we passed a bill in 1993 that put \nus on the path towards a balanced budget, restored confidence and \ncreating 22 million jobs. Productivity went up. It was a bill with a \npolicy totally out of line with the supply side philosophy of the 1981 \nbill. Almost every Republican senator predicted that the economy would \nbe severely hurt. The economy grew, and 6.5 million jobs were created \nin just the first two years after that bill passed. The United States \nenjoyed 40 consecutive months of unemployment below 5 percent.\n  Twenty years after 1981, we had another supply side riverboat gamble \nin front of us. President Bush assured the country in 2001 that\n\n       We can proceed with tax relief without fear of budget \n     deficits, even if the economy softens.\n\n  And on another occasion, he said\n\n       A tax cut now will stimulate the economy and create jobs.\n\n  Yet what we are now facing, almost two years after the passage of \nthat measure is a loss of another 1.8 million jobs to our economy.\n  The President, and the Republicans, passed a $1.3 billion tax cut \nlike the one we are considering today. It was targeted to the \nwealthiest. Unfortunately, the President's predictions were dead wrong. \nI want to get this chart back up. Two years after the 1981 bill, we \nlost 1.3 million jobs. Since the 2001 tax bill was passed 20 years \nlater, we have lost 1.8 million jobs in almost 2 years.\n  Now, 22 years after the first try, we are going to try it again. It \nis not enough that the riverboat gamble failed in 1981. It is not \nenough that it failed in 2001. By gosh, we are going to try it again, \nfolks--another riverboat gamble. One would think history would teach us \nsomething.\n  If history does not, then how about some of the economists and what \nthey are saying. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said:\n\n       There is no question that as deficits go up, contrary to \n     what some have said, it does affect long-term interest rates. \n     It does have a negative impact on the economy . . .\n\n  He twice testified before Congress in opposition to the tax cut plan, \nwarning that these deficits would stunt long-term growth. Ten Nobel \nlaureates and 400 other economists disagree with the President's \napproach. In a statement made February 10 of this year, they wrote:\n\n       Regardless of how one views the specifics of the Bush plan, \n     there is wide agreement that its purpose is a permanent \n     change in the tax structure and not the creation of jobs and \n     growth in the near term.\n\n  The economists also said that:\n\n       Passing these tax cuts will worsen the long-term budget \n     outlook, adding to the nation's projected chronic deficits. \n     This fiscal deterioration will reduce the capacity of the \n     government to finance Social Security and Medicare benefits, \n     as well as investments in schools, health, infrastructure, \n     and basic research. Moreover, the proposed tax cuts will \n     generate further inequities in after-tax income.\n\n  That is what these 400 economists said.\n  What we are talking about is fairness. We want fairness in the Tax \nCode. We want fairness to the working families of America in how they \nare taxed and who pays the burden in this country.\n  Every time we talk about fairness, President Bush says, class \nwarfare. Why is fairness class warfare? Why is it in President Bush's \nhead that if we try to have fairness in the Tax Code, he thinks it is \nclass warfare?\n  That is what this is about. It is about basic fairness. We have tried \nit before. It failed horribly, and yet I guess we are going to do it \nagain.\n  Why should we do this? Why should we go against the advice of some of \nthe most renowned economists and why should we go against what we know \nfrom history? Why take a risky gamble when people's lives are at stake? \nWhy take a risky gamble when 9 million Americans cannot find jobs?\n  If I were out of work, I would want my representatives in Washington \nto do what has been proven to grow the economy, proven to create jobs, \nnot what has twice proven to fail.\n  In fact, the more I think about this tax bill before us, I think of \nBill Bennett. It is like a gambling addiction, putting $500 in the slot \nmachine and\n\n[[Page S6203]]\n\npulling the handle. That is what this tax bill is like. It is like \nputting $500 in and pulling the handle and hoping he hits it. Now we \nknow that Mr. Bennett did not hit it. He lost millions of dollars over \nseveral years of gambling.\n  That is what this bill is like. It is a riverboat gamble, like David \nStockman called it in the 1980s.\n  I am getting to my amendment now, and there is an interesting \ncomparison I wanted to make on Medicare. How much does the plan before \nus cost? Well, when we throw out figures of billions of dollars, eyes \nsort of glaze over. No one can understand exactly how much money that \nis. So I thought I might compare it.\n  The President's plan if made permanent costs more than the entire 75-\nyear shortfall in both Social Security and Medicare, about 1.8 percent \nof GDP. The Bush tax cuts made permanent over a 75-year period will \namount to 2.3 percent to 2.7 percent of GDP.\n  We hear all the talk about the shortfall we are going to have in \nSocial Security and Medicare when the baby-boomers retire, and that we \nhave to do something about it. Here is your answer: The Bush plan will \ncost more than the shortfall in Social Security and Medicare. Think \nabout it. Are we going to have this riverboat gamble, a tax cut that \nbasically benefits the wealthiest in our society, when we could be \nusing this to secure Social Security and Medicare for 75 years? But \nmaybe that is what this is all about.\n  It was Newt Gingrich, after all, who said that they--the \nRepublicans--wanted to have Medicare ``wither on the vine.'' Maybe that \nis what this is all about. Pass this tax cut, reward the wealthiest in \nour society, and when it comes time to do something about Social \nSecurity and Medicare, we will not have enough money. Maybe that is \nwhat it is all about.\n  That is not what we should be about. We should be about a jobs and \ngrowth bill that helps the working families of America. We ought to be \nabout a bill to help secure Medicare and Social Security for the baby \nboomers. One of the ways we can do this is by making sure we have \nequity in the Medicare system. The amendment I sent to the desk will \nhelp do that by making sure we have better equity in the Social \nSecurity system and Medicare system.\n  I tried to listen as my colleague from Iowa offered his amendment. I \ndid not receive a copy of it earlier, so I did not have a chance to \nlook at it. I heard some of the things that my colleague from Iowa was \ntalking about in terms of helping right some of the wrongs in Medicare \nto provide for less disparity under Medicare.\n  Most of what I heard I agree with. I think a number of the provisions \nin Senator Grassley's Medicare amendment are similar to provisions in \nmy amendment. I commend him for that.\n  However, his amendment uses a different offset. I don't know exactly \nwhat that is. I plan to analyze it overnight. It may have some merit, I \ndon't know. Both are trying to help rural hospitals and providers. I \nhope we can work together to get that done sometime this year.\n  Basically, what my amendment would do is, say, if the Congress does \nnot pass legislation by December 31, 2003 then the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services would promulgate regulations by December 31, 2004. \nWe would have to enact additional legislation. If none passed, the \nSecretary would have to act by the end of 2004. Those regulation \nchanges would have to have the following parts:\n  One, to equalize urban and rural base payment rate. This increases \nthe rate for all hospitals in cities below one million people.\n  Two, improve the Medicare incentive payment program to ensure that \nbonus payments are made on behalf of all eligible physicians; three, my \namendment would eliminate the Medicare DSH cap. The current cap \ndisproportionately hurts rural states; four, it would establish a \nMedicare inpatient hospital bonus payment for hospitals with low \nMedicare patient volumes; five, it would adjust the Medicare inpatient \nhospital prospective wage index to revise the labor-related share of \nsuch index to account for 62 percent of such index. Currently, payments \nare 71 percent based on labor costs. I heard Senator Grassley's \namendment did the same thing; next, reinstate a bonus payment to home \nhealth care providers in rural areas. A 10 percent bonus has expired \nand this would reinstate it. Next adjust the work GPCI to no less than \n1 for physicians; lastly, this amendment I am offering would say we \nwould have a hold harmless clause that whatever we do could not result \nin the lower level of reimbursement for a health care provider under \ntitle XVIII, that such provider would have received but for the \nenactment or these of this amendment or these regulations.\n  The offset I used would be to limit, to put a cap on any tax \ndeductions for dividend income not to exceed $500. In other words, you \ncould get an exclusion of up to $500 on dividends in terms of a tax \nbenefit, but no more than that. That offset would fully pay to make \nsure our hospitals in Iowa or Washington State--I know Washington is \nvery low on the payment schedule--Montana, other States, make sure that \nwe have an equalization so the Medicare payments in those States are \nnot so skewed as they are right now.\n\n  We can get this done simply by capping at $500 the tax benefits under \nthe present bill before the Senate on dividends. It seems to me that \nwould be a small price for the wealthiest in our country to pay to make \nsure we had a working Medicare system that was fair to all.\n  In closing, regarding the tax bill, do we take a risky gamble as we \nhave before, sort of a Bill Bennett gamble, as I have said, pull the \nhandle on the slot machine and hope something comes up? Or do we go \nwith proven methods to grow the economy and create jobs? Do we break \nthe bank on tax cuts for the wealthy or do we invest in education? Do \nwe break the bank on dividend tax breaks or do we cap them and use that \noffset as a way of helping equalize Medicare payments in our States? Do \nwe break the bank on tax cuts for the rich or help families afford \ncollege tuition? Do we break the bank on tax cuts for the rich or do we \nhelp families afford health care coverage? Do we break the bank on tax \ncuts for the rich or do we keep Social Security secure? Do we break the \nbank on tax cuts for the rich or do we keep Medicare benefits intact? \nDo we break the bank on tax cuts for the rich or do we start to work on \nhaving smaller deficits?\n  These are our choices. The choice is clear. This bill needs some \nserious amendments. There will be a number of amendments offered and, \nquite frankly, if some of the amendments are accepted, maybe the bill \nwould be worthy of support. As the bill sits right now, the bill must \nbe opposed, unless we can adopt some of these amendments that I think \nwould make it, A, more fair and equitable, and B, to make sure we \ninvest in the long-term security of Social Security and Medicare.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator has 39 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Parliamentary inquiry, Madam President: In terms of the \ntime, can this time be reserved?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It can be reserved for use today.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, before we move on with the next \namendment, I think it would be accurate for me to say that the speech \nby my good colleague from the State of Iowa emphasizes the difference \nof philosophy I have tried to emphasize that our bill tries versus \nother approaches. These are honest, faithfully held ideas about the \nrole of the Government in our society.\n  The alternatives my colleague from Iowa has given--tax cuts on the \none hand, or spending money on the other hand--is exactly the point I \nhave been trying to make of whether or not the resources of this \ncountry should go through the Federal Treasury and have 535 Members of \nCongress divide them up, keep taxes high in the process, or whether it \nis better to reduce taxes to create jobs and create the jobs by leaving \nthe money in the hands of 110 million taxpayers making their own \nindividual decisions; the dynamics of our free market system respond \nvery well to that. Money that is spent by individuals or invested by \nindividuals turns over in the economy many more times than it does if I \nmake a decision on how that is spent.\n\n[[Page S6204]]\n\n  Some believe, as evidenced by the recent speech, it is better to have \nhigher levels of taxation, bring the money through the Federal Treasury \nand decide how to spend it. The other approach is that we will, as we \ndo through this bill, give tax reduction with the taxpayers of this \ncountry deciding on investing and spending, or both, and enhancing the \neconomy that way and creating jobs.\n\n  Another goal of this bill is to bring taxation of the people of this \ncountry within the band that it has been for about 50 or 60 years, of \nabout 17 percent or 19 percent of the resources of this Nation coming \nto the Federal Government for us to finance programs and to make \ndecisions on how that will be spent. About 17 to 19 percent of the \ngross domestic product has generally, over 40 years, been taxed. In \nrecent years that has gotten as high as 21 percent, as high as it was \nin World War II, so the highest in peacetime history.\n  This tax bill, besides the motive of creating jobs, is to bring the \nlevel of taxation down so it falls within that historic band, based on \ntwo propositions. One is it is a level of taxation that has not been so \nhigh to be harmful to our economy and to our people, because our \ncountry has advanced tremendously well with the Federal Government \noperating within that band of deciding how to allocate 17 percent to 19 \npercent of our resources. The other is it is a level of taxation that \nhas been accepted by the people of the United States.\n  Some of them would say it is still too high, but I guess I would have \nto say over the long haul I have not heard too much complaint about the \nlevel of taxation that has existed over that long period of time of 17 \npercent to 19 percent.\n  So I do not find fault with anything my colleague from Iowa said. He \nis expressing one very legitimate philosophy of government and the \nfinancing of that government and the distribution of resources and \nhaving that done by political decision. I am expressing another \nphilosophy of government shared by some Democrats and hopefully by a \nlot of Republicans, that a level of taxation can get so high it hurts \nthe economy, and the way to enhance the economy and grow the economy is \nto let people have a lower level of taxation.\n  Another way to say it is if we have any budget problems and any \ndeficit problems, they are not related to the undertaxation of the \nAmerican people. They are related to the overspending by the Congress.\n  Now we move on to another issue. But before I yield whatever time she \nmight consume to the Senator from Maine, we are adopting policy with \nher amendment, in a bipartisan way, that is unrelated to the policy \nthat is in the bill. That is because as chairman of the committee, \nresponding to the people in my committee, both Republicans and \nDemocrats, as well as responding to people outside the committee as \nrepresented by Senator Collins and Senator Nelson of Nebraska, there \nwas a desire to have more people involved with the policy of how to \nmeet the needs of the States through some State aid. So we have \ndeliberately left kind of a vacuum in this legislation that is now \ngoing to be filled by the good work of Senator Collins and Senator \nNelson off the committee, and by Senator Rockefeller and others on my \ncommittee. I commend them for their hard work.\n  There is an awful lot of compromise that has gone into this product \nand I am proud to be affiliated with this product. But the product is \nnot mine, because it was my determined effort to leave it to people who \nhave worked on this issue for about 2 years now. For about 2 years \npeople have been promoting this concept. I compliment them for their \nstick-to-it-iveness. Tonight proves that hard work pays off.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, let me begin by thanking the \ndistinguished chairman of the Senate Finance Committee for his hard \nwork.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, if I might ask the Senator to yield just \nfor the sake of orderly process here in the Senate, as I understand it, \nthe Senator means to offer her amendment. Is that correct?\n  Ms. COLLINS. That is correct.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Technically, as I understand it, we should put aside \npending amendments.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I was about to ask.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent the Harkin amendment and the \namendment by Senator Grassley be temporarily set aside, as well as the \nother amendments, so the Senator from Maine can offer her amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 596\n\n     (Purpose: To provide temporary State and local fiscal relief)\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to amendment No. 596, which is a Collins-Rockefeller-Nelson, et \nal, amendment, regarding State aid, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins] for herself, Mr. \n     Rockefeller, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Smith, Mr. Schumer, \n     Mr. Coleman, Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Wyden, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 596.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nOf Amendments.'')\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I was beginning with my thank-yous to \nthe distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, who has worked so \nhard to produce not only the bill on the floor but also has worked very \nclosely with the sponsors of this amendment to come up with a proposal \nfor fiscal aid to the States that I believe is carefully drafted and is \ngoing to make a real difference to the 49 States that are struggling to \nclose budget shortfalls.\n  I am pleased to have a number of cosponsors, including Senators \nRockefeller, Ben Nelson, Smith, Schumer, Coleman, Clinton, Murray, and \nWyden. But I particularly want to pay tribute to Senator Ben Nelson and \nSenator Rockefeller, who have worked night and day with not only \nSenator Grassley and myself but others interested in this issue to \nforge a compromise that I think will result, at the end of the day, in \nthe conference report with $20 billion in much needed fiscal relief for \nour States.\n\n  Half of this funding would be through a temporary increase in the \nFederal Medicaid share, to ensure that States can continue to protect \nmillions of vulnerable Americans who rely on the Medicaid program as \npart of the health care safety net.\n  The attacks of September 11, coupled with the subsequent recession \nand resulting unemployment, have placed tremendous and unanticipated \nstrains on State budgets. The States are, after all, our partners in \nproviding health care, education, and other essential services to the \ncitizens of this Nation. They are, however, facing a dramatic and \nunexpected decline in government revenues at precisely the time when \nthe demand for government services has never been higher because of a \nlagging economy.\n  States from Maine to Nebraska to West Virginia to Alaska are facing \ntheir most serious budget shortfalls in 50 years. States face deficits \nof between $70 and $85 billion for the next fiscal year, which begins \nin most States on July 1. They also face deficits of $26 billion trying \nto close the books on the current fiscal year.\n  Moreover, while the President's proposal for excluding dividends from \ntaxation would spur needed investment in American businesses, it would \ncost the States nearly a billion dollars over the next 3 years. That \nstrengthens, to me, the case for providing aid to the States.\n  Let me tell you what the State of Maine, my home State, is facing. \nThe State of Maine faces a budget shortfall for this year and the next \nof approximately $1.2 billion. Let me put that in perspective.\n  The entire budget for the State of Maine is only $5.3 billion, which \nmeans it faces a shortfall of approximately 20 percent. Imagine if the \nFederal Government were struggling with a budget shortfall of 20 \npercent. It would have to close a $440 billion budget gap, and it would \nhave to do so without borrowing a single dime. That summarizes the \ndilemma facing our State.\n\n[[Page S6205]]\n\n  Forty-nine States have balanced budget requirements. They have to \nbalance their budgets. They cannot print more money. They can't run \ntemporary deficits. They can't borrow the money to close the deficit. \nAs a consequence, States have been cutting spending, increasing taxes, \nusing rainy day funds, and delaying capital projects. They are doing \nwhatever they can because they must balance their budgets.\n  All of the States have cut programs--even programs that provide \nlifelines to our most vulnerable citizens. At a time when the number of \npeople without health insurance is climbing, 49 States have either \nalready cut their Medicaid Programs or are planning to do so.\n  Medicaid provides a critical health care safety net for 44 million of \nour most vulnerable low-income citizens, including 218,000 in my State \nof Maine. States, as a result of trying to balance their budgets, are \nslashing Medicaid Programs. As a consequence, approximately 1.7 million \nAmericans are at risk of losing their health insurance. That means they \nare going to be added to the growing number of 41 million Americans \nlacking health insurance.\n  Moreover, not only is our proposal compassionate, not only will it \nhelp the most vulnerable Americans keep their health care services, but \nour proposal makes sound economic sense. Putting money into the hands \nof States is a great way to stimulate economic growth in conjunction \nwith the tax provisions of this package. As States cut spending and \nraise taxes to balance their budgets, they weaken the overall economy.\n  A recent Goldman Sachs analysis underscores the stimulative effect of \nState fiscal relief. The report notes that ``State governments could \nprovide significant support to the economy without large long-term \nbudget cuts, reducing the need for these jurisdictions to raise taxes, \nand cut spending.''\n  After all, if we cut taxes here in Washington only to have taxes \nincrease in State capitals across the country, we will wipe out some of \nthe good we are trying to do by cutting Federal taxes.\n  I am not saying Congress should bail out the States. I am not saying \nStates should not have to make hard choices. I am not saying States \nshould not balance their budgets. The States are going to have to make \nhard, painful choices, even with the $20 billion we are proposing to \nassist them. The nature and the severity of the fiscal crisis facing \nour States has convinced me that we simply have to help them. The \nconsequences are too dire otherwise, and too many vulnerable low-income \nAmerican families will suffer if we do not step in and lend a helping \nhand.\n  I am encouraged that the economic stimulus package approved by the \nSenate Finance Committee authorizes temporary fiscal relief to the \nStates. As the distinguished chairman has indicated, tonight we are \ndeciding how to fill in the blanks and how that help should be \nallocated. We focus particularly on Medicaid because of our concern \nabout the impact of State budget cuts on low-income families \nin America.\n\n  But there is another reason it makes sense to target one-half of the \nassistance to the Medicaid Program. That is that Medicaid is the \nfastest growing component of State budgets. While State revenues are \nstagnant, or declining in most States, Medicaid cuts are increasing at \na rate of more than 13 percent a year. That is why States have no \nchoice but to look to the Medicaid Program.\n  If you look at home State budgets, the vast majority of State \nspending is for education and Medicaid. If we want to help protect low-\nincome Americans, the best thing we can do is to approve an increase in \nthe Federal match for the Medicaid Program.\n  As to the State of Maine, our amendment would mean $116 million over \nthe next 2 years for health care and other services that will help our \nmost vulnerable Americans.\n  There is another advantage to using the current Medicaid structure--\nwhat is known as the Federal Medicaid matching rate, or FMAP. That is, \nthe States don't have to take any new legislative action or establish \nany new administrative structures in order to use these additional \nFederal matching funds. They can go straight into the Medicaid Program.\n  The remaining $10 billion could be used by States and local \ngovernments to fund education or job training, health care or other \nsocial services, transportation or other infrastructure needs, and law \nenforcement or public safety. In other words, we provided a great deal \nof flexibility for that remaining $10 billion.\n  Our amendment would allocate $4 billion of those funds directly to \ncounties and local governments.\n  Our amendment is strongly supported by a wide range of health care \ngroups, which I will submit as part of my formal statement in the \ninterest of time.\n  The support for our proposal--the Collins-Rockefeller-Nelson-Smith, \net al, amendment--underscores the critical importance of providing \nassistance to States right now. Now is when they need it. Now is when \nwe must act.\n  Congress is most effective when it stands arm in arm and not toe to \ntoe with our partners, the States. Our States face a fiscal crisis of \nexpanding dimension. We need to help, and this bipartisan, carefully \ncrafted amendment is the critical step forward in doing just that.\n  I hope we will have a strong bipartisan vote for this important \namendment. It is similar to proposals that my colleagues and I advanced \nlast year and this year which garnered the overwhelming support of the \nSenate. Now we can make sure that it happens.\n  I would like to yield at this time to the Senator from West Virginia \nwho has been stalwart in arguing for fiscal relief for the States. It \nhas been a great pleasure to work with him. I yield to him as much time \nas he needs out of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank my dear friend, the very distinguished \nSenator from Maine. I thank the Presiding Officer for allowing me to \ntalk briefly about this amendment of Senator Collins, myself, Senators \nNelson and Smith, and Senators, et al, as the Senator from Maine kept \nsaying, including Senator Clinton and many others. It is something we \nhave been working on for 2 years. It is something we have been working \nvery hard on for 2 years. It is something the National Governors \nAssociation has worked hard for, for obvious reasons, which I will get \ninto in a moment, although my remarks will not be long.\n  The Senator from Maine really did cover the logic and the need in \nvery clear terms. If those who are listening heard her, they heard the \nbest possible argument. I just want to add a few comments.\n  I also thank the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Grassley \nfrom Iowa, for his generosity and good judgment in accepting this $20 \nbillion package as part of the chairman's mark. Is it everything in \namount and scope that the Senator from West Virginia would wish? No. \nBecause the Senator is from West Virginia and the needs on a \nproportional basis across the country are greater in West Virginia than \nmany other places. I would support $30 billion. I support $40 billion \nprovided that one-half is used for Medicaid, and then others could be \nnegotiated out.\n  So I do not think the $20 billion is enough, but $20 billion is what \nwe have, and $20 billion is more than we started out with last year. We \nwill hope people forget that, even though 75 of them on this floor \nvoted for it then, and then, for a $30 billion bill, 80 on this floor \nvoted for it this year. That does not happen a lot around here.\n  That was not a free vote. That was not a trivial vote. That was a \nvote people made after thinking about it. So we will prevail, and we \nwill rejoice in that. And we will not do that just because we win an \namendment; we do that because we know we are helping real people.\n  We have almost 300,000 people in West Virginia who are on Medicaid. \nOne of the things that always strikes me: We always talk about health \ncare in statistics, and somehow that separates us from being able to \nget down to what the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, calls ``real \npeople.'' And I am of that school, the so-called real people school.\n  I picked up the paper this morning. I read that 60 million Americans, \nat some point during the year, do not have health care. That is not a \nMedicaid statement. That is a health care statement. That means some of \nthem\n\n[[Page S6206]]\n\nnever have it, and others of them only have it on a part-time basis. \nBut that means that all of them--60 million Americans out of 260 \nmillion, how ever many we are--worry all the time about health care.\n  But here comes a Medicaid amendment in which we can do some good for \npeople. The Senator from Maine mentioned 1,700,000 people are at risk \nif we do not. I am not sure the $10 billion will take care of all those \n1,700,000 people, but it will take care of a lot of people, and it is \ngoing to take care of them with very good health care. People need to \nunderstand that Medicaid, unlike Medicare, does provide a prescription \ndrug benefit. And Medicaid, probably known to most of my colleagues, \nprovides 6 million elderly, poor Americans--who do not have health care \notherwise and prescription drugs otherwise--it provides this to them. \nSo it has an enormous capacity and reach. It is superb health care. It \ndoes EPSDT for children. That is early screening. It does all kinds of \nthings that Medicare, obviously being a different area, does not do. So \nit is a superb program.\n  The Senator from Maine pointed out it is very good in terms of being \na stimulus to the economy. She is quite correct about that. And it is \nabout a 3 to 1 relationship. For every $1 you spend in the State, about \n$3 is actually churned beyond that. So it is a stimulus program. Yes, \nit is actually a stimulus program. I think that is one of the reasons \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee put it in the mark.\n  But there is another aspect here. The Senator from Maine used the \nwords ``safety net.'' I will use the word ``underpinning.'' Either one \nis the same. This is a sacred concept. This is a country, because of \nour original history under the British crown, in which we wanted to \nprotect the minority, not protect the majority. The majority, we \nfigured, were able to do that.\n  There are protections and checks and balances in all these things, \nbut people sometimes say: Well, if somebody is on Medicaid, that means \nthey are not working or they don't deserve it. That is so untrue.\n  When I go back to the way I was introduced to West Virginia--and what \ncaused me to stay in West Virginia--when I became a Vista volunteer for \n2 years, and I dealt with people, none of whom had health care, they \nfed me every meal I had, because I ate in some home or some mobile home \nor whatever it was. I depended upon them. My life was them. If it was a \ngood day for them; it was a good day for me. If it was a bad day for \nthem; it was a bad day for me. It changed me in every single way.\n\n  But these are people who need this. There is nothing that hurts so \nmuch as to know a child cannot get screened for autism when they should \nbe, or that a child has no dental care whatsoever. I had to deal with \nthat. I would have to load kids from this little community into my \njeep, and we would go down to the one place in Charleston, WV, which \noffered free dental care. And, obviously, you can't do that for 38 \nyears. So it is a tragic situation.\n  These are good people. These are people sometimes who cannot find \nwork simply because they live too far out in the country, as was the \ncase in this community, or they did not have automobiles to be able to \nget to work. Or if they got to work, they didn't know how to take a job \nexam or have a job interview, or they had never been up in an elevator \nand they were scared by that, or they were asked to lower a Venetian \nblind because the Sun was in their eyes, and they had never seen a \nVenetian blind before, so they would just sort of shut up and hunker \ndown and be defeatist.\n  Don't tell me those people are not worth keeping healthy because \nthings did not break their way. Things broke well in my life. Things \nhave not broken well in some people's lives in Maine and Alaska and \nWest Virginia, and we cannot pretend that somehow these are not people \nand that they don't deserve help. The spirit of America is one in which \nyou try to protect those who cannot protect themselves, as much as \npossible, within reason.\n  Incidentally, this also happens to do an enormous amount for our \nhospitals and nursing homes. And that was the one thing that was not \nsaid by the Senator from Maine. Eighty-five percent of any hospital in \nWest Virginia depends on Medicare and Medicaid--all of them.\n  So by doing this--and by pouring millions of dollars into West \nVirginia, and $10 billion across America--for a temporary period of 18 \nmonths, we strengthen our entire health care system as well as \nstimulating the economy. So it helps the economy and it helps the \npeople--and people who really do need it.\n  The Senator pointed out that the other $10 billion--which I was less \ninvolved with because I was focused on the Medicaid relief--is spent \nwisely: in education, job training, transportation. She talked about \nit. And it is a good expenditure. Governors and local groups can decide \nhow to spend that.\n  I was worried it would be kind of a revenue-sharing thing. I remember \nback when I was Governor in 1982, we had revenuesharing, and, all of a \nsudden, county courthouses all over the State of West Virginia got new \nroofs and got refurbished, which is not exactly what I think the \nrevenuesharing was meant to be for.\n  So it is a serious business when you give Medicaid help to people who \nneed it.\n  I will conclude with this. And this really gets my goat. I have heard \na lot around here the argument that you cannot give money to States. \nWhat are we, two nations? Are we 50 States, on the one hand? Is that \ncalled America? Or are we a Federal Government? Is that America? Or are \nwe somehow bound up that we work together and that we help each other?\n\n  I was not elected by a country. I was elected by a State. I am a \nSenator from West Virginia. That means we work together.\n  To say the States have been irresponsible is so wrong because if you \ngo back to the end of the Second World War or if you go back just 10 \nyears, you will find the States have been far more discrete and \nresponsible in their spending than has the Federal Government.\n  Now, you can say: Well, the Federal Government has very broad \nresponsibilities, the Department of Defense, and other endeavors. And I \nunderstand that. But the fact is, the States have been responsible.\n  When we took in less money in 1982 than we did in 1981, I had to fire \n10,000 Department of Highway workers. I had to fire them. I had to fire \nthose people--good people who worked. So don't tell me that States \ndon't sacrifice.\n  West Virginia has just raised its cigarette tax to 55 cents, and all \nof the money is being spent by the Governor on Medicaid. And, at the \nsame time, the State is having to cut services.\n  This morning, I talked to the president of our very largest \nuniversity, with 31,000 students, West Virginia University. His budget, \nand every other State public education budget at the college/university \nlevel, has been cut by 13 percent. And it will happen again next year. \nIt is a devastating cut. Why? Because, as the Senator from Maine said, \nyou have to balance the budget.\n  So we are dealing with real States here, but, most importantly, we \nare dealing with real people who need the help in an America which was \ncreated to protect those who needed that help.\n  I ask my colleagues to join the Senator from Maine, the Senator from \nNebraska, and others who have sponsored this bill, and been working on \nit for a long time. I am thrilled that, at last, it has a very good \nchance of passing.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I yield myself off the bill such time \nas I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am in support of this amendment. I am very glad that \nsuch a compromise has been worked out. I am very happy with the team of \npeople both on and off the committee who have put it together. I would \nlike to emphasize one thing about the amendment. I am sure it has been \nstated very well by other sponsors, but this is meant to bring \ntemporary--and I want to stress ``temporary''--fiscal relief to the \nStates. I have heard from my State and many others about the difficult \nbudget situations they are currently experiencing. This amendment will \nhelp to bring temporary relief to all States during this difficult \nfiscal time.\n  It is important for the Senate to successfully pass a strong growth \nbill, and\n\n[[Page S6207]]\n\nthis amendment helps to achieve that goal. Numerous Senators have \nindicated that State fiscal relief is a key component of this growth \npackage. Some of my colleagues believe strongly that we should direct \nsome State fiscal relief through the Federal Medical Assistance \nPercentage Program or something we call around here by the acronym \nFMAP. This is the funding structure for Medicaid. This amendment uses a \ntemporary adjustment in the FMAP formula.\n  Some of my colleagues feel strongly about giving flexible grants to \nthe States and localities. This amendment also uses flexible grants to \nthose States and localities. Many Members both on and off the Finance \nCommittee have worked hard to reach this agreement. As I stated in the \nFinance Committee markup, I believe all Senators should have an \nopportunity to weigh in. The amendment before us reflects the hard work \nof many Senators who care deeply about State fiscal relief. It is a \ngood compromise. For these reasons, I am going to vote for this \namendment, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I want to state a couple more times, just so it is not forgotten, to \nany State and local people listening or who will read about it or for \nsure will be reminded about it a year or so from now: This is meant to \nbe temporary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe committee for his remarks. I thank the Senator from West Virginia \nfor his eloquent statement, and I now yield time to the other great \nleader on this issue, my colleague and friend, Senator Ben Nelson of \nNebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I come to the floor today to \nsupport and urge my colleagues to join in support of the amendment \nbefore the Senate for State fiscal relief. I begin by thanking my \nfriend and colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, who has been stalwart \nin pushing for State fiscal relief for 2-plus years. We have worked \nvery carefully, very closely to bring about this amendment that is \nbefore us today.\n  On two other occasions, we have had overwhelming support. We believe \nthis amendment will potentially have that same level of support. I \nthank her for all of the work and leadership she has provided in making \nthis possible.\n  I thank also the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, my \nfriend to the east of Nebraska in Iowa, Senator Grassley. He has been a \nman of his word. We have worked very carefully, very closely on this \nissue and others. I thank him for contributing significantly to our \neffort to bring this amendment to the body.\n  Most of what needs to be said has been said already. I do want to \nemphasize, as Senator Grassley has, that this is temporary. It is for a \n2-year period. And why is it temporary? Because one would expect that \nif we are going to grant stimulus programs to grow the economy, that \nafter a reasonably short period of time, the economy will respond. That \nis the hope, that is the expectation, and that clearly is the goal, not \nonly of this amendment but of the entire growth package before the \nSenate.\n  Our goal is to make sure that we grow the economy faster than we grow \nthe deficit. It doesn't make a lot of sense to cut taxes in Washington \nand ignore what is happening in the State capitals. ether it is in \nJuneau or Lincoln or wherever it may be, what happens in State capitals \nwith the State legislatures does matter.\n\n  Over the weekend, I was home in Nebraska and the local news media was \ncovering in great detail the travail of the Nebraska Legislature in \ntrying to take care of a growing budget deficit caused by declining \nrevenues and increasing costs. Therefore, the news was replete on the \nsubject day in and day out. So if we are going to try to change the \nattitude and improve the economy with active results in Washington, DC, \nit does not make sense to ignore what is happening in the State \ncapitals.\n  We only have one tax pocket. The Federal Government is trying to put \nin some money. States have their hand in taking more out. That \ncertainly is counterproductive to the goal we have if we ignore what is \nhappening at the State level.\n  I have said that it is the equivalent of trying to drive a car with \none foot on the accelerator and the other on the brake. We don't want \nwhat we are attempting to do here negated by what is going on in State \ncapitals. This will permit us to do as much as we can to help avoid \nthat.\n  There is the human side. Quite honestly, in Nebraska, for example, \nwith this projected budget shortfall, the University of Nebraska, the \nState colleges are all taking significant cuts. Nebraska teachers are \nout of work because of lower State aid to education. In fact, when it \ncomes to health care coverage and child care options, more than 15,000 \nchildren have already been cut from Medicaid benefits and another 2,000 \nfamilies have lost their child care. More harsh cuts are on the way \nunless we do something to help fill the revenue gap. This amendment \ndoes that.\n  Some have suggested that this is bailing out the States or somehow it \nis a gift that we are doing out of the generosity of Washington. I have \nencountered the generosity of Washington, generally, as a former \nGovernor when things were given to us. They were called underfunded and \nunfunded Federal mandates. This is not what we are about today. We \nrecognize that one of the best ways to help the States with their \nproblems today is to take care of these needs and make sure that we \ndon't have what we are doing here negated by action at the State level, \nwhich is to respond by supporting additional FMAP funding for a period \nof 2 years, as well as recognizing that the State and local governments \nare also feeling the pinch with the fast growing requirements due to \nhometown security under homeland security requirements. They do not \nhave the luxury to run deficits, nor should they.\n  Therefore, what we propose is $10 billion to be split between the \nStates and local governments on a block grant basis. This will help \nprovide some relief from property taxes that would otherwise most \nassuredly rise as the cost of local governments are passed on to \ntaxpayers.\n  As we look at this package, as we look at State fiscal relief, I hope \nwe will continue to have the bipartisan support we have had in the \npast. Whether it is 75 or 80 votes is secondary. I certainly hope it \nwould be overwhelming support for this effort.\n  For those who would say what kind of stimulus will come from this \neffort, there are studies that show that 1.24 will be returned in one \nyear. From my perspective, a 24-percent return on this sort of \ninvestment to take back to the States is a good return, and it is \ncertainly a stimulus to the economy. Therefore, it is a stimulus to the \nfuture of this great country.\n  I appreciate the opportunity. I thank my colleague, the Senator from \nMaine, for her support, for her constant counseling on how we should go \nabout this effort. I thank her for the time to speak on this very \nimportant amendment.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I would like to ask my friend from Nebraska how he would \nrespond to a valid question that has been raised about our amendment: \nWill the increase in the FMAP, Federal share of Medicaid, be a \ntemporary one?\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I am glad my friend from Maine has asked that \nquestion so that I can provide some assurances to our colleagues. On \nbehalf of our group of Senators offering this amendment, let me be \nclear: We have drafted this provision in such a way that the increase \nin the FMAP will end June 30, 2004. My colleagues will be glad to know \nthat there is precedent for Congress passing short-term Medicaid \nmatching rate increases that have not become permanent.\n  In 1981, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act reduced Medicaid \nmatching rates for 3 years, while also creating exemptions for States \nthat had high unemployment rates, special hospital review programs, or \nstrong fraud and abuse recovery systems. At the time when this was \nenacted, some in Congress worried that these changes would be \npermanent, but these provisions expired on schedule without any \nparticular controversy or efforts to extend them.\n  There is even a more recent example: The Omnibus Consolidated \nRescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 granted\n\n[[Page S6208]]\n\na temporary increase in the FMAP to Louisiana. The State's matching \nrate rose from the normal rate of 72.08 percent to a special enhanced \nrate of 84.28 percent in State fiscal year 1995-96 and from the normal \nrate of 71.49 percent to an enhanced rate of 81.46 percent in State \nfiscal year 1996-97. This temporary State relief was granted because \nthe Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 tightened \ndisproportionate share hospital payment policies and posed a hardship \nfor Louisiana at a time when the State's economy was faring badly. The \nState was able to use these temporary funds to avoid disruptions in \nessential services. The temporary increase in Louisiana's FMAP expired \nas scheduled.\n  These provisions expired as planned after fulfilling their mission of \ntemporary relief to help these States transition through a difficult \nperiod. Congress has been able to maintain discipline in the past. \nThere is no evidence that a temporary increase in Medicaid matching \nrates will inevitably become permanent. In fact, because our amendment \nin no way adjusts how future FMAPs are calculated, it does not effect a \npermanent change in FMAPs for States.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank my colleague for that valuable clarification. \nLet me ask my colleague from West Virginia about another question that \nhas come up regarding the impact of our proposal on the baseline for \nfuture Medicaid calculations. There is some concern that this provision \nmight increase FMAP rates in future years. Would you clarify this issue \nfor our colleagues?\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I am happy to address that issue. The FMAP is \ncurrently calculated annually under the following formula. The FMAP is \nat least 50 percent and is calculated based on the ratio of a State's \n3-year average of per capita income to the 3-year average of per capita \nincome of the Nation. Given the nature of this formula, the previous \nyear's FMAP in no way affects the calculation of future FMAPs. \nBasically, if the State's average per capita income is below the \nnational per capita average, the State gets a higher FMAP. The FMAP is \ncalculated usually 6 months to a year in advance of the start of a \nFederal fiscal year. The amendment would take the FMAP that has already \nbeen calculated by HHS under this formula for fiscal year 2003 and \nfiscal year 2004 and increase it by 2.95 percentage points for a \nportion of those years. It does not adjust the underlying formula. \nBecause the FMAP is calculated annually, and the calculation is still \nbased on the current per capita income ratio, our amendment in no way \nincreases the baseline for future FMAP calculations.\n  I would like to add that I completely concur with the Senator from \nNebraska's statement on the temporary nature of the FMAP.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I would like to add one other point of clarification on \nthis provision. By no means do we intend to prohibit States from using \nthe revenuesharing portion of this amendment on services or other \nspending that the State cut in its most recent budget. If a State \nwanted to use a portion of these funds to restore all or part of a \nvital service it was forced to eliminate or reduce, it should be \nallowed to do so. We know that the State is the best judge of how to \nprioritize these funds, not the Federal Government.\n  Madam President, I thank my colleague and close friend, the Senator \nfrom Nebraska, for his leadership and for making such an excellent \ncase. I know there are others who are waiting, so I will conclude the \ndebate on this by making just one final point. Forty-nine States are \nfacing severe budget shortfalls. This is not an isolated problem. It is \na problem that affects all but one State. This isn't a case where \nStates have been fiscally irresponsible, spending wildly.\n  In fact, the States are coping with the demand for services and a \ndecline in revenues at the same time. It is not something they brought \nupon themselves. That is why we should step in temporarily--these are \nnot permanent assistance programs--to provide help. It will help ensure \nthat 1.7 million Americans will not lose their Medicaid services. It \nwill help ensure that they might just have a little bit of help as they \nmake the painful, difficult choices that are necessary to close their \nbudget gap. It will help ensure that it has a direct stimulative \neffect, which is, after all, the entire purpose of this package. It is \nto get our economy growing again and create good jobs. Fiscal aid to \nStates will help to achieve that critical goal.\n  I want to take this opportunity to ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of this amendment \nto allocate State fiscal relief funds to Medicaid and State and local \ngovernments.\n  I have been supportive of State fiscal relief since the last \nCongress. Last year, I introduced a bill with Senators Rockefeller, \nNelson, and Collins to provide states with fiscal relief, which \ngarnered the support of 75 Senators.\n  This year, I reintroduced State fiscal relief legislation with \nSenators Rockefeller, Nelson, and Collins that would provide States \nwith $20 billion--half through FMAP.\n  And earlier this year, 80 Senators supported a sense of the Senate \nthat $30 billion should be spent on State fiscal relief, with half of \nthe money going to Medicaid. Eighty votes is a pretty clear signal that \nthis is important to a lot of folks in a lot of States.\n  And make no mistake, FMAP is good economic stimulus for the States \nwhich need it badly. By providing State fiscal relief in the form of \nFMAP back to our states, we improve the health of our workforce, \nprotect or expand health coverage, create new jobs, and infuse the \neconomy with new money.\n  By providing a temporary boost to FMAP in the form of $10 billion, \nOregon would see more than $300 million in new economic activity, more \nthan $110 million in new wages would be generated, and more than 3,500 \njobs would be created.\n  As you can see, State fiscal relief is one of the most effective \npolicies the Congress could and should enact as part of the economic \nstimulus/growth package. There is no question that States will spend \nany additional Federal funds they receive quickly, putting money \ndirectly into the economy rather than curtailing economic activity.\n  As many economists have noted, we need to increase demand in the \neconomy--but State budget actions to balance their budgets right now \nare reducing demand significantly. This is precisely the wrong medicine \nat the wrong time for our economy.\n  As you know, States are facing budget deficits of approximately $100 \nbillion that need to be closed over the next few months. States are \nclosing these deficits by cutting education, health care, and public \nsafety--and sometimes by considering raising taxes.\n  Unfortunately, the economic impact of State budget cuts and possible \ntax increases have wide-reaching impacts. A dollar cut from Medicaid \nresults in far more than one dollar less in health care.\n  Fortunately, the opposite is also true: every single dollar spent on \nMedicaid results in over $3 in the State and local economy.\n  Some of our colleagues will tell us that the States spent their own \nway into the current fiscal crisis. But most of the spending increases \nin health care were driven by the fact that health care costs grew \nalmost twice as quickly as general inflation, and that Medicaid \nenrollment rose among disabled individuals and the elderly--two groups \nwith expensive health care needs.\n  In addition, States expanded health care coverage among low income \nchildren and pregnant women.\n  Since the economy began to falter, virtually every State has taken \nMedicaid cost-containment action. Additional cuts are expected next \nyear as States struggle to fill budget shortfalls of billions of \ndollars.\n  Of course, this means that the number of uninsured Americans will \ncontinue to grow.\n  According to the CDC, Medicaid and SCHIP provided coverage for 2 \nmillion children and 1 million adults who lost their health coverage \nlast year. I suspect this year, those numbers will be even larger.\n  My home State of Oregon has been hit hard by the economic downturn.\n\n[[Page S6209]]\n\nThe number of uninsured is up, way up. Children and adults, parents \nhave lost their jobs and they are turning to Medicaid. Will Medicaid be \nthere for them?\n  Without additional resources, 100,000 Oregonians will lose their \nhealth coverage, and the people who retain their coverage are facing \ndrastically reduced benefits. This loss will have a ripple effect in \nthe local economy. In some counties, a quarter of the population is \neligible for Medicaid.\n  While we need to strengthen our economy in the long run, it is \nimperative that we address the immediate economic problems by tackling \nthe State fiscal crisis.\n  This amendment will provide millions of dollars to needy State and \nlocal governments to provide essential services that benefit all of us.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I yield such time as the minority leader \nhimself may use.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I thank the distinguished ranking \nmember, the Senator from Montana. I will just take a couple of minutes.\n  I think this is a critical amendment. I hope, as we consider what it \nis we need to do to ensure that our country can be put back in economic \nbalance, that we recognize the importance in providing meaningful \nassistance to the States.\n  Of all the amendments we have before us, this is one of the most \nimportant. I just spoke to the Governors yesterday. They have an $80 \nbillion shortfall. So I am very hopeful that, as we consider where it \nis we can do the most good, where we can get the greatest traction, \nwhere we can do the most to ensure that we have the greatest degree of \neconomic recovery, we recognize the importance of helping States deal \nwith the crisis they are facing in dealing with medical costs. \nLikewise, we must recognize that we have an obligation to offset the \ncosts of the Leave No Child Behind Act and realize that transportation \ninfrastructure has to be addressed. Our legislation would do that.\n  So I applaud my colleagues for the extraordinary effort they have \nmade to bring us to this point. I congratulate our colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle for their effort. I hope our colleagues will see fit \nto pass the amendment when we vote on it tomorrow.\n  If I may say briefly, I wish we were not here tonight with the \nlegislation that is pending before us. Our country is mired in debt. We \ncould exceed $400 billion in debt this year--the single largest 1-year \nlevel of indebtedness our country has ever faced. I cannot imagine, \nwith all of that debt, with the recognition that we have gone from a $5 \ntrillion surplus to a $2 trillion deficit, that anyone could possibly \nfeel comfortable supporting a tax cut of the magnitude we are talking \nabout tonight.\n  I only wish that somehow we could resolve our differences and \nrecognize that fiscal responsibility has to have some important part in \nour calculation as to what makes the most sense as we look to economic \nrecovery. An independent analysis by Economy.com found that we could \nactually lose jobs in the outyears. The objective report indicated that \nnot only do we not create many jobs in the next year because most of \nthis legislation doesn't kick in until 2004, we actually could harm the \neconomy in the outyears because of increasing long-term indebtedness as \na result of higher interest rates.\n  So from a jobs point of view, we can do better. From a cost point of \nview, we can certainly do better. From the point of view of fiscal \nresponsibility, we must do better. So we will be offering a Democratic \nalternative that will allow us that fiscal responsibility and allow us \nan immediate response to the economic circumstances we are facing right \nnow.\n  Our bill does what the economic experts told us we must do. They said \nmake it temporary, make it immediate, make it broad-based and, above \nall, make it fiscally responsible. That is what the Democratic \nalternative will do tomorrow. It will provide help for the States, as \nthis amendment does. It will provide a broad-based wage credit for \nevery working family in the country today. It will provide meaningful \nhelp to small business with the business expensing allowance. It will \nprovide unemployment insurance for those who have seen it terminated. \nSo it does exactly what the Nobel laureates, the economists, have told \nus must be done if indeed we are cognizant and sensitive to the many \npressures and challenges and the many real problems we are facing as we \nlook to our fiscal responsibilities in the coming years.\n  We can do better than this. I am very hopeful that we can persuade \nour colleagues to look carefully at what repercussions there will be if \nthe legislation currently pending passes. I hope we can persuade our \ncolleagues that indeed working together we can find a better approach. \nOur Democratic alternative is that better approach. I urge my \ncolleagues to look at it tonight and support it tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor and I thank my colleagues for the opportunity to \naddress the alternative, as well as the State amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I, too, am pleased we are going to be \nvoting to increase aid to the States. Earlier this year, I offered \nlegislation to cut taxes, but its centerpiece was aid to the States. In \nfact, I suggested $75 billion in aid to the States. That sounds like a \npretty large sum, but I suggested in the introduced legislation to \nprovide up to $75 billion because, in my judgment--and I think it is \nthe judgment of most economists--dollars that are spent to help States \nto balance their budgets will significantly help the economies in those \nStates. Unfunded mandates by the U.S. Federal Government has caused \nsome of the problems the States are facing. No Child Left Behind has \nbeen mentioned, and there are others, such as IDEA and special \neducation. There are various unfunded mandates.\n  We in the Congress have said that the States must provide these \nservices, but the President and the Congress have not provided the \nmoney to the States so they can provide these services. So the States \nhave had to figure out how to pay for these services because that is \nFederal law, they must do so.\n  In the meantime, as we all know, States have suffered dramatic \nreductions in revenues because the economy has been down. States all \nacross the country have not received near the amount of revenues they \nexpected in their last budgets. When you add to that rising health care \ncosts in the country, which are averaging 12 to 13 percent higher each \nyear, this is a huge increase to the States' Medicaid budgets and other \nhealth care budgets. So it is very important to give increased aid to \nthe States. I am disappointed, frankly, that this bill provides only \n$20 billion when the need is so great.\n  I remind our colleagues also, as the occupant of the chair knows \nwell--particularly because her father is Governor of a State--States \nhave to balance their budgets. That is not true for the Federal \nGovernment. When States face all these unfunded mandates and a \nreduction in revenue, they have huge budget deficits, which they have \nto somehow solve, and they can only do so by raising taxes or by \ncutting various State services, such as Medicaid--their share--and \nwhatnot.\n  So that is why we are here today and why so many Senators have spoken \nout in favor of aid to the States. We are soon to have an amendment \noffered by the Senator from Washington, which I support. She is going \nto suggest even more aid to the States. This $20 billion is merely a \ndrop in the bucket. As we all know, the budget deficit in California is \n$35 billion alone. This bill provides just $20 billion. One State alone \nis much more than that. My State of Montana is running a budget deficit \nof about $260 million. We are a small State, but $260 million in \ndeficit is a lot for my State with a population of 19,000 people.\n  So I join in the chorus, and I particularly thank the Senator from \nMaine and the chairman of the committee. I also thank the other \nSenators who are working to put this together. I must say I will \nsupport it, but I wish we were a little wiser, frankly, and providing \nmore aid to the States. Certainly $20 billion is low, but if that is \nall we can get, that is what we face. I thank all my colleagues who \nhave worked on this.\n\n  Madam President, I now yield 3 minutes to the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n[[Page S6210]]\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Montana. I \nadd my remarks to his. I agree with him completely. I am in full \nsupport of the Collins-Rockefeller-Nelson amendment. Our localities and \nStates desperately need aid. It makes no sense to tell John Q. Citizen \nthat he will get a $100 rebate from the Federal Government and then \nhave his State and local taxes rise $100. That does not put money in \nhis pocket and stimulate the economy.\n  Madam President, $20 billion is a decent sum, half going to FMAP and \nhalf to direct aid. I would like to see a little more going to \nlocalities. It is 60-40, as I understand it. My original proposal with \nSenator Collins and Senator Snowe was 50-50. That would be a little \nfairer because localities need help in property taxes a lot. But this \nis a good start. I am glad it is in the bill. I hope it will stay in \nthe bill because our localities desperately need aid.\n  Property taxes are going through the roof, and the best property tax \ncircuit breaker is local aid. I wish it was higher as well, and I am \nglad that in a few minutes, my colleague from Washington will be \noffering an amendment that doubles that amount.\n  The original legislation that Senator Snowe and I introduced was $40 \nbillion. I know my friend from Montana originally proposed $75 billion. \nEven that would not be enough to do what we need to do. I hope we can \nraise the amount. Again, States and localities need it.\n  Cities and counties throughout my State are raising taxes. That is \ngoing to put a real damper not only on New York's economy but on \nAmerica's economy. Local aid prevents some of that from happening.\n  This is one of the most important provisions in this bill. There are \na lot of provisions in the bill that Senator Grassley has proposed with \nwhich I agree. There are some with which I disagree. But there is \nprobably none that is more needed, more demanded by the Governors, \nmayors, county officials, town and village officials than the proposal \nthe Senator from Maine, the Senator from West Virginia, and the Senator \nfrom Nebraska have brought before us.\n  I am going to support it rather enthusiastically, only tempered by \nthe fact that I think it should be more. I hope it can be more. I hope \nit does not get any lower, I say to my good friend from Iowa, in \nconference and in other places. He is shaking his head yes, let the \nrecord show. I hope he is saying, yes, it should not get lower not, \nyes, it should get lower.\n  This is a very important amendment. I will fully support it. I was \ninvolved in helping to push this local aid issue. I hope we can \nincrease the amount with the amendment of the Senator from Washington.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, it is my understanding that all Senators \nwho wished to speak on the Collins amendment have spoken.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all pending amendments be temporarily \nlaid aside so the Senator from Washington can offer her amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 564\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 564.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray], for herself, Mr. \n     Daschle, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Schumer, \n     and Mr. Corzine, proposes an amendment numbered 564.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to offer an amendment that will \nhelp address the real needs of families in cities and States all across \nthis country. I thank my cosponsors Senators Daschle, Baucus, \nRockefeller, Wyden, Kohl, Schumer, Edwards, and Corzine.\n  As I look at the current tax proposal, I do not see much that will \nprovide an immediate stimulus to our economy or help working families \nwho are struggling during this recession. In fact, today's Washington \nPost said that even some Republicans consider this plan ``bizarre and \neconomically suspect.''\n  This tax bill ignores the real needs that families are facing, and it \ndramatically increases the deficit, all to give massive tax cuts to a \nvery few. That is an approach that has already failed us. Simply put, \nthis tax bill fails America's families. So tonight I am offering an \namendment to put some stimulus and relief into this no-stimulus bill.\n  The Murray amendment provides direct help where it is so badly \nneeded--in our States and in our local communities. My amendment \naddresses a crisis in health care that jeopardizes access for all \nAmericans.\n  Currently, the underlying bill, as we just heard, offers $20 billion \nin aid to the States. By the way, that funding is only there because \nDemocrats fought for it. That is a major accomplishment considering the \nPresident's plan included nothing for our ailing States, and the House \nalso failed our States.\n  While $20 billion is a victory in our current political environment, \nwe all know it is not enough to help our States recover quickly. So my \namendment offers an additional $20 billion for our struggling States \nand local governments. In total, my amendment provides $40 billion in \nimmediate assistance to our ailing States.\n  Here is how the money will be divided: $20 billion will go to general \nrevenue sharing. Of that, $16 billion is for State governments, \nincluding Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico; $4 billion is for local \ngovernments, and each State will receive a minimum of $100 million.\n  The other $20 billion goes to States for Medicaid relief. This \nprovision would temporarily increase the Federal matching rate for \nMedicaid. If we are going to help our economy recover, we need to help \nour States and local governments get through this crisis.\n  All of my colleagues know the plight of our States. My home State of \nWashington continues to suffer real economic problems, and it \nillustrates the importance of adopting the Murray amendment. Washington \nState has the second highest unemployment rate in the Nation at 7 \npercent. My colleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, who is going to be \nspeaking in just a few minutes, shares the distinguished record of \nhaving the highest unemployment in the Nation go back and forth between \nOregon and Washington in the last 2 years.\n  In Washington State, since the spring of 2001, we have lost tens of \nthousands of jobs. In fact, one in nine Washington residents does not \nhave health care coverage today, and 150,000 people in my State have \nlost health insurance in the last 2 years. In the last 2 years alone, \nwe have faced in my State an earthquake, an energy crisis, declines in \nour technology sector, the downturn of Boeing, and the loss of \nthousands of jobs. And now we face a State budget deficit of $2.7 \nbillion. That translates to dramatic cuts in education, health care, \ntransportation, and social services.\n  These programs are more important now than ever because times are so \ntough. Unfortunately, as we all know, many other States are facing very \nsimilar challenges. In fact, today our States are experiencing the most \nsevere economic crisis since World War II. Nationwide, States are \nfacing deficits totaling $70 billion to $85 billion.\n  Experts are warning us that 1.7 million people nationwide risk losing \nMedicaid coverage as States cut their budgets. In fact, in Washington \nState, according to our insurance commissioner, 60,000 children will \nlose access to health care unless we help. That is 60,000 children in \nWashington State alone. Unlike the Federal Government, States do not \nhave the option of deficit spending. Instead, States are forced to cut \nexisting programs or raise new revenues to balance their budgets.\n  To add to the State's budget crises, the Federal Government has \ncreated costly new mandates in areas such as education and homeland \nsecurity.\n  The ``No Child Left Behind'' law required States to implement new \naccountability measures, but the assistance that was promised has never \nbeen delivered.\n  On homeland security, State and local law enforcement must work \novertime whenever the threat level is raised. For many States and \nlocalities, homeland security is on the verge of becoming another \nunfunded mandate. Unfortunately, in response to the crises in our \nStates, the President proposed nothing to help them. It is like the \nfamous newspaper headline: ``Ford to City: Drop Dead.'' The House of \nRepresentatives followed the President's lead in leaving States in \ncrisis. It took Democratic efforts in the Senate to build bipartisan \nsupport for our States.\n  I am proud of the work that Democrats have done to add $20 billion to \nthe tax legislation to help our States get through this difficult time. \nI also commend my colleagues on the other side who are working on this \nissue. I applaud their work in the face of strong opposition from the \nPresident and the Republican party leadership.\n  My amendment will help States deal with education, as many State \nuniversities and community colleges are facing double-digit tuition \nincreases. My amendment will also help States address their Medicaid \nshortfalls by temporarily raising the Federal share of Medicaid \npayments.\n  Given the fiscal crisis in our States, this additional support is \ncritical today. This aid will allow our States to maintain health care \ncoverage for our most vulnerable citizens.\n  Some of my colleagues may hear the word ``Medicaid'' and think I am \njust talking about helping low-income families. That is true and it is \ncritical, but it is much more than that.\n  Yes, Medicaid does provide coverage for more than 42 million low-\nincome, disabled, and elderly Americans, but let's not forget that \nMedicaid plays a major role in America's health care delivery system.\n  It pays for about half of all nursing home care. It pays for 17 \npercent of prescription drug coverage.\n  Hospitals, doctors and clinics in every State rely on Medicaid as a \nsignificant source of revenue.\n  Cuts in Medicaid could close nursing homes. Cuts could make it harder \nfor middle class families to pay for long-term care for their aging \nparents or relatives. It could mean lower wages for nurses in long-term \ncare facilities. Finally, let me emphasize, it could have a major \nimpact on women because 70 percent of Medicaid beneficiaries over age \n15 are women.\n  Unless we address the Medicaid shortfall, we will feel the impact \neverywhere.\n  When poor kids, families, and moms do not have health care, kids show \nup at school sick, moms cannot care for families, and parents do not go \nto work. That affects everyone. It will add to the 41 million Americans \nwho do not have health insurance, and that will add to the costs we all \npay for health\n\n[[Page S6212]]\n\ncare. This affects families and businesses in the form of much higher \ninsurance premiums.\n  Finally, when Medicaid is underfunded, it puts more pressure on our \ndoctors, hospitals, and clinics that are already struggling. We are \nlosing doctors and seeing hospitals close today.\n  We cannot afford to let things get worse. We need to improve the \nunderlying tax bill so it addresses the real challenges facing families \nin our States and local communities. States are facing a fiscal crisis, \nand my amendment provides $20 billion in aid. States are facing a \nhealthcare crisis, and my amendment provides another $20 billion to \nmake up the Medicaid shortfall.\n  This amendment is a chance to improve what has been called a \n``bizarre and economically suspect'' tax plan.\n  Before I close, I want to clarify something that we may hear during \nthis debate. I want my colleagues to know that this is not about \nbailing out States that have overspent. We are talking about individual \nAmericans and their access to services like vision and dental care, \nasthma medicine, hospice care, and physical therapy. So when my \ncolleagues blame the States for this crisis, they are choosing their \nwords carefully. They do not dare blame the disabled, the elderly, poor \nchildren and their parents, but that is who they are really talking \nabout, the people who will lose access to health care unless we pass \nthe Murray amendment.\n  Let's not forget that our States have had to pick up the bills \nbecause the Federal Government has not done its job in certain areas.\n  For example, because we have not reformed health care at the Federal \nlevel, States have had to deal with more and more residents on \nMedicaid. Because Federal assistance for tuition has been cut, there is \nmore pressure on State-funded universities. To those pressures we can \nadd the Federal Government's failure to fund the education law and new \nhomeland security mandates.\n  So this is not about bailing out States that have done something \nwrong. This is about recognizing our responsibility to pay for the \nthings we have required at the Federal level. We know there is an \neconomic crisis in our States, and this is a chance to provide some \ncritical support.\n  Unless we provide some real aid to our States, Congress and the \nPresident will just be passing the tax burden on to the local level. \nLet's do the responsible thing.\n  I think that any Senator who votes against the Murray amendment will \nhave a hard time explaining to their Governor, their mayors, and all \ntheir citizens why they left their State hanging in order to provide a \nmassive tax cut to the few, which will not result in immediate economic \ngrowth.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the Murray amendment, and I thank my \nco-sponsors.\n  I yield 15 minutes to my colleague from Oregon, who is a cosponsor of \nthis amendment and who knows in his State how much they are struggling \nas they try to meet a crisis, as so many other States are.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I thank Senator Murray, the lead sponsor \nfor this legislation.\n  Oregon and Washington are really ground zero as far as the economic \nhurt in this country, and I thank her for all of her leadership and \nsupport.\n  I will take only a few minutes tonight because I know we have had a \nnumber of speakers on this topic, but I think it is time to put a human \nface on this issue and try to make sure that people really understand \nwhat is at stake.\n  In Eugene, OR, where I went to school, parents have recently been \nselling their own blood plasma--that's right, their own blood plasma--\nto pay for a math teacher's salary for one more year because the school \ndistrict has been unable to come up with the cash to pay for a math \nteacher. I think that really says it all.\n  As Senator Murray and other colleagues talked about, we are not \ntalking about luxuries. We are not talking about something that would \nbe frivolous or on somebody's wish list. We are talking about the most \nessential services in our society, making sure that kids get a good \nstart, and decent health care.\n  What it has come to in my State, which is in its third year now of \nfinancial meltdown, is we have parents actually going out and selling \nblood.\n  Something is really out of whack in this country when somehow the \nCongress is going to find ways to come up with billions of dollars to \nrebuild Iraq, but the Congress of the United States will not come up \nwith the dollars that are needed to rebuild the States. That is what \nthis effort on a bipartisan basis is all about.\n  In my home State, we now have schools closing a month early. We \nbrought an end to the medical-needy program which helped nearly 9,000 \nlow-income Oregonians with unusually high health costs who do not \nqualify for our innovative health plan. More than 2,500 older adults \nand persons with disabilities have lost adult care, assisted living \ncare, nursing home care, and the list really goes on.\n  I particularly wanted to highlight the fact that these cuts and the \nhardship that has been engendered as a result of these cuts comes about \nat a time when some of our States have been on the cutting edge of \ninnovation.\n  I will take a minute to describe our health plan. The State of Oregon \nhas been the only State in the country--in fact, the only political \njurisdiction on the planet--that has been willing to force a discussion \nabout tough calls in health care. Many feel, given the demographics \ntsunami that is ahead with millions of baby boomers retiring and the \ntechnology explosion, it is not on the level if you are not willing to \nmake some tough choices in health care. That is what my home State did \na number of years ago with the Oregon Health Plan; we held the first \nnationwide debate about how to go about making choices in health care, \nmaking sure you are doing prevention first in kids and pregnant \nmothers. And all the services we know will reap great benefits in the \nyears ahead.\n  That is the program that has been slashed. It was not a program that \nengendered a lot of fancy services or Cadillac health care or \nprofligate spending. It was a program that focused on the basics, on \nthe essential health care services, on services that by anyone's \nanalysis are just plain vanilla, essential services for our citizens.\n  I bring this up by way of saying, as we move tonight to close out the \ndiscussion of these amendments, I certainly support the Collins \namendment. It is very helpful. I would like to go further, for all the \nreasons Senator Murray has described tonight, that we think about these \nconsequences in human terms: What is going on today in Eugene, OR, what \nis going on with the Oregon Health Plan where people did make tough and \ncourageous calls.\n  A lot of the States must be wondering now, what was the point of \ntrying to be innovative? What was the point of trying to be innovative \nbecause when there were tough financial circumstances nationally beyond \ntheir control, the Federal Government said: That is the way it goes, we \nare not going to do anything to help tide you over so innovative \nprograms such as the Oregon Health Plan are not decimated.\n  These are critical issues. The budget cuts we have seen in health \ncare and education are not going to be quickly healed. Regarding the \nnational economy, we all hope for a speedy recovery, but it seems to \nme, by any calculation, the States are going to need significant and \nongoing help to ameliorate the damage that has been done and to start \npulling together the tatters of the social safety net and begin to help \nour citizens again. We are not going to repair that tattered safety net \nwith just a few needles and thread; we will do it with real and \ntangible help, the way the Murray amendment seeks to do.\n  I come to the Senate tonight to make it clear, what we seek to do in \nthese important amendments is to try to give our States the tools in \nthis struggle to provide the most critical of services, to tell them \nthey are going to have a little bit more to get by with during \nunprecedented times.\n  School finance in Oregon has been cut so drastically they have \ncurtailed the school year in some districts. We have been laying off \nteachers left and right. We have no way to attract them. Senator Smith \nand I co-hosted an important economic development summit at the end of \nlast year with 1,300 business leaders from all over the State.\n\n[[Page S6213]]\n\nThey are worried, as a business community, that with the shortening of \nthe school year in the country, it will be very tough to grow existing \nbusinesses and to attract new ones.\n  Suffice it to say, we are not really happy about the Doonesbury \ncartoons either. We have been first so often in my home State--with \nenvironmental protection, mass transit--but we are not pleased to be \nfirst in terms of economic hurt and unemployment and the kinds of \nproblems we have been outlining on the floor tonight.\n\n  We have to start filling the holes in these devastated budgets. The \nsituation is dire. In the face of this unprecedented suffering, many in \nthe Senate believe the $20 billion allocated is not enough and the \nSenate must do better.\n  Ultimately, budgets are about choices. Budgets are not just about \ncharts and graphs and figures and lots of dark ink on paper. Budgets \nare about hopes and aspirations and what kind of country we want. I \ndon't want a country and I don't want a State to have to sit by while \nthe Government does not respond when people have to sell blood to \nfinance a teacher's salary and we end up having the devastation to an \ninnovative state-of-the-art health plan, the way the Oregon Health Plan \nwas at the outset.\n  I don't want to tell the people of my home State, and I don't think \nothers in this body want to either, that the U.S. Congress can figure \nout a way to come up with billions and billions of dollars to \nreconstruct Iraq, hundreds of millions of dollars for tax cuts, and \nsimply not come up with the critical dollars needed to keep our kids in \nschool for a full year, to keep older people in health care systems \nthat are a lifeline for them.\n  I hope our colleagues will support the Murray amendment. The very \nleast the Senate can do is to keep the huge budgetary hole the States \nhave found themselves in from getting deeper and wider. The Murray \namendment ensures that can be done.\n  I urge the passage of this critical amendment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I first thank my colleague, Senator \nMurray, for her sponsorship of this vital amendment. I also want to \nspecifically recognize Senator Grassley, the distinguished chairman of \nthe Finance Committee, and Senator Baucus, the distinguished ranking \nmember, for their leadership in putting State and local fiscal relief \non the agenda. I should also note the bipartisan effort of Senators \nCollins, Rockefeller, Smith and Nelson which helped establish State aid \nin the budget debate. Finally, Senator Snowe deserves special \nrecognition for her early and steadfast support of this legislation.\n  The fiscal crisis in our States and cities is a national problem that \nrequires bipartisan cooperation in the best spirit of the Senate, and I \nam proud to be working together with my esteemed colleagues.\n  I support the Murray amendment.\n  This amendment is critical to New York. It will help thousands of New \nYorkers keep their jobs, maintain the State services they rely on, and \nmost importantly avoid the burden of increasing taxes. I cannot state \nthat more clearly--without this legislation the tax burden on citizens \nin my State will go up. That threatens to undo the very stimulus we all \nbelieve is necessary.\n  As we all know, New York is not alone. States are facing their worst \nfiscal crisis since World War II. The Governor of New York, George \nPataki, stated the situation in all of our States and cities clearly, \n``We face a fiscal crisis today of a magnitude that we have not faced \nin our lifetime.''\n  According to estimates provided by the National Conference of State \nLegislatures, the total budgetary shortfall for all States in fiscal \nyear 2004 was in the range of $80 billion, and an approximate $22 \nbillion gap still remains from fiscal 2003. Many believe these figures \nremain significantly understated.\n  Almost every State is running a significant, multi-hundred million \ndollar deficit. In many States, the figure runs into the multi-billions \nof dollars. In several States, the deficit's percentage of the total \nState budget is estimated to be in the range of 25 percent or more. New \nYork State's budget shortfall alone is $12 billion dollars.\n  The situation at the local level is just as dire. According to the \nNational Association of Counties, nearly 72 percent of counties are \nfacing budget shortfalls, 37 percent are reducing services, and 17 \npercent are increasing taxes--all at a time when the demand for \nservices and the need for tax cuts is rising given the sour economy.\n  This is not a regional issue. It is a national crisis.\n  Unlike the Federal Government, which has seen its fiscal position \nchange from a budgetary surplus in 2000 to a newly estimated deficit of \nover $300 billion in fiscal 2003, almost every state is required by law \nto have a balanced budget. To achieve this the only options are to \nraise taxes and/or cut spending.\n\n  State taxes are increasing in three ways. First, state income tax \nrates are increasing. Second, property tax rates are skyrocketing. In \nNew York City, Mayor Bloomberg was forced to raise property taxes over \n18 percent to preserve vital services. Third, States are increasing \nsales taxes, excise taxes, and other fees. As the New York Times \nrecently reported ``at least 15 states have raised taxes, five of them \nby 5 percent or more.''\n  This increasing tax burden falls heavily and squarely on the backs of \nour working families. It will make it harder for them to make ends meet \nin these already difficult economic times when every dollar counts.\n  State spending cuts follow 2 years of a deteriorating economic \nenvironment and fiscal outlook. During that time, States have cut the \nfat from their budgets and depleted reserves. They now are cutting \nmuscle. To balance their budgets for fiscal 2004, States are in the \nprocess of eliminating thousands of jobs.\n  In many States, the jobs that will be lost are vital to our \ncommunities: policemen, firefighters, teachers, postal workers, and bus \ndrivers. In New York these were the jobs of the everyday heroes that we \ncelebrated after the tragedies of September 11.\n  States also are eliminating many critical programs and reducing funds \navailable for those programs that remain.\n  Among the most vulnerable targets are those services that working \nfamilies rely on, such as childcare and elementary and secondary \neducation. Without funds, school improvements will not be made. \nLibraries will not be upgraded. Staff will be cut. Class sizes will \ndramatically increase.\n  All of this is happening today. As one school superintendent stated, \n``It is the worst thing that has happened in my thirty years in public \neducation.''\n  This comes at a time when, as a nation, we are striving to raise our \nchildren's test scores and improve overall school performance. In \naddition, in many states the cost of higher education is increasing. \nTuition at some State colleges and universities has been raised over 20 \npercent. Also vulnerable are programs that help those most in need \nduring difficult times.\n  States now bear the responsibility for numerous programs and services \nthat provide the safety net that our citizens rely on. For example, as \nwe know well, states fund a large percentage of the cost of Medicaid. \nDuring the current fiscal crisis, according to the Kaiser Commission on \nMedicaid and the Uninsured, Medicaid programs have been cut \nsubstantially. This will place an enormous burden on our society. \nStates clearly need funding to pay for Medicaid.\n  In addition, programs such as job-training, housing subsidies, and \nother services for lower-income citizens are at risk.\n  Most importantly, states now face extraordinary demands to provide \nthe protection citizens require in the new post-9/11 world. They face \nincreased responsibilities to patrol ports, bridges and tunnels, to \ntrain emergency response personnel, and to put in place the \ninfrastructure to protect their citizens.\n  In the current world, with threats on our home soil at high levels, \nand on the brink of a war with a nation accused of sponsoring \ninternational terrorism, we cannot abandon our States and cities. We \nmust give them the funds they need to protect our citizens.\n  The solution is to provide direct Federal aid to the States and \nlocalities within the budget. We have had bipartisan agreement to \nprovide $20 billion in direct Federal aid to the States and\n\n[[Page S6214]]\n\nlocalities on a one-time basis. I commend Senator Grassley for his \nleadership in getting this done. It is a very good start, but it not \nenough.\n  I have heard some argue that state aid is not good economic policy, \nbut numerous reports indicate that a very large number of economists \nbelieve that aid to the States is, in fact, an extremely effective \nmeans of providing fiscal stimulus, as it quickly puts money in the \nhands of people who need it and will spend it.\n  State and local aid also alleviates the need for States to cut more \njobs, cut more programs, and raise taxes, which acts as an \n``antistimulus'' on the economy. Without any State aid, an individual's \nor family's decreased in Federal taxes could be surpassed by an \nincrease in State and local taxes.\n  We should not support policies where, ``What one hand giveth the \nother taketh away.'' We should not ``rob Peter to pay Paul.''\n  This modest increase in the amount of aid is a one-time shot in the \narm for the States. It is not an enormous, multi-year change that \nthreatens to build more deficits. It is a short-term proposal in \nresponse to a crisis that threatens to further drag down our economy \nand further increase the tax burden on our citizens.\n  Some argue that States and cities have dug their own fiscal graves, \nand should now lie in them. I could not disagree more. Our States and \ncities face the same economic forces as the Federal Government. As the \neconomy has forced a dramatic reversal in fiscal health in our Federal \nbudget, so has it wreaked havoc on local budgets.\n  Why should we hold States and localities to a different standard than \nwe hold ourselves?\n  If we want to teach States a lesson, why should we force citizens to \nbear the brunt of that discipline through higher taxes on their income, \nbigger class sizes for their children, and less services for those in \nneed?\n  The money we are discussing is not a bailout. Nowhere close. States \nand locals will still need to make painful cuts and possibly raise \ntaxes. But we can help alleviate the pain which will fall not on \nlawmakers, as we all know, but on our citizens.\n  As President John Kennedy once said, ``Let us seek not the Democratic \nsolution or the Republican solution, but the right solution.''\n  This is the right solution. I fully and enthusiastically support \nSenator Murray's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I spoke earlier in support of the \nCollins amendment which is a $20 billion fiscal relief package. We have \nbeen told that $20 billion is a drop in the bucket. I don't think $20 \nbillion is a drop in the bucket. We have been told that maybe $75 \nbillion is not enough for State aid.\n  We have to be fiscally responsible as we approach this. I do not \nfault the good intentions behind people who have higher figures in \nmind, including the amendment by the Senator from Washington. There are \nMembers on both sides of the aisle for whom fiscal relief is a key \ncomponent of any larger tax and jobs package. I have worked hard to \naccommodate Members' priorities relative thereto.\n  A number of provisions in this amendment have been addressed by the \nState fiscal conservative relief amendment offered by Senator Collins. \nThe State fiscal relief amendment offered by Senator Collins represents \na significant boost to States. It provides $20 billion. To me, that is \nlots of money. This is much more money than some would like to spend at \nall. However, there will be those for whom no amount of spending will \never be enough.\n  I am not saying Senator Murray is one of those for whom no amount of \nmoney would ever be enough. All I am saying is that at some point we \nhave to determine a final dollar amount for State aid.\n  We have an amendment that provides $20 billion for States, and I \nthink we should stick with that number. Therefore, Senator Murray's \namendment at $40 billion is too expensive and must be opposed. I urge \nmy colleagues to vote against this amendment. I urge them to support \nthe Collins amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield whatever time the Senator from Washington \ndesires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I know there are many other Senators on \nthe floor who wish to speak to their amendments. Let me conclude this \namendment debate by saying how important it is for our States that are \nstruggling today with $75 billion or $80 billion in debt, that we do \neverything we can to get the economy going in a true economic stimulus \npackage to provide funds for those States to assure they do not lose \npeople off health care, that their education systems are intact, and \nthey have the ability to deal with their budget crisis and we don't add \nto it with fiscally irresponsible tax cuts that preclude them from \nbeing able to provide the services that are so critical today.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent all pending \namendments be temporarily set aside and the Senator from Michigan be \nrecognized for the purpose of offering an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection? Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 614\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan (Ms. Stabenow) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 614.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To ensure the enactment of a medicare prescription drug \n                                benefit)\n\n       At the end of end of subtitle C of title V, add the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. . ENSURING ENACTMENT OF A MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG \n                   BENEFIT.\n\n       (a) Trigger.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act, the provisions as described in subsection (b) shall not \n     take effect except as provided in subsection (c).\n       (b) Provision Described.--A provision described in this \n     subsection is--\n       (1) section 102 of this Act to the extent such section \n     accelerates the scheduled phase down of the top tax rate of \n     38.6 percent to 37.6 percent in 2004 and to 35 percent in \n     2006; and\n       (2) section 116(a)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986, as added by section 201 of this Act.\n       (c) Delay Until Enactment of a Medicare Prescription Drug \n     Benefit.--The provisions described in subsection (b) shall \n     apply to taxable years beginning in or after the calendar \n     year in which a prescription drug benefit under the medicare \n     program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) is enacted that is--\n       (1) available to all beneficiaries under such program; and\n       (2) actuarially equivalent to the Blue Cross and Blue \n     Shield benefit offered through the Federal employees health \n     benefits program.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I rise this evening to offer an \namendment that seeks to set the right priorities for us in the Senate \nand in the Congress as we move forward this year with the budget. My \namendment is simple. It says before the dividend tax cut and the \nacceleration of the top tax rate go into effect, Congress must pass a \nMedicare prescription drug bill that is actuarially equivalent to the \nvalue of the Blue Cross standard option under the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Program, known as FEHBP, for all Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  This is a question of our values and priorities. My amendment is a \npromise to our Nation's seniors. It says you are as important as the \nelite in this country; we are finally going to get something done; and \nthat it will be something that is equal to what we receive in the U.S. \nSenate. This is the third consecutive Congress that has considered \nadding an outpatient prescription drug benefit under Medicare. In the \nlast two Congresses we were unsuccessful. To be fair, we were \nunsuccessful with a Democratic President, a Republican President, a \nDemocratic Congress, a Republican Congress. The reality is we have not \nyet been able to\n\n[[Page S6215]]\n\ndeliver for our seniors the promise of prescription drug coverage under \nMedicare.\n  I believe the time is up. Our seniors and those who are disabled, who \ndepend on Medicare, are counting on us to get this done this year.\n  In order to be able to do that, we need to impose some discipline on \nourselves. We have to hold our feet to the fire in order to get this \ndone. This amendment says to the House and Senate and the \nadministration that we must all work together to pass a meaningful \nprescription drug benefit or a major component of the tax cut that is \nsupported by the majority will not go into effect.\n  I would like to make it clear that my amendment does not eliminate \nthe tax cuts on dividends or those for the people who pay the highest \nrates. As long as we pass a meaningful prescription drug benefit, these \ntax cuts would take effect as scheduled.\n  Having said that, I want to also indicate that I do not believe, from \nan economic standpoint, that is the best way to stimulate the economy. \nI agree with the over 450 economists who have said this will not create \njobs; it will not create growth. But if in fact there is support to \npass the tax breaks geared to the elite in the country, I ask my \ncolleagues to at least be willing to hold off. At least be willing to \nhold off until we can fulfill the promise of an outpatient prescription \ndrug benefit under Medicare.\n  My amendment says this should be available to all seniors, not just \nseniors in private insurance, as has been proposed by the President and \nby others, but all seniors should be able to get the same prescription \ndrug coverage.\n  In addition, this amendment says the prescription drug benefit we \npass should be actuarially equivalent to the plan that is most often \nused by Federal employees, including Members of Congress. In other \nwords--and I have heard other colleagues say this--the seniors of this \ncountry should get no less in prescription drug help than we get \nthrough our insurance plan. That is what my amendment says, simply. The \ntax cuts geared to the most wealthy among us, the elite in the country, \nshould wait until we can fulfill the promise of a prescription drug \nbenefit that is equal to what we receive as Members of the Senate.\n  I have heard many friends on the other side of the aisle extol the \nvirtues of our plan, the FEHBP plan. I have also heard the President \nand members of his administration make similar comments. They say a new \nprescription drug benefit should be modeled after the benefit in the \nFederal employee plan. In fact, on May 6 my distinguished colleague \nfrom Idaho, Senator Craig, held a hearing in the Aging Committee, which \nI am on, that highlighted the Federal employee program, its benefits, \nand so on. While the witnesses disagreed on whether it would be \nappropriate to go to the structure of that plan--and I have great \nconcerns about anything outside of Medicare--they all agree that this \nplan that we and other Federal employees have offers excellent \nprescription drug coverage for Federal employees.\n  I think most of us agree our seniors deserve the same opportunity to \nhave prescription drug coverage equal to what we or other Federal \nemployees receive. However, the current budget resolution does not \nallow for that. It does not provide for the resources to do that. So \ndespite the comments I have heard on a number of occasions from \ncolleagues that, in fact, we ought to be providing similar coverage, \nthe budget resolution does not provide the resources. So this, again, \nis a question of priorities. It is a question of values. What should \ncome first, fulfilling the promise of a quality prescription drug \nbenefit for our seniors under Medicare or proceeding with a tax cut \ngeared to the elite in this country?\n  I think it is particularly of concern that we focus on this, \nparticularly in light of the overwhelming evidence that those \nparticular tax cuts will not stimulate the economy in the short run, \nwill not create jobs, will not create growth. No matter how many times \nMembers say that, with all due respect, we have overwhelming evidence--\n450 economists, 10 Nobel laureates, concerns by Chairman Greenspan--and \nonly 13 economists on the side, saying it is a good idea.\n  Before we go ahead with something we know is not a short-term \nstimulus, doesn't create jobs, doesn't create growth, and, in fact, \ncreated red ink as far as the eye can see, I ask that we stop.\n  Whether Members wish to have a dividend tax cut and a top rate cut or \nwish not to, we should come together and agree we would not proceed \nuntil we provide prescription drug coverage that is quality and is \nsimilar to what we have as Members of the Senate.\n  This is a trigger. As I indicated, it is not eliminating those parts \nof the tax bill. It is simply a trigger on those.\n  If I might take just another moment on the broader issues of \nMedicare, on this question of whether we will have the resources to \nupdate Medicare to provide a real prescription drug benefit, one that \nwe could probably support because it would be similar to what we are \nable to receive as Members of the Senate. The larger issue is where we \nare going in terms of the huge national debt projected for the future. \nThe actual question is whether we will be able to meet our obligations \noverall for Medicare and Social Security in the long run without going \ninto more and more deficit.\n  I refer to the study that was recently done that indicates if we were \nto take the proposals that have been put forward by the President--I \nrealize in the Senate there is a modified version of that. We don't \nhave exactly this amendment in front of us. But if we are to take what \nthe President has suggested in totality over the next 75 years, we \nwould see a cost of over $14 trillion.\n  At the same time, the projected Medicare and Social Security deficit \nis $10 trillion.\n  I go back again to my concern that this an issue of priorities. We \nhave one proposal that creates a $14 trillion cost. At the same time \nthat we know we have an unfunded liability in Social Security and \nMedicare of $10 trillion, why in the world would we do that? Why in the \nworld would anybody? This is what the economists are talking about. \nOver 450 economists have come out against this, saying it will not \ncreate jobs; it will just create more massive debt; it will create \ninstability long term in the economy; it jeopardizes Medicare and \nSocial Security.\n  These are the numbers they are looking at. Why in the world would \nanybody with common sense looking at this say we ought to go in this \ndirection? If we didn't go in this direction, and if we agreed to the \namendment we are talking about, we would be sending a clear message \nthat we are committed to really providing Medicare prescription drug \ncoverage and not just talking about it for another session but really \nproviding it for our seniors and for the disabled. And we would be \nsending a message that we are making a long-term commitment to Medicare \nand Social Security.\n  My fear is, if we proceed down the road as we currently are as a \nCongress, that we are creating a situation which will lend itself to \nthe argument of those who say we can't afford Medicare and Social \nSecurity anymore. We heard that. We heard we can't afford prescription \ndrug coverage; we can't afford Medicare as we know it; we can't afford \nSocial Security as we know it. We can afford to update it for \nprescription drugs if we do not pass irresponsible tax policy that \ncreates trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.\n  That is my concern overall. I am hopeful that we will reconsider \nthis. I am very hopeful that in the meantime, regardless of the broader \npicture, colleagues will join to be able to send a strong message that \nwe are going to put the seniors of the country first and a real \nprescription drug benefit first. As many colleagues have said, our \nseniors deserve the same kind of benefit that we receive in the Senate. \nThis amendment would allow that to happen.\n  With the passage of these other provisions, it then would allow them \nto take effect after the prescription drug benefit is passed.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time. I yield to my colleagues who are \npossibly wishing to speak. I would like the opportunity to respond at \nthe appropriate time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I see my distinguished colleague from\n\n[[Page S6216]]\n\nOhio who arrived a few moments before me. I simply ask of my colleague \nwhether I can proceed for 4 or 5 minutes without being disruptive to \nthe statement on which he is proceeding.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I am happy to yield my distinguished colleague 3 or 4 \nminutes prior to submitting my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to lay the \npending amendments aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 550, As Modified\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. WARNER], for himself and Ms. \n     Collins, Mr. Allen, Mr. Craig, and Ms. Murkowski, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 550, as modified.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the \n above-the-line deduction for teacher classroom supplies and to expand \n such deduction to include qualified professional development expenses)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title V, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. EXPANSION OF ABOVE-THE-LINE DEDUCTION FOR CERTAIN \n                   EXPENSES OF ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL \n                   TEACHERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subparagraph (D) of section 62(a)(2) \n     (relating to certain trade and business deductions of \n     employees) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(D) Certain expenses of elementary and secondary school \n     teachers.--The deductions allowed by section 162 which \n     consist of expenses, not in excess of $400, paid or incurred \n     by an eligible educator--\n       ``(i) by reason of the participation of the educator in \n     professional development courses related to the curriculum \n     and academic subjects in which the educator provides \n     instruction or to the students for which the educator \n     provides instruction, and\n       ``(ii) in connection with books, supplies (other than \n     nonathletic supplies for courses of instruction in health or \n     physical education), computer equipment (including related \n     software and services) and other equipment, and supplementary \n     materials used by the eligible educator in the classroom.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2002.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer. I thank the managers of this bill and my colleague from Ohio.\n  I will proceed for a few minutes with regard to amendment No. 550, in \nwhich I am privileged to be joined by Senators Collins, Allen, Craig, \nand Murkowski, the Presiding Officer. It relates to the teachers of \nAmerica.\n  I learned, as other colleagues have learned on their trips to \nschools, to my utter astonishment that so many teachers reach into \ntheir own pockets and take their own dollars, after paying taxes in \nthose instances where they pay taxes, and buy school supplies for the \nchildren. They have to use their own money for further teacher \neducation.\n  Last year, the Congress of the United States, at the initiative of \nmyself and many others, finally passed a law by which they got a $250 \nabove-the-line deduction. That was a remarkable achievement \nlegislatively. Unfortunately, that piece of legislation sunsets at the \nend of this calendar year.\n  The purpose of this amendment is, first, to increase $250 to $400 as \nthe amount of deduction and, second, to enable that amendment now, by \nvirtue of this amendment, to become permanent law so that they can plan \ntheir futures a little bit better. This deduction will be there for \nthose wonderful and courageous teacher expenditures which they take out \nof their own pockets. I find it to be very touching.\n  I was talking to my colleague from Ohio while waiting to take the \nfloor, and he told me that at the time he was Governor, they put \nsimilar legislation into State law. This, of course, will be Federal \nlaw and apply to all 50 States.\n  This amendment will make this important tax benefit permanent for our \nteachers. In addition, it will increase the above the line deduction to \n$400 and expand the allowable uses for the deduction to include \nprofessional development expenses.\n  It is important to note that the President's budget calls for this \ntax relief. I also note that the amendment has been endorsed by the \nNational Education Association.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe NEA endorsing my amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe record, as follows:\n\n                               National Education Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 2003.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: On behalf of the National Education \n     Association's (NEA) 2.7 million members, we urge your support \n     for the Warner amendment on teacher tax deductions when it is \n     offered during consideration of the tax reduction plan. A \n     similar amendment was approved by the Senate during the last \n     Congress by a vote of 98-2. This year's vote may be included \n     in the NEA Legislative Report Card for the 108th Congress.\n       The Warner amendment, which was originally introduced as \n     the Teacher Tax Relief Act (S. 695), would increase to $500 \n     and make permanent a tax deduction for educators' out-of-\n     pocket classroom supply expenses. The amendment also would \n     help educators access quality training, much of it mandated \n     by the No Child Left Behind Act, by expanding the deduction \n     to include professional development.\n       Last year, Congress enacted a $250 tax deduction for \n     educators' out-of-pocket expenses as part of the economic \n     stimulus package. The current deduction expires at the end of \n     the year. The Warner amendment would make a real difference \n     for many educators, who often sacrifice other personal needs \n     in order to pay for classroom supplies and professional \n     development. Two important reasons for supporting this \n     amendment are:\n       According to a study by the research firm Quality Education \n     Data, a division of Scholastic, elementary school teachers \n     spend more than $1 billion a year on classroom supplies. The \n     study found that the average elementary educator spends $521 \n     annually, with first-year teachers spending over $700 a year \n     for classroom supplies.\n       Teacher quality is the single most critical factor in \n     maximizing student achievement. Ongoing professional \n     development is essential to ensure that educators stay up-to-\n     date on the skills and knowledge necessary to prepare \n     students for the challenges of the 21st century.\n       We urge you to support this important amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n     Diane Shust,\n       Director of Government Relations.\n     Randall Moody,\n       Manager of Federal Relations.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, why do teachers need this kind of \nrelief? It is now estimated that the average teacher spends $521 out of \ntheir own pocket each year on classroom materials--materials such as \npens, pencils and books. First-year teachers spend even more, averaging \n$701 a year on classroom expenses.\n  Why do they do this? Simply because school budgets are not adequate \nto meet the costs of education. Our teachers dip into their own pocket \nto better the education of America's youth.\n  Moreover, in addition to spending substantial money on classroom \nsupplies, many teachers spend even more money out of their own pocket \non professional development. Such expenses include tuition, fees, \nbooks, and supplies associated with courses that help our teachers \nbecome even better instructors.\n  The fact is that these out-of-pocket costs place lasting financial \nburdens on our teachers. This is one reason our teachers are leaving \nthe profession. Little wonder that our country is in the midst of a \nteacher shortage.\n  Without a doubt the Teacher Tax Relief Act of 2001 took a step \nforward in helping to alleviate the Nation's teaching shortage by \nproviding a $250 above-the-line deduction for classroom expenses.\n  However, it is clear that our teachers are spending much more than \n$250 a year out of their own pockets to better the education of our \nchildren.\n  This amendment that I have offered today is the same as the \nadministration's request. Again, the amendment will increase the above-\nthe-line deduction for educators from $250 allowed under the current \nlaw to $400; allow educators to include professional development costs \nwithin that $400 deduction (under current law, up to $250 is deductible \nbut only for classroom expenses); and make the Teacher Tax relief \nprovisions in the law permanent.\n\n[[Page S6217]]\n\nCurrent law sunsets the teacher tax provisions at the end of this year.\n  Our teachers have made a personal commitment to educate the next \ngeneration and to strengthen America. And, in my view, the Federal \nGovernment should recognize the many sacrifices our teachers make in \ntheir career.\n  This amendment is another step forward in providing our educators \nwith the recognition they deserve.\n  In my view, America's teachers deserve better.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an analysis of the President's budget \nrequest which depicts exactly the same amendment about which I am \nspeaking also be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\nExtend, increase and expand the above-the-line deduction for qualified \n                    out-of-pocket classroom expenses\n\n       Under current law, teachers who itemize deductions (do not \n     use the standard deduction) and incur unreimbursed, job-\n     related expenses are allowed to deduct those expenses to the \n     extent that when combined with other miscellaneous itemized \n     deductions they exceed two percent of AGI. Current law also \n     allows certain teachers and other elementary and secondary \n     school professionals to treat up to $250 in annual qualified \n     out-of-pocket classroom expenses as a non-itemized deductions \n     (above-the-line deduction), effective for expenses incurred \n     in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2001 and before \n     January 1, 2004. Unreimbursed expenditures for certain books, \n     supplies and equipment related to classroom instruction \n     qualify for the above-the-line deduction. Expenses claimed as \n     an above-the-line deduction cannot be claimed as an itemized \n     deduction. The Administration proposes to extend the above-\n     the-line deduction to apply to qualified out-of-pocket \n     expenditures incurred after December 31, 2003, to increase \n     the deduction to $400, and to expand the deduction to apply \n     to unreimbursed expenditures for certain professional \n     training programs.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, the amendment is in compliance with the \nPresident's program. It is the desire of this National Education \nAssociation just to take existing law, make it permanent, and to \nincrease it to $400, given the calculations of the amounts that are \nexpended each year by teachers all across America, which is larger than \nexisting law, $250.\n  I appreciate the indulgence of my colleagues. I hope this amendment \nwill receive the support of the Senate tomorrow as we proceed to vote.\n  I thank my colleague from Ohio and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be temporarily laid aside so the Senator from Ohio may offer \nan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Thank you, Madam President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 592\n\n  Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Voinovich] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 592.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are \n     necessary to the Commission to carry out this Act.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I rise today to commend Chairman \nGrassley for the outstanding job he has done to bring this \nreconciliation bill to the floor and to focus attention on our urgent \nneed to address fundamental tax reform.\n  When the Senate enacted the budget resolution for fiscal year 2004, \nit presented Chairman Grassley with a very difficult challenge--to \nreport to the Senate meaningful, stimulative tax deductions while \nkeeping the overall growth in the deficit below $350 billion. Many \nobservers, in and out of Congress, considered that task impossible. But \nI believe the Finance Committee has accomplished that goal.\n\n  The reconciliation bill before the Senate today contains $430 billion \nin tax cuts and $80 billion in offsets, for a net cost of $350 billion. \nEqually important, both the tax cuts and the offsets are real. The \nJoint Committee on Taxation, a highly respected, neutral scorekeeper, \nhas analyzed this bill and certifies the revenue effects of both the \ntax cuts and the offsets.\n  Many people claim this economic growth package is too small and they \nwould like to see larger tax relief for small businesses and working \nfamilies. So would I, but only if we can offset the additional cost. \nAnd some people claim the tax cuts are too large and will limit funds \navailable to low-income support programs. I sympathize with their \nconcern, but we must recognize that the most effective low-income \nsupport program is a job. And we can only provide jobs by jump-starting \nthe economy.\n  Too many of our fellow Americans are out of work, too many of our \nfellow Americans are worried about whether they are going to have a \njob. Small business owners and investors in Ohio have told me this is a \ngood plan that will help them create jobs in my State. We accelerate \nthe reduction of tax rates, we end the marriage penalty, we accelerate \nsmall business depreciation, we increase the size of the child tax \ncredit, and we begin to eliminate the double taxation of dividends.\n  Another area of contention is the nature of the offsets. It is in \nthis area, more than any other, that Senator Grassley has been unjustly \ncriticized. He was asked to produce offsets that would limit the total \ncost of tax reform to $350 billion, and he has done it.\n  Members of Congress who oppose some or all of the offsets because of \ntheir impact on special interest groups have had ample time to present \ntheir own alternatives and failed to do so. It is easy to criticize, \nbut it is difficult to legislate. Let us acknowledge that regardless of \nour individual opinions regarding the offset package Chairman Grassley \nand a majority of his committee have chosen to legislate.\n  However, the current disagreements over the offset package inevitably \nbegs the question: Why is the Tax Code so complicated? How did we get \ninto this situation? And how can we return to a simple, fair, and \nhonest Tax Code? What is stimulative to the economy? What isn't \nstimulative? What tax expenditures came in several years ago which are \nno longer relevant? All these issues need to be discussed. That is why \nI am offering this amendment.\n  Many of my colleagues have said: We need fundamental tax reform, but \nnow is not the time. I have heard that over and over. I have heard that \nfor years: Tax reform but now is not the time.\n  I think the debate over offsets demonstrates this is precisely the \ntime to abandon piecemeal tinkering and embrace fundamental tax reform. \nThis Congress--not the next or the one after that--should seize the \nopportunity to focus national attention on the need for comprehensive \ntax reform in the United States of America.\n  I am proposing the establishment of a commission to examine the Tax \nCode from top to bottom. And I recommend fundamental restructuring. The \ngoal of any Government revenue program should be to raise sufficient \nfunds to operate public programs with the minimum disruption of the \neconomy. Tax structures should be simple, fair, effective, and honest. \nOur current Tax Code achieves none--none--of these objectives.\n\n  Proof of the complexity of our current Tax Code is demonstrated by a \nfew, simple observations:\n  The Internal Revenue Code consists of approximately 1,395,000 words.\n  There are 693 sections of the Internal Revenue Code that are \napplicable to individual taxpayers; 1,501 sections applicable to \nbusinesses; 445 sections applicable to tax-exempt organizations, \nemployee plans, and governments.\n  As of June 2000, the Treasury Department had issued almost 20,000 \npages of regulations containing over 8 million words.\n  The current 1040A short form has doubled the number of lines that \nonce appeared on the 1945 version of the standard 1040 tax return. It \nhas an 85-page instruction booklet which now tops the long form 1040 \ninstructions published just 7 years ago. This is the short form, 85 \npages; and it is more than the instructions that we had 7 years ago on \nthe long form.\n  The IRS prints at least 1,101 publications, forms, and instructions, \ncontaining 16,339 pages, up from 943 documents with 12,933 pages. That \nis 2 years ago.\n  Over 56 percent of the taxpayers in this country need professional \npeople to help them prepare their tax return.\n  Americans toil for about--listen to this--6.4 billion hours on tax \nforms and recordkeeping, accounting for 84 percent of the Federal \nGovernment's paperwork burden in this country. And that is associated \nwith the Internal Revenue Code. This only includes financial \nrecordkeeping and tax preparation, and these estimates may be too low \nsince they ignore the countless hours spent on tax minimization \nstrategies. Everybody is working to figure out a way not to pay taxes.\n  Included among the items of needless complexity today are the \nfollowing:\n  An alternative minimum tax that treats items such as dependent \nexemptions as tax shelters, thereby threatening to tax millions who \nnever were meant to be affected; phaseout after phaseout of such \nallowances as itemized deductions, earned-income tax credits, personal \nexemptions, eligibility for IRAs, eligibility for other savings \nincentives, eligibility for educational tax breaks; and each of these \nis like an additional minimum tax system all of itself, forcing \ntaxpayers to file multiple schedules for each form.\n  I have a very simple return. I do not have that much. But the \nschedules that are connected with my return are unbelievable. I am sure \nmy colleagues who think about it think about all the time they spend on \npreparing their own individual tax returns.\n  Also, included among the many items of needless complexity today are:\n  Pension and saving incentives that add administrative costs and \npossibly even reduce net savings by providing different rules for \nwithdrawals, penalties, Social Security tax treatment, allowable \namounts of exclusion or deduction, and so on; a tax treatment of \ndependent children that needlessly causes millions of unnecessary tax \nreturns to be filed; a capital gains law with at least seven different \ntax rates, and that requires taxpayers to fill out pages of forms even \nwhen they have only a few dollars of capital gains; complicated rules \nfor charitable deductions and charities, including multiple limits on \ngiving as a percent of income, and a perverse excise tax on foundations \nthat actually discourages charitable giving; child credits and \ndependent exemptions that could easily be folded into one; and \nunnecessarily strict estimated tax rules that pick up very little extra \nrevenue for all the complexity they introduce.\n\n  It is unbelievable.\n  One of the most disturbing aspects of this current Tax Code is the \nalmost continual growth of so-called tax expenditures. Essentially, \nthey increase the level of tax rates far beyond what is necessary, and \nthen mitigate the impact with incentives to special interest groups. It \nis the Government equivalent of jacking up prices in the grocery store, \nand then accepting coupons at the checkout counter.\n\n[[Page S6219]]\n\n  Private sector investment becomes distorted by tax provisions \nencouraging both individuals and corporations to allocate their funds \nto minimize their taxes rather than to maximize their income. \nUltimately, most people end up paying more than they should for both \ntheir groceries and their taxes.\n  According to a recent article in the Washington Post, many leading \ntax reform advocates believe the only solution for this dilemma is to \npropose new and different tax cuts every year. Although I sympathize \nwith their goal, it will not provide the most effective reforms that \nmeet the ultimate test the American people demand: a Tax Code that is \nfair, simple, and honest. Tax reform, like surgery, is best done \nquickly. Do you hear that? Tax reform, like surgery, is best done \nquickly and infrequently rather than slowly and often.\n  That is why I am proposing a commission to propose comprehensive \nreform that can be enacted at once, implemented quickly, and establish \na fair, simple, honest, and effective revenue structure for the next \ngeneration.\n  This commission will examine all aspects of the Federal revenues, \nincluding individual taxes, corporate taxes, capital gains taxes, \nexcise taxes, user fees, taxes on dividends, tax deductions, tax \ncredits, and tax complexity.\n  The commission will recommend fundamental reforms that can be enacted \nin a single reform package and implemented quickly. It will allow \nCongress and the Nation to focus on tax reform, devise a simple, fair, \nhonest solution, and move on to other priorities.\n  The current debate clearly demonstrates the system is broken and \nnow--not next year, or the year after--now is the time to fix the \nproblem.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I think the Senator from Ohio is on \ntarget. It makes excellent sense for the United States to set up some \nkind of a tax commission to take a good, hard look at our tax \nstructure. As I listened to the Senator's amendment being read, one \nthought came to my mind, though. That is, commissions sometimes work \nand sometimes they don't work. And the goal here, clearly, if we do \nthis, is to make it work.\n  That begs the question, how do you make it work? How do you make it \nworthwhile, not just some outfit drawing conclusions that are put on \nthe shelf to gather dust. Most commission recommendations are put on \nthe shelf to gather dust.\n  The one commission that comes to my mind that really has worked--and \nI can think of many that have not--is the commission on Social Security \nback in the early 1980s, when President Reagan nominated Chairman \nGreenspan to head the commission on Social Security. Various Senators \nwere on the commission. Senator Dole was on the commission, and Senator \nMoynihan. They had a job to do, and they did a pretty good job. It was \nnot political. The President, both bodies of Congress, both political \nparties, all got together and worked with members on the commission to \ncome up with recommendations to save Social Security.\n  Two points: One is, the membership is people who really want to do a \ngood job. They work together. There is not any political sniping, no \npartisan rhetoric. They work together. And it is very important that \nthe composition of the commission be people who do want to work \ntogether; that is, the commission not be stacked.\n  The second point is at that time there was a crisis. Social Security \nwas about to go belly up. A crisis generally creates solutions and \nresults. The complexity of the U.S. Tax Code and the increasing \ncomplexity of the Tax Code may have become a crisis in the nature of \nSocial Security back in the early 1980s; I don't know.\n  I am saying to the Senator from Ohio: It is a good amendment. As most \nthings in life, it is the followthrough that counts, the followup that \ncounts. It is making sure that if we do this, the right people are \nappointed. I say that in part because when I listened to the Senator, \nhe mentioned two members appointed by the majority leader, one by the \nminority leader, three by the President, and also the House. It has the \npossibility of being a stacked deck, possibility of being a partisan \ncommission. That is the last thing we need around here is a partisan \ncommission on tax reform.\n  I would like to work with the Senator, and I know other Senators \nwould like to work with him, to do the very best we can to make sure \nthis is not a stacked deck, and it is not therefore a commission whose \nrecommendations collect dust on some shelf somewhere but rather \nsomething that makes good sense.\n  One other point I might mention while the Senator from Ohio is here. \nI know the Senator is wondering, just as I think most Senators in this \nbody are wondering, what is the real effect of dividend exclusion. What \neffect does it really have. There are a lot of people who have lots of \nideas. A lot of economists have spoken on the effect of excluding \ndividends from income. I think in theory most of us agree there is some \ninequity between the taxation of equity and the taxation of debt with \nrespect to companies' decisions as to whether to invest or investor \ndecisions as to whether to invest.\n\n  One point that often rises in the debate is the wealth effect. What \nis the wealth effect of a significant reduction in dividend income? Who \nknows, really? There are all kinds of analyses; different people have \ndifferent points of view. We are trying to do our best to try to get \nopinions of people who really don't have an axe to grind, of people who \nreally, as far as we can tell, are pretty straight, who have their \nheads screwed on straight and they are trying to give us the right \nrecommendation rather than spoon-feed us some political agenda from any \nside.\n  I am trying to do the best I can by trying to find people who are \nprobably neutral. The three organizations I looked at that have \nanalyzed the wealth effect of the President's dividend proposal are \nBrookings Institute, McKinsey & Company, and Goldman Sachs is the \nthird. Let me go through first the Brookings analysis briefly. I think \nit is instructive.\n  The total value of equities held by households in the United States \nis $10 trillion. That is, the total value of all equities held by \nhouseholds is $10 trillion. I will get to institutional investors in \njust a moment.\n  The reasonable estimate of the stock price increase due to the \nPresident's dividend proposal, according to Brookings' analysis, is 5 \npercent. The increase in value effect of equities held by households as \na result of the stock price increase is about $500 billion. The next \nquestion is what is the wealth effect, how much effect of that \nincrease, if it is 5 percent, is going to be translated into spending \nin the economy.\n  The Brookings analysis is that the wealth effect--that is, the \npercent of wealth increase that is consumed rather than saved by \nhouseholds--will be 3 to 5 percent. So that means the increase in \nconsumption as a result of the wealth effect is about $15- to $25-\nbillion, which is about .14 percent to .23 percent of GDP. We all know \nthat usually to have a real stimulus in the economy you need somewhere \nbetween 1 and 1.5 percent; and .14 and .23 is certainly very small \ncompared with 1 percent or 1.5. That is the Brookings analysis.\n  The McKinsey Company's analysis is very similar. I want to read a \nquote from the McKinsey analysis. I think it is instructive. It says:\n\n       But the proposed tax cut (eliminate tax on dividends) isn't \n     likely to have a major lasting effect on US share prices, \n     primarily because the key investors who drive them are \n     already exempt from taxes. What little impact the proposal \n     may have was probably reflected in the 2.2 percent gain in \n     the S 500 the day before it was announced.\n\n  Continuing on to quote:\n\n       Those who believe otherwise draw on classic finance theory. \n     In a world without taxes, theory suggests, shareholders would \n     be indifferent to whether a corporation paid dividends, since \n     the funds to do so would come at the shareholders' own \n     expense. In a world with taxes, shareholders may face \n     different tax rates on, for example, dividends as opposed to \n     capital gains. They would care whether a company retained its \n     earnings or distributed those earnings as dividends, because \n     this would affect how much they got to keep. If all investors \n     paid taxes on dividends, yes, share prices probably would \n     rise if the tax were eliminated.\n       The fact, however, is that tax-paying US individual \n     shareholders own a minority of all US shares--\n\n  That is, about 28 percent. That is, individuals own about 28 percent.\n\n     whereas tax exempt US institutions and individuals who hold \n     shares in tax-exempt accounts own 61 percent. (The remainder \n     was\n\n[[Page S6220]]\n\n     in foreign hands.) For the most part, tax-paying individual \n     shareholders don't drive share prices, whereas nontax-paying \n     institutional investors do: the trading activity of a \n     company's top 40 to 100 investors--again, usually big \n     institutional investors--accounts for 70 percent of its stock \n     price movement.\n       Since these investors are indifferent to the issue of taxes \n     on dividends [because they are tax exempt] they are unlikely \n     to set in motion the kinds of changes in their portfolios \n     that would drive up share prices.\n\n  I will soon yield to the Senator from Ohio.\n  The third reason Goldman Sachs gave in their review is that it would \ngenerate no more than a 5 percent increase in stock prices. That is the \nGoldman Sachs view.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I will soon ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  Second of all, the ranking member of the Finance Committee and I sat \nin on meetings together as part of the centrist coalition. The thing \nthat impressed me, when we met with Alan Greenspan, was the fact--and \nhe has said this publicly since the time we had our private meeting \nwith him--that the most significant thing we could do to aid the \neconomy was to eliminate double taxation, eliminate the tax on \ndividends, although it was a short-term benefit, he said, but something \nsystemic needs to be done to better the Tax Code.\n  You can argue the dividend issue any way you want, but what I usually \ndo is ask the people back in Ohio how they feel about it. No. 1, many \nof our businesses that have defined pension plans, because their stock \nis down, are going to be asked for an enormous amount of money to be \ndeposited in those fine pension plans, which they don't have. Other \ncorporations have told me that if their stock price gets a bump, they \nwill issue stock and they will get cash that way so they won't have to \nborrow it the way they are now borrowing the money.\n  In addition, there are many people, such as my son George, who have \nretirement accounts, who have seen those retirement accounts go down in \nvalue. There are millions of Americans in that same position. Other \nAmericans, who are in a better position, have seen a vast amount of \nwealth disappear in the stock market. Many of them say to me that \neliminating the tax on dividends will give a bump to the market. \nBecause the market will get a bump up, they are going to feel a little \nbetter about the future and, as a result of that, will be more likely \nto spend some money.\n\n  So you can argue this any way you want.\n  I have other people who say to me, if you do this, it is going to \nimpact on municipal bonds, affect real estate trusts, and eliminate or \nhave an impact on the low-income housing tax credit.\n  So that is the issue we are talking about here. We will talk about \nthat today and tomorrow.\n  What we really need to do is put all of this on a table and not do it \nas part of this stimulus package, and have tax reform, so we can start \nto look at the wealth factor and look at whether it makes a difference \nin terms of our economy. We have tax loopholes and tax expenditures \nthat are really no longer relevant. We can take that money and put it \ninto something elsewhere. We can reduce taxes and provide something \nthat would be really helpful to the economy. But we don't do that \naround here. We take things from day to day, week to week, year to \nyear.\n  I say to the ranking member of the Finance Committee, my \ndistinguished colleague, if the commission membership is not what it \nought to be, I am glad to rewrite it so that it is entirely impartial, \nso it will get the job done. I want to get the job done. I would like \nto have a commission such as they had in 1983 when we looked at Social \nSecurity. They did a good job. I think we ought to do that again. I \nthink a lot of people agree on that. But unless we get at it now, it \nwill not happen, we will let it go, and it will be something else next \nyear.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I appreciate what the Senator said, and \nhe is correct. We have had all kinds of theories, and it is hard to \ntell what is the most accurate. Maybe we should just not pass this bill \nbecause we are going to make the Code that much more complex by passing \nthis legislation, and so we will at least be giving the commission a \nbit of a break. I appreciate what the Senator has said.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be temporarily laid aside so the Senator from Florida may \noffer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 617\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Madam President, I send an amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 617.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nfurther reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Today, the Senate began consideration of the \nJobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. This is an \nappropriately named act because the economy is very much in need of \nassistance.\n  The President's mishandling of the economy since January 20, 2001, is \nalmost incredible. Two million-plus Americans have lost their jobs \nsince that date. We have seen a 50 percent increase in the unemployment \nrate to last month's 6 percent. The stock market has lost a quarter of \nits value. There has been a $7 trillion turn in the Federal \nGovernment's finances--from a $5 billion projected surplus to today's \n$2 trillion projected addition to the national debt.\n  The CBO's most recent estimate is that the deficit this year will top \n$350 billion--the largest annual deficit ever. Economic growth has been \nanemic--on average, 1 percent, and consumer confidence has dropped 34 \npercentage points.\n  What has been the response to this dismal economic record? The \nPresident has proposed the same prescription that he proposes for \nnearly all of our mounting domestic problems: tax cuts for the very \nwealthy.\n  Madam President, I don't think we have a problem; we have at least \nthree interconnecting challenges. The first is to regenerate a moribund \nnational economy; the second is to prepare for the next decade, when \nour Government will be faced with enormous additional expenses, \nparticularly in Social Security and Medicare; and finally, the \nimmediate crisis that is occurring because of our States' financial \npositions and what that is doing to wage loss, benefits loss, and a \ndenial of the services that represent the ultimate safety net under \nmuch of our population.\n  The bill the Finance Committee has reported very closely follows the \nPresident's plan. There are two fundamental aspects of this plan with \nwhich I take the strongest exception. First, the mix of tax cuts that \nit includes will do little to stimulate the economy, which we \ndesperately need. Second, the cost of this program is not offset, so \nFederal deficits and the debts that we will pass on to our children and \ngrandchildren will grow even greater.\n  Why is a stimulus important--a real stimulus? It is important because \nconsumer spending makes up two-thirds of our economy; so as consumers \ngo, so goes our economy. The economy is struggling today not because we \ndon't produce enough goods and services in the United States but \nbecause consumers are reluctant to spend what they have to purchase \nthose goods and services.\n  Madam President, I would like to direct your and my colleagues' \nattention to this picture. This picture was taken on a desert airport \nin Senator Kyl's State of Arizona. It is a picture of a portion of the \nover 300 commercial airliners currently parked on that airfield.\n  I submit these airplanes are not parked on the airfield in Arizona \nbecause Boeing cannot build enough airplanes. They are parked there \nbecause there are not enough passengers who want to or are able to or \nare willing to fly in those airplanes.\n\n[[Page S6221]]\n\n  This administration, in spite of that fundamental truth, has pursued \na plan that does not emphasize demand-side stimulus. The administration \nbelieves producing goods and services is more important than selling \nthose goods and services.\n  This picture of airplanes parked is evidence that producing goods is \nnot enough. For the economy to get back on track, more Americans must \nshop at our malls, go out to eat, and buy airline tickets. Putting more \nmoney quickly into the hands of those who are the most likely to spend \nit is the best formula for jump-starting this economy.\n  Rather than spread tax cuts broadly to spur consumer demand, the \nPresident's plan directs most of the tax cuts to the wealthiest \ntaxpayers. President Bush believes we need to reduce the tax burden on \ninvestment by completely exempting dividend income from the income tax. \nBy doing so, President Bush hopes to spur savings and investments. \nBusinesses are not going to make such investments when today, on \naverage, they are only using 75 percent of their capacity.\n  The plan I offer today provides substantial tax relief for all \nworking Americans. My plan will give to the typical two-working-member \nfamily paycheck tax relief of up to $1,530 this year and again $1,530 \nnext year. Let me recite a couple of recent experiences.\n  Last Friday, I taught school at Oyster River High School in Durham, \nNH. I talked to some of the teachers at that school. Very few of them \nare invested in the stock market. Those who are invested in the stock \nmarket are invested generally through a plan, such as a 401(k) \nretirement plan, where the dividends are already exempt from taxation. \nSo they will get zero benefit from this plan.\n  On Sunday of this week, I worked at Drake's Diner in Des Moines, IA. \nI talked to the bus boys, the waiters, the cooks, and the dishwashers. \nI tell you, their salary level is not sufficient for them to have a \nsignificant presence in the stock market. This paycheck relief plan \nwill put real money in the pockets of real Americans who will spend it \nto stimulate the demand that is so critical to getting this economy \njump-started. This paycheck tax relief will inject $200 billion into \nthe economy over the next 2 years.\n  During the Finance Committee markup, some criticized the wage tax as \nbeing a threat to the finances of the Social Security trust fund. That \nargument is a red herring and has no basis. My amendment makes \nabsolutely no changes to the payroll taxes paid by employers and \nemployees and, therefore, does not affect one thin dime of the revenues \nthat go in to the Social Security and the Medicare trust funds.\n  My amendment provides a refundable income tax credit for workers \ndesigned to provide the same benefits as would a temporary reduction in \nthe payroll tax.\n  My plan also includes tax relief for small businesses. It \nsubstantially increases the amount of machinery and equipment that a \nsmall business can deduct; therefore, creating an incentive for that \nbusiness to make its investment now when we need it as opposed to \ndeferring it to a future date.\n\n  My amendment will provide States with over $40 billion in aid over \nthe next 12 months. This temporary assistance is provided to the States \nby the Federal Government, increasing its share of Medicaid costs.\n  Greater assistance from the Federal Government will help forestall \ndrastic cuts in State health programs that will affect those least able \nto absorb them. Directing relief to the Medicaid reimbursement rate is \nthe most efficient means by which to get these funds to the States.\n  Finally, my plan bolsters unemployment compensation benefits. Many of \nthose over 2 million people who have lost their jobs since January 20, \n2001, have lost them for a considerable period of time and, thus, have \nexhausted both their State and now their Federal unemployment benefits. \nMy proposal would extend the Federal program, which is currently \nscheduled to expire at the end of this month, through November. It \nwould provide 26 weeks of benefits to those who are struggling to find \nwork in this stagnant economy. It would also provide 13 weeks of \nbenefits to the approximately 1 million workers who had exhausted their \nbenefits before the end of last year but who were excluded from the \nextended program which we enacted in January.\n  Finally, this proposal gives the States the option of modernizing \ntheir unemployment compensation programs to better cover part-time and \nlow-wage workers.\n  In summary, the plan I have submitted will stimulate demand and, \nthus, has the better opportunity to stimulate the economy. It focuses \nall the money in the next 24 months, as Senator Nelson from Nebraska \ncommented that one of his objections to several of the proposals was \nthey would spread the money out over a 10-year period and, in the case \nof the President's plan, an infinite period because the tax cuts would \nstay in effect assumedly until Congress acted to do otherwise, whereas \nwhat we need to do is the money that is available to stimulate the \neconomy needs to be focused in the period when the economy needs \nstimulation.\n  Finally, this plan is fair. It treats all Americans, whether they are \nteaching school in Oyster River or whether they are busing tables at \nDrake's Diner, fairly and gives them an opportunity to be part of the \nrecovery of the American economy.\n  Maybe even more important, my plan does not ask our children and \ngrandchildren to foot our bill. We have had an incredible buildup of \ndebt. If I could use as an example my own family. My father was born in \n1885. On the day he was born, he inherited, as his share of the Federal \nnational debt, $33. I was born in 1936. On the day I was born, I \ninherited a national debt of $264. My oldest daughter was born in 1963. \nWhen she was born, she inherited as her portion of the national debt \n$1,634. The last number I am going to give you is stunning, almost \nunbelievable. My youngest granddaughter was born 3 years ago. When she \nwas born, her share of the national debt was $20,163.\n  In four generations of one American family, we have gone from $33, as \nthat citizen's portion of the national debt, to $20,163. This expansion \nof debt is not only immoral, it is also bad economics. By putting the \ncost of their tax plan on the Nation's credit card, the President \njeopardizes the very economic growth we hope to stimulate.\n  Increasing the debt reduces national safety, crowds out private \nsector borrowing, increases the cost of capital for the private sector, \nand ultimately reduces economic potential. Even further, there is a \ncommonsense reason to offset the cost of the stimulus bill so that it \ndoes not increase the national debt. In just 8 years, the first wave of \nthe baby boom generation, born after World War II, will become eligible \nfor full Social Security and Medicare benefits.\n  Today, there are 39\\1/2\\ million Americans eligible for Social \nSecurity and Medicare full benefits. In the year 2011, 8 years from \ntoday, when the first of the baby boomers become eligible, there will \nbe 45 million. At the time when the last of the baby boomers turn 65, \nwhich will be in the year 2030, there will be nearly 72 million \nparticipants in these two programs.\n  Those numbers are hard to comprehend, but what they say is that our \nFederal Government has entered into a contract with our citizens paying \nthrough this very payroll tax that we discussed earlier, with the \nexpectation that upon retirement, they will have purchased some \nbenefits, both economic and medical security.\n  My plan is fully offset, primarily by suspending some of the tax cuts \nenacted in 2001, tax cuts that have yet to go into effect. My proposal \nsuspends the reductions in the top three income tax rates planned to go \nin effect in 2004 and in 2006. My plan freezes the planned cuts in the \nestate tax scheduled beyond 2006. My plan also clamps down on those \nAmericans who avoid paying taxes by investing in abusive tax shelters, \nmoving their corporate headquarters to a file cabinet in Bermuda or \nhiding assets offshore.\n  We need to bring America back to a time when our economy was booming \nand our Federal finances were sound. The President's plan will not do \nthat. My plan will.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n\n[[Page S6222]]\n\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent that the pending business be set \naside for the purpose of offering an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 575\n\n       (Purpose: To further enhance the denial of deduction for \n     certain fines, penalties, and other amounts.)\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I send amendment No. 575 to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl], for himself, Mr. \n     Cornyn, Mr. Alexander, and Mr. Ensign, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 575.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent that this amendment be designated \nthe Kyl-Cornyn amendment and that Senators Alexander and Ensign be \nlisted as original cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will address this amendment for a few \nminutes, and then I am going to speak on the dividends proposal that \nwill be offered tomorrow and that hopefully the Senate will approve as \none of the perfecting amendments of the legislation that passed out of \nthe Finance Committee.\n  The first thing I would like to do is to describe the amendment that \nI have just laid down. I know Senator Cornyn is coming a little bit \nlater, and he will be talking about it, too.\n  This amendment is known as the tobacco tax lawyers amendment. The \ntechnical name is different than that, but the gist of this amendment \nis that about $9 billion could be returned to the States, the clients \nin the tobacco litigation, from the attorneys who overcharged those \nclients. This legislation ensures that overcharging be recognized in \nlaw so that the States can apply for that refund.\n  How does that work? There is an existing IRS Code provision that says \nif one is the trustee of a trust, and they overcharge that trust, they \ntake too much in the way of fees out of it, they have to return those \nfees. The IRS will enforce that.\n  In fact, the Secretary of the Treasury is involved in that process. \nWe simply apply that same existing IRS Code provision to this situation \nwhere attorney's fees have been charged in excess.\n  The common thread is a fiduciary relationship, the legal term which \napplies where a trustee or a lawyer to a trust or to a client has a \nresponsibility above and beyond a mere contractual responsibility. As \nthe court cases all attest--and I will quote a couple in a moment--\nwhereas a contract between two regular people is enforceable in law, \nwith respect to a trustee or a lawyer, where you have a fiduciary \nresponsibility to the client or to the trust, that contract is not the \nmost important thing. The most important thing is the fiduciary \nresponsibility, which the law will enforce, above the contracted for \nfee. That is what would apply in this particular case.\n\n  As a result of the tobacco litigation we are all familiar with, the \nfees are being paid to these lawyers at the rate of about $500 million \na year. That exists for 30 years until the year 2028, possibly forever \nif the lawyers win their argument for an inflation adjustment. Some \nattorneys are receiving fees--if we can believe this now--in excess of \n$150,000 an hour.\n  Senators make about $150,000 a year, and there are a lot of people \nwho think Senators are overpaid. Think about instead of earning \n$150,000 a year, a person earned $150,000 every hour. That is what some \nof the attorneys in this tobacco litigation are earning. It is \nunconscionable, and no contract that provides for that can be \nenforceable in law. It is clearly a breach of the fiduciary \nresponsibility.\n  Congress enacted this Tax Code provision in 1996 in response to two \nvery famous people. I will not mention their names, but they set up a \ntrust and then proceeded, basically, to pay themselves as trustee most \nof the money out of the trust. Congress said: That is not right. We do \nnot care what the contract says. It is wrong. The IRS can tax you on \nthat overage.\n  That is the same provision we would use. The Congress can tax you on \nthat overage, and I will describe in a minute how we actually describe \nwhat the overage is.\n  I will first assure my colleagues that the money that would be \nreturned by the tobacco lawyers is not returned to the tobacco \ncompanies. They have to pay the money. They either pay it to the \nlawyers or they pay it to the States. The money would be returned to \nthe States. As I said, under the original bill that Senator Cornyn and \nI introduced, it is about $9 billion. That is the securitized value of \nthis income stream of over half a billion dollars every year for 30 \nyears, and maybe in perpetuity. So $9 billion is the reduced-to-present \nvalue of this fee award.\n  I have a chart, which I do not think I will bother to put up on the \neasel, which shows what every State would get. My State, for example, \nwould receive about $164 million, and it could use that money. Since it \nis based purely on population, if that is what Arizona, with a little \nover 5 million people, received, my colleagues can figure out what \ntheir State would receive.\n  I will go back to describe what the tobacco settlement really did \nbecause most people are not aware of what happened in the tobacco \nsettlement. Attorney's fees were not awarded in the tobacco settlement \npursuant to contract. So for those people who say we are trying to \nabrogate contracts, as I said, we are not talking about contracts. We \nare talking about a fiduciary responsibility. In any event, in the \ntobacco settlement, there was not a contract. Nor were they awarded by \na court, which is the other way that ordinarily attorney's fees are \nawarded as a result of successful litigation.\n  So it was not awarded by a contract, and it was not awarded by a \ncourt. Instead, after the tobacco companies' initial offer to settle \nthe litigation and that offer failed and Congress rejected a \nlegislative settlement, which some of my colleagues will recall, the \ntobacco companies and the lawyers agreed to a $246 billion settlement, \nwith a special provision for attorney's fees. So this was not between \nthe lawyers and clients. It was between the lawyers and the other \nparty, something about which courts always raise a red flag.\n  That provision included a very unusual agreement by the tobacco \ncompanies to pay the fees of these lawyers who represented their \nopponents, the States. The fees were ostensibly set by a panel of three \narbitrators, and there are some very interesting articles about how \nthis would occur that would make your blood boil. Two of the majority \nwere effectively chosen by the lawyers.\n\n  In this agreement, the tobacco companies and lawyers agreed to \nimmunize all fee awards from judicial review. In other words, it \nstipulates that it cannot be reviewed by a court. And all proceedings \nwere concealed from the public. That is what we are talking about--a \nsecret deal by which the tobacco companies agreed, as part of how much \nmoney they had to pay out, that they would pay these substantial fees \nto the lawyers.\n  It does not take too much imagination to figure out that it was in \nthe best interests of two parties that this arrangement exist--the \nlawyers and the tobacco companies. They got together and they concocted \na secret deal which was never reviewed by a court, is not pursuant to a \ncontract, and which, by the precedence of this Congress, can be \nlimited.\n  Now, the amendment we have proposed guarantees that none of these \nlawyers receives less than $20,000 an hour for their services. Is that \ngenerous enough? None of them will get less than $20,000 an hour. How \nmuch is a plumber charging these days? A hundred dollars an hour? I am \nnot sure what it is. How much does a schoolteacher get these days? \nProbably not $100 an hour when you add it all up. These lawyers would \nbe guaranteed $20,000 for every hour they put in. Some claim to have \nput in 10,000 hours, 20,000 hours, 30,000 hours. Add it up. They will \nnot have to sell their yachts.\n  As I said, there are a lot of descriptions of this, and I will put \nsome of this in the Record at the appropriate time.\n\n[[Page S6223]]\n\nI wanted to note, if anyone thinks I misspeak, in one of the articles \nit is noted that in the case of Michigan, for example--I will be very \nspecific--the fee worked out to $22,500 an hour for this particular \nfirm. These lawyers would therefore have to take a little bit of a cut. \nInstead of getting $22,500 an hour, they only get $20,000 an hour.\n  Now, The Economist, a respected magazine published in Great Britain, \nnotes that tobacco settlement ``arbitration is a mere figleaf. The \nmoney going to the lawyers was clearly part of the overall amount that \nthe tobacco companies were willing to pay to settle the case. Whatever \nthe lawyers get, the States do not.''\n  That is the bottom line. So the money has to be returned to the \nclients, the States, not the tobacco companies.\n  As I said, the proposal is based on the intermediate sanction tax, an \nexisting provision of the Tax Code that applies a punitive tax to the \nexcessive portion of a fiduciary's fee and effectively forces the \nfiduciary to restore the excessive portion of the fee to the client. \nOur amendment applies the same tax formula to the excessive attorney's \nfees in the mega-lawsuits.\n  The suit would have to be $100 million or this provision would not \napply. We are talking about a very minute number of lawsuits per year; \nprobably 15 to 20 litigations a year, at most, according to experts, \nwould qualify. You have to exceed $100 million as part of the \nsettlement or judgment.\n  Let me note, because one of my colleagues said you have to have \ncontingent fees in the big complicated cases, that is very true, \nlawyers will take tough cases on a contingent fee. In the early stages \nof this litigation, it was tough litigation, that is true. So sometimes \nlawyers will take a third, sometimes even 40 percent. I have seen fees \nas high as 50 percent of the settlements.\n\n  What have experts and courts said about that? Courts have made clear \nthat fee agreements based primarily on the size of the recovery tend to \nbecome unreasonable when judgments reach the $100 million mark, which \nis the mark we use here. As one court stated:\n\n       In much smaller cases, a fee award of 33 percent does not \n     present the danger of providing the plaintiff counsel with \n     the windfall that would accompany a mega fund settlement of \n     $100 million or upwards, but it is quite different when the \n     figure hits the really big time.\n\n  Whereas the Third Circuit Court notes:\n\n       Courts have generally decreased the percentage awarded for \n     attorney fees as the amount recovered increases and $100 \n     million seems to be the informal marker of a very large \n     settlement.\n\n  It is one of the reasons we chose the $100 million mark.\n  The logic of avoiding judgment-based awards in the very largest \nlawsuits is straightforward:\n\n       It is not 150 times more difficult to prepare, try, and \n     settle a $150 million case than it is to try a $1 million \n     case, but the application of a percentage comparable to that \n     in a smaller case may yield an award 150 times greater.\n\n  Another said:\n\n       There is considerable merit to disallowing standard \n     percentage awards as the size of the recovery fund increases. \n     In many cases the increase in the recovery is merely a factor \n     in the size of the class and has no direct relationship to \n     the efforts of counsel.\n\n  That certainly was the case in the tobacco litigation.\n  Before the trial lawyers or some of their allies say this is a \nRepublican lawyer-bashing amendment, I say two things. First, I am a \nlawyer. I am not trying to bash any lawyers. A guaranteed fee of \n$20,000 an hour would be considered extraordinarily generous by the \nstandards of most of my colleagues. Second, the fee formula used in \nthis situation allows attorneys to receive up to 500 percent of what \ncourts usually determine as reasonable hourly rates but not less than \n$20,000 an hour. So you take what a court determines as a reasonable \nrate, add 500 percent--no one can contend that is unfair--and that is \nthe standard used in this typical type of case.\n  Before you say this is Republican lawyer bashing, this came from \nprobably the most liberal court in the country, the Florida Supreme \nCourt, which in a specific case tried to determine what would be a fair \nfee in a situation like this.\n  What it said was that the maximum multiplier that it thought was \nappropriate was this multiplier of 5, or 500 percent.\n  Here is what the court said:\n\n       We set the maximum multiplier available in this common-fund \n     category of cases at 5. . . . [A] multiplier which increases \n     fees to five times the accepted hourly rate is sufficient to \n     alleviate the contingency risk factor involved and attract \n     high level counsel to common fund cases while producing a fee \n     that remains within the bounds of reasonableness. We \n     emphasize that 5 percent is a maximum multiplier.\n\n  I take this as the most liberal of standards, the reasonable \nattorney's fees, plus 500 percent, and then say, but we will guarantee \nyou that you do not get anything less than $20,000 an hour if it turns \nout not to satisfy that. I challenge any of my colleagues, if you vote \nagainst this amendment, you are going to have to justify paying lawyers \n$20,000 an hour rather than returning that money to the States.\n\n  The original of the bill Senator Cornyn and I filed has this \nprovision effectively from June of last year. To avoid any question \nthat it is retroactive, we made it effective on the effective day of \nthe act, so it is only prospective.\n  There is one more thing I want to summarize. This act does not alter \nthe considered fee award standards of any jurisdiction in the country. \nRather, it is intended to enforce those standards and to correct the \noccasional extreme outlier. What we are doing is enforcing the court-\nimposed law relating to fiduciary responsibilities.\n  Let me quote a couple of these courts. This is from the Illinois \nSupreme Court:\n\n       A fiduciary relationship exists as a matter of law between \n     attorney and client.\n\n  The New Jersey Supreme Court:\n\n       An attorney's freedom to contract with a client is subject \n     to the constraints of ethical considerations.\n\n  The Massachusetts Appeals Court:\n\n       While freedom of contract is the guiding principle \n     underlying contract law, contractual freedom is muted in the \n     lawyer-client and lawyer-lawyer context.\n       That comes from a law professor, Joseph Perillo.\n\n  Here is another court:\n\n       [A]n attorney is only entitled to fees which are fair and \n     just and which adequately compensate him for his services. \n     This is true no matter what fee is specified in the contract, \n     because an attorney, as a fiduciary, cannot bind his client \n     to pay a greater compensation for his services than the \n     attorney would have the right to demand if no contract had \n     been made. Therefore, as a matter of public policy, \n     reasonableness is an implied term in every contract for \n     attorney's fees.\n\n  As I noted before, in this case, in the tobacco litigation, you don't \nhave a contract between the client and the attorney. The contract is \nbetween the attorney and the opposing parties, the tobacco companies, \nwhich make it even more suspect.\n  Again, as I said, this does not change the substantive law. It simply \nenforces preexisting fiduciary standards that bind every attorney in \nevery State.\n  I urge my colleagues when we vote on this amendment tomorrow to just \nconsider the alternative. These lawyers are all going to get a ton of \nmoney, hundreds of millions of dollars, guaranteed $20,000 per hour \nthat they work. Most of them worked, they claim, thousands of hours on \nthis case. But we are able to return somewhere, depending upon how the \npayment for this amendment is done, between $6.5 billion and $9 billion \nto the States. The States could use this money at this time. The \ntobacco companies have to pay the money one way or the other.\n  After compensating lawyers on the basis of a reasonable attorney fee \nplus 500 percent, but at a minimum at least $20,000 an hour, the \nremainder would be returned to the States. I submit this is a \nresponsible thing for us to do.\n  The final comments I would like to make relate to the amendment that \nwill be offered tomorrow relating to the dividend section of this bill. \nThe proposal is to join the President in finally bringing to an end the \npernicious practice of taxing dividends in this country twice, which \nputs us at a competitive disadvantage with our trading partners, which \nis unfair in anybody's book, which drives corporations to fund their \ninvestment by debt rather than equity investment, which reduces the \ntransparency of corporations because they do not have to account to \nshareholders, and which diminishes the value of stock because the \nshareholders are going to have to pay a tax on the dividends even after \nthe corporation has already done so.\n\n[[Page S6224]]\n\n  Those are the reasons President Bush understood that this double \ntaxation of dividends had to be addressed in this tax bill. The beauty \nof his proposal is that when combined with two of the other provisions \nof the act, the acceleration of the write-off for small business and, \nmost important, the acceleration of the reductions in the marginal \nincome tax rates, we will produce in this country 1.4 million jobs next \nyear, and we could produce half a million jobs this year.\n  The proposal that is going to be offered tomorrow is ingenious in \nthat it puts the bulk of this relief right up front where it will do \ngood for the economy right now; and, second, it sends an unmistakable \nmessage to the stock market that we mean business about reducing the \ntax to zero.\n  What the proposal does is, for this current tax year, before we could \nput this all in effect, it gives all of the dividend holders a 50-\npercent deduction on their dividends. So for this tax year we are in \nright now they can write off half of what they would otherwise have to \npay, and starting next year, 2004, and going into 2005 and 2006, in \nother words for 3 straight years, the tax rate for them goes to zero on \nthese dividends. It is repealed. It is gone.\n  I challenge anybody at the end of that period of time to suggest at \nthat point we try to reinstate the double taxation of dividends. It is \nnot going to happen.\n  So the message to the stock market, when the vote occurs tomorrow and \nyou have seen that the Senate is willing to follow the President and \nrepeal the double taxation of dividends, the message is that you can \nfinally begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel with respect to \nthe recovery.\n\n  What do economists tell us? One economist, a very prominent \neconomist, told us at a dinner the other night that he could expect to \nsee at least a 20-percent increase in the value of stock as a result of \nthis. The average of the economists we have talked to is closer to 10 \npercent. But take 10 percent. I think we would all like to see a return \nof that much value in our stock portfolio. This exists whether or not \nwe are holding stock that issues dividends because of the general value \nof the market, or increased value of the market that would result from \nthis. Obviously, those taxpayers who receive dividends from their \ncorporate holdings would receive a direct benefit in the reduction of \ntheir liability for taxes, in addition to the increase in the value of \ntheir stock.\n  Obviously, this is going to be very good tax policy. It puts us in a \nbetter competitive position. Do you know that the United States has the \nsecond worst tax rate on dividends in the entire world of economically \ndeveloped countries? Only Japan has a slightly higher rate. And every \nother country in the economically developed world has a lower tax rate \non dividends than we do. No wonder we are having a problem right now.\n  But another point I would like to make with regard to this whole \nissue is that dividends obviously work in two good ways. By putting \nmoney back in taxpayers' pockets, they can do with those dividends \nwhatever they like. The distinguished Senator from Florida who was \nspeaking a moment ago talked about the need for consumers to have more \nmoney in their pockets. This is a way for consumers, and specifically \nsenior citizens, to get more money in their pockets. There are about 10 \nmillion seniors who would receive relief under this proposal, just \nunder $1,000 a year in terms of the average value they would receive. \nThis is money in their pocket. This is money with which they can do one \nof two things: They can either spend it or they can invest it. In \neither case they are helping the economy.\n  For those who think we need to have people who can spend more, they \ncan spend more. For those who think we need more investment, obviously \nsome seniors invest some part of their income.\n  I would like to make a point in response to the Senator from Florida \nbecause he referred to my beloved home State of Arizona and showed a \nphotograph of some airplanes sitting out on a tarmac, airplanes that \nwere mothballed. If you come out to Tucson, AZ, you will see a very \ninteresting sight. There are literally hundreds if not thousands of \nthese airplanes. Most of them are military, but there are some \ncommercial airplanes as well.\n  The point he was trying to make was this is a consumer-driven \nrecession and therefore we need to put money in the pockets of \nconsumers. The two big things we do here is accelerate the marginal \nincome tax rate--that puts money in the pockets of consumers--and don't \ndouble tax dividends so the people who invest in stocks have that money \nto spend. Even for those who believe this is a consumer-driven \nrecession, which it is not, what the President has proposed, and what \nwe will be voting on tomorrow, helps put money in the pockets of \nconsumers.\n  But there is a fundamental misunderstanding, if you look at airplanes \nand say, therefore, because people are not flying as much, this is a \nconsumer-driven recession. There are two problems: First, regarding 9/\n11, the airline industry is almost unique among the businesses in this \ncountry. The airline industry and associated industries went into a \nnose dive that they still haven't recovered from because the traveling \npublic has not traveled as much after 9/11. But the airlines will tell \nyou a second factor has contributed to their bad financial situation. \nIn addition to the fact that some people do not travel as much as a \nresult of 9/11, and we have increased security costs placed upon them, \nthe biggest single factor, they will tell you, is they have lost the \nbusiness traveling public.\n  The business travelers who buy the first class or business class \ntickets and fly a lot are not flying as much. Why? Because the \ncorporations are trying to save money. Why? Because they can't get \nenough money to invest in their businesses. Why? Because there is a \ncapital asset deficit. This recession, the first of the 21st century, \nis the first nonconsumer recession. It is a capital asset deficit \nrecession. It is a recession that understands that investment income is \nwhat is lacking.\n  Over the last 2 or 3 years, we have seen, by the count of some \neconomists, almost $10 trillion sucked out of the stock values of this \ncountry. Something has to be done to put back that value. The way you \nput it back is by creating more investment opportunities. Most of the \neconomists we have talked to said the single best thing you can do to \nadd to that investment opportunity is to repeal this double taxation of \ndividends.\n  My colleague, Senator Voinovich from Ohio, quoted Alan Greenspan a \nwhile ago, who said if you are going to do something like this, get rid \nof the double taxation of dividends. That will help spur investment. He \nalso said to Congress, stop spending so much money.\n  This chart on my left demonstrates the situation here. Last year, \nconsumer spending didn't go down. Those of you who have refinanced your \nhome or tried to buy a car at 0 percent interest know people are still \nbuying. Consumer spending went up 3.4 percent last year, and it was up \nthe year before as well. This green line shows consumer spending \ncontinues to go up. From 1999 to 2002, you can see that consumer \nspending is increasing.\n  It hasn't fallen off. What has fallen off? The gross private \ninvestment is what has fallen off--the investment in our businesses in \nthe United States. After reaching the peak just after the year 2000, we \nall know what happened. We read the paper and see what is happening to \nthe stock market. You can see investment in the market has plummeted, \nand it hasn't come back very much. It will come back if we give people \nthe means to invest and the incentive to invest because they are not \ngoing to have their profits from their investment in corporations taxed \nafter the corporation has already paid the tax.\n  This is clearly a capital asset problem and not a consumer spending \nproblem, as has been alleged by so many of those on the other side of \nthe aisle.\n  Finally, I want to say this: My colleague from Florida said, ``The \nPresident's handling of the economy''--the end of the quote, but the \ngist is the President's handling of the economy is why we are in the \nbad economic situation.\n  Under current circumstances, would that the President could handle \nthe economy. But as all economists know, fortunately 250-plus million \npeople drive the economy in this free market country of ours. They make \nmillions of decisions every day. The President\n\n[[Page S6225]]\n\ndoesn't run the economy in the United States of America. He has very \nlittle that he can do to change the economic situation in the country \nexcept try to lead by persuasion. He is trying very hard to do that.\n  The other thing he can do is to propose to the Congress that we try \nto do things he thinks will help the economy and he has done that. But \nmy colleague who spoke these words a moment ago wants to deny him the \nability to put his plan in effect. On the one hand, they complain he is \nnot doing anything to handle the economy, and on the other hand, they \nare going to disagree with whatever he proposes to do. Of course, we \nknow the truth. He doesn't handle the economy. But he has some \ninfluence over the direction we go by getting his best advisers \ntogether and trying to figure out how we can create the most jobs and \nproduce economic recovery. He has done that. Most of the Republicans in \nthis body have agreed his proposal is the best way for us to create \njobs.\n  Therefore, tomorrow what will be offered is very close to what he \nproposed. With this dividend, this elimination of the double taxation \nof dividends, we will be able to go a long way toward giving the \nPresident the plan he has asked for--not so that he can handle the \neconomy, but so we as leaders can help lead the country toward at least \nsome degree of recovery in this year of 2003.\n  As I said before, some people say the President's reelection depends \non whether the economy is strong or not. I don't think he would be \nproposing something which he thinks won't work. He is proposing \nsomething which he believes will work, and we believe it will work. \nThat is why I hope my colleagues will support the proposal that will be \noffered tomorrow in support of the President's program to eliminate the \ndouble taxation of dividends.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield to the Senator from Texas what time he might \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Iowa \nproviding me an opportunity to speak on a matter I know the Senator \nfrom Arizona has already addressed--something called the Intermediate \nSanctions Compensatory Review Adjustment Act of 2003.\n  This amendment, I believe, is important for a number of reasons. \nFirst of all, nobody in this body is going to get quite everything they \nmay want in this jobs and economic growth package of 2003. But, for \nbetter or for worse, a deal has been struck in order to obtain \nsufficient votes to get the matter out of committee and hopefully \nenacted into law to provide $20 billion of State aid as part of this \npackage.\n  If it had been up to me, I would have said that notwithstanding the \ndifficult times States find themselves in--and in my State of Texas \nthey find themselves with a $10 billion budget shortfall--but \nnotwithstanding that fact, I would be reluctant to send $20 billion to \nthe States with no strings attached so they could spend however they \nmight like when we have no means of establishing accountability for how \nthat money might be spent. But the collective wisdom of the Finance \nCommittee and perhaps this body is that $20 billion in State aid will \nbe sent to the States as part of this overall package.\n  That being the case and recognizing that no single Senator gets \neverything he or she wants, the question then has arisen--and the \nSenator from Arizona has raised it--the issue of attorneys' fees \nostensibly earned by lawyers who represented the various States in the \ntobacco litigation and other contingency fee arrangements whereby \ncertain private lawyers have earned, or at least claim to have earned, \nliterally billions of dollars in attorneys' fees.\n  I don't speak on this issue without a little bit of history, and \nperhaps that would provide some context for why I support this \namendment.\n  On January 1, 1999, I was sworn in as Attorney General of Texas, \nshortly after my predecessor had entered into a settlement with the \ntobacco industry, and really I think what we all recognize is an \nunprecedented lawsuit ultimately resulting in the largest civil \njudgment in the history of the world.\n  I know the State of Texas and other States filed this lawsuit to \nrecover Medicaid expenditures they had incurred on smoking-related \nillnesses. Certainly, I count myself second to no one in expressing \nconcern about the number of people in this country and around the \nworld--some 400,000 in this country alone--who lose there lives \nannually as a result of smoking-related illnesses. But that is only \npart of the story.\n  The rest of the story is that a small group of entrepreneurial \nlawyers saw an opportunity once they joined league with State attorneys \ngeneral to file litigation against the tobacco industry. If that were \nmore or less the end of the story, then I wouldn't have concerns. But \nultimately, those settlements ended up with the States in a joint \nventure with the tobacco industry to keep the tobacco industry alive, \nand with the settlements, these huge amounts of money, multiple \nbillions of dollars being paid out of the profits of the tobacco \nindustry for continuing to sell more of their tobacco products in the \nfuture, not just in this country but across the world.\n  So rather than discouraging or limiting tobacco use in this country \nand around the world, the States became joint venturers, so to speak, \nwith the tobacco industry because if the tobacco industry was unable to \nsell more of its product, then the States would not get paid under the \nsettlements, a truly shrewd and ingenuous arrangement on the part of \nthese entrepreneurial lawyers.\n  But the real concern I have about this arrangement, particularly in \nmy home State of Texas, is while the State receives a historic \nsettlement of $17.3 billion--and actually that purports to be the \npresent value of the money that is going to be paid in perpetuity--it \nis really probably only a part of what ultimately that judgment is \nworth.\n  Once these lawyers settled the case for the client, so to speak, then \nthey talked to the tobacco industry, and they said: OK, what about us? \nWe have my client's settlement, $17.3 billion, roughly speaking. Now \nwhat about us? And they engaged in an arrangement which I believe \nviolated one of the most basic obligations that a lawyer owes to the \nclient and breached their fiduciary duties to the client.\n  It simply boils down to this: that the duty of a lawyer who has been \nhired by a client is to maximize the recovery on the part of the \nplaintiff. Here, rather than do that, they struck a deal with the \ntobacco industry for a certain amount of money and then said: Well, on \ntop of that, now you have to deal with us--which turns on its head the \nduty of loyalty that a lawyer has to a client to not let his or her \npersonal interest conflict with the interests of the client and to \nmaximize the recovery by the client.\n  So, simply stated, I believe what we saw in the tobacco litigation, \nall across this country, represented an unprecedented breach of \nfiduciary duty that the lawyer owed to the client to maximize the \nclient's recovery and enrich the lawyers in the process.\n  So the question is, What do we do about it? Well, here again, I \nbelieve that the needs of the States, and particularly the State of \nTexas--which is currently in session trying to deal with a $10 billion \nshortfall, looking at cutting health care for those who are unable to \npay for health care on their own, for children under the CHIPS program, \nfor public education--that this provides an opportunity for this body \nto correct an injustice, to enforce a fiduciary duty that the lawyer \nowes to the client, and to provide aid to the States in the process in \na way that will help ameliorate that loss and vindicate a wrong.\n  Part of this story, too, involves a tragedy. My predecessor as \nattorney general currently stands indicted by a U.S. grand jury in the \nWestern District of Texas for trying to enrich a friend, a colleague, \nto the tune of some $520 million for doing no work.\n  For those who have not followed the story, I will just say that about \nthe time the tobacco settlement was struck, there arrived on the scene \nanother lawyer, whom nobody had ever heard of before, by the name of \nMark Murr. The lawyers who had been involved in the litigation--at \nleast they had done some work on it--wondered what this arrangement \nwas. And when push came to shove, ultimately the five main lawyers in \nthe Texas tobacco lawsuit got their $3.3 billion. But then\n\n[[Page S6226]]\n\nthere was an arrangement made to create a separate mechanism, a \ncollusive arbitration arrangement, whereby Mark Murr would receive up \nto $520 million out of the recovery of the State of Texas.\n  As it turned out, during my investigation as attorney general, we \ndetermined that the contract upon which Mr. Murr claimed a right to be \npaid had been falsified, backdated, and literally been cut and pasted \nto make it look as if he had done some work on the case and had been \ninvolved in the case much earlier than he really had. In truth, and in \nfact, I believe he did not do any work to justify that fee.\n  During the 4 years that I was attorney general of the State of Texas, \nwe conducted an investigation into that matter, were successful in \npreventing Mr. Murr from making the claim for that money against the \ntreasury of the State of Texas, and ultimately, I believe, provided the \nfactual basis under which the U.S. attorney was able to present that \ncase to the grand jury, and ultimately resulting in the indictment of \nthe former attorney general of the State of Texas.\n\n  I say that with no pleasure at all. It is a tragedy, a terrible \ntragedy. But it is a story of how a steward of the public trust has \nviolated that trust and now must be held accountable for violating that \ntrust. But in the process, and what this amendment addresses \nspecifically, is the manner in which five private lawyers enrich \nthemselves at the expense of the State of Texas and how other lawyers \nacross the country, during the course of this tobacco litigation, \nenrich themselves at the expense of their State clients in breach of \ntheir fiduciary duties.\n  The Internal Revenue Code provides a mechanism where those who breach \nfiduciary duties--whether they be a trustee or, in this case, a lawyer \nrepresenting a client--can be taxed. It provides another mechanism, a \nnonlitigation mechanism, to enforce that fiduciary duty that is owed by \nthe fiduciary to the client. In this case, I believe it is an \nopportunity for this body to find funds--if, in fact, it is the will of \nthe majority of this body--and to see Federal dollars, or money that \notherwise is paid by Federal taxpayers, go to State taxpayers. It \nprovides another opportunity to provide up to $9 billion of additional \nfunds by simply enforcing the fiduciary duty owed by these lawyers to \ntheir clients, the various States.\n  So I am pleased to join Senator Kyl and Senator Alexander in \ncosponsoring this amendment that would, if adopted by this body, \nprovide an additional $9 billion in State aid, in a way that I believe \nultimately does justice, by enforcing this fiduciary duty owed by the \nlawyers to the client.\n  Let me just say, Mr. President, in closing, that I support the Jobs \nand Economic Growth Act of 2003. Even though I think it will undergo a \nnumber of amendments and will ultimately not be exactly what any of us \nwould like, I believe it provides a necessary prescription for what \nails the economy and will provide a necessary jump-start to allow \ntaxpayers, the ones who earn the money, to keep more of that money and \nspend it as they see fit, and to allow small businesses that earn the \nmoney to reinvest in their businesses and create new jobs in a way that \nwill ultimately help us grow our way out of our current economic \ndoldrums.\n  So I am happy to support this important legislation and happy to add \nmy voice to hopefully putting America back to work.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of myself, Senator Corzine, and Senator Schumer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu], for herself, Mr. \n     Corzine, and Mr. Schumer, proposes an amendment numbered 619.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I will take such time as I may need to \nexplain the amendment. I estimate it to be around 10 or 15 minutes for \nmyself and for Senator Corzine who joins me on the floor. I know there \nare no time constraints, but I know there are other Members with \namendments and the hour is late. I just want to let them know \napproximately how much time it will take for us to offer the amendment.\n  We offer this amendment in good faith because many of us are firmly \nconvinced and feel very passionately that the direction the President \nis leading us with his proposal is the wrong direction.\n  Times have been much worse in this country over the course of our \nlong history. In many ways, things are moving along pretty well. We are \nmaking a tremendous amount of progress on many fronts. But it is in \nsome ways a very crucial time. We are trying to transform our military. \nWe are moving into a technological age for which this particular type \nof economy needs some special framework. We are fighting terrorism \nworldwide. We are engaged in conflicts because of the recent attack on \nour Nation. I wouldn't say this is the calmest of times, but yet we are \nnot in a depression; some would argue not in a recession. But it is an \nimportant time to do the right thing.\n  For the 4.5 million people I represent in Louisiana, it is very \nimportant that we get this tax package right. Their livelihoods depend \non it. Their children's futures depend on it. Their small businesses \ndepend on it. The health of their parents depend on it. We can't get it \nwrong, and we are about to.\n  This plan the President has laid down will not create jobs. The plan \nthe President has laid down will raise taxes. The plan the President \nhas laid down will increase deficits. It will disappoint thousands of \nparents, teachers, and students who actually believed him when he said \nhe would not leave a child behind. They actually believed him. And they \nvoted for him. This plan does not fund Leave No Child Behind.\n\n  This plan says no to so many small businesses that trusted him, that \ncame here to Washington and said: Mr. President, if you get a little \nmore money, could you please help us with our health care premiums? He \ntold them, yes. But this plan doesn't have a deduction for health care \npremiums. It is the No. 1 issue for the small businesses in Louisiana \nand across the Nation. You won't find it in the President's plan. It is \nnot in there. He said no to small business.\n  I know I can't use profanity on the floor of the Senate, so let me \njust say: It is a darn shame that when he had a chance, when the \nRepublican leadership had a chance to do the right thing at an \nimportant time in our Nation, for some reason, that some of us can't \nfigure out, I can't even go where they are going. I don't understand \nit.\n  I don't understand a plan, when we need jobs, that doesn't create \njobs; when we are trying to fix the deficit, it makes the deficit \nworse. For what?\n  So Senator Corzine and I have worked, along with Senator Schumer and \nmany of our colleagues, to come up with something that would actually \ntake the President at his word, which we are continuing to hope we can \ndo. I am getting personally unsure of that, but I am trying to take him \nat his word that he really wants to create jobs; he wants to get the \neconomy moving again; he wants to have a stimulus package; he wants to \nmake it generally fair to everybody, or as many people as possible.\n  He wants to honor the military, which he continues to say is one of \nhis No. 1 priorities. We have something in here, a tax credit for the \nGuard and Reserve. I don't know if anyone in America could say that \nthere is a group of people that deserve a tax credit more than the \npeople who have left their spouses, left their children, left their \njobs, put up a temporary sign ``gone to war'' on the front of their \nbuilding, but we are sitting on this floor tonight giving tax credits \nto everybody in the world--the double taxation to corporations, many of \nwhich don't pay taxes anyway--but we can't find space in the bill to \ngive it to the 400,000 guardsmen and reservists who are being called up \nto protect us.\n  That is why I am standing on the floor late at night to try to \nexplain it. At least in Louisiana, people don't understand it. They \njust don't understand it. So our amendment has something in here for \nthe Guard and Reserve.\n  You could argue we are in a recession or we are close to recession. \nIt is not booming times out there. I will not stand here and try to \nargue whether we are technically in it or not. People who don't have \njobs really don't care about that. What they care about is having a \njob. Jobs are hard to come by. We have a record high unemployment rate.\n  The people who are unemployed in the country are saying: Mr. \nPresident, if you have a little extra money, could you please allow us \nto use the money\n\n[[Page S6234]]\n\nin the compensation fund that we paid into to extend our benefits, \nmodest benefits? In Louisiana, it is $196 a week. The average benefit \nis $250 a week. These are people who have worked, many of them, since \nthey have been teenagers. They find themselves out of work. They are 40 \nand 50 years old. They came here to ask the President: Could you please \nextend the benefits? The President doesn't put them in his package.\n\n  But he puts in the package corporations that don't pay taxes, and he \nwon't put in his package unemployed people who paid taxes their whole \nlife since they have been teenagers.\n  I am offering the amendment because our amendment tries to take some \nthings the President put in his package, and the Finance Committee has \nput in their package, that is sort of modeled on what the President had \noriginally planned, that does do some of the things that will stimulate \nand that we generally agree on and there seems to be a consensus. And \nthere are some good things in it.\n  One is the marriage penalty which we recognize is a real penalty. It \nis taken care of in this amendment.\n  We accelerate the child tax credit, which is something we all, \nRepublicans and Democrats, agree would be a good thing, if you had some \nextra money, to give that thousand dollars to people. But instead of \nthe dividend tax, which has been argued by the likes of Alan Greenspan \nand others that it is not the right time to do, instead of that, we \nhave placed in our $350 billion package wage tax relief.\n  If we want to create jobs in the Nation, I would maintain that \nremoving the tax on jobs would be the best way to encourage jobs to be \ncreated. If you remove the tax from something, people are likely to \nmove toward whatever you remove the tax on. So people are paying a lot \nof money on their wages, and our amendment would give an immediate $765 \nrebate to every worker. For two parents, it is almost $1,530, for two \nworkers in a family.\n  And the way we have structured the amendment, every business would \nalso be able to take that immediate rebate for every worker up to their \n$10,000 in earnings. So every small business, every corporation would \nbe able to take that benefit of thousands and thousands and thousands \nof dollars now.\n  As several of the Senators from the other side have said, that money \nwill go into their pockets, and they will have flexibility to spend it \nhowever they want. We are not telling them how to spend it. They could \ngive bonuses. They could invest in property. They could invest in \nequipment.\n  But it is putting money in their pockets--real money, not pretend \nbenefits from a dividend they won't get, or would not get anyway \nbecause of the system that we have now.\n  So we offered this amendment--$350 billion. The centerpiece of it is \nwage tax relief that will benefit every worker, particularly those two-\nwage-earner families who make up the majority of our American \npopulation because this economy demands two wages, basically, to carry \nthe burdens and responsibilities of family life.\n  It also helps small business in terms of stimulating for plant and \nequipment expensing up to $100,000, small business health care, Guard \nand Reserve, unemployment compensation, and a very important component \nof this is helping the States. People have talked about this as aid to \nundeserving recipients. It is as if there is something wrong because we \nare giving aid to undeserving recipients. I like to think of States--\nand I served in the State legislature for 8 years, and as treasurer for \n8 years--as partners, good partners, hard-working partners. My Governor \nis a Republican, and I do not consider him an enemy. I do not consider \nhim an undeserving aid recipient. I consider him a partner. Together, \nwith the senior Senator, our Governor, and our legislature, every day \nwe try to give kids a good education, give our teachers a decent \nsalary. We try to keep our hospitals open. When a child is born sick, \nwe try to help their family take care of them, to see that the garbage \ngets picked up, that the sanitation is done, that highways are built. \nWe do this in partnership. They are not my enemies.\n  I have heard comments on the floor, and from the White House, that \nthey don't deserve it. Let me tell you something. They work hard, local \nelected officials--mayors, county council members, and school board \nmembers--trying to balance their budgets. They cannot run up deficits \nlike we do. Half of their problem is caused by the fact that we get \nhere day after day and put one unfunded mandate on them on top of \nanother. When it comes down to balancing their budgets, do you know \nwhose backs they balance them on? The schoolchildren get cut, teachers \nget cut, firemen and policemen get cut, so the President can give a \ndividend tax cut to corporations that don't even pay taxes.\n  I am not voting for the plan. I would not vote for it if it was the \nlast plan offered, because I am not raising taxes on police officers, \nfirefighters, teachers, and closing libraries. If you think I am making \nthis up, just go to any Nexus search. I went today and looked up \nMaine--a billion-dollar deficit. The Maine Legislature considers itself \nin a crisis mode. This is the State of Senators Snowe and Collins. So \nfar, this is what President Bush is asking the residents of Maine to \ndo--this is his plan, so the President is asking the residents of Maine \nto cut library services, and one community began to lobby its residents \nto reject a proposed health care center because the State could not \nafford it.\n  Now, you can put up a sign at the libraries in Maine saying ``book \nsale'' because the proceeds are going to a dividend cut. I don't want \nto hang that sign on my library in Louisiana, and I don't intend to. If \nthis bill passes, fine, it will pass by one vote, maybe a tie vote. It \nwill not have Landrieu's vote.\n  People say: Senator, are you opposed to tax cuts? No. I voted for the \nlast tax cut proposal of $1.3 trillion. But, of course, then people \ncame to my State during the election and tried to convince people I \ndidn't when I did. Nonetheless, I am a Democrat who has voted for tax \ncuts. I am not opposed to them. But if we are going to do them, let's \ndo them right, and fair, and in a way that stimulates the economy and \nactually creates jobs and honors our States as the partners they are, \nand respects those who are unemployed, not as charity cases but as \npeople who work and deserve a break, particularly when times are tough.\n\n  So we offer this amendment. Senator Corzine will speak because he \nunderstands the intricacies of economics in a way that is harder for me \nto explain. I hope he will explain why the plan that has been laid out \ndoes not create jobs in a country that is desperate for jobs and needs \na boost so that we can put people back to work and meet the challenges \nthat are before us, and standing up for our military and fighting a war \non terrorism at home--that we might have the strength to do that.\n  The amendment will be voted on tomorrow with a list of amendments. It \nis offered as a good-faith effort, an alternative, one that is \nstimulative and will create jobs, is fair, and will hopefully get this \neconomy moving again.\n  I reserve the right to speak for another few minutes to offer \nadditional amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I must say I am very proud to join with \nSenator Landrieu in sponsoring this substitute amendment for the \nunderlying bill we are debating. She put the passion into what it is \nthat we have tried to accomplish with respect to coming up with a \npowerful job-creating initiative, a powerful economic growth \ninitiative--one that sticks to the $350 billion budget level that we \nhave agreed to in the Senate. The size is the same.\n  Some of us might argue we should not be doing that at all, based on \nwhat we think the economy might need or the nature of it. But if we are \ngoing to have a $350 billion tax relief program, stimulus program, \nlet's make it one that people know has efficacy and will work and is \nnot designed to go to the elite few but to all of America's families \nand businesses, to everybody in America regardless of their economic \nposition.\n  Our proposal is designed to work for the person who makes the very \nleast, and also for those who make whatever they are blessed with to \nmake in our great country.\n  It also deals with an issue that I heard the Senator from Louisiana \ntalk about in what I think were clearly more forceful terms, about \ndealing\n\n[[Page S6235]]\n\nwith the libraries, prisoners, schools, and everything that our State \nand local governments are trying to deal with, by putting $50 billion \ninto our State and local governments so they can continue to service \nthe American people the way they are expected to. We have a $100 \nbillion budget deficit cumulative across the States in the upcoming \nyear. That is coming on top of about $80 billion this year. We are \nraising taxes and cutting services at the local level faster than we \nare cutting taxes here at the Federal level. That makes no sense.\n  So we have put together a package that works to give tax relief to \nevery single American, working American, and also to help our State and \nlocal governments so they are not out there chopping away at children's \nhealth insurance programs, educational programs, and all the other \nissues that are so important and so positively delivered by our State \nand local governments.\n  If you go back and look at CBO looking at the individual pieces of \nwhat we call the ``multiplier effect'' with regard to initiatives, you \nwill find that the package we put together, because of the breadth of \nparticipation of the population and because of the benefits that are \noffered, will contribute more to growth and jobs than anything on the \ntable that has been talked about. This is truly a pro-growth proposal. \nIf we are sincere about putting Americans back to work, about getting \ngrowth going in our economy, then we ought to be doing those things \nthat work and where people know they work.\n  Mr. President, $350 billion is a lot of money. We ought to be using \nit in absolutely the most effective and efficient way. That is what our \npackage is about. I will go through some of the details of it. I think \nit is essential that we try to use our money and our efforts most \neffectively. This substitute, which will stimulate jobs and will create \ngrowth, will do so without irrevocably undermining the long-term budget \nand fiscal position of the Federal Government.\n  It will avoid creating a debt burden for our children and their \nchildren. By contrast, some of the various proposals that are \ncontemplated here force Americans to pay taxes to pay the interest on \nthe debt: $2.4 trillion, if you add it up with regard to the two tax \ncuts, the one in 2001 and the one we are talking about which will \nincrease the debt burden for every family in America for a family of \nfour $30,000.\n  That is a debt tax. That is a tax because you are going to be paying \nthe interest on that $30,000. One can say we are cutting taxes on one \nhand, but if we are creating interest expense for the Federal \nGovernment on $2.4 trillion, we are raising taxes, and it is a debt \ntax.\n  Deficits do matter, particularly in the long term, and the debt tax \nthat is being proposed will burden the financial health of every \nworking American for the long term, every bit as great or greater than \nthose tax cuts that we are talking about that are embedded in these \nproposals.\n  Even the person nominated to be President Bush's top economist has \nagreed that deficits matter. At least he did before joining the \nadministration. For example, this is what the nominee for Chairman of \nthe President's Council of Economic Advisers, Greg Mankiw, said in his \nrecently published textbook, appropriately named ``The Essentials of \nEconomics.'' I want to read a phrase:\n\n       The most basic lesson about budget deficits follows \n     directly from their effects on the supply and demand for \n     loanable funds.\n\n  He says specifically:\n\n       When the Government reduces the national savings by running \n     up a budget deficit, the interest rate rises and investment \n     falls.\n\n  That is very clear. It could not be clearer--Economics 101, the most \npopular textbook in America, the President's Chairman of the Council of \nEconomic Advisers. When you run up deficits, you reduce the economy's \ngrowth rate.\n  The underlying bill, like the House proposals and most egregiously, \nactually, the $726 billion proposal by the President, grows the \ndeficits, will push up interest rates, will reduce investment in the \nlong run, and, thereby, reduce growth. I thought this was a jobs and \ngrowth package.\n  That is the reality. It is tied together with some of the best \nthoughts in the White House, and it certainly fits what we hear the 10 \nNobel Prize winning economists talking about, and other folks, but this \nis the President's economist. That is why the package Senator Landrieu, \nSenator Schumer, and I are presenting tonight will provide a real boost \nto the economy without destroying long-term fiscal discipline.\n  The heart of our amendment, as was described by Senator Landrieu, is \nthe wage tax credit. This is relief that would give each working \nAmerican a tax cut on their earned wages of up to $765. That is the \nequivalent of the payroll taxes an individual paid on the first $10,000 \nof their earnings in 2001.\n  Under our proposal, a married, working couple--we can all add--would \nreceive tax relief up to $1,530 regardless of their income. Regardless \nof whether you make $20,000, where it is a hard-working blue-collar \njob, or $50,000 where you are a technician, computer programmer, or $1 \nmillion if you work on Wall Street, everybody gets this same $765 and \n$1,530.\n  We need to remember that four out of five Americans pay more in wage \ntaxes, payroll taxes than they pay in income taxes. That is why this \ndoes provide broad-based tax relief to everyone. People across America, \nregardless of their overall income level, pay payroll taxes, and that \nis why the benefit is so broadly distributed and allows for real growth \nin the economy because you put money in the pockets of people who will \ngo out and spend it.\n\n  I remind my colleagues, this is a 1-year tax cut in which all \npayments and tax credits would come out of the General Treasury. We \nmade that very clear so we did not get into this hyper conversation \nabout raiding Social Security trust funds or Medicare trust funds. This \nis a tax cut coming out of the General Treasury, just as any of the \nother proposals we see.\n  Every working American and business owner would benefit from our \nproposal. As I said, the $1,530 cut for a couple would help American \nfamilies make ends meet and generate immediate growth in our economy. \nFor low- and moderate-income families, this payroll relief would pay \nfor 5 weeks' worth of groceries for a family of four, more than 2 \nmonths of childcare, 3 \\1/2\\ months of utility bills, and 7 months of \ngasoline. By the way, if you were a millionaire, with this money you \ncould buy 50 shares of GE stock or any other $30 stock. You can get \ninvolved in the marketplace.\n  The payroll tax relief has been scored among the most stimulative \ncost-effective tax relief proposals evaluated by the CBO and private \neconomists. It has a high-multiplier effect by anybody who looks at it. \nIf we are serious about getting our economy moving--and I think people \nare sincere in their belief that we need to put some stimulus in--this \nis the place where we can get the maximum bang for our buck, the \nmaximum bang for $350 billion.\n  Our proposal is $188 billion of the total $358 billion. In addition \nto helping working Americans, our wage tax credit would provide \nbusiness owners, small and large, a tax credit for up to $765 on each \nof their employees. Our wage credit for business owners would put \nimmediate cash into the hands of employers to spur investment, new \njobs, plant, and equipment. They can do what they need to do to boost \ntheir business.\n  America's businesses, bottom line, by the way, would grow by the \namount in this tax credit. The last time I looked at stocks, growing \nearnings on America's publicly traded companies gets reflected in stock \nvalues. That is what price times earnings means. It really will boost \nthe value of the stocks as much as the kinds of things we are talking \nabout with regard to the dividend.\n  By reducing payroll taxes, which many view as a tax on labor, we \nwould encourage more employers to hire more people and keep those they \nalready have.\n  I point out this is one of the reasons I think the Business \nRoundtable, which represents 150 of the country's largest corporations \nwith over 10 million employees, along with many other business groups \naround the country, have endorsed the concept of payroll-based tax \nrelief.\n  It is pretty simple. It is fair. It is an affordable economic \nstimulus, if we believe $350 billion is affordable. It will put money \ninto the hands of consumers\n\n[[Page S6236]]\n\nand businesses that will get immediately reinvested in our economy.\n  In the past few years, the concept of payroll tax relief has been \nsupported by people on both sides of the aisle. A year ago, Senator \nDomenici and I introduced a similar bill, and in December 2001, the \ndistinguished majority leader, Senator Frist, expressed strong support \nfor payroll tax relief. As he put it then:\n\n       A payroll tax holiday is truly a stimulative, temporary tax \n     cut that would be welcome news for most Americans. . . .As \n     economic growth stagnates and unemployment numbers increase, \n     putting additional money in consumers' pockets will provide a \n     much needed economic boost.\n\n  Senator Frist was right on the mark then, in my view, about the need, \nand he is right on the mark with respect to the stimulative impact of \npayroll tax relief.\n  I hope my colleagues tomorrow will stand behind those words and \nsupport this proposal to help reinvigorate the economy.\n  Beyond the centerpiece of the wage tax credit which I talked about, \nagain $188 billion, the Landrieu-Corzine-Schumer amendment includes \nother provisions which are part of the underlying bill, such as \nmarriage penalty elimination, and acceleration of an expanded child tax \ncredit. We tried to take the best parts, the most powerful pieces of \nthe stimulus, and put them in the proposal. We are looking at high-\nmultiplier, high-return elements with regard to policies that we think \nwill get this economy going.\n  Maybe most importantly, I will not go into this because Senator \nLandrieu did such a great job of it and we have heard a lot of \ndiscussion on it, and I compliment the Finance chairman because he has \nrecognized the need for us to help out our cash-strapped State and \nlocal governments in supporting an amendment--I believe it should be \nmore, but reasonable folks can differ about the degree. We need to make \nsure we put real dollars into our State and local governments. We have \ntalked about it from our point of view, that that should be $52 \nbillion.\n  We have things that take advantage of advanced refunding, of the low \nfinancing rates, the lowest in 40 years. We put in here about \nrefinancing debt, just like the American consumer has with their \nmortgages over the last year, having our State and local governments \ntake advantage of that same thing.\n  We have worked with Medicaid, where there is truly a lot of hurt. We \nhave talked about unfunded mandates with Leave No Child Behind, also \nthe issue of child care assistance. We have $3 billion in this program \nfor those purposes because if people are going to work, they have to be \nable to take care of their kids. It is a kind of simple concept. Also, \ngeneral block grants for homeland security, education, and other \npriorities.\n  Beyond the assistance provided to State and local governments, our \namendment provides for a variety of tax cuts for business. We believe \nin those. We are supportive of those. We include in this an increase in \nthe expense from $25,000 to $100,000 a year for small business. We \nrepeatedly hear that 50 percent of the jobs in America come out of \nsmall business, which 99 percent of businesses are. We are trying to \nrecognize that, and we are also trying to help small business with a \n50-percent credit for health care premiums. It is one of those things \nthat holds back the economy most forcefully in New Jersey in other \ncommunities I work with.\n  Finally, our $350 billion package includes the nearly $13 billion in \nunemployment benefits that a number of folks have talked about. This is \na soggy economy, as Secretary Snow describes it. It is so soggy that we \nhave lost 2.7 million private sector jobs, including over 500,000 in \nthe last 3 months alone. We only have about 75 percent capacity \nutilization in the country. So there are needs.\n  While some of us might not agree on size, myself included, we might \nnot even agree we need a serious proposal on tax cuts, if we are going \nto do it, as we have decided to do it, we ought to make it as powerful \nas we can possibly make it. I think we should be responsible fiscally \nover a long period of time. I think deficits do matter. But if we are \ngoing to have a $350 billion tax cut, we ought to design it in a way \nthat will create jobs and promote growth, without undermining our long-\nterm fiscal health. Our amendment does that, and I am proud of this \namendment which I am offering, along with Senators Landrieu and \nSchumer. I very much appreciate their help and I hope our colleagues \nwill give serious consideration to a proposal that I think has real \nmeaning concerning job creation and economic activity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I think I still control the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa controls time in \nopposition.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. But I reserved as much time as I would consume to \npresent the amendment. I said I would speak for 15 minutes and then \nSenator Corzine, and if the Senator from Iowa would allow us to present \nour amendment, then we would be happy to yield to the opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is reserved, but the \nSenator from Iowa has the right to seek recognition in opposition.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, a number of misleading and just flat out \nwrong statements have been made by the proponents of this amendment. \nThey said this package does not help the military. I wonder where they \nhave been the last few months. We have already passed the military tax \ncut bill in the Senate and we are trying to work it out with the House. \nThat is the situation. So do not tell me we have not dealt with the \nproblems of the people in the military.\n  They argue we do not deal with unemployment benefits. I guess they \nwere not paying much attention when just a few hours ago we were \ntalking about extending unemployment benefits. I offered a unanimous \nconsent agreement at that time, but what happened? The other side, \nwhich is now complaining, rejected my offer to make that the top \npriority just as soon as we are done with this bill.\n  We also put together a strong bipartisan State aid package, which the \nother side has cried crocodile tears over. So I hope no one is misled \nby some of the previous rhetoric we have heard. The amendment is \nnongermane and violates the Budget Act. So obviously later on there \nwill be a point of order made on it.\n  To relieve any concern that the underlying bill is only concerned \nabout giving more money to corporations, I want to point out how this \nlegislation helps families. I will make a couple of points regarding \nthe distribution of tax benefits in our package. As I stated \nrepeatedly, the package fairly balances investment and consumption \nincentives within the plan and benefits families at all levels of \nincome.\n  Now, this is quite contrary to much of the rhetoric we have heard on \nthe proposal's distributional benefits. I have heard repeatedly that \nthe typical family receives only $217 of benefits under the bill, while \nmillionaires receive tens of thousands of dollars of such tax breaks. \nOne response to this is to note the progressivity of our system. A \nsimple example, however, is an effective way to demonstrate the bill \ndoes in fact provide benefits to families at all income levels. For \nillustrative purposes, I have analyzed the tax benefits of accelerating \nthe $400 increase in the child tax credit combined with the increased \nrefundability for single mothers of two children at various income \nlevels under the bill.\n  The example does not account for additional benefits that are also \nprovided in this bill with expanding the 10 percent bracket.\n  The charts I have with me demonstrate the tax benefits to that single \nmother with $15,000, single mother with $20,000, single mother with \n$30,000 of wage income during the 2003 tax year. As we can see, the \nfirst chart demonstrates a single mother of two with $15,000 of wage \nincome will receive an additional $250 of refundable tax credits under \nthis bill. This increased $250 comes from a combination of increasing \nthe tax credit amount and reducing the limits on refundability. With \nher refundable earned income credit of $3,823, her total refundable tax \ncredits would increase by $250 all the way up to $4,573.\n\n[[Page S6237]]\n\n  The second chart is for a family of $20,000 wage income, which \ndemonstrates a significant increase in benefit to the same single \nmother. At a slightly higher income level, she receives an additional \n$710 of benefits under the Finance Committee plan for a total \nrefundable credit of $4,270.\n  Finally, at $30,000, we can see this single mother receives the \nentire benefit of $800 increased child tax credit in the form of \nrefundable payments.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider these examples as further evidence of \nthe impact this bill will make on hard-working families in this country \nat different income levels, and I might say at all income levels. I \nhope the informed judgment will be made based upon fact and not upon \nthe statements previously given about this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I first want to thank my colleagues, \nSenator Landrieu and Senator Corzine, for their sponsorship of this \nimportant amendment.\n  I also want to recognize Senator Grassley, the distinguished Chairman \nof the Finance Committee, and Senator Baucus, the distinguished ranking \nmember, for their leadership. Democrats and Republicans may disagree on \nour economic priorities, but we all appreciate the contribution \nSenators Grassley and Baucus have made to the debate.\n  There is something else we all agree on. By any measure we are in the \nmidst of a very tough economy. Our long-term prospects are very bright, \nbut right now times are tough. We are all familiar with the \nstatistics--rising unemployment, choppy markets, low growth. These are \nreal problems that require real solutions.\n  But too often we hear economic theory and ideology as the rationale \nfor what we should do.\n  I believe that equitable tax relief can be very good short-term and \nlong-term policy. If we can find the means to afford it, hard-working \nfamilies and successful entrepreneurs should keep more of what they \nearn. And at this time of low economic growth and high economic \nuncertainty, there is an important role for the Federal Government to \nplay in reigniting our economy.\n  My concern with the legislation before us, and the reasons I support \na complete replacement of that bill, is quite simply that it does not \nwork as advertised. We all recognize that the bill is not a short-term \nresponse to the economic downturn. It is a back-door attempt to \nfundamentally change the tax code.\n  We may need to take up that debate at some point. But our first \npriority should be getting the economy moving.\n  We need to unite behind an economic plan that is based on the \npractical needs of our country for jobs and growth, not on an ideology \nof how the world works.\n  It is time to replace the centerpiece of the President's plan--the \ndividend tax cut--with something that both Democrats and Republicans \ncan rally behind, a one-time reduction in Federal payroll taxes, wage \ntaxes, for every working American. That is the heart of this amendment. \nAnd it is time we put in place real aid to State and local governments \nso that we don't undo the very economic recovery we are trying to \nstart.\n  Let me briefly review the key elements of wage tax relief.\n  Every working American is subject to taxes on his or her wages which \nare used primarily to fund Social Security and Medicare. Under the wage \ntax cut in this amendment, every American worker would receive a rebate \nfor the amount of these taxes they have paid on their first $10,000 of \nearnings, about $800 for each working American.\n  In addition, every employer would be eligible to receive a tax credit \nfor the payroll taxes they have contributed on behalf of their \nemployees. This tax relief would take effect as soon as possible in \n2003.\n  The cost of a payroll tax reduction would be paid out of the general \nfunds of the Treasury, so that there would be no impact on the Social \nSecurity trust fund.\n  The benefits of a payroll tax cut are numerous. First, a payroll tax \ncut gets money in the hands of people who need it and will spend it--\nthe litmus test for most economists of a good stimulus program.\n  While we can have a long debate about the merits of a dividend tax \ncut, in the real world an additional $800, or $1,600 in the case of two \nworking parents, would have a big impact on the average family's \nbudget.\n  Second, it is good economic policy. The problem with our economy \ntoday is that there is not enough demand for products and services. The \nadministration's supply-side approach, in fact, has it backwards. \nCapacity is not the problem, as illustrated by the fact that inflation \nhas dropped during this downturn from 2.8 percent in 2001 to 1.6 \npercent in 2002.\n\n  We need to encourage consumption so that businesses will have the \nconfidence to invest in new plants and equipment and hire more workers. \nBefore the debate was politicized, the Business Roundtable, which \nrepresents the CEOs of major U.S. corporations, wrote the President \nthat an immediate reduction in the payroll tax would be more effective \nthan ``any other proposal'' to stimulate demand and productivity.\n  Third, a payroll tax cut is equitable. It would benefit the many \nAmericans who work, not just the few who receive taxable dividends. The \nCongressional Research Service estimates that 40 percent of all \ndividends are received by the wealthiest 2 percent, or those with \nincomes of $200,000 or greater. By contrast, the majority of American \nhouseholds now pay more in payroll taxes than Federal income taxes.\n  Fourth, a payroll tax reduction removes a large disincentive to \ncreating jobs. In our present economy output is flat with GDP running \nat an annualized rate of only 1.6 percent, but productivity is \nincreasing. The result is that since 2000 the economy has lost over 2 \nmillion jobs, and Americans are remaining out of work longer. A payroll \ntax reduction will lower the cost of labor for an employer by about 15 \npercent, making it more likely that employers will keep workers on the \npayroll and hire more people.\n  Finally, a payroll tax cut is affordable. The $188 billion estimated \ncost of a one-time payroll tax reduction is about one-half the cost of \nthe President's dividend tax cut plan. While it costs less, a payroll \ntax reduction provides more immediate stimulus. By contrast, the \nPresident's dividend tax cut delivers only $2.5 billion in stimulus in \n2003--50 times less impact.\n  If we want to grow the economy today, it makes sense to put money to \nwork now, not ten years from now. Most importantly, since a payroll tax \ncut is a one year plan, it does not create structural deficits in our \neconomy which drive up our national debt and undermine our long term \ngrowth.\n  Let me now turn to the issue of State aid.\n  We have had bi-partisan agreement to provide $20 billion in direct \nFederal aid to the States and localities on a one-time basis. I commend \nSenator Grassley for his leadership in getting this done. It is a very \ngood start, but it is not enough.\n  This amendment provides a bigger boost to our States and locals. They \nclearly need the money.\n  According to estimates provided by the National Conference of State \nLegislatures, the total budgetary shortfall for all States in fiscal \nyear 2004 was in the range of $80 billion, and an approximate $22 \nbillion gap still remains from fiscal 2003. Many believe these figures \nremain significantly understated.\n  Almost every State is running a significant, multi-hundred million \ndollar deficit. In many States the figure runs into the multi-billions \nof dollars. In several States the deficit's percentage of the total \nState budget is estimated to be in the range of 25 percent or more. New \nYork State's budget shortfall alone is $12 billion.\n  The situation at the local level is just as dire.\n  According to the National Association of Counties, nearly 72 percent \nof counties are facing budget shortfalls, 37 percent are reducing \nservices and 17 percent are increasing taxes--all at a time when the \ndemand for services and the need for tax cuts is rising given the sour \neconomy.\n  This is not a regional issue. It is a national crisis.\n  I have heard some argue that State aid is not good economic policy. \nBut numerous reports indicate that most economists believe that aid to \nthe States is, in fact, an extremely effective means of providing \nfiscal stimulus,\n\n[[Page S6238]]\n\nas it quickly puts money in the hands of people who need it and will \nspend it.\n  State and local aid also alleviates the need for States to cut more \njobs, cut more programs, and raise taxes, which acts as an ``anti-\nstimulus'' on the economy.\n  Without any State aid, an individuals' or family's decrease in \nFederal taxes could be surpassed by an increase in State and local \ntaxes.\n  We should not support policies where, ``What one hand giveth the \nother taketh away.'' We should not ``rob Peter to pay Paul.''\n  This modest increase in the amount of aid is a 1-time shot in the arm \nfor the States. It is not an enormous, multi-year change that threatens \nto build more deficits. It is a short-term proposal in response to a \ncrisis that threatens to further drag down our economy and further \nincrease the tax burden on our citizens.\n  Some argue that States and cities have dug their own fiscal graves, \nand should now lie in them. I could not disagree more. Our States and \ncities face the same economic forces as the Federal Government. As the \neconomy has forced a dramatic reversal in fiscal health in our Federal \nbudget, so has it wreaked havoc on local budgets.\n\n  Why should we hold states and localities to a different standard than \nwe hold ourselves?\n  And if we want to teach states a lesson, why should we force citizens \nto bear the brunt of that discipline through higher taxes on their \nincome, bigger class sizes for their children, and less services for \nthose in need?\n  The money we are discussing is not a bailout. Nowhere close. States \nand locals will still need to make painful cuts and possibly raise \ntaxes. But we can help alleviate the pain which will fall not on \nlawmakers, as we all know, but on our citizens.\n  At a time when we are struggling to find funds for homeland defense, \npublic education, health services, and the environment, it is \nunacceptable to many of us to push through massive, multi-year tax \ncuts.\n  On behalf of the many citizens and business leaders who play by the \nrules and quietly shoulder the burden of financing our government, it \nis time for a new approach.\n  This amendment gives us an opportunity for that new approach.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank my colleagues for their comments. I will speak \nan additional 2 or 3 minutes to wrap up, as I stated when I began.\n  First of all, I have a great deal of respect for the Senator from \nIowa, who has been under a great deal of pressure to try to provide a \nplan for the Senate to consider. If we are given a fair hand, we could \nhave actually designed a plan that could have been more stimulative, \nmore fair, more equitable than the one we will be considering tomorrow.\n  No. 1, the dividend proposal--and I could say scheme--tries to \nconvince people this will create jobs in America when it will not \ncreate jobs, and it will raise taxes because of the way it is designed \nin the big picture, taxes at the local level. That is happening now.\n  If people think that is not going to happen, look at Arkansas. The \nState of Arkansas just raised income taxes across the board by 3 \npercent. That is why they have a zero deficit, because they just raised \nincome taxes.\n  This plan, if it does not create jobs, will actually raise taxes at \nthe local level. In Louisiana, only 18 percent of filers even file for \na dividend tax. The average is $450 in earnings, so we are saving them \n$100.\n\n  The plan that Senator Corzine, Senator Schumer, and I offer will give \nrelief to every worker. It gives help to the creation of jobs in \nAmerica. It gives a check to every businessperson, every small \nbusiness, every large business. It puts money in the economy in a \nsignificant amount. For a two-wage-earner family, it is $1,500--not \nnext year, not in 2004. The checks go out within a few months--two \nchecks this year.\n  Averages can be extremely misleading. One of the best examples of \nthis was an article written recently that said if Bill Gates--assume he \nwas worth $20 billion--happened to walk into a homeless shelter and sat \ndown at a table with 19 homeless men, and one of the guys from the \nother side walked in and said, What is the average income of the people \nin this homeless shelter, the average income would be $1 billion. But \nthat average is not reflective of the reality, which is one guy has $20 \nbillion and 19 guys have zero. But the average would be $1 billion.\n  So beware of averages. I am not fighting for averages. I am fighting \nfor the 4.5 million people who live in Louisiana who deserve a break. \nIf we are going to give out $350 billion on this floor, then give them \na fighting chance to get a portion of it, to keep their job, to send \ntheir kid to college, to pay their house note. And stop confusing them \nwith these charts and these averages that do not mean a hill of beans. \nTalk the truth to people. That is what we need. We need to speak the \ntruth and keep our promises and be disciplined in what we do.\n  I offer this amendment with a great deal of passion. A great deal of \nstudy has gone into this because we want to work with the President. I \nwant to work with the President. I want to work with the Republican \nleadership. I have demonstrated that time and time again.\n  But I can't vote for a package that doesn't make sense, that will not \ncreate jobs, and will raise taxes, all the time promising people it is \ngoing to do the opposite.\n  Like I said on the television, it is hogwash. We are going to offer \nour amendment tomorrow. Hopefully, we will get some votes.\n  I ask to send two other amendments to the desk. I am not going to \ndebate them tonight, but I offer them now and ask to have the clerk \nreport them. I offer them for consideration but not until tomorrow.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 620\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to laying aside the pending \namendment?

Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is not in order while time \nremains on the first-degree amendment.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I withdraw the second-degree amendment.\n  I want to speak on the first amendment I sent to the desk. The \namendment I have sent to the desk is a fairly simple amendment. It was \none of those ideas you find when you go around and listen to real \npeople. When you do that, you can come up with ideas that will lead to \ngood policy that will actually help real Americans get back to work.\n  It has been said that we are in a sluggish economy right now. I agree \nwith that. Certainly, the American economy is the strongest economy in \nthe world. It has been incredibly resilient, but it is not nearly as \nstrong as what we would like to see. So when you talk to various \npeople, there are all kinds of ideas of how to get the economy started.\n  While I support what the President is trying to do, I have talked to \na lot of people in small businesses and large businesses who support \nthe elimination of the double taxation on dividends. They support the \nacceleration of the cuts in the marginal tax rates and several of the \nother small business expensing items and the like in the bill that the \nPresident had sent up here, parts of which are in the Finance \nCommittee's mark. Those provisions will stimulate the economy.\n  I have a provision we sent to the desk that, for a very little cost, \nas far as the people who score these budgets ascertained, for very \nlittle cost will put a tremendous amount of money into the U.S. \neconomy.\n  Right now, we encourage businesses to go overseas. We encourage that \nthrough our Tax Code, and actually it is beneficial a lot of times for \ncompanies to relocate overseas. But if they do that and make money and \npay taxes in those other countries, when they try to bring the money \nback here to invest in this country, they pay a 35 percent tax rate on \nthat money. So if a company is faced with bringing the money they have \nmade overseas back here or investing that money overseas, they say to \nthemselves: Do I want to invest $100 out of every $100 overseas or do I \nwant to invest $65 out of every $100 back here in the United States? \nThe obvious answer is they keep that money overseas, and they invest \nthat overseas.\n  I appreciate the support of both the ranking member and the chairman \nof the Finance Committee. This amendment was brought up in the Finance \nCommittee. They both voted for it. I appreciate their vote on it. It \nnarrowly lost, by one vote. That is why we are taking another run at \nthis.\n  Our amendment says we will give companies that have invested overseas \nand have made money overseas 1 year's time to bring that money back to \nthe United States and, instead of paying a 35-percent tax rate, they \nwill only pay a 5.25-percent tax rate.\n  J.P. Morgan and Associates just did a study to find out how much \nmoney would actually come back into the United States if this amendment \nis adopted within 12 months, the next 12 months. It is estimated $300 \nbillion will come back into the United States--$300 billion.\n  Compare that with all the other plans that have been talked about \naround here. For a cost of only $4 billion over 10 years, as far as \nwhat the budget people score it, as far as loss of tax revenues, to get \na $300 billion boost in the economy--there is nothing else in the \nstimulus package that gives you as much bang for the buck.\n  While I support the rest of it, and I am voting for the rest of it, \nthis is something that needs to be included in a stimulus package \nbecause this will truly bring the money back into the United States.\n  This is money that is not going to be here any other way. This is not \ntaking money away from Government and putting it in the private sector, \nor taking it away from the private sector and putting it in the \nGovernment. This is money outside the United States that will come back \nhere and create U.S. jobs.\n  This is a bipartisan amendment. We have done a couple of things to \nmake sure it not just comes back here. It cannot go for executive pay, \nfor one thing. It has to come back here and be invested in the United \nStates, in their companies in the United States.\n  We have gone around and talked to people in business, instead of \nrelying on a study. I went around talking to a lot of businesses. I was \ntalking to some people the other day. They said they have $2 billion in \ncash sitting overseas that they would bring back here in a heartbeat if \nthis passed. That is $2 billion in high-tech industry. A big part of \nthe sluggish part of our economy has been in the high-tech industry--$2 \nbillion in just one company that will come back here to the United \nStates in the next 12 months. You can clearly see this would have a \nvery strong stimulative effect on our economy.\n  I thank the cosponsors of the original bill that we introduced--\nSenator Boxer, Senator Gordon Smith, and Senator Allen--for joining as \noriginal cosponsors of this bill. It is bipartisan in nature. Several \nother Members from the other side of the aisle have approached us.\n  We think this amendment will be a significant part of this stimulus \npackage. Most people aren't aware of this amendment. Most people aren't \naware of the impact it will have on the economy. But I encourage all of \nour colleagues to learn about this before we vote on it tomorrow. It is \nvery obvious that there are upsides to this. I just do not see any \ndownside. The upsides are tremendous. A huge amount of money\n\n[[Page S6241]]\n\nwill come back into the United States to create American jobs.\n  If you ask yourself whether to vote for this amendment, you just have \nto ask yourself whether you want to create jobs overseas or do you want \nto create jobs in the United States? We are talking about $300 billion \ncoming back into the United States in the next 12 months to create \njobs. That is a lot of capital. We have heard about the lack of capital \nand business investment being part of the recession. This would be a \nsignificant addition to our economy.\n  I encourage our colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in regard to the statement just made by \nthe Senator from Nevada, I voted for the amendment that he speaks about \nin committee. It lost by a 1-vote margin. I don't know whether Members \nhave had a chance to give it the thorough thought it ought to have when \nit is brought up on the floor. I hope Members will take a good look at \nit. If there is evidence to back up what has been said about the \namendment bringing money home, it is something that would give a shot \nin the arm to the economy. It ought to be something we look at. I think \nthere has been some talk about it, but not enough at this point. I am \nnot suggesting the amendment should not be voted for tomorrow. I am \njust suggesting it is something I am taking a very good look at.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield for a short statement and then I want to \ncontinue.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. The only comment I would make is that a couple of years \nago when this was introduced, the Joint Tax Committee scored this as \nbringing about $150 billion back into the economy. J. P. Morgan's--a \nprivate institution--latest study estimated it would be $300 billion. \nThey have the latest figures. That is where we would come up \nconservatively. Even if you do not go with the new study, the old study \nsaid $150 billion. It puts a lot of money back into the economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grassley). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all pending \namendments be temporarily set aside so that the Senator from New York \ncan offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 557\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I send amendment No. 557 to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 557.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make higher \n                       education more affordable)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title V, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____.

      (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by this subsection \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2002.\n       (c) Application of EGTRRA.--The amendment made by \n     subsection (b) shall be subject to title IX of the Economic \n     Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 to the same \n     extent and in the same manner as the provision of such Act to \n     which such amendment relates.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will be brief.\n  This amendment would continue the work we made in the last tax bill a \nfew years back to further increase the deduction for college tuition. \nThe bottom line is a simple one: College is a necessity today for young \npeople. Good jobs are hardly available without a college education. \nThey are getting rarer and rarer. Yet the cost of college is very, very \nexpensive.\n  If you are wealthy, you can afford it. If you are poor, we often pay \nfor your tuition, as we should. I fully support that. But if you are in \nthe middle class, that tuition bill every year is a fright. My wife and \nI make good salaries, and we are up late at night trying to figure out \nhow we are going to pay for our two daughters' college education. One \nis a freshman in college. One is in the 8th grade. So we know, because \nour salary is better than the average American, what the average \nAmerican does: They struggle in terms of thinking of how they are going \nto pay for tuition.\n  This amendment, cosponsored by Senators Biden, Boxer, Durbin, \nCantwell, and Lieberman, takes the current deduction and makes it \npermanent, because now it expires at the end of 2005. It increases the \neligible tuition amount to $8,000 for the tax year 2003\n\n[[Page S6242]]\n\nand $12,000 for the tax year 2004 and thereafter. It now is $4,000 for \nthe tax year 2003 and thereafter.\n  The deduction is available to joint filers with taxable income up to \n$130,000, with a phase-out up to $160,000; and single filers with \ntaxable income up to $65,000, with a phase-out up to $80,000.\n  The bottom line is simple: This helps middle-class people with \nperhaps the greatest problem they struggle with. It also can be taken \nby parents or grandparents who pay the tuition of a dependent child or \ngrandchild. It applies to any student enrolled at least half time, \nincluding graduate students. It is per student, so if you have two \nstudents in college or graduate school, you get the deduction for each \nof them.\n  It would cost about $26.3 billion for the 10-year period of 2003 to \n2013. The cost of the amendment would be offset by slowing the \nacceleration of the top tax rate reduction so that the top rate would \nbecome 37.6 percent in 2004 and 35 percent in 2006.\n  Now, again, we are dealing with choices. It would be nice to get that \ntop rate down quickly, but if you ask me, the future of America depends \non kids who deserve to go to the best college being able to afford to \ngo to the best college. That is probably more important than quickly \naccelerating the top rate.\n  This amendment, as I said, applies to the solid, middle class who get \nvery, very few tax breaks and yet sweat and struggle to send their \nchildren to college.\n  Mr. President, when a young man or young woman either does not go to \ncollege, even though they have the grades to get in, or goes to a \nlesser college than the one they deserve to go to, they lose. Their \nlifetime productivity will be lower. Their families lose, but we lose. \nAmerica loses, because in this new ideas-oriented economy, we need the \nbest educated labor force possible.\n  So I can hardly think of a better investment for America than tuition \ndeductibility. We made a good step in the tax bill of 2001, as I said.\n  For the first time, I, Senator Snowe of Maine, and then-Senator \nTorricelli of New Jersey managed to get this into the tax bill for up \nto the $4,000 level. This will bring it up to $8,000 and make sure it \ndoes not expire in 2005.\n  Mr. President, as I said, in today's information-driven economy, a \ncollege degree is no longer a luxury, it is a necessity.\n  In terms of long-term economic growth and developing this country's \nhuman capital--which is ultimately the true source of innovation and \ncompetitive advantage--we could make a few better investments than \nensuring future generations have access to an affordable college \neducation.\n  The challenge is that the cost of college tuition has increased \nfaster than any other major consumer item including health care over \nthe last 20 years, skyrocketing from $5,156 in 1981 to $21,768 in 2001, \nan increase of 322 percent.\n  Even in real, inflation adjusted dollars the price of a 4-year public \nor private college education has almost doubled over the past two \ndecades.\n  As currently written, this bill does everything except invest in \npeople. We have incentives for plants, property, and equipment. Let's \ntake this opportunity to invest in the next generation.\n  As I said, the amendment makes the current tax deduction permanent \nand increases the eligible tuition amount to $8,000 for tax year 2003 \nand $12,000 for tax year 2004 and thereafter.\n  The deduction is available to joint filers with taxable income up to \n$130,000, with a phaseout up to $160,000, and single filers with \ntaxable income up to $65,000, with a phaseout up to $80,000. For \nexample, for a joint filer with an income of $105,000, the legislation \nwould mean a savings of as much as $3,240.\n  The legislation would allow families to choose the Hope Scholarship \ninstead of the deduction, depending on which is more beneficial to \nthem.\n  I know the hour is late. I heard my colleague from North Dakota got \nout of his lovely home to come to the floor because he was so eager to \nspeak, and I am eagerly awaiting his remarks. I hope he did not have to \nget out of his pajamas and back into his nice suit and tie. I don't \nknow what his status was while he was at home.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask that my remaining time be ceded \nback to the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, under our informal agreement, we had been \nswitching back and forth. The Senator from South Carolina is now \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I urge the Senator, at this late hour, to \nspeak briefly so everybody who wants to speak can. The bewitching hour \narrives at about 10 minutes after midnight tonight.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. With that in mind, I will be very \nbrief.\n  Mr. President, I do appreciate the opportunity to be recognized very \nbriefly. The reason I want to speak is to recognize the Finance \nchairman's great job, taking a pretty bad situation and making the best \nof it. It got off to a rocky start in the Senate about how to craft a \ntax package to help stimulate the economy. But I am very impressed by \nwhat has happened.\n  Almost everyone has some view of how to cut taxes. That is good for \nthe American public. I am not here to criticize my colleagues on the \nother side who have put forward tax packages. I think we all see the \neconomy soggy--whatever adjective you want to use--but both parties \nhave a view of getting money back into the economy. That is good.\n\n  I congratulate those who have stepped up to the plate to put money \nback into the economy. I may disagree with your approach. But also I \nwould like to congratulate those Senators who took the road less \ntraveled; that is, saying: We do not need a tax cut. We cannot afford a \ntax cut. We are in deficits. Now is not the time to take money out of \nthe revenue stream. We should be retiring the debt. To those Senators, \nI say, you are absolutely right in terms of having a philosophy that \nmakes sense.\n  The problem is, if we do not cut taxes, we have shown a propensity, \nparticularly our friends on the other side, to spend the money. That is \nan overarching thing that I think is well-documented.\n  It is not a debate as to whether we will take the $350 billion, the \n$152 billion, the $550 billion, or the $726 billion, and put it on the \ndebt. That is not going to happen. That should happen, but it is not \ngoing to happen.\n  So now the debate becomes, how do we take whatever money we are going \nto set aside for taxes to create jobs? Because if it does not create \njobs, I am not going to vote for it.\n  Twelve Democratic Senators joined with the President and members of \nthe majority party to cut taxes in 2001 in a very comprehensive manner. \nA lot has happened since that tax cut: America has been attacked, the \ndefense spending needs have gone up, the Iraq war has come, and a lot \nof money has been spent. But I would argue that everything we have done \nto make America stronger, to free the people of Iraq, making us \nstronger, is money well spent. Let's keep that same theme of spending \nour money wisely.\n  The one thing that disappoints me about my friends on the other side \nis that every amendment they have to offer or every approach to taxes \ngoes after the dividend tax cut. That is the centerpiece of the \nPresident's view of how to stimulate the economy. Every amendment being \noffered takes money from the dividend tax cut to pay for that \namendment.\n  The best example of what is going on here is Senator Dorgan's \namendment about repealing the Social Security tax. A month ago we had a \nchance to do that, and our friends on the other side en masse voted no. \nWe had a chance to expand the budget resolution by doing away with the \ntax on senior citizens at the 85-percent rate on their Social Security. \nThis tax was put in in 1993 by our friends on the other side. I would \nargue that offering this amendment now is the best evidence one could \npoint to as to what is going on here. Everything this President is \nasking for in terms of job stimulus and economic activity beyond \nhelping people put money in their pockets goes to\n\n[[Page S6243]]\n\nthe dividends, double taxation exclusion.\n  The Senate Finance Committee has produced a bill that addresses that \nproblem. There will be an amendment on this floor that will basically \nmirror what the President has asked for. It will take taxation \ndividends to zero for a 3-year period.\n  I honestly believe that is the best way to create jobs simply because \nif you could buy stock and receive a dividend without paying taxes, \nmore people would be likely to buy stock. People say the stock market \nwould go up 10 or 20 percent. I don't know if that is right or not, but \nthat makes sense to me.\n  The $350 billion tax proposal by Senator Landrieu I disagree with. \nBut you have to understand that the difference between Senator \nDaschle's plan of $152 billion, the Finance Committee's of $350 \nbillion, and Senator Landrieu's amendment of $350 billion is negligible \nin terms of the money it takes out of the economy to help people \nreceive tax benefits. So this argument that our President's plan \ndoubles the national debt has to give way to facts. Everybody is \nwanting to cut taxes.\n  The point I am trying to make is the American people have to choose \nbetween these competing plans. We will have to choose. Here is what I \nam going to do. I am going to make a choice to take the tax package \nthat was passed in 2001 and accelerate the benefits. Because the reason \nwe haven't received the full benefit of the 2001 tax package is we put \neverything off in terms of rate reductions. Let's take the money we are \nputting on the table now and accelerate the rates. Let's accelerate the \nchild tax credit so people will have more money to spend. But let's do \nsomething we didn't do in 2001. Let's create a system so that jobs can \nbe created by economic activity.\n  You will never convince me that if you make an investment in the \nstock market more attractive, people will not have better jobs, and \nthere will be more jobs for people. That is why I will follow the lead \nof the President.\n  I am pleased that I am a Member of the Senate at a time when both \nparties want to cut taxes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, we find ourselves here, yet again, \nconfronted with the third tax cut package in 3 years from the \nPresident. As a recent Washington Post article pointed out, President \nBush seems dead set on ramming through tax cuts every year he is in the \nPresidency---regardless of the economy, regardless of the budget \ndeficit, regardless of its competition with much-needed programs like a \nuniversal and comprehensive prescription drug benefit for Medicare.\n  In fact, after years of harping on budget deficits, the Republican \nParty has now jettisoned its sense of fiscal responsibility, but only \nafter President Clinton adopted that same fiscal responsibility and \nsuccessfully delivered budget surpluses. Now, Republicans are silent on \nthe issue.\n  But only when we put all of these concerns aside do we get to the \nmost fundamental question---the question of fairness. President Bush \nhas taken great strides to launch preemptive rhetorical attacks, \nclaiming Democrats are engaging in class warfare with opposition to tax \ncuts. But when we consider the facts, it is the President who is \nengaging in class warfare by pushing through a package that steals from \nthe poor and then gives to the rich. His preemptive rhetorical attacks \nwill not measure up to the facts.\n  So, with all the challenges we have ahead, we are being asked to vote \non another tax cut that will not help the average American family. It \nis incumbent on us to separate the myth of Republican rhetoric from \nreality in how this tax cut will affect our constituents, our families, \nand our country. It is time to set the record straight.\n  Myth 1: The Republican tax proposals are best at generating new jobs \nand promoting a strong sustainable recovery. The reality is that the \nRepublican tax proposals are poorly targeted to the problems facing the \neconomy. They generate fewer jobs and less economic growth this year \nwhen they are needed most than does the Democratic alternative.\n  The economy is in a slump now, with 2.7 million fewer private sector \njobs than in March 2001, and even the Fed's outlook for the near future \nis weak.\n  Economic forecasters expect that the economy will eventually bounce \nback, but they have been expecting a recovery ``soon'' for over a year \nand it has not come yet. With the economy still in a slump, with excess \nunemployment and underutilized factories, the policy we need now is \njob-creating stimulus that restores full employment quickly.\n  Republicans still insist that long-term tax cuts for the wealthy \nsomehow create jobs, despite the poor track record that 1.7 million \njobs have been lost since passage of the 2001 tax cut. Their program is \nso backloaded that it doesn't take effect until past the time when it \nis needed. Such a policy is not just ineffective but counterproductive, \nbecause it creates large deficits and an increase in the public debt \nthat is a drag on long-term growth.\n  Additionally, most of the Republicans' proposed capital income tax \ncuts reward capital owners without directly encouraging new capital \nformation or higher output. Such tax cuts can't be expected to create \nnew jobs if they don't encourage output. In fact, to the extent that \nthe tax cuts effectively reduce the cost of capital facing businesses, \nsome businesses may be encouraged to substitute capital for labor \nwithout increasing their output, so that jobs are lost rather than \ngained. If the goal of the tax cut is really job creation, the tax cuts \nshould be designed to directly encourage businesses to hire more \nworkers.\n  The Democratic proposal adheres to the basic principles of sound \npolicy: it provides a boost to job creation and economic growth now \nwhen it is needed and does not create large future deficits or \nincreases in debt that are a drag on growth. The Democratic plan just \nhas ``more taste'' and is ``less filling.''\n  When the JEC Democratic staff compared the impact on jobs and growth \nof the President's $726 billion ``Jobs and Growth Initiative'' and a \nmuch smaller but more targeted Democratic alternative, they found that \nthe Democratic proposal generated roughly twice the additional jobs and \ngrowth by the end of this year than the President's plan but at one-\nseventh the cost. The Republican proposal provides less growth and \nfewer jobs in the first year when they are really needed than the \nDemocratic proposal.\n  Myth 2: The Republican tax proposals are good for economic growth. \nThe reality is that the Republican tax proposals hurt economic growth \nand depress national income in the long run.\n  An analysis by the JEC Democratic staff found that because of its \nlong-run budgetary costs, the President's plan had adverse long-run \nsupply-side effects that lowered national income in 2013 by 0.4 to 0.6 \npercent. In their most recent analysis of the President's budget, the \nCBO found adverse macroeconomic effects if tax cuts are not paid for--\nthat a proper ``dynamic scoring'' would raise, not lower, the costs of \nthe administration's tax proposals.\n  Economic theories that claim that private saving should fully make up \nfor drops in public saving are unsupported by experience. What did we \nlearn from the Reagan era and the fiscal discipline of the 1990s? The \nReagan tax cuts pulled down both public saving and national saving; the \ntax cuts failed to generate the large supply-side responses that had \nbeen claimed by the proponents of the cuts.\n  Myth 3: The Republican proposals are fair and are aimed at the middle \nclass. In reality, the Republican proposals are unfair and are heavily \ntilted toward the very top of the income distribution.\n  The lion's share of the tax cuts enacted in 2001 already went to the \nvery richest of households, particularly the tax cuts scheduled to take \neffect after 2002. Before the 2001 tax cut, the justification for large \ntax cuts for the wealthy was that we were simply ``returning the \npeople's money'' and getting rid of surpluses that were too big, and \nthe wealthy were the ones who paid the most in taxes. But that is \nclearly not the case because now we have no surpluses.\n  By 2010 when the tax cut is fully phased in, over a third of the tax \ncut goes to the richest 1 percent of households, while less than one-\nfourth goes to the entire bottom 60 percent. Despite this, the \nadministration has proposed additional tax cuts that would clearly \nbenefit only high-income households: the dividend tax exclusion and the \nnew savings incentives. As part of their growth and jobs package, the\n\n[[Page S6244]]\n\nadministration also proposes to accelerate the portions of the 2001 Tax \nAct that highest-income households benefit the most, while leaving \nunchanged, continuing to phase in slowly, elements of the 2001 tax cut \nthat most benefit lowest income families with children. The plan truly \nkeeps the spirit of the administration's proposals--``leave no \nmillionaire behind.''\n  In advertising just how ``fair'' their growth package is, the \nadministration has repeatedly relied on the average tax cut statistic, \nstating that households will ``on average'' receive a tax cut of over \n$1,000 in 2003. But this is far greater than what a typical household \nnear the middle of the income distribution would receive; in fact, \nfour-fifths of households would receive less than this amount. \nAccording to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, the middle 20 \npercent of households would get tax cuts averaging only $200 in 2003 \nfrom the President's plan. Meanwhile, households in the top 1 percent \nwould enjoy an average tax cut of over $20,000, and millionaires would \nget tax cuts averaging about $90,000.\n  The compromise tax cut package crafted by Senator Grassley limits the \ndividend exemption to the first $500 of a family's dividends in fiscal \nyear 2003, increasing by 10 percent of dividend income above $500 from \n2004 to 2007, and 20 percent above $500 from 2008 to 2012. Still, even \nin the first year with the $500 limit, the great bulk of the dividend \ntax cuts will go to highest income households simply because they are \nmost likely to have dividend income, and among those with dividend \nincome are the most likely to have at least $500 of dividend income. In \nlater years as the tax break for higher dividend income increases, the \nshare of the dividend tax cut benefiting highest income households will \nincrease. Overall, the Grassley plan would still provide a \ndisproportionately large tax cut to the highest income households.\n  But most importantly, even though the low- and moderate-income \nfamilies need the most help in this troubled economy, Republican \nproposals assist them the least.\n  Myth 4: The Republican tax plan is the best way to address the \nproblems of long-term unemployment. The reality is that the Republican \ntax plan ignores the plight of the unemployed and the long-term \nunemployed.\n  Although the temporary Federal unemployment insurance program will \nexpire at the end of May for workers exhausting regular state UI \nbenefits, currently the Republican plan does not extend the program. \nNor does the plan provide any further assistance to the approximately \n1.1 million workers who have exhausted all of their unemployment \nbenefits and still have not found work.\n  The unemployment rate today is 6.0 percent, higher than when the \ntemporary Federal UI program was created in March, 2002, or extended in \nJanuary, 2003. During the last 3 months, over 540,000 private-sector \njobs have been lost and the economy has lost 2.7 million private-sector \njobs since the recession began. On average, job losses in a recession \nbottom out after about 15 months and are erased within 2 years. The \npersistence of job losses at the 25-month mark in this recession is the \nmost severe since the 1930s. These workers have carried the brunt of \nthis recession, there are simply no jobs out there for them.\n  Myth 5: The Republican tax plan is fiscally responsible, but the \nreality is that the Republican plan leads to deficits as far as the eye \ncan see and exacerbates the fiscal pressures posed by the imminent \nretirement of the baby boom generation.\n  What was a $5.6 trillion 10-year surplus when the President took \noffice has virtually disappeared, even without counting any current \nproposals. The administration has repeatedly claimed that the \ndeterioration was largely out of their control, but the fact is that \neven including the effects of the recession and other technical changes \nto the CBO budget forecast, the tax cuts already passed are responsible \nfor over a third of the deterioration in the budget. Enactment of the \nPresident's new budget proposals would result in a $2.1 trillion 10-\nyear deficit--a turnaround of an astounding $7.7 trillion.\n  A particularly large bias in administration estimates comes from \nassuming that expiring tax provisions will indeed expire and that the \nalternative minimum tax will continue to affect a larger and larger \nsegment of the population without any fix.\n  Deficits reduce national saving, reduce the resources available for \nproductive investments, and hence reduce future economic growth. Even \nChairman Greenspan recently warned of the danger to our nation's long-\nterm economic health: ``I support the program to reduce double taxation \non dividends and the necessary other actions in the federal budget to \nmake it revenue-neutral . . . it should be done in the context of paygo \nrules, which means that the deficit must be maintained at minimal \nlevels.''\n  Myth 6: States will benefit from the Republican tax plan. The reality \nis that the Republican tax plan ignores the fiscal crisis of the States \nand probably makes it worse.\n  The Senate Republican plan established a $20 billion fund to be \nequally divided between State governments and local governments, to be \nused for education and job training, health care including Medicaid, \ninfrastructure, law enforcement, and other essential services. However, \nat the same time, the Federal tax changes will reduce State revenues by \napproximately $10 billion, leaving States on net with no additional \nfunds.\n\n  The recession that began in March 2001 has hit State budgets from \nboth sides. Income and sales tax revenues have fallen with reduced \neconomic activity, while the demands on social services have grown as \njoblessness has increased and family incomes have declined. Every week \nbrings a new headline--or two--announcing another State's proposed \ncutbacks in services or program eligibility as it responds to a \nworsening budget crisis. Numerous spending cuts in social programs, \nincluding Medicaid, have been announced by States as they work to close \ntheir widening funding gaps. Some 22 States have proposed or adopted \ncuts in Medicaid and the SCHIP that would drop coverage for at least \n1.7 million people if all the proposals were adopted. Prospects for \n2004 are worse: the National Conference of State Legislators estimates \nthat 41 States will face a cumulative budget shortfall of $78 billion.\n  The Democratic proposal requires that the Federal Government provide \ntwice as much money to help States mitigate the negative impacts of the \nrecession on poor and working families. This will also aid job \ncreation.\n  Myth 7: The congressional Republican tax plans adhere to the limits \nset in the budget resolution. The reality is that the Republican tax \nplans are full of ``smoke and mirrors'' gimmicks that hide their true \ncosts.\n  The true cost of the 2001 tax cut is much greater than the official \ncost because of the gimmicks of phase-ins and sunsets and because the \ntax cut allowed the alternative minimum tax to pick up additional \nrevenue from more and more over time--a situation that is not likely to \nbe tolerated for too long. The official cost ignores interest costs as \nwell. As a result, a more realistic estimate of the cost of the 2001 \ntax cut is much greater than the official cost--nearly $2.5 trillion \nover the first 10 years, not the $1.35 trillion as officially scored. A \nfully phased in version of the tax cut would cost even more over 10 \nyears, over $4 trillion, even before counting interest payments.\n  Myth 8: Republican tax and budget proposals are no threat to Social \nSecurity and Medicare. In reality the Republican tax and budget \nproposals break our promises on Social Security and Medicare.\n  Tax cuts now mean even bigger tax increases later. The Bush tax cut \nagenda gambles away the income security of future generations, and for \nwhat? Current tax cuts to the wealthy, which Republicans claim will \nultimately benefit everyone. Instead, those tax cuts will ultimately \ncost everyone.\n  Our country's impending demographic challenge and corresponding \nfiscal pressures are a certainty. We were already faced with tough \ndecisions ahead about how the retirement of the baby boomers would be \nmade ``affordable'' to our Government budget: either taxes will have to \nrise in the future, spending cuts, or some combination of both. The \nBush tax cut agenda is not responsible for that situation, but it \nsurely and dramatically has made the tough problem even tougher. It \nmakes the fiscal hole even deeper, and it unjustly pushes off most\n\n[[Page S6245]]\n\nof the financial responsibility for the tax cuts and government \nprograms we now enjoy, onto our children and grandchildren. We're \nputting our tax cuts on a credit card that our kids will have to pay \noff.\n  In the end, tax reform should be considered in a time of surpluses \nand not in a time during record budget deficits. Most importantly, we \nas a Congress have responsibility to act fairly and effectively to \ncombat our Nation's economic crises. The Republican plans do not live \nup to that responsibility and I can only hope that my words today have \nseparated the rhetorical myths from the facts.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, once again we have a challenging task before \nus. We have to draw a road map that will lead to economic growth, \ndevelopment, and future sustainability. We have to come up with a \npackage that is fair to all taxpayers. One that eliminates complexity \ninstead of creating more of it. Unfortunately, this is much easier said \nthan done. So far, we have all been talking about it. In fact, as I \nhave listened to my colleagues speak throughout the day, I have been \nstruck by the unusual tenor of this debate. We have Democrats claiming \nthey want to eliminate tax increases and Republicans saying we need to \nuse tax increases to offset other provisions. While I have serious \nreservations about voting for a package that appears to rob Peter to \npay Paul, I believe the Finance Committee has crafted a bill that will \nlead to the creation of new jobs. And, that is what this debate should \nbe about.\n  In April, the number of unemployed people in this country rose to 8.8 \nmillion--8.8 million. That is 8.8 million Americans without jobs and \nwithout paychecks--but still with plenty of bills to pay. That kind of \neconomic chaos sends ripples throughout the economy. It affects more \nand more people until we do something to stop it. Until we take action \nto stem and control the problem so that the economy can regain its \nstrength.\n  The strength of our economy lies in our workforce, so we have to put \ninto place a plan for growth that will actually encourage the creation \nof new jobs. I think this plan is a good step toward that goal, and I \nbelieve the tax relief provided in this plan will put money back into \nthe pockets of taxpayers and provide much needed resources for \nbusinesses to draw on in order to create more jobs for those who need \nthem.\n  That is what I would like to talk about for a moment--the employers, \nthe small business owners, the entrepreneurs. I am a strong supporter \nof the President's dividend proposal, and I am extremely disappointed \nwe have been forced to reduce it in the Senate. I would hope we could \neventually reach an agreement here and with our colleagues in the House \nto restore that proposal.\n  Nearly every week, I go back to Wyoming, and small business owners \nand local residents from around my State want to talk about the \nunfairness of our tax policy when it comes to the double taxation of \ndividends. In fact, I have a stack of over 300 letters from \nconstituents representing different age groups and different income \nlevels supporting the full elimination of the double taxation on \ndividends.\n  Although some of my colleagues continue to misrepresent to the \nAmerican people that this provision would only help the rich, I think \nit is important to remind everyone that families, single people, \nmarried couples, college students, working mothers, single dads, senior \ncitizens, and everybody in between are all unfairly burdened by the \nloss of spendable cash that results from the double taxation of \ndividends. We should not be surprised by that. After all, it is not \njust corporate executives who receive dividends.\n  If we eliminate the double taxation on dividends we will put money \nback into the pockets of hardworking taxpayers, and we will also create \njobs for working Americans across the country. Studies have shown that \nthe President's dividend proposal could create as many as 400,000 new \njobs. That would provide enough jobs for over four-fifths of Wyoming's \npopulation. That is a lot of jobs.\n  I would prefer we pass a dividend proposal that completely eliminates \nthis unfair double taxation, but I understand why my colleagues on the \nFinance Committee had to come up with a new dividend plan. They were \nfaced with a tough problem--staying within the budgetary constraints \nset forth by Congress while still providing real, economic growth. I \nbelieve they came up with a workable compromise that will provide some, \nif not all, of the relief necessary to encourage short and long-term \ninvestment by individuals and corporations. Under this plan, \nindividuals will have more money to reinvest in their portfolio, and \ncompanies will be more likely to use equity financing to fund future \ngrowth.\n  Other important components of this bill are the small business and \nagricultural provisions, as well as the section that will increase the \nallowable amount for small business expensing from $25,000 to $75,000. \nSmall business is truly the backbone of our economy, the engine that \nmakes it go, and we have to create an environment that encourages \nrather than discourages growth. As corporations struggle to meet income \nprojections and cost reductions, small businesses are the ones \nproviding jobs and putting food on the tables for our working families.\n  As many as 22.4 million small businesses could directly benefit from \nprovisions like the increase in small business expensing. Other \nemployers will benefit from provisions like the repeal of the Special \nOccupational Tax and the extension of the applicable period for a \ntaxpayer to replace livestock sold on account of drought, flood, or \nother weather-related conditions. These provisions mean thousands and \nthousands of employers will have more money to reinvest in their \ncompany, hire more people, and create more jobs. That means putting \nmore Americans back to work.\n  This package should be about jobs; and I support the tax relief \nprovisions, because I think they will create the jobs that will \nincrease the flow of revenues that will bring this economy out of its \ncurrent slump.\n  However, I want to make it clear that I am concerned about the high \nnumber of revenue provisions that are included in the bill. An economic \ngrowth package should not simply shift the tax burden from one person \nto another. That is not the way to create a more fair tax system. \nDespite my concerns, I will vote for this package because we need an \neconomic growth package now. I encourage my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this plan to put more Americans back to work and help our \nfamilies get back on their feet again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes off the remaining time \non the bill to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the manager of the bill, the ranking member of \nthe Finance Committee.\n  The Senator from South Carolina has just been talking about this \nscheme to give the President all that he wants on dividends, but to do \nit within the limits of the $350 billion tax bill that is before the \nSenate.\n  A prominent Republican economist commented on this scheme today, \ncalling it, ``The Dividend Fiasco.'' This scheme would exempt exempt \none-third of dividends this year, two-thirds the next year, and all of \nthem in the third year, and then sunset the whole proposal after that. \nAgain, this is an economist whom Republicans have called before the \nCongress repeatedly to testify on their behalf. Here is what he says \nabout that scheme:\n\n       Think, for a moment, of the likely wacky effects of such a \n     plan. If a firm pays you a dividend next year as opposed to \n     this year, then you will save 33 percent on your taxes. With \n     rates falling so sharply, it would be positively \n     irresponsible for a firm to pay any dividends at all until \n     the rates are at their lowest. Then, in 2005, the rate is \n     zero for only one year. Thus, a firm will have an incentive \n     to pay dividends that it might have planned to pay in 2006 in \n     2005 as well. So under the administration's proposal, \n     dividends would go as close to zero as firms could manage for \n     a few years, spike to their highest level in history, then \n     drop sharply for some time.\n       Administration sources admit that dividends will likely \n     decline relative to today under this plan between now and \n     2005. How can that be a harmless event given that increases \n     in dividend payments are viewed to be so wonderful? Clearly, \n     this proposal is one of the most patently absurd tax policies \n     ever proposed.\n\n  That is from a prominent Republican economist. He has it exactly \nright. That is patently absurd.\n\n[[Page S6246]]\n\n  It is a hoax. It is an absolute hoax. The principle behind this bill \nis to limit the total tax cut to $350 billion. The reality of the \nproposal advocated by the Senator from South Carolina is that it would \nnever be sunsetted, and the cost would turn out to be even more than \nthe President's original proposal.\n  While I was gone, my colleague from Arizona on the Finance Committee, \nand for whom I have a great deal of respect, suggested that corporate \ntaxes are high compared to other nations. That is just not true. If you \nlook at the effective tax burden--not the nominal tax burden, the \neffective tax burden--what companies really pay, the United States is a \nrelatively low tax jurisdiction. Look at where the OECD places the \nUnited States in its international ranking of corporate income taxes as \na percentage of GDP. This is where the United States ranks. We are way \ndown the list, nowhere close to being high up on the list.\n  Another thing I have heard repeatedly is that this plan is a jobs \ngrowth package. Let's do the math. If this is a jobs package, it is one \nof the most poorly designed in economic history. They say it is going \nto produce a million jobs. Actually, the models that have been done say \nfrom 230,000 to 900,000 jobs. Let's say it is a million jobs. It costs \n$350 billion. Let's divide 1 million jobs into $350 billion. Do you \nknow what the cost of this program is per job? Three hundred fifty \nthousand dollars a job. Let's say that one more time. The cost of this \nprogram to create a job is $350,000. Now, that is patently absurd. What \na ridiculous way to create jobs. The cost is $350,000. What are the \njobs going to be--$50,000 jobs, if they were pretty good jobs. So it \nwould cost $7 for every $1 you would produce in jobs? That makes no \nsense.\n  My colleague said that consumer demand is not the problem in the \neconomy. That is absolutely the problem. Consumer demand in the last 2 \nmonths has been 1.4 percent and 1.7 percent. That has been the growth. \nThat is mighty tepid growth. That is right at the heart of what is \nwrong in this economy.\n  My colleague from South Carolina said Senator Dorgan's amendment on \nthe Social Security tax is an example of what is wrong here. No. It is \nan example of what is right here. The Senator from South Carolina said \nwe had a chance on the budget resolution to do something about the \nprevious increase in income subjected to Social Security tax. No, the \nbudget resolution doesn't decide those things. It has nothing to do \nwith that--nothing, zero.\n  This is the place where you can do something about repealing a \nprevious tax increase. The budget resolution doesn't change the tax \ncode. This is the bill that determines the specifics. Our colleagues \nwill have a chance tomorrow to indicate whether they are going to \nrepeal the previous tax increase that involved Social Security \nrecipients.\n  One other thing I heard my colleague from Arizona say was that the \ndividend proposal would be such a tremendous benefit to the elderly. \nThat's true, if you are wealthy. If you are an elderly person earning \nmore than $500,000 a year, this plan gives you an average benefit of \n$24,000. If you are an elderly person earning less than $50,000 a year, \nyour average benefit is just $90. If you are earning $50,000 or less, \nand you are elderly, you get $90. If you are earning over half a \nmillion dollars, this dividend tax cut gives you $24,000. I don't think \nthat is equitable. I don't think it is fair. I don't think it does much \nto stimulate the economy.\n  Let's remember the context within which we are making these \ndecisions. The budget deficits have skyrocketed. All of this money, \neverything being proposed here, is with borrowed money. This is not \nbeing offset by spending reductions. This is all borrowed money.\n  The Senator from South Carolina says that at times you need to do \nthat to give a boost to the economy. I agree with that entirely. That \nis absolutely the right economics. But do you know what? The deficit \nthis year on an operating basis is going to be between $500 and $600 \nbillion.\n  Should we do more? I believe we should. In fact, I think we should do \nmore than what is in this plan, because this plan doesn't do much. This \nplan doesn't do much in the first year or the second year. This plan is \nvery tepid in terms of what it does. In the first year, this plan gives \n$44 billion of stimulus in a $10.5 trillion economy.\n  Frankly, that is not going to do much of anything. That is exactly \nwhat we see when you analyze this proposal in terms of what it is going \nto do to grow the gross domestic product. Senator Daschle's plan is the \nonly plan that has much stimulus--$125 billion this year. Only $44 \nbillion is in the plan before us.\n  Here is an analysis of what the various plans would do in terms of \nstimulus. The President's plan, which is even more costly than the one \nbefore us, would increase GDP by less than half of 1 percent. The \nDemocratic plan is significantly more, seven-tenths of 1 percent. In \nthe second year, the Republican plan is half of 1 percent, and the \nDemocratic plan nine-tenths of 1 percent.\n  But what is most interesting is that the Republican plan, over the 10 \nyears, is actually negative. It actually hurts economic growth. How can \nthat be? Very simply, because it is going to explode deficits and debt.\n  Here is what happens under the Republican plan: The debt of $6 \ntrillion in 2002 will go to $9 trillion by 2008, and to $12 trillion by \nthe end of this budget period. It explodes the deficits and debt.\n  The Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Mr. Greenspan, has told us:\n\n       With a large deficit, you will be significantly \n     undercutting the benefits that would be achieved from the tax \n     cuts.\n\n  He also said:\n\n       New academic evidence had strengthened his opinion that \n     budget deficits led directly to higher interest rates, and \n     that those higher interest rates choke off economic growth.\n\n  It is not just Chairman Greenspan. Here are 10 Nobel laureates in \neconomics.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator has \nused 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will conclude by saying the tax cut plan proposed by \nPresident Bush is not the answer to these problems of weak economic \ngrowth.\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds to call up my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 611\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 611.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To make the child tax credit acceleration applicable to 2002)\n\n       Strike page 14, line 8 through page 15, line 11, and insert \n     the following:\n       ``(d) No Interest.--No interest shall be allowed on any \n     overpayment attributable to this section.''.\n       (2) Clerical amendment.--The table of sections for \n     subchapter B of chapter 65 is amended by adding at the end \n     the following new item:\n\n``Sec. 6429.

The amendment increases the child tax credit from $600 to\n\n[[Page S6247]]\n\n$1,000 and makes it retroactive to the beginning of 2002 instead of \n2003, as called for in the bill. To offset the cost, the amendment \nwould delay the rate reduction for the 1 percent of taxpayers in the \ntop income tax bracket from this year to 2005. I hope my colleagues \nwill give it close consideration.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be temporarily laid aside so I might call up amendment No. \n612.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 612\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus], for Mr. McCain, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 612.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is the Military Fairness Act. I am \noffering it, and it is being cosponsored by Senator McCain.\n  Very simply, this is the amendment that is Ping-Ponging back and \nforth between the House and Senate. We did pass, at one point, \nprovisions that allow National Guard, Reservists, and other military \npersonnel to have a level playing field and not be unfairly taxed, \nparticularly while serving in our Armed Forces. One is the death \nbenefits gratuity and another is the travel expenses. There are similar \nprovisions like that.\n  It is only fair, particularly as we are winding down the war in \nIraq--and the hostilities there are not over--about 80 percent of the \nbenefits of this amendment are to our Reservists and National Guard who \nwill always be serving our country. This amendment makes very good \nsense. It is paid for by slightly reducing the rate reduction at the \ntop rate. It is a very modest change. I think it is only fair and \nproper.\n  Again, the major cosponsor of this amendment is the Senator from \nArizona, Senator McCain. I urge adoption of the amendment at the \nappropriate time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to sponsor with my colleague \nSenator Baucus this important amendment to S. 1054, the Jobs and Growth \nTax Act of 2003. This amendment would simply add the Armed Forces Tax \nFairness Act of 2003, as previously passed by this body, to the growth \nbill. This amendment is much needed tax relief for our men and women in \nuniform whose sacrifice and commitment are the foundation upon which \nthe freedom we all enjoy is built. There are a number of provisions to \nthis amendment that many of us have worked on for several years.\n  One of the provisions I would particularly like to highlight today is \nsection 601. The Military Home Owners equity Act has passed this body \npreviously on a 97-to-0 vote. This legislation would allow service \nmembers, who are away on extended active duty, to qualify for the same \ntax relief on the profit generated when they sell their main residence \nas other Americans. I am pleased to announce that Secretary of State \nColin Powell fully supports this legislation and this legislation \nenjoys overwhelming support by the senior uniformed leadership--the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff--as well as the Office of Management and Budget \nDirector Mitch Daniels, the 31-member associations of the Military \nCoalition, the American Foreign Service Association, and the American \nBar Association.\n  The average American participates in our Nation's growth through home \nownership. Appreciation in the value of a home allows everyday \nAmericans to participate in our country's prosperity. Fortunately, the \nTaxpayer Relief Act of 1997 recognized this and provided this break to \nlessen the amount of tax most Americans will pay on the profit they \nmake when they sell their homes. Unfortunately, the 1997 home sale \nprovision unintentionally discourages home ownership among service \nmembers and Foreign Service Officers.\n  This provision will not create a new tax benefit, it merely modifies \ncurrent law to include the time service members are away from home on \nactive duty when calculating the number of years the homeowners have \nlived in their primary residence. In short, this provision is narrowly \ntailored to remedy a specific dilemma.\n  The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 delivered sweeping tax relief to \nmillions of Americans through a wide variety of important tax changes \nthat affect individuals, families, investors, and businesses. It was \nalso one of the most complex tax laws enacted in recent history, and \nunfortunately our service men and women were left out of this critical \ntax relief act.\n  The 1997 act gives taxpayers who sell their principal residence a \nmuch needed tax break. Prior to the 1997 act, taxpayers received a one-\ntime exclusion on the profit they made when they sold their principal \nresidence, but the taxpayers had to be at least 55 years old and live \nin their residence for 2 of the 5 years preceding the sale. This \nprovision primarily benefitted elderly taxpayers, while not providing \nany relief to younger taxpayers and their families.\n  Fortunately, the 1997 act addressed this issue. Under this law, \ntaxpayers who sell their principal residence on or after May 7, 1997, \nare not taxed on the first $250,000 of profit from the sale, joint \nfilers are not taxed on the first $500,000 of profit they make from \nselling their principal residence. The taxpayer must meet two \nrequirements to qualify for this tax relief. The taxpayer must (1) own \nthe home for at least 2 of the 5 years preceding the sale, and (2) live \nin the home as their main home for at least 2 years of the last 5 \nyears.\n  I applaud the bipartisan cooperation that resulted in this much \nneeded form of tax relief. The home sales provision sounds great, and \nit is. Unfortunately, the second part of this eligibility test \nunintentionally and unfairly prohibits many of the women and men who \nserve this country overseas from qualifying for this beneficial tax \nrelief.\n  Constant travel across the United States and abroad is inherent in \nthe military and Foreign Service. Nonetheless, some service members and \nForeign Service officers choose to purchase a home in a certain locale, \neven though they will not live there much of the time. Under the new \nlaw, if they do not have a spouse who resides in the home during their \nabsence, they will not qualify for the full benefit of the new home \nsales provision because no one ``lives'' in the home for the required \nperiod of time. The law is prejudiced against families who serve our \nNation abroad. They would not qualify for the home sales exclusion \nbecause neither spouse ``lives'' in the house for enough time to \nqualify for the exclusion.\n  This amendment simply remedies an inequality in the 1997 law. The \nbill amends the Internal Revenue Code so that service members and \nForeign Service officers will be considered to be using their house as \ntheir main residence for any period that they are assigned overseas in \nthe execution of their duties. In short, they will be deemed to be \nusing their house as their main home, even if they are stationed in \nBosnia, the Persian Gulf, in the `no man's land,'' commonly called the \nDMZ between North and South Korea, or anywhere else they are assigned.\n  In the wake of September 11 and operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nour Armed Forces are now deployed to an unprecedented number of \nlocations, in very significant numbers. They are away from their \nprimary homes, protecting and furthering the freedoms we Americans hold \nso dear. We cannot afford to discourage military service by penalizing \nmilitary personnel with higher taxes merely because they are doing \ntheir job. Military service entails sacrifice, such as long periods of \ntime away from friends and family and the constant threat of \nmobilization into hostile territory. We must not use the Tax Code to \nheap additional burdens upon our women and men in uniform.\n  In my view, the way to decrease the likelihood of further \ninequalities in the Tax Code, intentional or otherwise, is to adopt a \nfairer, flatter tax system that is far less complicated than our \ncurrent system. But, in the meantime, we must ensure that the Tax Code \nis as fair and equitable as possible.\n  The Taxpayer's Relief Act of 1997 was designed to provide sweeping \ntax relief to all Americans, including those who\n\n[[Page S6248]]\n\nserve this country abroad. Yes, it is true that there are winners and \nlosers in any tax code, but this inequity was unintended. Enacting this \nnarrowly tailored remedy to grant equal tax relief to the members of \nour Uniformed and Foreign Services restores fairness and consistency to \nour increasingly complex Tax Code.\n  I would like to thank Senator Baucus and the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Grassley, for their superb effort on behalf of our \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and Foreign Service officers. As I \nstated earlier, the provisions in this amendment are issues we have \nneeded to fix for a long time. Let's get it passed this year and \nfinally enacted into law.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. I rise today to tell you about an \nurgent issue in my State that could benefit from the same relief this \nbill provides for Arkansas schools. The relief is known as ``advance \nrefunding.''\n  Just like homeowners, municipally owned utilities are able to \nrefinance or ``refund'' their bonds. But the Tax Code permits them to \ndo this only once. Imagine if you had refinanced your home at 7.5 \npercent a few years ago. Having taken that one opportunity, now that \nrates are at 5.15 percent, you would not be permitted to do another \nrefinancing. You would miss out on this opportunity to refinance.\n  There is a utility in my State that finds itself just in this \nposition and all of the utility's consumers suffer the consequences. \nWithout an additional advance refunding, it customers face significant \nrate increases as the utility struggles to remain competitive in the \nrestructured marketplace while paying off debt it incurred to bring \nelectricity to many customers in my State. I want my constituents to \nenjoy stable rates just as I know yours do, Mr. Chairman. I ask if you \nwould work with me in this conference to provide additional advance \nrefunding relief to meet this urgent need in my State.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree that an additional advance refunding \nopportunity would be helpful and practical in your situation and in \nothers. I will work with you in conference to see if there is an \nopportunity to accommodate you.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, tomorrow, an amendment will be offered--I \nam not sure by whom; it may be Senator Nickles from Oklahoma--which \naccelerates the dividend exclusion provisions considerably beyond the \nprovisions that are in the Finance Committee bill. Our understanding is \nit is a 50 percent exclusion in the first year, 2003, and 100 percent \nup through 2006, and after that the provision will be sunsetted.\n  I will make a couple of comments because we will not have time to \ncomment on it tomorrow at any length. One is that this is a significant \nincrease from the committee bill, which costs $80 billion. My \nunderstanding is that this amendment will cost in the neighborhood of \n$124 billion. How is the $40 billion difference going to be paid for?\n  Clearly, there is going to have to be cutting back on other tax \ncuts--whether it is the marriage penalty or whatever--to bring that to \nthe attention of Members who may believe it is better to have a child \ntax credit or a marriage penalty and whatnot.\n  And I have not seen the amendment, so I am not exactly sure of the \nprovisions, but from all indications, it will eliminate the provisions \nin the President's dividend exclusion, which will require that before a \ndividend can be paid, a company would have to pay income taxes in the \nprior year. If that provision is eliminated, that is going to mean that \nwe are not only ending double taxation of dividends, in many cases we \nwill be ending single taxation of dividends, which, in a sense, will \nmean dividends will be tax-free. All American wages will be taxed, \ninterest income will be taxed, and other ordinary income is going to be \ntaxed. But if a company did not pay taxes in the prior year, then the \ncompany will be basically giving dividends to shareholders, and there \nwill be no tax on them, not at the individual level or the corporate \nlevel. That, I think, is a gross miscarriage of justice.\n  For that additional reason, I hope the Senate does not adopt that \nprovision when we vote on it tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/14/senate-section/article/S6248-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Bush be printed in the Record. \nThe letter was sent to me, as President pro tempore of the Senate, in \ncompliance with the war powers resolution, Public Law 93-148.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 2003.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     President pro tempore of the Senate Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President In my report to the Congress of November \n     15, 2002, I provided information regarding the continued \n     deployment of combat-equipped U.S. military personnel as the \n     U.S. contribution to the NATO-led international security \n     force in Kosovo (KFOR) and to other countries in the region \n     in support of that force. I am providing this supplemental \n     report prepared by my Administration, consistent with the War \n     Powers Resolution (Public Law 93-148), to help ensure that \n     the Congress is kept fully informed on continued U.S. \n     contributions in support of peacekeeping efforts in Kosovo.\n       As noted in previous reports, the U.N. Security Council \n     authorized member states to establish KFOR in U.N. Security \n     Council Resolution 1244 of June 10, 1999. The mission of KFOR \n     is to provide an international security presence in order to \n     deter renewed hostilities; verify and, if necessary, enforce \n     the terms of the Military Technical Agreement between NATO \n     and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia; enforce the terms of \n     the Undertaking on Demilitarization and Transformation of the \n     former Kosovo Liberation Army; provide day-to-day operational \n     direction to the Kosovo Protection Corps; and maintain a safe \n     and secure environment to facilitate the work of the U.N. \n     Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK).\n       Currently, the U.S. contribution to KFOR in Kosovo is about \n     2,250 U.S. military personnel, or approximately 9 percent of \n     KFOR's total strength. Additionally, U.S. military personnel \n     occasionally operate from Macedonia, Albania, and Greece in \n     support of KFOR operations. Nineteen non-NATO contributing \n     countries also participate with NATO forces in providing \n     military personnel and other support personnel to KFOR.\n       The U.S. forces are assigned to a sector principally \n     centered around Gnjilane in the eastern region of Kosovo. For \n     U.S. KFOR forces, as for KFOR generally, maintaining a safe \n     and secure environment remains the primary military task. The \n     KFOR forces operate under NATO command and control and rules \n     of engagement. The KFOR coordinates with and supports UNMIK \n     at most levels, provides a security presence in towns, \n     villages, and the country-side, and organizes checkpoints and \n     patrols in key areas to provide security, protect minorities, \n     resolve disputes, and help instill in the community a feeling \n     of confidence.\n       The UNMIK continues to transfer non-reserved competencies \n     under the Constitutional Framework document to the Kosovar \n     Provisional Institutions of Self-government (PISG). The PISG \n     includes the President, Prime Minister, and Kosovo Assembly, \n     and has been in place since March 2002. Municipal elections \n     were successfully held for a second time in October 2002.\n       NATO continues formally to review KFOR's mission at 6-month \n     intervals. These reviews provide a basis for assessing \n     current force levels, future requirements, force structure, \n     force reductions, and the eventual withdrawal of KFOR. NATO \n     has adopted the Joint Operations Area plan to regionalize and \n     rationalize its force structure in the Balkans. The KFOR has \n     transferred full responsibility for public safety and \n     policing to the UNMIK international and local police forces \n     throughout Kosovo except in the area of Mitrovica, where the \n     responsibility is shared due to security concerns. The UNMIK \n     international police and local police forces have also begun \n     to assume responsibility for guarding patrimonial sites and \n     established border-crossing checkpoints.\n       The continued deployment of U.S. forces has been undertaken \n     pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct U.S. \n     foreign relations and as Commander in Chief Executive. I \n     appreciate the continued support of the Congress in these \n     actions.\n           Sincerely,\n     George W. Bush.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/14/senate-section/article/S6248-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6248-S6249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEVELOPING ALASKA OIL\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Murkowski, recently \nwrote an article entitled ``Developing Alaska Oil Is Good for the \nGlobal Environment,'' which was published on May 4, 2003 in the \nAnchorage Daily News.\n\n[[Page S6249]]\n\n  Senator Murkowski made extremely astute observations and concisely \ndetailed the hard truths of the United States' current energy \ncondition.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record Senator \nMurkowski's article.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Anchorage Daily News, May 4, 2003]\n\n          Developing Alaska Oil Is Good for Global Environment\n\n                          (By Lisa Murkowski)\n\n       As Congress continues to debate whether to permit some \n     limited oil development on Alaska's Arctic coastal plain, we \n     must ask whether America is doing everything it can to \n     protect its energy security in the future.\n       As a new Senator from Alaska, I may shock some by \n     acknowledging some hard truths. First, this nation needs to \n     do a far better job of energy conservation and needs to \n     develop innovative energy technologies to meet our growing \n     need for clean and efficient fuels.\n       For example, overcoming the technical hurdles of hydrogen-\n     powered vehicles could be very beneficial in meeting our \n     future energy needs. Second, opening a tiny part of the \n     Arctic National Wildlife Refuge by itself will not solve all \n     our energy woes, as it will take time to develop the area's \n     potential. But ignoring the area's huge energy potential \n     equates to hoping that foreign sources will supply our winter \n     heating oil and summer gasoline needs at reasonable prices \n     into the distant future. That's like students avoiding \n     studying for finals in hopes that a snowstorm will force \n     schools to close in May.\n       It also ignores the limitations of the refining process for \n     crude oil and the growth in demand for aviation fuel, diesel, \n     plastics and other items made from oil. The truth, according \n     to the U.S. Energy Information Agency, is that there's a 50-\n     50 chance the Arctic coastal plain holds about 10 billion \n     barrels of economically recoverable oil--enough to produce \n     about 1 million barrels a day for 30 years.\n       Rather than some inconsequential amount, such a find would \n     be the largest oil field discovered in the world in the last \n     three decades and would equal nearly one-fifth of America's \n     domestic production by 2010.\n       Equally important, at current prices, it represents $15 \n     billion a year that we won't have to spend on buying oil \n     overseas, in some cases enriching dictators who wish us ill. \n     Producing more energy at home would strengthen our economy by \n     producing jobs and tax revenues here. It would foster our \n     national security in the midterm by lessening the potential \n     for America to be subject to blackmail from foreign oil \n     boycotts.\n       And allowing more oil development in Alaska would honor the \n     promises Congress thrice made to my state, first at our \n     statehood, later in 1960 when President Eisenhower created \n     the Arctic National Wildlife Range and most recently in 1980 \n     when 131 million acres of Alaska was withdrawn as parks and \n     refuges. Each decision specifically permitted oil development \n     to take place on the coastal plain, unless such development \n     would harm Alaska's environment. And the truth is that \n     tapping into a tiny percentage of ANWR's vast acreage won't.\n       According to the recent environmental impact statement for \n     reauthorization of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline, less than 1 \n     percent of the vegetation of the Arctic coastal plain likely \n     will be impacted by future oil development. Safeguards in \n     congressional legislation will guarantee that no more than \n     2,000 acres of the 40 million acres of coastal plain will be \n     touched.\n       Directional drilling underground allows oil wells to be \n     placed up to seven miles apart, preventing disturbance to the \n     animals that breed and graze in between. New procedures on \n     seismic work prevent ocean noise when bowhead whales are \n     passing.\n       Some worry about the impacts on calving caribou. But \n     Alaska's experience at the nearby Prudhoe Bay oil field, \n     where the caribou herd has grown sixfold, shows that caribou \n     can not only tolerate but flourish in oil fields. That is \n     especially the case since restrictions will prevent any \n     drilling noise during the two months when the caribou might \n     be present.\n       Developing oil domestically actually is good for the global \n     environment since it reduces the importation of oil on \n     foreign-flagged, single-hulled tankers, requiring the oil \n     industry to meet America's stringent environmental \n     safeguards.\n       Alaska's beauty certainly is not threatened as 192 million \n     acres of Alaska remain protected--nearly the size of all East \n     Coast states combined. The truth is that America needs to \n     both conserve and produce more energy.\n       If we can, as some have argued, reduce our foreign reliance \n     on oil by 1 million barrels per day by increased \n     conservation, and also increase production from ANWR by \n     adding a million barrels, the 2 million barrels resulting \n     from this two-pronged approach would substantially improve \n     U.S. energy policy.\n       The government predicts that U.S. oil production will \n     continue its steady decline unless we act now. By 2015 \n     America will be producing just 30 percent of the oil we \n     consume daily. We've wasted a quarter century on this debate.\n       Let's help ourselves by developing our own oil reserves \n     now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/14/senate-section/article/S6249-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               LEADING THE FIGHT AGAINST GLOBAL HIV/AIDS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the size of HIV is about 100 nanometers. \nThat is tiny, microscopic, and invisible to the naked eye. A nanometer \nis one-billionth of a meter. If you divide 3 feet, into 1 billion \nparts, and take 100 of those parts, that is the size of HIV. That is \n2,000 times smaller than a human hair.\n  Yet that little virus casts a long shadow of death. Reaching across \noceans sweeping across continents, burrowing deep into even the most \nremote villages on Earth, AIDS--the disease that virus causes--has \nkilled 23 million people since it was discovered in 1981. Forty two \nmillion people are living with the HIV virus right now. And another 60 \nmillion people could die by 2020.\n  Those are daunting statistics. They paint a dark landscape. But they \ndo not reveal the individual rays of light that have been dimmed by \nHIV/AIDS. The loving mother who left her child to fend on the streets. \nThe caring husband who left his wife to support their family. The \ninnocent newborn who left the womb facing not a bright future, but an \nearly death.\n  Nowhere is there a greater threat to life today than in the AIDS-\nravaged parts of the world: Africa, the Caribbean, and soon China, \nIndia, and Russia. Millions of lives have already been lost. Millions \nof more lives will be lost unless we act. But if we do act, if we \nsummon the moral courage to shine light into the long shadow of this \nlittle virus, we will change the course of history.\n  HIV/AIDS has a tremendous impact on a society and an economy. In \nZimbabwe, AIDS will wipe out 20 percent of its workforce by 2005. Kenya \nhas reported in recent years as many as 75 percent of the deaths in law \nenforcement are AIDS-related. In countries with HIV prevalence rates of \n20 percent or higher, economic growth, GDP, drops by an average of 2.6 \npercentage points per year. Economies are shrinking solely because of \nthis little virus. That, my friends, causes hopelessness to prevail.\n  But we are still losing the battle against the virus. The problem is \ngetting worse, not better. The virus is spreading like wildfire. By \n2010, China will have 10 to 15 million cases of HIV/AIDS, and India is \nlikely to have 20 to 25 million cases--the highest estimate for any \ncountry. Every 10 seconds brings 1 AIDS-related death and 2 new HIV \ninfections. For every 1 person who has died over the last 20 years, 2 \nmore will die in the next 20 years.\n  We have a moral duty to lead the world in this fight, . . . to devote \nmore resources and manage those resources so they get where they need \ngo and help the people who need help.\n  At the end of the week the Senate will take up H.R. 1298 authorizing \nthe President's emergency plan to fight AIDS. The House passed this \nbill with overwhelming support, 375 to 41. All but one of the House \nDemocrats voted for the bipartisan compromise. This bill is not \nperfect. But we must not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. The \nPresident will sign this bill as it currently stands.\n  We will defeat HIV/AIDS. As a Senator, as a doctor, as a medical \nmissionary, I have committed to this cause. The President has committed \nto this cause both in word and deed.\n  History will judge whether a world led by America stood by and let \ntranspire one of the greatest destructions of human life in recorded \nhistory--or performed one of its most heroic rescues. President Bush \nhas opened the door to that latter possibility. We must pass this \nlegislation now and get this program established without further delay.\n  The President's Global AIDS Initiative is a rare opportunity to enact \nlegislation that will save hundreds of thousands--millions--of lives. \nThis is our moment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/14/senate-section/article/S6249-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6249-S6250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that\n\n[[Page S6250]]\n\nwould add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal \nthat violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred on September \n28, 2001. A 47-year-old Mexican immigrant was beaten in his home by two \nmen who believed him to be of Arab descent. After following the man \nhome, the pair chased him to his front door, broke in after him, and \nphysically assaulted him in front of his wife and child. According to \nthe pair, the assault was revenge for the September 11, 2001 bombing \ntragedy.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/14/senate-section/article/S6250-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NATO PROTOCOLS OF ACCESSION\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I would like to speak about the \nhistoric vote last week in this Chamber to recommend the ratification \nof the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Protocols of Accession. I \nadd my belated support to the protocols which serve to broaden the \nworld's greatest alliance and, in the process, strengthen it to \nconfront the new dangers of this new century.\n  It is said that the poppies in the fields of Europe are red with the \nblood of millions of Europeans and Americans who gave their lives so \nthat millions more could live in peace. Such is the legacy of the 20th \ncentury. And from that same period, that same struggle, emerged the \nmost successful strategic alliance the world has ever known--the North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization.\n  For nearly half a century, that alliance manned the ramparts of a \nEurope that was divided and was still, truly, at war with itself. The \nfact that the war was a cold one, was itself cold comfort to the \ncountless thousands trapped behind what came to be known as the `iron \ncurtain.'\n  When framed against the circumstances of NATO's birth and the fact \nthat for so long the alliance's purpose was to keep the peace in a \ndivided continent, the event that we gathered for last week was truly \nawesome indeed. Last week, we welcomed many of the nations of Europe \nonce held captive by Communism into the partnership of the North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization.\n  The vote gave us the opportunity to affirm the place that NATO holds \nin the constellation of American security. Our fate is bound up with \nEurope's--to deny this is to overlook the lessons of history and the \nsignposts of the future. Within Europe we find many of our closest and \nour oldest allies. For over 50 years, we have drawn strength from NATO, \nand for over 50 years we have, through NATO, worked hard for the \nsecurity of our partners. We cannot, will not, must not stop now.\n  Let us not forget, in times of crisis NATO has worked for American \nsecurity as well. In the wake of September 11, 2001, the alliance \ninvoked Article V of its charter for the first time in its history, \ncalling the attack on one member an attack on all. European aircraft \nhelped secure the skies over the eastern seaboard of the United States. \nOur NATO partners and our partnerships with them continue to be crucial \nto our Nation's security: the challenges we face as a nation are \nformidable--terrorism, tyrants, and the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction among them--and we cannot, we must not, face them \nalone.\n  But the world has changed, and so, too, must the alliance. The issues \nraised by Senators Levin and Warner address some critical questions. As \nthe number of alliance members increases, the ability of the council to \nact quickly may become harder and harder to realize. That is especially \ntrue because every NATO action requires unanimous consent. In addition, \nwe must acknowledge the possibility that with 26 alliance members, the \nchances that one of them may someday cease to uphold the basic values \nthat the treaty organization is based on also becomes--mathematically \nspeaking, at least--more likely. The amendments request that the North \nAtlantic Council study how to deal with both eventualities, and I \nbelieve these requests to study are both appropriate and timely.\n  However, while I support these amendments, I am mindful of NATO \nSecretary General Lord Robertson's recent warnings that developing \nprocedures to suspend members or changing the decisionmaking apparatus \nof the alliance would be ill-advised at this juncture. Lord Robertson \nhas navigated the Alliance through some perilous waters during his \ntenure at the helm of NATO, and I see no reason to distrust his counsel \nnow.\n  The expansion of NATO makes clear that, despite the claims of \nalarmists, this great alliance is not stumbling into irrelevance. We \nhave had differences with some of our partners, and we will continue \nto. But with our commitment, the alliance can once again prove its \nresilience. It can once again demonstrate that common values between \nnations are the strongest bonds of all. We must not forget that enemies \nof America are also enemies of NATO, and they see the democratic \ndiversity of our nations as a weakness. They think they can divide us. \nThey are wrong. In our diversity, we find a wellspring of great \nstrength. Standing in the Chamber today speaking for Senate approval of \nthese protocols, I am reminded of the words of the Great Seal of the \nUnited States: e pluribus unum: ``from many, one.'' I welcome our new \nEuropean allies into the alliance structure; they will add their \nstrength to ours, and their addition will make us all more secure.\n  There are those in this country and in Europe who question the value \nof strong trans-Atlantic ties; they cite recent disagreements between \nsome European nations and our own government as a rationale for the \nUnited States to stride alone into whatever fate holds in store for us \nall. By way of rejoinder, I offer President John F. Kennedy's words in \n1962, when he urged his fellow Americans to ``think \nintercontinentally.'' President Kennedy continued, ``acting on our own, \nby ourselves, we cannot establish justice throughout the world; we \ncannot insure its domestic tranquility, nor provide for its common \ndefense, or promote its general welfare, or secure the blessing of \nliberty to ourselves and our posterity. But joined with other free \nnations, we can do all this and more. We can assist the developing \nnations to throw off the yoke of poverty. . . We can mount a deterrent \npowerful enough to deter any aggression. And ultimately we can help to \nachieve a world of law and free choice, banishing the world of war and \ncoercion.'' President Kennedy called for a trans-Atlantic partnership \nbased on common values and concerns, one that looked outward as well as \ninward, one that would ``serve as a nucleus for the eventual union of \nall free men--those who are now free and those who are vowing that some \nday they will be free.''\n  The truth in President Kennedy's words in 1963 has not diminished in \n40 years. Although we may disagree with our partners and brothers in \npeace, our paths have not diverged, and our concerns are tied together \nstill. I applaud my colleagues for their overwhelming vote for the \nratification of the Protocols of Ascension that which, once ratified by \nall 19 NATO members, will allow these 7 nations, Bulgaria, Estonia, \nLatvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia, to become parties \nto the North Atlantic Treaty, and full members of the treaty \norganization.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/14/senate-section/article/S6250-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6250-S6251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              CUBA TRAVEL\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to speak to the issue of the \nFreedom to Travel to Cuba Act of 2003, S. 950, introduced by the junior \nSenator from Wyoming. I am cosponsoring this bill because I do not \nthink the United States Government should tell its citizens where they \ncan and cannot travel I also think greater people-to-people contacts \nwith societies living under dictatorial regimes can help encourage the \nspread of democratic ideas. It is for these reasons that I support S. \n950.\n  Lifting our ban on travel to Cuba is not a gift to Fidel Castro, and \nit should not be interpreted as an endorsement of his regime or as a \nsign of diminished commitment to improving human rights conditions for \nthe Cuban people. The recent harsh prison sentences meted out to dozens \nof peaceful political dissenters in Cuba, and the execution of three \nmen involved in a ferry\n\n[[Page S6251]]\n\nhijacking, provide further evidence of the fundamentally repressive and \nundemocratic nature of the Castro regime. Cuba has been stubbornly \nimpervious to the democratizing trend sweeping the hemisphere in recent \nyears. This, however, merely demonstrates the failure of our 40-year \npolicy isolation.\n  Lifting travel restrictions on our citizens is not likely to bring \nabout a transformation in Cuba overnight. But we have already seen what \nperpetuating the ban has accomplished--nothing. We have been depriving \nour own citizen of their liberty without bringing the blessings of \nliberty any closer to the Cuban people. It is time to end this \nfruitless policy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/14/senate-section/article/S6251-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nIN HONOR OF THE RETIREMENT OF LIEUTENANT COLONEL ERIN M. McCARTER, USAF\n\n Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, the world has just witnessed \nthe overwhelming effectiveness of the Armed Forces of the United \nStates. Our military's rapid success in Iraq should serve as a source \nof pride for our Nation, for that success is based on the people in the \nArmed Forces, average Americans and immigrants doing extraordinary \nthings.\n  I come to the floor today to pay tribute to one of the people who has \nmade the American military the great success it is today. At the end of \nthis month, Lieutenant Colonel Erin McCarter will retire after over 20 \nyears in the Air Force.\n  Col. McCarter hails originally from Moline, IL, one of the Quad \nCities on the Mississippi River. She graduated from Moline High School \nand then attended the University of Iowa through the Air Force Reserve \nOfficers Training Corps.\n  Commissioned as a second lieutenant, she started her military career \nduring the cold war as the logistics officer accountable for nuclear \nmunitions at Ellsworth Air Force Base. At 21, then Lt. McCarter was \nresponsible for the nuclear munitions at a Strategic Air Command \nfacility. It is remarkable the responsibility the military places in \nthe hands of relatively young officers and enlisted personnel, and \nthese young men and women are routinely up to the demands placed on \nthem.\n  Col. McCarter continued her Air Force career largely in logistics and \nas a staff officer. She served as a wing supply and headquarters staff \nofficer at a number of major Air Force bases, including Ramstein in \nGermany and Shaw in South Carolina. She served as chief of the Pacific \nAir Force's weapon systems support at Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii. \nWhile there, she also served as chief protocol officer to the \ncommanding general, Pacific Air Forces.\n  She went on to command the 8th Supply Squadron at Kunsan Air Force \nBase in South Korea, before coming to the Pentagon. After holding staff \nofficer positions and serving as a liaison officer to Congress, Col. \nMcCarter became Country Director, Saudi Arabia Division, in the Office \nof the Deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force for International \nAffairs. In this capacity, she successfully managed the relationship \nwith one of our country's key strategic allies in the Middle East.\n  During her Air Force career, Col. McCarter received a master's degree \nin business administration and completed the executive program in \ninternational business management at Georgetown University. She \nreceived the Meritorious Service Medal with three oak leaf clusters, \nthe Air Force Commendation Medal with oak leaf cluster, and the Air \nForce Achievement Medal with oak leaf cluster.\n  After 20 years in service to our Nation, Colonel McCarter is \nretiring. Our Nation's loss is Illinois's gain, however, as she is \nreturning to the Prairie State, where most of her family continues to \nreside. I want to take a moment as well to thank her family. Without \ntheir continuous support, I am confident Col. McCarter would not have \nhad as successful a career in the Air Force as she enjoyed.\n  Upon Col. McCarter's retirement from active duty, I want to welcome \nher home to Illinois and thank her for her dedication, devotion to \nduty, and commitment to the Air Force and our Nation. We owe her and \nall her colleagues in the Armed Forces a great debt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/14/senate-section/article/S6251-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JERRY BERLIN\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I pay tribute to Jerry Berlin--a \nfriend, an American patriot, and a principled and passionate man. On \nApril 29, in a shocking tragedy, Jerry was shot and killed by his \nbusiness partner at the Signature Grand banquet hall, which they had \nworked so hard to build together.\n  It is always difficult to know what to say when people we care about \nare taken from us before their time. Even more difficult when the death \nis so sudden, so horrific, as this one was. But let me take a moment to \npay tribute to the great American life that Jerry lived.\n  Jerry was born in New York. His family, like many others, moved down \nto Miami when he was a boy. In high school at Miami Beach High, Jerry \nacted and danced in school productions. Those who knew him might have \nguessed it because he always had a spark in his eye and a spring in his \nstep.\n  Jerry's hard work quickly established him as a stellar lawyer, and \none of the best Democratic fundraisers in the country. He believed in \nwhat our party believes: that if you work hard and play by the rules, \nyou should be able to go as far in America as your talents will take \nyou. And he didn't just talk about those ideals. He lived by them.\n  In the mid-1980s, Jerry's boundless energy led him to team with his \nbusiness partner to create Signature Gardens, a banquet hall that \ncatered literally and figuratively to the middle class. It was a place \nfor weddings, proms, sweet sixteens, Bar and Bat Mitzvahs. You name it. \nIt was a place where the community came together. And it was a \nwonderful success.\n  All who knew Jerry are still in disbelief that his life could be \ntaken, and in such a horrible way.\n  In recent years, I am told, Jerry was becoming more religious. He was \nexploring his faith. He even went to study in Jerusalem. I have no \ndoubt he is with God, in peace, now. We mourn for him and pray for his \nchildren, Ashley, Bret and Sharon, his ex-wife Gwen, and his fiancee, \nMarna Ross.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/14/senate-section/article/S6251-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6251-S6252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RETIREMENT OF WISCONSIN STATE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE WILLIAM BABLITCH\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the career of a \ndistinguished public servant, Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice William \nBablitch. Justice Bablitch has been a voice of fairness and reason on \nthe Wisconsin Supreme Court for nearly two decades. Upon his retirement \nin July of this year, Wisconsin will lose a fine jurist, but the State \nand the institution will be stronger for his contributions and his \nservice.\n  Justice Bablitch has deep roots in Wisconsin. He was born and raised \nin Stevens Point and graduated from Pacelli High School. He cleaned \ngolf clubs while working his way through college, studying first at \nUniversity of Wisconsin--Stevens Point and ultimately earning his \nbachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin--Madison. He spent 2 \nyears in Liberia, West Africa in the Peace Corps, serving as an \nelementary school teacher. Upon his return he entered law school, and \nin 1968, he received his J.D. from the University of Wisconsin--\nMadison. His close friends say his first love has always been the law.\n  Justice Bablitch has spent his entire career in public service--first \nas the District Attorney in Portage County, later elected to the State \nSenate, and finally as a justice on the State Supreme Court. In Portage \nCounty, Justice Bablitch coordinated one of the first sensitive crimes \nunits in the state and worked cooperatively with the Portage County \nSheriff to help the University of Wisconsin--Stevens Point through the \ncampus demonstrations that grew out of the Kent State protests and \nshootings.\n  First elected in 1972, Justice Bablitch served as a State Senator for \n11 years representing Adams, Waushara, Portage and Wood Counties. For 7 \nof his 11 years in the State Senate, he had the\n\n[[Page S6252]]\n\ndistinction of serving as Majority Leader. His legislative \naccomplishments are many and varied. He wrote the first campaign reform \nlaw restricting campaign spending and establishing public financing. He \ndrafted watershed sexual assault legislation that prohibited the cross \nexamination of a victim's past consensual sexual conduct--legislation \nwhich quickly became a national model. And he authored legislation \nwhich barred utilities from suspending or terminating service in the \nmiddle of winter.\n  Justice Bablitch was elected to the Supreme Court in 1983 and was \nreelected in 1993. One of his most notable opinions came in a dissent \nwhere he upheld Wisconsin's hate crimes law. His dissent, however, \nbecame the majority position of the United States Supreme Court when \nthat body upheld Wisconsin's law. He wrote opinions strengthening \nWisconsin's ``lemon law.'' He also authored important opinions in civil \nrights and environmental cases. Justice Bablitch's tenure will be \nremembered for his ability to resolve complex issues of great \nimportance to every resident of Wisconsin.\n  On July 31 of this year, Justice Bablitch will step down from his \nposition on the Court. With his long career in public service and his \ndemonstrated devotion to the law, it is nearly certain that Justice \nBablitch will not be closing the book on his career--only ending \nanother distinguished chapter. Yet on this occasion, we would be remiss \nif we did not thank him for his outstanding contributions, for his \ndedication and for his even-handedness on the bench.\n  Let me close by quoting Justice Bablitch himself: ``Law is the glue \nthat holds our society together. Without law we have chaos.'' Wisconsin \nowes him a debt of gratitude for devoting his career to being the \nglue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/14/senate-section/article/S6252-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO COLONEL DON WILLIAMS\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise to honor my friend Don \nWilliams on his last day presiding as Executive Director of the Fort \nKnox CORE Committee meeting in Kentucky. Since the inception of the \nCORE Committee in 1992, Don spent 4 years as Chairman and the past 7 \nyears as Executive Director of the committee up until his retirement at \nthe end of this month. Fortunately, Don will continue to serve as a \nmember of the CORE Committee and add his valuable insights and \nexpertise on Army issues pertaining to Fort Knox.\n  Don has advocated on the behalf of Fort Knox on the local, State, and \nFederal levels for many years. After 28 years of service in Army \ninfantry and armor units and high-level staff assignments, Colonel \nWilliams retired from the Army in 1990 as Chief of Staff at Fort Knox. \nDuring his last role in active duty as Chief of Staff, Don became very \nactive in the local communities surrounding Fort Knox. As a private \ncitizen, Don has continued to promote the future vitality and \nimportance of Fort Knox and the economic development of the base's \nsurrounding communities.\n  Don has accomplished many great achievements over his life. He \nreceived his BA and later his MA in political science from the \nUniversity of Massachusetts. He has taught at the U.S. Air Force \nAcademy and he spent 5 years at the Pentagon on the Army staff and \nlater as Secretary to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. After his retirement \nfrom the Army, Don served as senior vice president of Bank One, Central \nKentucky; vice chairman of the Kentucky Commission on Military Affairs; \nand important roles with the Association of the United States Army and \nthe Louisville Chamber of Commerce. Don has worn just about every \nimportant military/civilian relations hat in Kentucky and he has worn \nthem all with the dedication and dignity of a solider and a gentleman.\n  I ask my colleagues to honor Colonel Williams' service to the U.S. \nArmy, the Commonwealth of Kentucky and our great Nation. While Don may \nbe relinquishing his duties as Executive Director of the CORE \nCommittee, I look forward to continuing to work with him on important \nprojects to both Fort Knox and its surrounding communities. Don is a \ngreat Kentuckian and a good friend. I thank the Senate for allowing me \nto laud his praises.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/14/senate-section/article/S6252-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              IN RECOGNITION OF OFFICER KEITH P. THOMPSON\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to \ncongratulate Officer Keith P. Thompson of the Omaha Police Department \non his selection as Officer of the Month for March 2003 by the National \nLaw Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund.\n  After receiving his initial training in law enforcement as military \npolice officer in the U.S. Army, Officer Thompson joined the Omaha \nPolice Department where he served the people of Omaha honorably until a \ntragic event occurred on August 28, 1996.\n  On that day a stolen vehicle collided with Officer Thompson's \ncruiser. Miraculously, both he and his partner, Officer Mark Negrete, \nsurvived the crash. While Officer Negrete escaped with only minor \ninjuries, the accident left Officer Thompson in a coma for 20 days. \nAgainst all odds, he survived the collision, the coma, and the surgery \nthat followed, but complications left him paralyzed.\n  It would have been easy for Officer Thompson to give up on his law \nenforcement career at that point. But instead, he fought back through \nmonths of grueling therapy, battling paralysis, memory loss, and \ndifficulties with his speech.\n  After rejuvenating his memory and fine motor skills, Officer Thompson \nenrolled in Goodwill's Head Injury Rehabilitation and Employment, or \nHIRE, program where he mastered computer keyboarding. Through it all, \nOfficer Thompson's wife Ann and their three children believed in him \nand were at his side helping him overcome the challenges and obstacles \nthat had been set in his path.\n  On September 25, 1997, less than 13 months after the accident, \nOfficer Thompson returned to duty at Omaha's Central Police \nHeadquarters. He currently serves as the first line in nonemergency \ncommunications with the community as part of the Information Service \nUnit's Telephone Response Squad. He also speaks regularly to recruit \nclasses about the dangers of high, speed pursuits.\n  Officer Thompson serves his community every day he goes to work, but \nhe also serves as an inspiration to all those who meet him or hear his \nstory. He is living proof that with courage, determination, and heart, \nall obstacles can be overcome.\n  I congratulate Mr. Thompson on the recognition he has deservedly \nreceived. It is truly an honor for him, his family, the Omaha Police \nDepartment, and the State of Nebraska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/14/senate-section/article/S6252-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/14/senate-section/article/S6252-4", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/14/senate-section/article/S6252-5", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nPERIODIC REPORT RELATIVE TO THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO IRAN \n         WHICH WAS DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 12170--PM 32\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Consistent with section 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 \nU.S.C. 1641(c), and section 204(c) of the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c), I transmit herewith a 6-month \nperiodic report prepared by my Administration on the national emergency \nwith respect to Iran that was declared in Executive Order 12170 of \nNovember 14, 1979.\n                                                      George W.

Since last July, the American Red Cross in \n     Michigan has seen a 43% increase in the number of military \n     cases served over last year; and\n       Whereas, Operation Enduring Freedom, the war on terrorism, \n     and the Iraq conflict have placed increased demands on this \n     vital program. The Red Cross and Congress can no longer rely \n     on charitable contributions from the American public to \n     support this required serviced, especially during the current \n     economic downturn: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize Congress to include funding for the American Red \n     Cross Armed Forces Emergency Services in the National Defense \n     Authorization Act and the Department of Defense \n     Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2004 to help fund costs \n     associated with AFES emergency communications and staff \n     mobilization and deployment. We also support the inclusion of \n     AFES funding in the Department of Defense budget request \n     starting in fiscal year 2005; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation. Adopted by the House \n     of Representatives, April 10, 2003.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-103. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Arizona relative to border \n     security; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                          House Memorial 2001\n\n       Whereas, illegal immigration has reached record levels, \n     with some estimates placing the overall illegal immigrant \n     population at between five and ten million individuals. This \n     results in annual costs to society estimated in the billions \n     of dollars due to the extra funds spent on education, health \n     care, welfare and corrections programs; and\n       Whereas, the nation's border states, including Arizona, are \n     particularly hard hit by the influx of illegal immigrants \n     across their borders. Among the more serious problems that \n     accompany illegal immigration are increased drug smuggling \n     and crime; and\n       Whereas, this state does not condone the illegal \n     immigration of individuals into this country and it supports \n     the efforts of the United States Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service (INS) and its enforcement arm, the \n     Border Patrol, to vigorously enforce the immigration laws of \n     this country; and\n       Whereas, while the INS and Border Patrol are charged with \n     enforcing current immigration laws, those laws do not go far \n     enough toward preventing the illegal entry of immigrants into \n     this country, requiring border states to rely on their own \n     resources to combat this growing problem; and\n       Whereas, state resources would be less strained in the \n     fight against illegal immigration by the provision of federal \n     funds to increase border patrol measures in border states. \n     Further, congressional action to expand the scope of the \n     Posse Comitatus Act to allow greater military involvement in \n     the patrolling of United States borders would give states \n     much-needed assistance in preventing the entry of illegal \n     immigrants and in fighting terrorism, drug smuggling and \n     crime problems; and\n       Whereas, article IV, section 4 of the Constitution of the \n     United States provides that ``The United States shall \n     guarantee to every State in this Union a Republic Form of \n     Government, and shall protect each of them against \n     Invasion.'' This confirmation of our national sovereignty \n     validates this request for additional resources to protect \n     our borders from illegal immigration and the harmful crime \n     and drug problems that accompany it.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Arizona, prays:\n       1. That the Congress of the United States introduce and \n     enact legislation that would increase effective border \n     controls, including the provision of greater funding for \n     border states and laws that would allow for increased \n     military presence along this nation's borders.\n       2. That the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona \n     transmit copies of this Memorial to the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives and each Member of Congress from the State \n     of Arizona.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-104.

A Senate joint resolution adopted by the General \n     Assembly of the State of Tennessee relative to restore state \n     and local sales tax deductibility from the Federal Income \n     Tax; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                    Senate Joint Resolution No. 184\n\n       Whereas, the viability of the Federal system of government \n     of the United States has endured through the history of this \n     republic through the diligence of governmental officials in \n     adjusting to evolving economic, social and political \n     conditions to preserve equity and fairness; and\n       Whereas, in 1986, amendments to the Internal Revenue Code \n     eliminated the option to deduct state and local sales taxes \n     paid by citizens from their income as reported on Federal \n     income tax forms, while the deductibility of state and local \n     income taxes was preserved; and\n       Whereas, Tennessee is one of a few states which do not have \n     an income tax on salaries\n\n[[Page S6254]]\n\n     and wages; taxpayers in these several states do not enjoy the \n     same advantages in deductions as do taxpayers in those states \n     that do levy taxes on salaries and wages; and\n       Whereas, in an effort to restore equity, Representative \n     Brady of Texas and others have introduced H.R. 720 to provide \n     taxpayers with the option of deducting state and local sales \n     taxes in lieu of state and local income taxes when computing \n     Federal income tax liability; and\n       Whereas, the members of this General Assembly and the \n     citizens of this State regard the passage of this measure as \n     essential to the restoration of fairness in the \n     administration of Federal income tax: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the One Hundred Third General \n     Assembly of the State of Tennessee, the House of \n     Representatives concurring, That this General Assembly hereby \n     memorializes the Congress of the United States to act \n     expeditiously to allow for the deduction of state and local \n     sales tax in the computation of Federal income tax liability, \n     as would be allowed under the provisions of H.R. 720, now \n     pending before the Congress; be it further\n       Resolved, That this General Assembly memorializes each \n     member of the United States Congress from Tennessee to \n     utilize the full measure of his or her influence to effect \n     the passage of Federal legislation providing for the \n     deduction on the Federal income tax, and urges the \n     Congressional delegations of our sister states of Alaska, \n     Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Texas, \n     Washington and Wyoming to join in this effort; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Senate is directed to \n     transmit a certified copy of this resolution to the Honorable \n     George W.

A senate resolution adopted by the General \n     Assembly of the State of Iowa relative to the federal \n     Medicare Program; to the Committee on Finance.\n       Whereas, the federal Medicare program provides health care \n     coverage for more than 485,000 Iowa senior citizens and \n     disabled persons; and\n       Whereas, all Americans equally contribute payroll taxes to \n     fund the federal Medicare program; and\n       Whereas, Iowa has a disproportionately large number of \n     federal Medicare enrollees, making Iowa health care providers \n     particularly dependent on federal Medicare payments as a \n     revenue source; and\n       Whereas, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \n     Services of the United States Department of Health and Human \n     Services, Iowa hospitals provide the eighth highest quality \n     care of any state in the nation; and\n       Whereas, the current federal Medicare funding formula has \n     created inequitable payments, leaving Iowa with the lowest \n     per-enrollee payment level in the nation; and\n       Whereas, Iowa's unfairly low federal Medicare payments are \n     a drain on Iowa's economy, costing the state of Iowa \n     approximately $1 billion annually in Medicare reimbursement \n     funding that could aid in the payment of health care costs of \n     Medicare-eligible residents; and\n       Whereas, Iowa's unfairly low federal Medicare payments make \n     it difficult to recruit physicians, nurses, and other health \n     care professionals, who are in great demand throughout Iowa \n     and the nation; and\n       Whereas, the United States Congress has the authority to \n     pass legislation to address Iowa's Medicare equity concerns: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, the House of Representatives \n     concurring, That the General Assembly of the State of Iowa \n     urges the United States Congress to pass legislation that \n     addresses Iowa's Medicare equity concerns; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this Resolution be sent by the \n     Secretary of the Senate to the President of the United \n     States, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and to \n     all members of Iowa's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-107. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Montana relative to allowing taxpayers to deduct \n     sales tax on their federal income tax returns; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution No. 34\n\n       Whereas, national economic studies show that states that \n     rely on sales taxes for governmental revenue generally \n     experience stronger economic growth than those states that \n     rely on income taxes for governmental revenue; and\n       Whereas, until 1986, federal law allowed taxpayers to \n     deduct sales taxes on their federal income tax return; and\n       Whereas, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 removed the ability of \n     taxpayers to deduct sales taxes on their federal income tax \n     return; and\n       Whereas, not allowing the deduction of sales taxes on the \n     federal income tax return discriminates against those states \n     that do not impose income taxes and is counterproductive to \n     economic growth; and\n       Whereas, a major impediment preventing Montana from \n     switching from the income tax to a sales tax is the higher \n     federal tax burden that Montana taxpayers would face because \n     they would not be allowed to deduct sales taxes on their \n     federal income tax return; and\n       Whereas, the United States Congress has recently considered \n     legislation to restore the deduction of sales taxes on the \n     federal income tax return; and\n       Whereas, federal policy should encourage states to develop \n     tax policies, including the use of sales taxes to fund \n     government services, that encourage economic growth: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Montana, That the Legislature urge Congress to \n     enact and the President of the United States to approve \n     legislation to allow taxpayers to deduct sales taxes paid on \n     their federal income tax return; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature encourage the Montana \n     Congressional Delegation to work in its respective houses of \n     Congress for the enactment of federal legislation that would \n     allow taxpayers to deduct sales taxes paid from their federal \n     income tax return; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State send copies of this \n     resolution to the Honorable George W.

to the Committee of Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n\n                           Senate Memorial 56\n\n       Whereas, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued a \n     notice of proposed rulemaking on July 31, 2000 regarding a \n     standard market design for the nation's wholesale electricity \n     markets; and\n       Whereas, the provisioning of electricity is an essential \n     service that is critically important to the citizens and \n     businesses of New Mexico and of all states; and\n       Whereas, the delivery of electric service that is reliable, \n     safe and consistent with environmental values and that is \n     stably and reasonably prices is also of critical importance \n     to the citizens and businesses of New Mexico and of all \n     states; and\n       Whereas, in the best traditions of federalism, the nation's \n     electric power supply has historically been regulated through \n     the cooperation and complementary activity of state, federal \n     and other agencies; and\n       Whereas, through that cooperative and complementary system \n     of regulation, the nation's electric power supply is, on the \n     whole, safe, affordable efficient and dependable; and\n       Whereas, it is evident from the standard market design for \n     the nation's wholesales electricity markets that the Federal \n     Energy Regulatory Commission is proposing to make fundamental \n     changes in the way electric transmission is controlled, \n     operated and priced; and\n       Whereas, the changes inherent in the standard market design \n     of the nation's wholesale electricity markets appear to \n     necessitate alterations in the jurisdiction of the various \n     state commissions; and\n       Whereas, in recognition of the failure of the California \n     energy market, with its direct effects on the economy of that \n     state and its indirect effects on other state through \n     disruption of a previously beneficial and stable wholesale \n     market, the New Mexico Legislature, in 2001, postponed any \n     opening of retail markets in New Mexico until 2007; and\n       Whereas, the standard market design for the nation's \n     wholesale electricity markets implies vast changes in control \n     over the disposition of transmission assets, operations, \n     pricing and sitting and makes them subject to a form of \n     control that escapes state oversight; and\n       Whereas, the changes necessitated the standard market \n     design for the nation's wholesale electricity markets would \n     effectively remove the business of electric transmission from \n     any meaningful public scrutiny or accountability and\n       Whereas, Federal Policy should both protect consumers and \n     preserve the full ability of statues and municipalities to \n     oversee reliable and reasonably priced electricity service to \n     retail customers; and\n       Whereas, wholesale markets have been in existence within \n     the western interconnection for some time and have played an \n     integral role in the successful operation of western electric \n     systems; and\n       Whereas, as a credible cost-benefit analysis of either \n     regional transmission organizations or standard market \n     design, that accurately forecasts the effect of standard \n     market design on New Mexico rate payers has not yet been \n     performed; and\n       Whereas, New Mexico and its citizens must balance \n     significant air-quality and land-use issues related to energy \n     production and transport with the economic benefit of those \n     activities, and should not be deprived of that economic \n     benefit through premature implementation of standard market \n     design; and\n       Whereas, a clear demonstration of benefit must be performed \n     prior to the implementation of any new system for wholesale \n     electric power delivery that has economic and judictional \n     implications as profound as those inherent in the Federal \n     Energy Regulation Commission's current standard market design \n     proposal: Now, therefore, it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the State of New Mexico that the \n     Federal Energy Regulatory\n\n[[Page S6255]]\n\n     Commission be requested to withdraw it current standard \n     market design for the nation's wholesale electricity markets; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved that copies of this memorial be transmitted to the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the \n     President of the United States Senate, the Members of the New \n     Mexico Congressional Delegation and the Commissioners of the \n     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-109.

Federal mandates are being imposed at an alarming \n     rate on the states without the accompanying tax dollars \n     necessary to implement the mandated programs.

A bill to modify the calculation of back pay for persons who \nwere approved for promotion as members of the Navy and Marine Corps \nwhile interned as prisoners of war during World War II to take into \naccount changes in the Consumer Price Index; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to sponsor the World War II POW \nPay Equity Act of 2003. In 2000, we passed legislation intended to \ncorrect an injustice of not paying Navy and Marine Corps POWs for \npromotions while they were interned during World War II. Unfortunately, \nthis legislation omitted an adjustment for inflation. The result was \nthat these heroes were paying in 1942 dollars, roughly equating to ten \ncents on the current dollar. It is well past time to properly \ncompensate them for their dedicated service. This bill ensures these \nformer WWII POW, or their surviving spouses, would receive the \nappropriate back pay adjusted for inflation for their military service.\n  Many of these WWII veterans need our help, not only to fix a \ndiscriminatory act upon Navy and Marine Corps POWs, but financially as \nwell, since many suffer from extreme financial distress. The total \nnumber of surviving WWII POWs is now less than 1,000 and approximately \n400 spouses. We can not abandon the ``greatest generation'' who are \nresponsible for the successes and riches we currently enjoy in this \ngreat country. It would be shameful for Congress and our Nation not to \ncompensate these veterans appropriately, as this is a debt that our \ncountry incurred during their internment of POWs.\n  Make no mistake,this is a readiness issue, as well. Today's service \nmembers are acutely aware of retirees' disenfranchisement from \ndelinquent policies enacted over the years, and exit surveys cite this \nissue with increasing frequency as one of the factors in members' \ndecisions to leave service. In fact, a recent GAO study found that \n``inadequate military retirement benefits'' was a significant source of \ndissatisfaction among active duty officers in retention-critical \nspecialties.\n  I would like to emphasize that this year's defense authorization bill \ncontains over $1 billion in pork--unrequested add-ons to the defense \nbudget that deprive our military of vital funding for priority issues. \nWith the amount of unrequested spending attached to the defense \nauthorization bill, we could certainly find the funding for this \nlegislation. We must fulfill our commitment to a group who we \ncollectively owe our full support, admiration, and gratitude.\n  I request unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1057\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S6260]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide a cost-sharing requirement for the \nconstruction of the Arkansas Valley Conduit in the State of Colorado; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, an historian and poet once penned that the \nhistory of Colorado would be written in water. In the midst of \nColorado's worst drought in 300 years, this prediction has proven an \naccurate account of life in the headwater State and has proven a strong \nreminder that water is indeed our most precious natural resource. Yet \nin Southeastern Colorado, home of the Arkansas River, finding clean, \ninexpensive water, can be difficult. That is why today I am introducing \nlegislation that will ensure the expedited construction of the Arkansas \nValley Conduit--a pipeline that will provide the small, financially \nstrapped towns and water agencies along the Arkansas River with safe, \nclean, affordable water. By creating a Federal/Local cost share formula \nto help offset the costs of constructing the Conduit, this legislation \nwill protect the future of Southeastern Colorado.\n  By way of background, the Arkansas Valley Conduit was originally \nauthorized by Congress forty years ago as a part of the Fryingpan-\nArkansas Project. Due to the authorizing statute's lack of a cost share \nprovision and Southeastern Colorado's depressed economic status, the \nConduit was never built. Until recently, the region has been fortunate \nto enjoy an economical and safe alternative to pipeline-transportation \nof Project Water: the Arkansas River. Sadly, the water quality in the \nArkansas has degraded to a point where it is no longer economical to \nuse as a means of transport. At the same time, the Federal government \nhas continued to strengthen its unfunded water quality standards.\n  In order to comply with these standards, the region's municipalities \nhave begun exploring options for water treatment, some of which are \nestimated to cost between $20 million and $40 million. Taken together, \nthe municipalities alone are facing potential expenditures of up to \n$640 million simply to comply with federally mandated water quality \nstandards. Construction of over a half a billion dollars worth of water \ntreatment facilities is simply not a feasible alternative for the \nfinancially strapped farming communities along the Arkansas River. With \nthe Conduit, the communities will not need to build new water treatment \nfacilities.\n  In an effort to resurrect the Conduit, last year, Senator Ben \nNighthorse Campbell and I, worked to secure $200,000 for a Bureau of \nReclamation Re-evaluation Statement on the project. Thanks to this \neffort, the people of the valley are beginning to realize that the \nConduit is much more than just a pipedream, and that Congress is \nserious about fulfilling the promise of the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project.\n  According to the draft feasibility study, the Conduit is estimated to \ncost $200 million. My legislation calls for a 75/25 Federal/Local cost \nshare, meaning that the local communities will be required to come up \nwith at least $50 million to pay for their share. This is a sizeable \nsum, but is a far cry from the $640 million it would cost to build the \nnew treatment facilities that would be required if the Conduit is not \nbuilt. This will leave $150 million for the Federal government's share. \nHowever, I would like to point out that this $150 million undoubtedly \nwould be exceeded if the communities were forced to seek Federal grants \nto help build new treatment plants.\n  The Arkansas Valley Conduit will deliver fresh, clean water to dozens \nof valley communities and thousands of people along the river. The \nlocal sponsors of the project have initiated and are nearing the \ncompletion of an independently funded feasibility study of the Conduit, \nand have developed a coalition of support from water users in \nSoutheastern Colorado. They continue to explore options for financing \ntheir share of the costs, and are working hard to develop the \norganization that will oversee the Conduit project.\n  With the help of my colleagues, the promise made by Congress forty \nyears ago to the people of Southeastern Colorado, will finally become a \nreality.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1058\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill to \ncorrect an inequity in our tax code.\n  Currently, we use inconsistent standards to tax different types of \npolitical campaign committees. Congressional campaigns are taxed at the \napplicable corporate rates: depending on how much taxable income a \ncampaign generates, it will be taxed at rates that vary from 15 percent \nto 35 percent. However, all other campaigns must pay the highest \ncorporate rate of 35 percent. This is unfair.\n  It's wrong to tax some campaigns at rates that change according to \nincome level and then arbitrarily charge others at the highest possible \nrate. This disparity particularly hurts local and State candidates who \ngenerally have relatively low levels of taxable income but have to pay \nthe same 35 percent rate as campaigns that may generate more than $10 \nmillion in taxable income.\n  The bill I am introducing today will eliminate this inequity by \ntaxing all campaign committees at the corporate rate based on their \nlevel of income. No longer will congressional campaigns be allowed to \nreceive preferred tax treatment. All campaigns will be treated the \nsame.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this effort to improve the fairness \nof the tax code.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S6261]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1059\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TAX RATE FOR POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Paragraph (1) of section 527(b) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to tax imposed) is \n     amended by striking ``highest rate'' and inserting \n     ``appropriate rates''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Subsection (h) of section 527 of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to special rule \n     for principal campaign committees) is repealed.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2002.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Carper, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Nelson \n        of Florida, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Graham of South \n        Carolina, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Levin, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Reid, Mr. \n        Chambliss, Mr. Miller, Mr. Alexander, and Mr. Graham of \n        Florida):\n  S. 1061. A bill to authorize 36 additional bankruptcy judgeships, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Bankruptcy \nJudgeship Act of 2003, along with over a dozen Senators of both parties \nwho are joining me on this legislation. This bill creates new temporary \nand permanent bankruptcy judgeships in districts that need them, and \nextends and converts other temporary judgeships.\n  The substantial increase in bankruptcy case filings in recent years \nhas created a dire need for additional bankruptcy judgeships. My bill \nwould create 23 new permanent bankruptcy judgeships, 5 temporary \njudgeships, convert 2 temporary judgeships to permanent status and \nextend 2 other temporary judgeships. 17 States would receive new \njudgeships, as recommended by the Administrative Office for United \nStates Courts.\n  Among other things, the bill authorizes four new bankruptcy \njudgeships, and converts one from temporary to permanent status, for \nthe District of Delaware, the Nation's most overloaded bankruptcy \ndistrict. The most recent data show weighted filings for the district \nof Delaware surpassing 13,500 per judge, while the next busiest \ndistrict faces only about 3,000.\n  The bankruptcy bar in Delaware is among the most respected and \naccomplished in the country, as are our bankruptcy judges. But our \njudges are not superhuman. They must receive the assistance that this \nbill would grant them, and I intend to see that they get it.\n  The Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 2003 is long overdue and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1061\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of \nlegislation to provide more bankruptcy judges for several States, \nincluding four additional bankruptcy judgeships for my own State of \nMaryland. This legislation is being introduced today by Senator Biden, \nand is being cosponsored by myself and Senators Carper, Nelson of \nFlorida, Clinton, Edwards, Graham of South Carolina, Hollings, Levin, \nPryor, Reid, Chambliss, Miller, Alexander and Graham of Florida.\n  This bill is another significant step forward in our efforts to \nstrengthen Maryland's Federal bankruptcy court. We have been working \nfor several years to get these additional judgeships approved, yet no \nlegislation has been passed that would authorize them. With such \ninaction, the burden facing Maryland's sitting bankruptcy judges has \ngrown, and Maryland has remained without the additional judgeships it \nso desperately needs to make our bankruptcy system work.\n  Maryland's four sitting bankruptcy judges continue to show remarkable \ndedication given the extraordinary burdens placed upon them. However, \nadditional judgeships remain essential to the fair and timely \nadministration of the Bankruptcy Code for all of the businesses and \nindividuals that come before the Maryland District.\n  Since 1992, we have been requesting additional judgeships for the \nDistrict of Maryland; thus far none have been approved. In 1992, there \nwere approximately 15,000 bankruptcy filings in the District of \nMaryland. From 1998 to 2002, there were over 30,000 bankruptcy filings \nper year in Maryland. In the past few years the number of new filings \nper year has been closer to 35,000, and in 2002 there were 35,900 new \ncases. The caseload has more than doubled in the past ten years, and \nthe Court still does its work with only four bankruptcy judges. This \ndire need for additional judgeships in Maryland has yet to be remedied \nby the Congress.\n  This legislation provides four additional judgeships for Maryland, in \naccordance with a September 2002 recommendation from the United States \nJudicial Conference. These four additional judgeships would help reduce \nthe overwhelming workload of the four sitting bankruptcy judges. As of \nJune 30, 2002, the national weighted filing average for bankruptcy \njudges was 1,641. The weighted filing per judge for Maryland's four \nbankruptcy judges was 3,030--almost twice the national average.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, \nwhich would provide much needed help on the bankruptcy courts in \nMaryland and across the Nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL.:\n  S. 1062. A bill to amend section 924 of title 18, United States Code, \nto increase the maximum term of imprisonment for offenses involving \nstolen firearms; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, this week, May 11 through 17, is \n``National Police Week 2003.''\n  This is the week when thousands of law enforcement officers from all \nover the United States gather here in our Nation's Capital. \nRepresenting a full spectrum of our Nation's law enforcement personnel \nincluding local, State, and Federal officers, they gather here to honor \ntheir fallen comrades, as well as to celebrate all who serve this \ncountry and its citizens. Some of this year's highlights include the \nMay 11 ``Law Ride,'' the May 13 ``Candlelight Vigil at the National Law \nEnforcement Officers Memorial'' and the May 15 ``National Peace \nOfficers' Memorial Day Service'' which will be held on the Capitol \ngrounds. These events are being held to specifically pay tribute to the \nmore than 145 peace officers who were killed in the line of duty across \nthe U.S. during 2002.\n  In honor of ``National Police Week,'' today I am introducing two \nbills that will help improve our Nation's justice system and protect \nthe law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line for us all \non a daily basis.\n  The first bill I am introducing is the ``Stolen Gun Penalty \nEnhancement Act of 2003'' which would increase the maximum prison \nsentences for violating existing stolen gun laws.\n  A growing number of crimes in our country are being committed with \nstolen guns. The extent of this problem is reflected in a number of \nrecent studies and news reports which indicate that almost half a \nmillion guns are stolen each year.\n  This problem is increasing, and is therefore especially alarming \namong young people. A Justice Department study of juvenile inmates in \nfour States showed that over 50 percent of the inmates in those prison \nsystems had stolen a gun. In the same study, gang members and drug \nsellers were also more likely to have stolen a gun.\n  Specifically, this bill would increase the maximum penalty for \nviolating four provisions of the firearms laws. Under title 18 of the \nU.S. Code, it is illegal to knowingly transport or ship a stolen \nfirearm or stolen ammunition. It is also illegal to knowingly receive, \npossess, conceal, store, sell, or otherwise dispose of a stolen firearm \nor stolen ammunition. The penalty for violating either of these \nprovisions is a fine, a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years, or \nboth.\n  My bill increases the maximum prison sentence to 15 years.\n  I am a strong supporter of the rights of law-abiding gun owners. \nHowever, I firmly believe we need tougher penalties for the illegal use \nof firearms.\n  The ``Stolen Gun Penalty Enhancement Act of 2003'' will send a strong \nsignal to criminals who are even thinking about stealing a firearm. I \nurge my colleagues to join in support of this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Stolen Gun Penalty \nEnhancement Act of 2003 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1062\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Stolen Gun Penalty \n     Enhancement Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. STOLEN FIREARMS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 924 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)--\n       (A) in paragraph (2), by striking ``(i), (j),''; and\n       (B) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(8) Whoever knowingly violates subsection (i) or (j) of \n     section 922 shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not \n     more than 15 years, or both.'';\n       (2) in subsection (i)(1), by striking ``10 years'' and \n     inserting ``15 years''; and\n       (3) in subsection (l), by striking ``10 years'' and \n     inserting ``15 years''.\n       (b) Sentencing Commission.--The United States Sentencing \n     Commission shall amend the Federal sentencing guidelines to \n     reflect the amendments made under subsection (a).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 1065. A bill to establish a matching grant program to help State \nand local jurisdictions purchase bullet-resistant equipment for use by \nlaw enforcement departments; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, the second bill I am introducing today \nis the ``Officer Dale Claxton Bullet Resistant Police Protective \nEquipment Act of 2003''.\n  This bill is named in honor of Officer Dale Claxton of Cortez, CO, a \nfine law enforcement officer and family man, who was fatally shot \nthrough the windshield of his patrol car on May 29, 1998, after \nstopping a stolen truck. His assailants turned out to be dangerous \nfugitives and as a result, a large-scale man hunt was launched. The \nassailants were brought to justice, but Officer Claxton was tragically \nand prematurely taken away from his wife and four children.\n  ``The Officer Dale Claxton Bullet Resistant Police Protective \nEquipment Act'' would aid law enforcement agencies in acquiring bullet \nresistant equipment for their forces, including bullet\n\n[[Page S6263]]\n\nresistant glass for law enforcement vehicles, hand-held shields and any \nother equipment that officers may need when they serve on the front \nlines of law enforcement. Specifically, this legislation would help our \nNation's State and local law enforcement officers acquire the bullet \nresistant equipment they need in order to protect themselves from \nwould-be killers. This legislation would authorize the Department of \nJustice's Bureau of Justice Assistance to administer a $40 million \nmatching grant program to assist these agencies purchase bullet \nresistant equipment.\n  This legislation is a worthy companion, and similar in many ways, to \nS.764, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act, which I recently \nintroduced for reauthorization. Like S. 764, today's bill would help \nState and local law enforcement agencies acquire bullet resistant \nequipment--however this bill would simply provide for a wider array of \nbullet resistant equipment to supplement bullet proof vests.\n  As a former deputy sheriff, I am personally aware of the dangers \nwhich law enforcement officers face on the front lines every day. One \nway in which the Federal Government can improve their safety is to help \nthem acquire bullet resistant glass and other equipment for patrol \ncars. These partnership grants are especially crucial for officers who \nserve in small, local jurisdictions that often lack the funds to \nprovide their officers with the life saving equipment they may need.\n  The second component of this legislation would launch expedited and \ntargeted research and development by authorizing $3 million over 3 \nyears for the Justice Department's National Institute of Justice, NIJ, \nto conduct research and development of new bullet resistant \ntechnologies, such as bonded acrylic, polymers, polycarbons, aluminized \nmaterial, and transparent ceramics.\n  Promising new bullet resistant materials now being developed could be \nas revolutionary in coming years as the development of Kevlar was in \nthe 1970s for the manufacture of body armor. These exciting new \ntechnologies promise to be lighter, more versatile and hopefully less \nexpensive than traditional heavy bulletproof glass.\n  Our Nation's police officers, sheriffs and deputies regularly put \ntheir lives in harm's way as they protect the people and preserve the \npeace. They deserve to have access to the bullet resistant equipment \nthey need. The Officer Dale Claxton Bullet Resistant Police Protective \nEquipment Act will both accelerate the development of new lifesaving \nbullet resistant technologies and then help get them deployed into the \nfield where they are needed. Officers lives will be saved.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of Officer Dale Claxton Bullet \nResistant Police Protective Equipment Act of 2003 be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1065\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Officer Dale Claxton \n     Bulletproof Police Protective Equipment Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Officer Dale Claxton of the Cortez, Colorado, Police \n     Department was shot and killed by bullets that passed through \n     the windshield of his police car after he stopped a stolen \n     truck, and his life may have been saved if his police car had \n     been equipped with bullet-resistant equipment;\n       (2) the number of law enforcement officers who are killed \n     in the line of duty would significantly decrease if every law \n     enforcement officer in the United States had access to \n     additional bullet-resistant equipment;\n       (3) according to studies, between 1990 and 2000, 1,700 law \n     enforcement officers in the United States were shot and \n     killed in the line of duty;\n       (4) the Federal Bureau of Investigation estimates that the \n     risk of fatality to law enforcement officers while not \n     wearing bullet-resistant equipment, such as an armor vest, is \n     14 times higher than for officers wearing an armor vest; and\n       (5) the Executive Committee for Indian Country Law \n     Enforcement Improvements reports that violent crime in Indian \n     country has risen sharply despite a decrease in the national \n     crime rate, and has concluded that there is a ``public safety \n     crisis in Indian country''.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to save lives of \n     law enforcement officers by helping State, local, and tribal \n     law enforcement agencies provide officers with bullet-\n     resistant equipment and video cameras.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, fifteen years ago today, the most \ndeadly drunk driving accident in our Nation's history occurred. It \nhappened at about 10:55 p.m. EST, when a school bus full of teens and \nchaperones traveled down Interstate 71 to Radcliff, KY, on the way home \nfrom a church outing at a Cincinnati, OH amusement park. At this time, \na repeat drunk driving offender with a blood alcohol concentration, \nBAC, of .24 headed the wrong way down Interstate 71 and slammed his \npick-up truck into the bus. In just a few horrific moments, 27 people--\nmostly children--were killed; another 34 were injured.\n  Today, I was honored to stand with three brave people whose lives \nwere changed forever by this reckless tragedy: Karolyn Nunnallee, Janey \nFair, and Harold Dennis. Karolyn lost her 10-year old daughter, Patty, \nand Janey lost her 14-year old daughter, Shannon. Harold was riding on \nthe bus on that fateful day. Their perseverance should be a lesson for \nus all, as we continue to fight the social epidemic of drunk driving.\n  Today we must remember the victims and survivors of that terrible \ntragedy and sadly commemorate the 15th anniversary of the Kentucky bus \ncrash. It is in their memory that I, along with my colleague Senator \nMike DeWine, submit this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/14/senate-section/article/S6264-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6264-S6265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 44--RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF ASIAN \n                    PACIFIC AMERICANS TO OUR NATION\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 44\n\n       Whereas at the direction of Congress in 1978, the President \n     proclaimed the week beginning May 4, 1979, as Asian Pacific \n     American Heritage Week, providing the people of the United \n     States with an opportunity to recognize the achievements, \n     contributions, history, and concerns of Asian Pacific \n     Americans;\n       Whereas the seven day period starting May 4 was designated \n     Asian Pacific Heritage Week as it marks two historical \n     dates--May 7, 1843, when the first Japanese immigrants \n     arrived in the United States, and May 10, 1869, Golden Spike \n     Day, when, with substantial contributions from Chinese \n     immigrants, the first transcontinental railroad was \n     completed;\n       Whereas the 102nd Congress by law designated that the month \n     of May be annually observed as Asian Pacific American \n     Heritage Month;\n       Whereas according to the U.S. Census Bureau an estimated \n     12.5 million United States residents trace their ethnic \n     heritage, in full or in part, to Asia and the Pacific \n     Islands;\n       Whereas Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders can list \n     innovative contributions to all aspects of life in the United \n     States ranging from the first transcontinental railroad to \n     the Internet;\n       Whereas in the mid-1700's Filipino sailors formed the first \n     Asian American and Pacific Islander communities in the bayous \n     of Louisiana;\n       Whereas Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have added to \n     the vast cultural wealth of our Nation; and\n       Whereas Americans of Asian Pacific heritage, who include \n     immigrant and indigenous populations, have honorably served \n     to defend the United States in times of armed conflict from \n     the Civil War to the present: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes that the United States draws its strength \n     from its diversity, including contributions made by Asian \n     Americans and Pacific Islanders;\n       (2) recognizes that the Asian American and Pacific Islander \n     community is a thriving and integral part of American society \n     and culture;\n       (3) supports the goals of Asian Pacific Heritage Month; and\n       (4) recognizes the prodigious contributions of Asian \n     Americans and Pacific Islanders to the United States.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to recognize our country's diverse \nAsian American and Pacific Islander, AAPI, population and commemorate \nAsian Pacific American Heritage Month. I add my voice to those in the \nAAPI community recognizing and celebrating the unique contributions of \nthis diverse community by submitting a resolution similar to that \nsubmitted in the other body by fellow members of the Congressional \nAsian Pacific American Caucus.\n  It was more than 10 years ago when my friend and former colleague, \nCongressman Frank Horton of New York,\n\n[[Page S6265]]\n\ntook the important step of introducing and working to pass a bill to \ndesignate each May as Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, in \nperpetuity. His bill eventually became Public Law 102-450 on October \n23, 1992. This was a single, important step to demonstrate the support \nof the Congress for a community that has always been a vital part of \nour Nation's heritage.\n  Historians note that the first Asians or Pacific Islanders to set \nfoot on the continental United States were Filipinos manning Spanish \ngalleons that sought to explore the new land in the 1500s. Filipino \nsailors later, in the 1700s, founded the first AAPI communities in the \nLouisiana bayous, using names such as Manila Village and Bayou Cholas. \nThe first Japanese arrived on May 7, 1843, and others in 1869 attempted \nto establish the Wakamatsu Tea and Silk Colony, in order to grow \nmulberries, tangerines, grapes, and tea. Chinese adventurers joined \nother gold-seekers in northern California in the 1800s, establishing \nthe now-famous Chinatown in San Francisco in the 1850s, and working \ntoward the establishment of the first transcontinental railroad--marked \nby Golden Spike Day, May 10, 1869. Of course, before all of this took \nplace, the indigenous peoples most known to me, the Native Hawaiians, \nestablished a vibrant society, living and working the lands from \nroughly the 1200s on what was to become the 50th State in our precious \nUnion. Prior to western contact, the Native Hawaiians lived in an \nadvanced society steeped in science. The many other peoples in what is \nknown now as the collective AAPI community have their own fascinating \nstories to tell about their first adventures and long heritage in \nAmerica.\n  Advancing through history to come to the present, the AAPI community \nhas grown so much from our years of ``firsts'' that it now numbers \nabout 13.5 million--12.5 million Asians and almost one million Native \nHawaiians or Other Pacific Islanders. Together, AAPIs make up roughly \n4.7 percent of the population. Even with this growth in overall size, \nwe have remained inclusive of our various cultures and celebrated the \npositives among our differences as well as lauded our similarities. \nIndeed, my colleagues can certainly describe their favorite Korean, \nThai, or Indian restaurants, or strive to distinguish one of our many \nlanguages from another, while acknowledging the major significance we \ncollectively assign to educational access and attainment, service to \nthe communities we live in, and deep-rooted family values. It is also \nprudent to note that AAPIs together continue to strive toward \neliminating civil injustice and increasing our political involvement \nand participation in government, while looking to care for individuals \nin our community who deny the stereotype of AAPIs as a ``model \nminority''--those who are not faring as well as others and continue to \nlive below the poverty level or fail to reach their full potential in \nschool or in the workforce. It is not only for AAPIs but for all of us \nin this great country that I firmly believe that our individual \nidentification and knowledge of our cultures of origin strengthen us \nwhen we come together as Americans. It is out of our many, glorious \nparts that we come together to make one shining whole. Thus, the \ncelebration of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month truly is about all \nof us.\n  I urge my colleagues to support me in this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/14/senate-section/article/S6265-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6265-S6266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 544.

Mr. SPECTER submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by \nhim to the bill S. 1054, to provide for reconciliation pursuant to \nsection 201 of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year \n2004; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title V add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . FLAT TAX.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The current Internal Revenue Code, with it myriad \n     deductions, credits and schedules, and over 17,000 pages of \n     rules and regulations, is long overdue for an overhaul.\n       (2) The current Internal Revenue Code has over \n     6,900,000,000 words compared to the bible at 1,773,000 words \n     the Declaration of Independence at 1,300 words, The \n     Gettysburg Address at 267 words, and the Pledge of Allegiance \n     at only 31 words.\n\n[[Page S6292]]\n\n       (3) It is an unacceptable waste of our nation's precious \n     resources when Americans spend more than 5,800,000,000 hours \n     every year compiling information and filling out Internal \n     Revenue Code tax forms. In addition, taxpayers spend \n     $194,000,000,000 each year in tax code compliance. America's \n     resources could be dedicated to far more productive pursuits.\n       (4) The primary goal of any tax reform is to promote growth \n     and remove the inefficiencies of the current tax code. The \n     flat tax will expand the economy by an estimated $2 trillion \n     over seven years.\n       (5) Another important goal of the flat tax is to achieve \n     fairness, with a single low flat tax rate for all individuals \n     and businesses.\n       (6) Simplicity is another critically important goal of the \n     flat tax, and it is in the public interest to have a ten-\n     lined tax form that fits on a postcard and takes 10 minutes \n     to fill out.\n       (7) A comprehensive analysis of our tax structure has \n     concluded that a flat tax of 19 percent could be imposed upon \n     individuals and be revenue neutral.\n       (8) If the decision is made to include deductibility on \n     items such as interest on home mortgages and charitable \n     contributions, the flat tax would be raised from a 19 percent \n     to a 20 percent rate to accommodate the deductions and remain \n     revenue neutral.\n       (9) The flat tax would tax business at a 20 percent rate on \n     net profits and be revenue neutral and lead to investment \n     decisions being made on the basis of productivity rather than \n     for tax avoidance.\n       (10) The flat tax would lead to the elimination of the \n     capital gains tax. This would become a powerful incentive for \n     savings and investment--which translates into economic growth \n     and expansion, more and better jobs, and raising the standard \n     of living for all Americans.\n       (11) The flat tax would lower the cost of capital by \n     allowing businesses to write off the cost of capital purchase \n     in the same year the purchase was made as opposed to \n     complying with complicated depreciation schedules.\n       (12) By eliminating the double tax on dividends, the flat \n     tax eliminates the distortions in the tax code favoring debt \n     over equity financing by businesses.\n       (13) The flat tax would eliminate the estate and gift tax. \n     With the elimination of the estate and gift tax, family-held \n     businesses will be much more stable under the flat tax \n     system.\n       (14) As tax loopholes are eliminated and the tax code is \n     simplified, there will be far less opportunity for tax \n     avoidance and fraud, which now amounts to over $120 billion \n     in uncollected revenue annually.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Senate Finance Committee and the Joint Economic \n     Committee should undertake a comprehensive analysis of flat \n     tax proposals, including appropriate hearings and consider \n     legislation providing for a flat tax.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 566.

Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Bennett, and Mr. \nThomas) proposed an amendment to the bill S. 1054, to provide for \nreconciliation pursuant to section 201 of the concurrent resolution on \nthe budget for fiscal year 2004; as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title V add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . FLAT TAX.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The current Internal Revenue Code, with its myriad \n     deductions, credits and schedules, and over 17,000 pages of \n     rules and regulations, is long overdue for an overhaul.\n       (2) The current Internal Revenue Code has over 6,900,000 \n     words compared to the Bible at 1,773,000 words, the \n     Declaration of Independence at 1,300 words, the Gettysburg \n     Address at 267 words, and the Pledge of Allegiance at only 31 \n     words.\n       (3) It is an unacceptable waste of our nation's precious \n     resources when Americans spend more than 5,800,000,000 hours \n     every year compiling information and filling out Internal \n     Revenue Code tax forms. In addition, taxpayers spend \n     $194,000,000,000 each year in tax code compliance. America's \n     resources could be dedicated to far more productive pursuits.\n       (4) The primary goal of any tax reform is to promote growth \n     and remove the inefficiencies of the current tax code. The \n     flat tax will expand the economy by an estimated $2 trillion \n     over seven years.\n       (5) Another important goal of the flat tax is to achieve \n     fairness, with a single low flat tax rate for all individuals \n     and businesses.\n       (6) Simplicity is another critically important goal of the \n     flat tax, and it is in the public interest to have a ten-line \n     tax form that fits on a postcard and takes 10 minutes to fill \n     out.\n       (7) A comprehensive analyses of our tax structure has \n     concluded that a flat tax of 19% could be imposed upon \n     individuals and be revenue neutral.\n       (8) If the decision is made to include deductibility on \n     items such as interest on home mortgages and charitable \n     contributions, the flat tax would be raised from a 19% to a \n     20% rate to accommodate the deductions and remain revenue \n     neutral.\n       (9) The flat tax would tax business at a 20% rate on net \n     profits and be revenue neutral and lead to investment \n     decisions being made on the basis of productivity rather than \n     for tax avoidance.\n       (10) The flat tax would lead to the elimination of the \n     capital gains tax. This would become a powerful incentive for \n     savings and investment--which translates into economic growth \n     and expansion, more and better jobs, and raising the standard \n     of living for all Americans.\n       (11) The flat tax would lower the cost of capital by \n     allowing businesses to write off the cost of capital purchase \n     in the same year the purchase was made as opposed to \n     complying with complicated depreciation schedules.\n       (12) By eliminating the double tax on dividends, the flat \n     tax eliminates the distortions in the tax code favoring debt \n     over equity financing by businesses.\n       (13) The flat tax would eliminate the estate and gift tax. \n     With the elimination of the estate and gift tax, family-held \n     businesses will be much more stable under the flat tax \n     system.\n\n[[Page S6294]]\n\n       (14) As tax loopholes are eliminated and the tax code is \n     simplified, there will be far less opportunity for tax \n     avoidance and fraud, which now amounts to over $120 billion \n     in uncollected revenue annually.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) The Senate Finance Committee and the Joint Economic \n     Committee should undertake a comprehensive analysis of \n     simplification including flat tax proposals, including \n     appropriate hearings and consider legislation providing for a \n     flat tax.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 570.

Mrs. CLINTON submitted an amendment intended to be proposed \nby her to the bill S. 1054, to provide for reconciliation pursuant to \nsection 201 of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year \n2004; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the end of subpart C of title V, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. LEAD ABATEMENT TAX CREDIT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that:\n       (1) Of the 98,000,000 housing units in the United States, \n     38,000,000 have lead-based paint.\n       (2) Of the 38,000,000 housing units with lead-based paint, \n     25,000,000 pose a hazard, as defined by Environmental \n     Protection Agency and Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development standards, due to conditions such as peeling \n     paint and settled dust on floors and windowsills that contain \n     lead at levels above Federal safety standards.\n       (3) Though the number of children in the United States ages \n     1 through 5 with blood levels higher than the Centers for \n     Disease Control action level of 10 micrograms per deciliter \n     has declined to 300,000, lead poisoning remains a serious, \n     entirely preventable threat to a child's intelligence, \n     behavior, and learning.\n       (4) The Secretary of Health and Human Services has \n     established a national goal of ending childhood lead \n     poisoning by 2010.\n       (5) Current Federal lead abatement programs, such as the \n     Lead Hazard Control Grant Program of the Department of \n     Housing and Urban Development, only have resources sufficient \n     to make approximately 7,000 homes lead-safe each year. In \n     many cases, when State and local public health departments \n     identify a lead-poisoned child, resources are insufficient to \n     reduce or eliminate the hazards.\n       (6) Approximately 15 percent of children are lead-poisoned \n     by home renovation projects performed by remodelers who fail \n     to follow basic safeguards to control lead dust.\n       (7) Old windows typically pose significant risks because \n     wood trim is more likely to be painted with lead-based paint, \n     moisture causes paint to deteriorate, and friction generates \n     lead dust. The replacement of old windows that contain lead \n     based paint significantly reduces lead poisoning hazards in \n     addition to producing significant energy savings.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to encourage \n     the safe removal of lead hazards from homes and thereby \n     decrease the number of children who suffer reduced \n     intelligence, learning difficulties, behavioral problems, and \n     other health consequences due to lead-poisoning.\n       (c) Lead Abatement Tax Credit.--\n       (1) In General.--Subpart B of part IV of subchapter A of \n     chapter 1 (relating to foreign tax credit, etc.) is amended \n     by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 30B. HOME LEAD ABATEMENT.\n\n       ``(a) Allowance of Credit.--There shall be allowed as a \n     credit against the tax imposed by this chapter an amount \n     equal to 50 percent of the abatement cost paid or incurred\n\n[[Page S6331]]\n\n     by the taxpayer during the taxable year for each eligible \n     dwelling unit of the taxpayer.\n       ``(b) Limitation.--The amount of the credit allowed

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 91, S. 709.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 709) to award a congressional gold medal to \n     Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate passage \nof legislation I have sponsored to award the Congressional Gold Medal \nto The Right Honorable Tony Charles Lynton Blair, Prime Minister of \nGreat Britain, First Lord of the Treasury and Minister for the Civil \nService.\n  The rules of Congress require that the recipient of a Congressional \nGold Medal ``shall have performed an achievement that has an impact on \nAmerican history and culture that is likely to be recognized as a major \nachievement in the recipient's field long after the achievement.''\n  Indeed, Prime Minister Tony Blair has done just that.\n  In the more than a year and a half since the tragic attacks of \nSeptember 11th the United States has been thankful for the \ndemonstration of solidarity from nations across the world. But, Tony \nBlair and the people of Great Britain deserve special recognition for \ntheir steadfast resolve in all of the challenges our nations have faced \nin the war against terror. Together, we have determined that ridding \nthe world of terrorism and the regimes that support them and encourage \nthem, is in the best interests of all of the nations of the world.\n  For years, our nations have been close allies, and our allegiance to \neach other has been demonstrated time after time when our men and women \nhave joined together to defeat a mutual threat. However, since the \nattacks of September 11, 2001, we have rediscovered the closeness in \nour relations just as tragedy brings families closer together. Let us \nkeep the British troops and the families who have lost loved ones in \nour prayers as we pray for our own armed forces and families.\n  In the 18th century, English philosopher Edmund Burke said, ``The \nonly thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do \nnothing.''\n  It is clear that Prime Minister Blair and the people of Great Britain \nunderstands the truth in these words, and that strong leaders often \nhold lonely positions when they forgo the politically expedient.\n  Prime Minister Blair took a courageous and principled stand before \nthe world during a time that must have been politically lonely, and \nsome might even say risky. But he stood strong for what was right and \nfor what was just. And for that, he deserves nothing less than our \nhighest accolades.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 709) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 709\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDING.\n\n       Congress finds that Prime Minister Tony Blair of the United \n     Kingdom has clearly demonstrated, during a very trying and \n     historic time for our 2 countries, that he is a staunch and \n     steadfast ally of the United States of America.\n\n     SEC. 2.
