Several \nSenators spoke on that issue yesterday, and I hope that on both sides \nwe will be able to yield back a lot of that time and complete this bill \nat an early hour today. We will stack the vote in relation to the FSC/\nETI amendment for later this afternoon, possibly with a vote on passage \nof the Australia free-trade measure. The timing for those votes will be \ndiscussed and we will let our colleagues know a little bit later this \nmorning.\n  Senators should therefore expect votes later this afternoon, those \ntwo votes for sure.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/15/senate-section/article/S8141-7", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, farming, ranching, and agriculture and \nagri-related businesses continue to play a\n\n[[Page S8142]]\n\nvital role in our economy. Food and fiber jobs account for 16 percent \nof our total workforce. Agriculture makes up 12 percent of our gross \ndomestic product, and 9 percent of our trade exports. In fact, we have \na $10 billion positive balance on agricultural trade, in sharp contrast \nto our overall $490 billion trade deficit.\n  In many States, like my home State of South Dakota, agriculture is \nthe number one industry. Communities rely heavily upon the agricultural \neconomy. Many rely almost solely upon it. That is why, as the national \nspotlight focuses on rural America, it is so important to ask: Are we \ndoing right by rural America? Are we doing all we can to ensure that \nthe deep heritage in our Nation's rural way of life remains not only \nviable, but strong and vibrant?\n  Unfortunately, over the past 4 years, our Government has not done \nright by rural America. It has not provided the fair policies that our \nfamily farmers, ranchers, and rural business people deserve. And while \nI am sure rural residents appreciate the attention their communities \nhave received this campaign season, short snippets on the evening news \ndo not do justice to the serious challenges they are facing.\n  Per capita income for rural residents is less than 70 percent of that \nfor urban residents, and rural workers are roughly twice as likely as \nurban workers to earn only the minimum wage. Rural workers also have \nhigher rates of underemployment, and they have less prospects for \nimproving their employment situation in the future.\n  Ninety-five percent of the poorest counties in the country are \nlocated in rural areas--95 percent. The poverty rates in many parts of \nrural America are worse than in countries we often consider to be \n``developing.''\n  Of the many intractable pockets of poverty in rural America, several \nare on Native American reservations. One of those pockets is on the \nPine Ridge Indian Reservation in my home State of South Dakota. \nPresident Clinton called Pine Ridge, ``Ground Zero of poverty.'' Places \nlike Pine Ridge have a severe lack of basic infrastructure, of roads \nand bridges; of water and waste systems; of housing and public \nutilities, all of which lead to a lack of opportunity for businesses \nand job creation.\n  I have said it before, and will say it again: This is a quiet \nnational crisis that we must address. Today, I would like to talk about \njust a few of the specific issues confronting rural America, and how we \ncan do better.\n  At this time last year, Mother nature was a little kinder than the \nprevious year to farmers and ranchers across much of the Nation, \nincluding the Great Plains and much of the Midwest. Producers took time \nto rebuild cattle herds and grow new crops lost by the historic drought \nof 2002. That drought, by the way, was the worst drought since the Dust \nBowl days of 1936. It was a horrible and devastating drought that cried \nout for Federal assistance, but rural America received very little help \nfrom the Bush administration.\n\n  Unfortunately, this year, farmers and ranchers are dealing with new \nweather-related natural disasters. We have pockets of drought in South \nDakota. There has been extreme flooding in many areas--including South \nDakota and our northern neighbor, North Dakota.\n  In April, even before we knew that many areas of my State would be \nimpacted by weather-related disaster this year, I wrote to President \nBush and urged him to change his long-standing opposition to \nsupplemental disaster aid for farmers and ranchers. The national \npolicies regarding weather-related natural disasters are--by any \nlegitimate standard--failing to address the concerns of farmers and \nranchers. That is why dozens of national farm, ranch, and rural-related \norganizations supported my disaster amendment in 2002.\n  I had hoped the President would take a fresh look at what could be \ndone to put in place some more adequate, and permanent, disaster-\nrelated assistance policies. I suggested that he establish an inter-\nagency working group to provide a legislative proposal that the \nadministration would send to Capitol Hill.\n  Many of us pledged to work, in a bipartisan fashion, to move such a \nthoughtful package forward. I wanted to see if there was a way to work \nwith the President to ensure that farmers and ranchers are treated more \nlike victims of other natural disasters, such as tornadoes or \nhurricanes. I was hopeful the President would respond favorably to my \nrequest by working in a bipartisan fashion to craft thoughtful disaster \nassistance that more adequately provides what is needed in rural \nStates.\n  In mid-July, I received a response to my letter. I can't express how \ndisappointed I was that the letter made no mention whatsoever--none--\nabout my request for a legislative proposal. In essence, the letter was \na mere regurgitation of the insufficient steps that the Agriculture \nDepartment had taken under existing authorities.\n  I am sorry to report that as long as the Bush administration is \naround, it appears that we will be at a stalemate on disaster \nassistance. I believe if we want to do right by America, we must \nfulfill our obligations as Federal officials and respond to the \nlegitimate disaster-related needs of all Americans. The Bush \nadministration doesn't agree. They oppose disaster aid, pure and \nsimple. That is unfortunate.\n  We have also spoken many times on the floor about the need to move \nenergy policy forward. Doing right by America means taking care of our \npeople here at home, and that means investing in renewable fuels such \nas ethanol, wind, and biomass. There is overwhelming support for the \nrenewable fuels standard which would double the use of ethanol over the \nnext 10 years. The RFS would increase corn prices by as much as 50 \ncents per bushel, create 214,000 new jobs throughout the economy, and \nreduce our dependence on Middle Eastern oil supplies, saving the \ncountry at least $4 billion annually in imported oil.\n  Unfortunately, the RFS has been held hostage by a select group of \nHouse leaders who are insisting on special interest protection for \ngroundwater polluters. The President has been unwilling to tell these \nHouse leaders to back off, and as a result, this important bipartisan \nethanol legislation has been stalled in Congress for over 7 months.\n  It is time for the President to show some leadership and choose rural \ncommunities and American consumers over special interests.\n  In American today, meatpackers control roughly 80 percent of the beef \nmarket. They have been establishing what many consider a dangerous \nmonopoly, allowing them to manipulate markets. But the Bush \nadministration has opposed doing anything about what many think are \nglaring problems with concentration in the meatpacking industry.\n  For example, instead of helping our farmers and ranchers, the \nadministration opposed the ban on packer ownership that the Senate \napproved as part of the 2002 farm bill. They insisted that the \nprovision be removed from the bill, essentially holding the farm bill \nhostage until the provision was removed.\n  But that is not all. As we are now seeing through the Australia Free \nTrade Agreement, the administration has decided to promote \ninternational trade policies that will penalize our independent beef \nproducers.\n  Cattle prices have dropped $30 and $40 per hundredweight in the last \nyear, and the Bush administration proposes a trade agreement that will, \nover time, depress our cattle and beef markets and increase unfair \ncompetition.\n  Coupled with the issues of concentration and discriminatory trade \nagreements is the ongoing concern about how the Bush administration has \naddressed Canadian border issues in the wake of the mad cow scare. Last \nAugust, the Secretary of Agriculture announced a lifting of the ban on \ncertain Canadian beef products but said that before anything further \nwas done, there would be a public rulemaking.\n  That did not happen. Only as a result of a lawsuit--yes, there had to \nbe a lawsuit--USDA was forced to reverse their policies, policies that \nappear to have benefited the Canadians and select meatpackers who had \nprivate knowledge about special permits granted under reduced food \nsafety standards. All the while, the American public was kept in the \ndark.\n  That may sound unbelievable to some. And I don't claim to know all of \nthe facts, which is why several of us asked for an oversight hearing on \nthe matter and for the Department's Inspector General to conduct a \nthorough investigation.\n\n[[Page S8143]]\n\n  I am pleased that the IG has agreed to look into the matter. Trust in \ngovernment is very important. I am hopeful that the investigation, and \nan oversight hearing, will shed some light on what happened at USDA, \nand pave the way for more effective and transparent policymaking under \nthis administration's watch. I don't think anyone would dispute that we \nare not doing right by rural America when we hide things and provide \nspecial treatment for large corporations. One thing we can do here in \nthe Congress to help ranchers is to take up my bill to reinstate the \ndate adopted in the 2002 farm bill for implementation of country-of-\norigin labeling.\n  I have asked the majority leader to allow us to consider this \nlegislation, but as I have mentioned, there appears to be another \nagenda at work in the Senate.\n  To refresh memories on the labeling law, which we call ``COOL,'' the \npurpose of the provision was simply to allow for certain fruits, meats, \nand vegetables to be labeled with their country of origin.\n  it was a way to add value to our domestic products by offering \nAmerican consumers and others around the world a choice about the food \nthey feed their families. Polls show that Americans, in particular, \nwant to ``Buy American.'' But when it comes to food, they don't have \nthat choice. Labels tell us where the clothes we put on our bodies come \nfrom, but not where the food we put in our bodies comes from.\n  To fix this discrepancy, Congress passed COOL in 2002, despite the \nBush administration's opposition--opposition that reflected the \nposition of the large meatpackers who said they didn't want the labels \nbecause it might add a few pennies to the cost of doing business. Never \nmind that consumers say, by a large majority, that they are willing to \npay a few cents more to have this information.\n  Notwithstanding Congress's clear decision to implement labeling, the \nadministration and the meatpackers wouldn't give up. In the middle of \nthe night in January, in a meeting that was closed to Democrats, Bush \nadministration officials and the majority leadership added a small \nprovision to the Omnibus Appropriations bill to delay the labeling law \nuntil 2006--essentially paving the way to killing this important \nconsumer information tool.\n  People ask me all the time, Why do you object to going to conference? \nWhy can't you go to conference on these bills and allow the process to \nwork?\n  I have to say that it is exactly situations like this that \ndemonstrate how things don't work in Congress sometimes. That is why, \nonce again, the agreement that we reached last night on the so-called \nFSC bill was critical in ensuring adequate confidence and participation \non the part of Democrats as we go into yet another very important \nconference.\n  Are we doing right by America when we allow the Bush administration \nand a few in leadership to override the clear majority of the House and \nSenate? After all, both the House and Senate passed COOL with \nbipartisan votes.\n  Are we doing right by America when we allow these sorts of back-room \ndeals? We are not--clearly.\n  Another topic I want to discuss for just a minute is conservation.\n  I believe that we have the best farmers in the world. I also believe \nthat farmers are the true American conservationists. They work the land \nthey love and they take care of the land. They are the best stewards \nthat we could hope for.\n   But, as a Nation, we value conservation to such an extent--and this \nis a testament to the character of the American people--we value \nconservation to such an extent that we have supported programs to \nencourage farmers and ranchers and rural residents to do even more than \nthey already do to protect wetlands and to preserve grassland and other \nnatural areas.\n   Programs such as the Conservation Reserve Program, the new \nGrasslands Reserve Program, the Environmental Quality Incentives \nProgram, and the Conservation Security Program championed by Senator \nHarkin all reflect a tremendous and important commitment to \nconservation. In fact, I have said that the 2002 farm bill was the \n``greenest'' farm bill ever. Many of us remain extremely proud of those \nefforts.\n  But administration officials found a way to reallocate critical \nconservation funds away from many of these important programs. They \nhave, by their actions, failed to allow government to follow through on \nthe promises we made to the American people in 2002.\n  The Bush administration's approach doesn't recognize the important \nweight that Americans place on conservation--on protecting our natural \nresources.\n  It is also out of step with what Congress and the American people \nwant and expect from a farm bill that was supported by a wide \nbipartisan majority only 2 short years ago.\n  These are only a few examples of the deficient rural policies that \nfail to address the very troubling figures I discussed earlier.\n   If we ask, Are we doing right by rural America? The answer is \nclearly no.\n   In the future, I will discuss other issues that impact rural \nAmerica. But on these critical issues--disaster aid; energy policy; \nlivestock, trade and conservation issues--on all of these matters, the \nanswer is that we need a change.\n   The Bush administration is not doing right by American farmers, \nranchers, rural residents, or the communities in which they live.\n   We can, and we should, do better. And I am optimistic about the \nfuture of rural America because I believe we will do better.\n   In the coming months, rural America will get a chance to learn more \nabout those who have a positive vision for the future; those who \nunderstand that rural residents should not be taken for granted; and \nthose who know that they have an obligation to provide serious \nleadership and strive to make progress.\n   Together, I am confident we will make that progress.\n   I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/15/senate-section/article/S8143-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8143-S8144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of the minority leader, we \ndesignate our time to Senator Kohl, 5 minutes; Senator Dorgan, 5 \nminutes; Senator Conrad, 5 minutes; and Senator Cantwell, 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to address an issue \nof serious concern to families across the United States--the continued \nhigh cost of gasoline. Over the last few years, spring has always meant \ngas price spikes to southeastern Wisconsin. This year, that trend has \ngone nationwide, with consumers and businesses from coast to coast \nexperiencing gas prices of over $2 a gallon.\n  The current average price for a gallon of gas is $1.89, up 40 cents \nover last year. That means that a family owning one car can expect to \nspend an additional $286 this year on gas over last year. If a family \nhas more than one car, then they are looking at almost an additional \n$600. With job losses plaguing the manufacturing sector and stagnant \nwages for those who have been lucky enough to keep their jobs, that \nkind of increase in the cost of transportation is a serious problem.\n  And it is not only families who are feeling the pinch of high gas \nprices. Wal-Mart, the country's biggest retailer, has expressed concern \nthat these higher fuel prices will result in lower sales--and in fact, \nthe Commerce Department reported yesterday that retail sales saw their \nlargest drop in 16 months. Our economy's health is dependent on \nconsumer spending. If consumers are buying less because of high \ntransportation costs, the family van will not be the only thing out of \ngas; our nascent economic recovery will also stall.\n  Much of the gas money squeezed out of our economy heads to OPEC \ncountries, the result of their blatant price fixing. To address that, \nSenator DeWine and I have introduced the ``No Oil Producing and \nExporting Cartels Act'' or NOPEC. NOPEC will, for the first time, \nestablish clearly and plainly that when a group such as the OPEC \nnations act together to restrict supply or set prices, they are \nviolating U.S. law. The bill will not authorize private lawsuits, but \nit will allow the Attorney General or the FTC to file suit under the \nantitrust laws for redress. Our bill will also make plain that the \nnations\n\n[[Page S8144]]\n\nof OPEC cannot hide behind the doctrines of ``Sovereign Immunity'' or \n``Act of State'' to escape the reach of American justice. This \nlegislation would be a powerful tool to combat the illegal price fixing \nbehavior of OPEC, behavior that would be severely prosecuted if it \nhappened inside the U.S. or was carried out by U.S. companies.\n  Although OPEC is a big part of the problem of high gas prices, the \nlack of refining capacity across the country also contributes. Every \nday our economy demands almost nine million barrels of gasoline to keep \nthe marketplace moving, but we lack enough oil refining capacity to \nmeet the demand. Refineries are operating at 95 percent of capacity--\nand so we are forced to import 1 million barrels of refined gasoline a \nday.\n  The antitrust subcommittee on which I am the ranking member has \nlooked into the issue of whether insufficient refining capacity is a \nmanufactured crisis designed to raise prices by reducing the supply of \nrefined product. No new refineries have been built in this country for \n25 years, while scores have been closed. Some believe that this has \nallowed the remaining refiners to keep gasoline prices abnormally high. \nWe are going to have to be vigilant if we are to keep the short supply \nof refineries from allowing another Enron-like gouging of consumers.\n  Indeed, I was gratified by the news last week that the FTC had begun \na formal investigation into Shell's plans to close an important \nrefinery in Bakersfield, CA, a refinery that produces 70,000 barrels of \ngasoline a day. Should the FTC conclude that the closure of this \nrefinery results from efforts by Shell to control supply and raise \nprices, it must pursue all legal measures to protect consumers. The FTC \nmust be tougher on all mergers in the oil and gas industry and act \nquickly and decisively to prevent oil companies from manipulating \nsupply and prices. And Congress has important oversight \nresponsibilities to make sure the FTC uses the powers we have given \nthem.\n  The high price of gas is an issue that affects everyone, but to those \non the bottom of the economic ladder it can be devastating. It is a \nserious problem when--because of the cost of gas--getting to work, \nfinding a new job, or visiting the grocery store or the doctor become a \nluxury out of the reach of working families. It is a serious problem \nthat we need to address seriously--and there are simple steps, like \nsome I have outlined today, that we can take this year. We can and \nshould act--not sit on our hands while working families again reach for \nthe bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/15/senate-section/article/S8144-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8144-S8145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        STANDING FOR AGRICULTURE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague from South Dakota described \nthe circumstances on the family farms and ranches in this country and \nwhy folks who are out there living on the land trying to grow a crop \nand raise some animals wonder whether the Government is on their side, \nwonder what is happening here in Washington, DC, with this \nadministration and this Department of Agriculture, and why they won't \nstand up for their interests.\n  My colleague described many circumstances. Let me describe at least \none. I am going to talk later today about the United States-Australia \nFree Trade Agreement, so-called, that I think undermines once again our \nagricultural interests.\n  Let me describe one example of this administration again deciding we \nare not going to stand for farmers and ranchers. It deals with China. \nIt deals with wheat. An official from the U.S. Trade Ambassador's \noffice in the last week in which he served in the Government gave a \nspeech. He said the recommendation was that inside the administration \nthey take action against China because China has been unfair in its \ndecisions on trade with respect to U.S. agriculture.\n  If I can interpret that, we have farmers and ranchers who are trying \nto make a living, who are trying to raise some products and move them \naround the world and the Chinese, with whom we have a very large trade \ndeficit--the largest in human history--have decided they are not going \nto play fair with us.\n  What is the result of a recommendation inside this administration to \ntake action against China because China is not playing fair with \nrespect to our ability to sell wheat to China? They say we are not \ngoing to take action against China because that would upset the \nChinese. What do you think it does to farmers and ranchers out there \nwho are trying to make a decent living?\n\n  About a week ago, I was out on a ranch in North Dakota, owned by the \nEbers. They are out there by themselves. They are not a big \nconglomerate or a big corporation, only themselves. They run some \ncattle. They run a ranch, try to do a good job and try to make an \nincome at the end of the year. I asked them, Where do you buy your \ngroceries? It is an hour and a half away to go buy groceries. They are \nway out in the country.\n  You would expect and they would expect their Government would at \nleast stand up for them when it comes to fairness with respect to trade \nagreements, whether it is CAFTA, or U.S.-Australia, or NAFTA, or the \nbilateral with China. Nobody is willing to stand for them.\n  This administration says with respect to China that we know the \nChinese Government made commitments. We know the Chinese Government was \nsupposed to do certain things and has not done them with respect to \nagriculture, but we are not going to do anything about it.\n  March 17 of last year is when a U.S. Trade Ambassador's official in \nthe USTR office told a wheat industry meeting here in Washington, DC, \nthat the USTR should file a case against China at the World Trade \nOrganization in response to the failure of the Chinese to keep their \ncommitments. He was leaving the USTR and going to another agency. \nFinally, somebody was candid about what was happening inside the \nadministration.\n  This official expressed his frustration with the Chinese Government. \nHe noted that Chinese officials have never disagreed with U.S. \ntechnical criticism of how China has been administering these so-called \ntariff rate quotas. He said the Chinese only make the political \nargument: You have to understand China. China is a special case, they \nsay.\n  So this fellow said publicly that the trade policy review group in \nthis interagency process in the Bush administration has given the U.S. \nTrade Ambassador's office the green light to move forward with a WTO \ncase against China. That means in English that China is being unfair to \nour farmers and ranchers. So the technical folks said clearly we ought \nto take action against them. But he noted that many in the \nadministration decided we can't do that; that would be an ``in your \nface'' action with respect to the Chinese.\n  Right after this official made these candid remarks, the \nadministration disavowed those comments saying: No, no, he was not \nspeaking for the administration. Of course he was. He made a very big \nmistake. He told the truth. He was candid.\n  My colleague from South Dakota asked the question: Why will they not \nstand up for the interests of farmers and ranchers? These are the \nbedrock entrepreneurs of our country who live on the land and try to do \na good job and make a decent living. They expect their government to \nstand for them, to be on their side, to help them.\n  When they are confronted with an unfairness--and the example here is \nwith respect to the Chinese who are mistreating our farmers and \nranchers in international trade--they expect their government to stand \nfor them. This administration, this trade ambassador, this trade policy \nfrom this administration fails to do so. It is a shame.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, in this discussion of farm policy and \npolicy toward the rural parts of the country, I looked at the \nPresident's Web site for his campaign. It says, ``President Bush \nunderstands that America's farmers are the heart and soul of this \ncountry. That is why he has worked so hard to help protect the rural \nway of life. He has proven his commitment to rural America time and \ntime again. He pushed for and signed the 2002 farm bill.''\n  I was one of the negotiators of the farm bill representing the Senate \nin\n\n[[Page S8145]]\n\nthe conference committee with the House. We spent well over 100 hours \nin negotiation. To say the President's assertion that he ``pushed for'' \nthe farm bill is within hailing distance of the truth is to totally \nrewrite history.\n  Those who were involved in writing the farm bill have quite a \ndifferent recollection of the history of that period than the President \nnow portrays it. Let's go back to the time when we were negotiating the \nfarm bill and see what the administration said then and see if it \nstacks up to the claim he is making now that he pushed for the new farm \nbill.\n  When the House of Representatives was working on the farm bill, on \nOctober 3, 2001, the President put out this Statement of Administration \nPolicy:\n\n       [T]he Administration does not support H.R. 2646 and urges \n     the House of Representatives to defer action on the bill.\n\n  Does that sound like pushing for the bill? Or is that pushing for \ndelay of the bill?\n  Then the statement of administration policy said:\n\n       [N]ow is not the appropriate time for consideration of this \n     bill.\n\n  And\n\n       More time is needed for the fiscal picture to clear.\n\n  Then the administration said:\n\n       The Administration believes that acting now on the \n     significant fiscal and policy commitments of H.R. 2646 would \n     be premature.\n\n  Does that sound like they were pushing for the farm bill, or were \nthey pushing for delay of the farm bill?\n  Then when the Senate turned to the farm bill, the administration put \nout another Statement of Administration Policy. This is what they said:\n\n       The Administration believes it is unwise, in this time of \n     uncertain and changing federal resources and priorities, to \n     enact policies that create unknown and potentially huge \n     future demands on taxpayers.\n\n  Was that pushing for the farm bill? Or was that pushing for delay of \nthe farm bill?\n  The President now claims he was pushing for the farm bill. The truth \nis, he was pushing for delay. He was pushing for deferment. He was \npushing to wait.\n  What would have happened had we followed that advice? What would have \nhappened?\n  First, the money that had been set aside in the budget for the farm \nbill would have run out. Then with the deteriorating fiscal condition \nof the Federal Government, resources for a new farm bill would have \nevaporated. In addition, a new estimate was about to come out about the \ncost of a farm bill that would have increased the cost and made it \nimpossible to write the farm bill that was written.\n  For those who are concerned about taxpayers, they should understand, \nthe farm bill that was written has thus far cost significantly less \nthan projected. That almost never happens around here. The farm bill \nwas projected to cost $18 billion this year alone. Instead, it will \ncost $14 billion, dramatically less than forecast.\n  But it is not just that savings. The even larger savings is to \ncompare the current policy with the previous policy. If we make that \ncomparison, we find the savings under this farm bill are even more \ndramatic, a huge reduction in expenditure, and yet this is a much more \nfavorable piece of farm legislation for which the President now says he \npushed. But at the time what he was pushing, he was pushing for delay. \nThe fact is, delay would have killed the farm bill.\n  I remember working feverishly to convince my colleagues to move \nahead, telling them that from my position on the Budget Committee I \ncould see where this was all headed. If we had followed the Secretary \nof Agriculture's advice in this administration, we would have waited \nand waited and waited and the opportunity would have been lost.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/15/senate-section/article/S8145-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8145-S8148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ENERGY RELIABILITY\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise this morning to talk about our \nlegislative priorities, and something I think this body needs to \naddress before we adjourn next week. It is the issue of the reliability \nstandards for our electricity grid and the fact that I think we are \nstill putting the grid in jeopardy by not adopting reliability \nstandards.\n  Even Enron activities in California, by its own admissions, \njeopardized the reliability of the western electricity grid. That is \ncertainly unacceptable. We need to have in place rules that explicitly \nban market manipulation and rules that make reliability standards \nmandatory and enforceable.\n  In the documentation that has now been acquired through the Enron \ntask force, federal agencies and organizations such as the Snohomish \nCounty Public Utility District, which is trying to get out of lawsuits \nand manipulated contracts that Enron is pursuing against it, it became \nclear that Enron continued to manipulate the market until its \nbankruptcy. Even in one scheme, called Get Shorty, Enron discussed in \ndetail, and I quote from their comments and documents:\n\n       This [Get Shorty] is obviously a sensitive issue because of \n     reliability concerns. It would be difficult to justify our \n     position if the lights go out because ancillary services were \n     not available. The reason these services were not available \n     is because we were selling them without actually having them \n     in the first place.\n\n  In the Enron documentation and memos shared among various employees \nin the company about ways to scheme and make more money, they very well \nknew they were manipulating the market. They did not have these \nservices, but sold them anyway at a higher cost, and thereby \njeopardizing reliability.\n  Another summer is upon us and we have yet to take action on \nlegislation that would move us forward in ensuring the integrity of the \nelectricity grid by protecting consumers from these market manipulation \nschemes and putting regulatory standards in place for reliability.\n  Next month, in fact, will mark the first anniversary of the blackout \nin the Northeast and the Midwest that caused basically 50 million \nconsumers and businesses in the Northeast and Midwest to lose power. In \nsome cases that power was lost up to 4 days.\n  That blackout could have been avoided. When you think about not just \nthe inconvenience to consumers but the fact it cost our economy $4 to \n$10 billion as a loss of economic activity, it is outrageous we are not \nstepping up and passing electricity reliability standards legislation \nas a stand-alone bill before we recess for the summer.\n  We know why the blackout occurred. A few months ago, in April, the \nU.S.-Canadian power system outage task force issued a report and the \nDepartment of Energy, together with the Canadian counterpart, convened \na panel of experts that concluded this was something we could avoid if \nwe put reliability standards in place. In fact, the No. 1 \nrecommendation of that task force, which was reported to various \nMembers of Congress and various committees, is to ``make reliability \nstandards mandatory and enforceable, with penalties for non-\ncompliance.''\n  That was the No. 1 recommendation out of that task force that \ninvestigated what happened in the Northeast and what happened in the \nMidwest.\n  So the question is, Why are we not passing reliability legislation \nbefore we adjourn, to make sure there are mandatory enforceable rules \nin place? After the task force's 7-month investigation was complete, \nCongress has been given an opportunity, many times on the floor, to \npass reliability standards. Yet we have not done that. I think some of \nmy colleagues are trying to get a larger energy bill passed first. \nThere are many aspects of the comprehensive Energy bill this Senator \nwould support and many I would not. But I guarantee you this, when this \nelectricity reliability standards bill comes to the floor and is voted \non, it will have unanimous support.\n  So the question is, why we are not peeling off something as important \nas reliability standards as we approach the summer's hottest months, to \nmake sure businesses and utilities know they will have electricity \nsupply and blackouts will not occur. What if the lights go out again \nthis summer? What if they go out in August? God forbid they go out in \nSeptember as many of my colleagues will be in New York doing their \nbusiness and having meetings.\n  We know various Western States now, such as in Arizona, are putting \nin place programs to reduce demand because they have concerns. In a \nBusinessWeek article, FERC Chairman\n\n[[Page S8146]]\n\nPat Wood basically described the summer as ``a rosary bead summer'' in \nCalifornia because he has concerns that region is going to have some \nclose calls.\n  We also know, according to the North American Electric Reliability \nCouncil's own Reliability Assessment for 2004, New York City ``might be \nsusceptible to reliability problems'' again this summer.\n  So folks across the country could be affected by the cascading \noutages that happen to them or in nearby areas. In the words of Michael \nGent, who is the president of the North American Electric Reliability \nCouncil:\n\n       Whether legislation is adopted on a stand-alone basis or as \n     part of a comprehensive energy bill, passage is essential. If \n     reliability legislation had been enacted when first proposed, \n     I believe that the blackout would not have occurred.\n\n  Why is that? Because right now, while consumers may think there are \nstandards by which supply needs to be on the grid and reliability \nmaintained, there are actually no mandatory rules. What happened in the \nMidwest and in New York was the fact that people did not have the \nsupply available at a time that the demand was really there, or the \ntransmission available to move the power. So consumers were caught in \nthe dark--many senior citizens, individuals in hospitals. A whole \nvariety of things occurred that were very unfortunate circumstances.\n  Now, we in the Northwest know this situation all too well. It was \nactually my predecessor, Senator Gorton, who first proposed this \nlegislation and actually passed it out of this body, and then it \nlanguished in the House of Representatives. We waited again in 2002 and \n2003 to get this legislation moved forward through the process. So I \nthink it is critically important before this body adjourns next week \nthat we pass the reliability standards legislation and implement it.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2236\n\n  So, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now turn \nto Calendar No. 465, S. 2236, a bill to enhance the reliability of the \nelectric system; that the bill be read a third time and passed, and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid on the table, without any intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, reserving the right to object, we have had \nan energy bill pending that has been filibustered by our colleagues on \nthe other side. We are not in a position where one Senator, \nunfortunately, can pass a bill. There may be many bills I would like to \npass. We do not pass bills in this manner. We should get on with \npassing an energy bill. And, therefore, I object.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I hope my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle will reconsider their position because we are not, in the \nnext 5 to 6 days of legislative action, going to get a comprehensive \nenergy bill. But we can get an energy reliability standards bill passed \nand put in place, and send a message sent to electricity providers \nacross the country that there are going to be reliability rules and \nstandards in place.\n  We cannot continue to hold hostage good energy reliability \nlegislation for a comprehensive bill when consumers are at risk. We \ncannot continue to deny the reports across the country that more \nblackouts are coming. We need to act.\n  Now, Madam President, I would like to take a few minutes to expand on \nsome of the other news and events that relate to this energy policy.\n  As my colleague mentioned an energy bill, I certainly would like to \nget an energy bill that did something to prevent market manipulation, \nor even just a stand-alone bill that would prevent market manipulation. \nWe in the West have been astounded by the lack of response by the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission to the news and information about \nmarkets being manipulated.\n  I do not mean there is speculation about manipulation; I mean there \nare documents that have now been uncovered through organizations such \nas Snohomish County PUD; they are actually signed documents by various \nday traders at the Enron Trading Portland office that showed exactly \nhow the trading schemes worked. While those utilities harmed will \ncontinue to pursue their case legally, it is absurd that the Federal \nenergy regulators who are supposed to do their job in protecting \nconsumers are failing to do anything. Basically they are the policemen \non the watch and they are letting the crime continue to be committed.\n  When I say ``continue to be committed,'' I would like to submit for \nthe record an article that was recently published that shows the \nchances that these schemes might still be continuing in the State of \nTexas. The Texas Public Utilities Commission has an ongoing \ninvestigation, and there are a couple of companies down there that are \nactually pursuing this case. Some of the same Enron traders who were \ninvolved in the Portland office in these schemes have now moved on to \nother companies. CBS and others now have audiotapes showing that some \nof these Texas power giants might still be manipulating the market in \nthe same ways that Enron did. So the question is, When are we going to \nstand up and do something about this?\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article \nentitled ``Accusation: Trader Recordings Show TXU Schemed to Spike \nPower Prices.''\n   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      [From CBS-11, July 8, 2004]\n\n  Accusation: Trader Recordings Show TXU Schemed To Spike Power Prices\n\n                   (By Robert Riggs and Todd Bensman)\n\n       Audiotapes allegedly show traders for Texas power giant TXU \n     carrying out illegal market manipulation schemes to spike \n     electricity prices, much as Enron traders now stand accused \n     of doing in California, according to several state \n     competitors who claim the schemes damaged them.\n       CBS-11 obtained 250 hours of previously sealed telephone \n     recordings of TXU trader transactions from Allen-based \n     competitor Texas Commercial Energy. Company executives say \n     the recordings prove TXU cornered Texas's newly deregulated \n     electricity market last year and refused to sell until prices \n     spiked many hundreds of dollars per megawatt hour above \n     normal rates.\n       Officials for TXU, by far the state's largest energy \n     company, deny that its traders ever illegally cornered Texas \n     energy markets or squeezed competitors and said state \n     regulatory investigators cleared the company of any \n     wrongdoing.\n       The recordings of telephone trader transactions surfaced \n     from a Texas Commercial Energy anti-trust lawsuit that \n     claimed illegal market manipulation schemes by TXU drove the \n     nascent energy company into bankruptcy after several cold \n     fronts last year. A judge dismissed Texas Commercial Energy's \n     lawsuit in June on grounds that the court did not have proper \n     jurisdiction.\n       The company says it will appeal for a trial on the actual \n     merits of its allegations.\n       ``Now, the consumers get a chance to hear what their \n     intentions were and how they were being damaged,'' said Steve \n     Ousley, President of Texas Commercial Energy.\n       In one tape reviewed by CBS-11, TXU traders appear to gloat \n     about excessive prices charged to Garland Power & Light.\n       TXU Trader 1: ``They got a little power plant out there. I \n     think they've got 250, 300 (megawatts). And if they're short, \n     you know, they buy it from me sometimes.''\n       TXU Trader 2: ``Is that right?''\n       TXU Trader 1: ``When I, when I bend them over the bench and \n     give it to them (laughter).\n       TXU spokesman Chris Schein dismissed the discussion about \n     the city of Garland as mere ``boasting'' and ``verbosity.''\n       ``It's embarrassing, but there is no factual basis to what \n     he said in terms of taking advantage of that customer,'' \n     Schein said.\n       Texas Commercial Energy and other competitors tell CBS-11 \n     that many other audio recordings prove that TXU imported and \n     then put to use, during several 2003 cold fronts, the kind of \n     market manipulation schemes that have resulted in federal \n     action against traders for Enron, and also the Houston-\n     based Reliant Energy Services, for trading abuses \n     California.\n       In April, the Houston energy company Reliant and four of \n     its officers were indicted in San Francisco on six counts of \n     creating false energy shortages to spike prices.\n       In the course of its investigation of the TXU allegations, \n     CBS-11 News learned that TXU had hired five ex-Enron traders, \n     including one who came under FBI investigation for his \n     previous work in Enron's indictment-plagued Portland, Ore. \n     office and figures prominently in some of the Texas tapes.\n       ``I think Texans should be outraged that they have adopted \n     these Enron-like market manipulation schemes and even hired \n     some of the same people that implemented the schemes out in \n     California,'' Ousley said. ``In Texas, market manipulation is \n     all about the money. At the end of the day the consumers are \n     going to end up paying for the market manipulation.''\n\n[[Page S8147]]\n\n       Until now, TXU has largely escaped the kind of public \n     allegations of illegal market manipulation that has recently \n     bedeviled former Enron traders and Reliant Energy. Last \n     month, the release of the so-called ``Grandma Millie'' tapes \n     of foul-mouthed Enron traders in Portland boasting of illegal \n     trading schemes spurred widespread condemnation and pressure \n     on Congress to investigate other energy companies.\n       Many of the taped TXU trader conversations reviewed by CBS-\n     11 News are infused with jargon and would be difficult for \n     industry outsiders to interpret. Interpretation of the Texas \n     tapes has become central to the emerging controversy over \n     them.\n       TXU's Chris Schein said his firm's interpretation of the \n     tapes is that they show no wrongdoing at all.\n       ``The kinds of shenanigans that you saw in California did \n     not take place in Texas,'' he said. ``And state regulators \n     have been very concerned about that occurring.''\n       Little is known about four of the five former Enron traders \n     who have come to work for TXU, and Schein said affiliation \n     with the scandal-plagued company should not automatically \n     preclude employment at TXU.\n       But a fifth former Enron employee, Holden Salisbury, was \n     hired by TXU from Enron's scandal-plagued Portland office in \n     2002, the company confirms.\n       Those who worked the Enron office remain under an active \n     FBI investigation for market manipulation schemes known \n     euphemistically inside the office as ``Deathstar,'' ``Get \n     Shorty,'' and ``Fatboy,'' California authorities say. Federal \n     prosecutors have indicted and convicted several of \n     Salisbury's former Enron supervisors on charges that they \n     used market manipulation schemes, including Deathstar, to rip \n     off millions from California ratepayers.\n       The 31-year-old Salisbury, who shows up repeatedly in the \n     Texas tape recordings, has not been indicted or accused of \n     any crime. His trading logs from Portland, obtained by CBS-\n     11, indicate that he conducted multiple ``Deathstar'' \n     transactions while working there.\n       In a brief interview with CBS-11 outside his Allen home, \n     Salisbury would not say how he came to work for TXU but \n     insisted he has done nothing wrong as a trader for either \n     Enron or his current employer.\n       ``I don't think I did anything wrong in Portland, and I \n     don't think I have done anything wrong in Dallas,'' he said, \n     declining to talk further without TXU permission.\n       TXU's Schein said the company would not allow Salisbury to \n     talk further and that executives were angry that CBS-11 had \n     tried to interview him at home.\n       Robert McCullough, a former utility executive in the \n     Pacific Northwest, has worked as an expert witness in \n     lawsuits against TXU and Enron. He said he was surprised TXU \n     would hire anyone else from Enron's tainted Portland office.\n       ``We found hundreds, literally hundreds, of documents where \n     the different traders would sign off on specific schemes,'' \n     McCullough said. ``So it's very surprising to us that you \n     would actually want one of those people on your team.''\n       Asked why TXU would hire a trader from Enron's Portland \n     office, Schein said Salisbury had passed a TXU background \n     check. He later indicated the FBI had fully investigated and \n     cleared Salisbury.\n       FBI officials in San Francisco, Ca., however, say the \n     investigation of the personnel in Enron's Portland office was \n     by no means complete and could yet yield additional cases.\n       ``The FBI is in no way vouching for the character of Mr. \n     Salisbury,'' said Special Agent LaRae Quy.\n       Salisbury figures prominently in some of the TXU recordings \n     made during last year's February ice storm in North Texas.\n       Texas Commercial Energy officers and lawyers say the scheme \n     Salisbury and others used involved buying up as much \n     available energy on the open market as bad weather approached \n     and then, cutting TXU's scheduled sales. According to Texas \n     Commercial Energy, TXU traders would then refuse to sell, \n     even lying to customers about ostensible shortages, until \n     average $50 prices per megawatt hour spiked to a rare $1,000 \n     per hour high.\n       In the following days, they say, TXU traders working \n     together maintained tight control over prices, keeping them \n     artificially high, but not so high as to trigger the \n     unwelcome attention of state regulators.\n       Company officials say this 10:12 a.m. conversation on Feb. \n     25, 2003 between Salisbury and buyer Norm Berthusen of Cirro \n     Energy occurred after an extended buying spree by TXU. They \n     say it is but one of many recorded conversations supporting \n     their contention that TXU traders conspired to withhold \n     energy from the market.\n       Holden Salisbury: ``TXU, this is Holden.''\n       Norm Berthusen: ``Hey Holden, Norm Bertheson at Cirro.''\n       Holden Salisbury: ``Yes sir.''\n       Norm Berthusen: ``Anything happening here in some of the \n     short term power?''\n       Holden Salisbury: ``Um, it's not looking too good right \n     now. I don't think I'm going to have anything. . .''\n       Norm Berthusen: ``Where's all the energy going?''\n       Holden Salisbury: ``It's cold man.''\n       Norm Berthusen: ``I mean, it is, but hell, nobody's at \n     work. Very few people. I mean. . .''\n       Holden Salisbury: ``I don't know. . .''\n       Norm Berthusen: ``Strange. . . Strange how we can have \n     56,000 available in the summertime and we can't get 40 \n     together in the wintertime.''\n       Holden Salisbury: ``Yeah. I don't know. I mean there's \n     (power plant) units that are down in the state.''\n       Norm Berthusen: ``What units are down?''\n       Holden Salisbury: ``I don't know, but I know there are some \n     . . . Look I've gotta go man.''\n       Norm Berthusen: ``Alright.''\n       In an interview with CBS-11, Berthusen said he was \n     suspicious that something nefarious was afoot but didn't know \n     for sure until much later.\n       ``I believe as a result of those actions that took place in \n     February 2003 there may be a lot more overview from the \n     (Public Utilities Commission) side of the fence in terms of \n     monitoring some of this activity,'' he said.\n       TXU's spokesman, Chris Schein, said the recording shows no \n     wrongdoing. He said Salisbury's apparent refusal to say which \n     plants were off was in line with federal regulations \n     prohibiting the trader from divulging such protected details.\n       Texas Commercial Energy officials point to recordings a \n     month earlier as further evidence that TXU traders carried \n     strategy of using market dominance to set prices at \n     artifically high levels.\n       Traders Tim Drennan and Jim Dunkin discuss the \n     ``strategy.''\n       Tim Drennan: ``It's sitting at, uh, thirty-five percent . . \n     . uh thirty four point, uh . . . thirty four and a half \n     percent . . . uh forty six bucks, forty five bucks.''\n       Jim Dunkin: ``Yeah.''\n       Tim Drennan: ``So, eh, pretty much right in there where I \n     think you wanted to be.''\n       Jim Dunkin ``Excellent, excellent.''\n       Tim Drennan ``Yeah. No, I agree. I eh, we eh, we're all on \n     board with the, the, eh--with what we're doing here.\n       Jim Dunkin: ``Good.''\n       Later in the same discussion, according to Texas Commercial \n     Energy officials, traders talk about cutting large amounts of \n     scheduled energy deliveries to create an artifical scarcity \n     in the market, thereby driving prices up.\n       Jim Dunkin: ``What are you doing?''\n       Jerry `Doc' Gatty ``I'm pulling my thumb wondering what \n     Tim's gonna do here.''\n       Jim Dunkin: ``Well, cut it.'' (laughter)\n       Jerry `Doc' Gatty: ``We, we've got some big cuts in for \n     nine o'clock, so . . . I'm ready to get to 9 o'clock and get \n     it cutting so I know where I'm going. No, I know where I'm \n     going.''\n       Jim Dunkin: ``To the bottom.''\n       Jerry `Doc' Gatty: ``To the bottom.''\n       Several hours later, according to Texas Commercial Energy \n     officials, prices began to rise sharply to nearly $274, and \n     the traders demonstrate that they have achieved control of \n     prices.\n       Jim Dunkin: ``That's just like yesterday. Everything's \n     goin' just like we planned yesterday, except eh, except eh . \n     . . on the prices. But that's fine. I mean, I don't really \n     want to bump the prices unless we're 40 percent.\n       Tim Drennan: ``I understand . . .  We'll just keep them \n     where they're at here, uh, for the rest of the day, unless \n     we're, uh, unless we're super long. You know, if it gets over \n     40 percent, maybe I'll take em up to over a hundred. But \n     right now . . .''\n       Jim Dunkin: ``You can take them back up over to that . . \n     .''\n       Tim Drennan: ``Okay.''\n       Jim Dunkin: ``. . . if you get up over 40 percent.''\n       Tim Drennan: ``I understand, I understand.''\n       Four hours later, the traders discuss price manipulation \n     strategy for the following day by ``cutting the load,'' or \n     reducing scheduled energy sales, to create the appearance of \n     shortages, according to Texas Commercial Energy officials.\n       Jim Dunkin: ``I'd still go the same strategy tomorrow of \n     having plenty on, but cut the load.''\n       Tim Drennan: ``Hey, cut-cut the load, go short, but just \n     hold the price below 100 bucks.\n       Jim Dunkin: ``Yeah, hold the price below 100 bucks. But I \n     wouldn't roll a hundred bucks until I got the CT.''\n       After some additional discussion about price bidding, \n     Drennan said ``And what we'll do is we'll just . . . we'll \n     pull those prices back and keep it under 100, and I'll pass \n     that on to Chad. And we're going to be fine.''\n       Said Texas Energy Commission Vice President Bill Silliman: \n     ``They've got control over the prices. They only want to \n     double the price, not create a five-fold increase that \n     everyone would notice.''\n       TXU's Schein says the recordings fall far short of proving \n     that anyone at TXU has ever committed a crime or behaved \n     unethically in business. He called the price spikes that \n     occurred last winter ``anomalies'' due to a variety of \n     natural causes and normal market circumstances.\n       ``Those things don't occur, have not occurred in Texas,'' \n     TXU's Schein said. ``All of the market anomalies have been \n     thoroughly investigated and found to have been no wrongful \n     activities.''\n       Schein was referring to a January 2004 staff inquiry into \n     the allegations by the Public Utilities Commission's Market \n     Oversight Division.\n       ``At this point,'' the report concluded, in part, staff \n     ``has found no evidence of widespread, egregious price \n     gouging in the . . . energy market by TXU.''\n       But commission spokesman Terry Hadley conceded that \n     investigators were only able\n\n[[Page S8148]]\n\n     to listen to a tiny fraction of the recordings, very late in \n     their inquiry, before issuing the report in January. And, he \n     said, court-ordered restrictions at the time prevented Texas \n     Commercial Energy attorneys from helping investigators \n     interpret the recordings beforehand. By contrast, TXU did \n     work with investigators before the report was completed, \n     Hadley said.\n       The investigation remains open, he said.\n       ``Obviously, we don't have the resources to listen to \n     everything,'' Hadley said. ``They were considered to the \n     extent that some had been reviewed. With our resources, we're \n     not able to review all the thousands of hours of recordings. \n     But . . . we can continue to review the situation.\n       Robert McCullough, the former utility executive who worked \n     as an expert witness in lawsuits against TXU and Enron, \n     questions whether the utility commission is capable of \n     investigating anything. The number of investigators available \n     to enforce complex deregulation rules, he said, is pitifully \n     small.\n       ``Unfortunately, in Texas, we don't have many police. We \n     have one small office,'' McCullough said. ``I don't doubt \n     that those gentlemen work very hard, but it's like one \n     policeman to patrol Dallas at the moment.\n       ``The budget for the state PUC is $600,000,'' he said. \n     ``That amount of money could be purloined, taken from the \n     consumers in an hour. It's like having the entire budget for \n     the police force for the city of Dallas being the same amount \n     as what's in the till of a Ma and Pa grocery store.''\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. The issue is really before us in the sense that we need \nto continue to push the Federal regulators to do their job, the Federal \nregulators being the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. They have \nfailed to do their job. We had an Enron collapse and scandal in which \nmarkets were manipulated, shareholders were conned, books were cooked, \nand various aspects of this investigation and prosecution are taking \nplace. My hat is tipped to DOJ in their effectiveness in pursuing this \ncase against various Enron employees, including their recent indictment \nof Ken Lay, even though that is a process in which Mr. Lay has his \nopportunity and will have his day in court. But I take great offense to \nMr. Lay's PR campaign in which he goes on television saying that all \nthat happened in California was California's fault, that it was wrong \nfor them because they deregulated without proper supply.\n  Well, I think it is very clear there has been market manipulation as \nshown by the documents that are being provided, and it is a question of \nwhether the Federal regulators are going to do their job.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord an editorial from the Washington Post from this week in which \nthe paper criticized the Federal energy regulators for not doing their \njob. I think that is what we need, more attention to show that those \nFederal regulators have not had the bright light of day shown on them \nand that they are failing to do their job.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 12, 2004]\n\n                             Enron's Legacy\n\n       It has long been clear that ill-starred Enron Corp., whose \n     founder and chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, was indicted \n     last week, deliberately manipulated electricity markets to \n     intensify the California power crisis of 2000-01, forcing \n     electricity prices up across the West. But recently released \n     tapes of conversations between Enron traders have reminded \n     the victims of just how cynical that manipulation really was. \n     ``I want to see what pain and heartache this is going to \n     cause Nevada Power Company,'' gloats a trader on one of the \n     tapes, just before completing a deal. ``I'm still in the mood \n     to screw with people.''\n       The ratepayers of Nevada--and the rest of the West--are \n     right to feel angry about what Enron did and right to feel \n     aggrieved about the billions of dollars they overpaid for \n     electricity as a result. It's hardly surprising that their \n     anger has spread to Congress, particularly during an election \n     year. Rep. Anna G. Eshoo (D-Calif.) recently got the House to \n     pass an amendment to an energy appropriations bill, \n     effectively requiring the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission (FERC) to give the public easier access to Enron \n     documents. Some, including Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) and \n     Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) want the Senate to do the \n     same.\n       But while calling for access to documents lets off \n     political steam, it doesn't address the more fundamental \n     problems with federal energy regulation, as many in Congress \n     know perfectly well.\n       The much larger concern is that FERC's failure to resolve \n     quickly the gaggle of multimillion-dollar lawsuits and \n     regulatory cases filed by public utility commissions across \n     the West has hampered investment and left energy markets in \n     turmoil.\n       The fault is partly FERC's. Each case involves different \n     legal issues, but on the whole, the commission's reaction to \n     them has been slow, overly cautious and narrowly legalistic. \n     At the same time, Congress has refused to heed the \n     regulators' continued pleas for more powers, and particularly \n     for the right to exact the same kinds of civil penalties \n     other regulatory bodies do. Because FERC was set up in a \n     different era, it is a quasi judicial body, with little \n     ability to enforce rules. Its commissioners argue that they \n     have acted according to their interpretation of the law, \n     which among other things does not allow them to invalidate \n     old contracts retroactively. Spokesmen also point out that \n     some of Enron's behavior was ugly but legal, which limits \n     what FERC can do now. Indeed, much of what happened can be \n     attributed to the poor design of California's electricity \n     markets--a design that FERC opposed.\n       Nevertheless, it is becoming clear that FERC's overly \n     cautious approach to the Enron aftermath, the fault of both \n     FERC and Congress, has damaged the regulatory commission's \n     standing and even its ability to oversee market regulation in \n     the future. In California, Nevada, Washington state and \n     elsewhere, the acronym FERC has become a byword for \n     impotence. Its job was to protect consumers, the argument \n     goes; it didn't protect consumers, and it doesn't deserve \n     more powers. Yet the future success of deregulated energy \n     markets depends on the existence of a reliable regulator, \n     with enhanced powers to enforce standard market rules and to \n     penalize companies that fail to comply with reliability \n     requirements or that manipulate markets. It's probably too \n     late to undo all of the damage, but in upcoming cases FERC \n     should take far more seriously the spirit of the law, which \n     was designed to protect consumers, and Congress should \n     quickly act to give FERC the powers it needs to prevent \n     market manipulation.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. The article basically says:\n\n     . . . FERC's overly cautious approach to the Enron aftermath \n     . . . has damaged the regulatory commission's standing and \n     even its ability to oversee market regulation in the future. \n     In California, Nevada, Washington state and elsewhere, the \n     acronym FERC has become a byword for impotence. Its job was \n     to protect consumers, the argument goes; it didn't protect \n     consumers. . . .\n\n  So I think we need to continue to push. In fact, the editorial goes \non to say:\n\n     . . . Congress should quickly act to give FERC the powers it \n     needs. . . .\n\n  We must do our job in continuing to protect consumers from this \nmarket manipulation. When we have evidence now that shows it has taken \nplace, and we cannot get the cop on the beat to investigate, and we now \nhave documentation and suspicion that it may still be going on in other \nparts of the country, Congress needs to do its job.\n  Just as we did with the SEC in passing new accounting rules, we need \nto make sure the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission does its job on \nregulating wholesale power rates, making sure that they are just and \nreasonable and that the manipulation stops.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Collins and Mr. Bond pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 2659 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/15/senate-section/article/S8148-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8148-S8150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IRAQ INTELLIGENCE\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I come to the Senate floor once again this \nweek to talk about the Intelligence Committee report and what we know \nand what we have learned about the intelligence prior to this body \nauthorizing the President to go into Iraq.\n  We have seen over the past year a concerted effort by outside groups, \npartisan attack machines, and even Members of this body going after the \ncredibility and attacking the President and Vice President, sometimes \npersonally. We have seen breathless media coverage of every word of \nthose who profess to be nonpartisan but who prove to be anything but \nnonpartisan.\n  We have seen headlines alleging all types of wrongdoings. We have \nheard accusations of lying and misleading repeated as if they were the \nsimple, obvious truth.\n  Now, after the Senate Intelligence Committee spent a year \npainstakingly reviewing these accusations, attacks, and smears, we can \nset the record straight, while only hoping that the media will devote \nat least some of the same attention to the facts as they did to the \naccusations and unfounded allegations. Yes, we found there were \nsignificant problems with the intelligence\n\n[[Page S8149]]\n\nmechanisms, the lack of human intelligence, the failure to share \ninformation, the wall that had been built between intelligence \nagencies, and that we need to correct with appropriations and \nlegislation. That is what I hope the Intelligence Committee can do. But \nwe also need to correct the outright inaccuracies and political \nattacks.\n  Let's just review an example. First, let me take the interesting \nstory of the initially anonymous former Ambassador, one Joe Wilson. As \nwe point out in the additional views of Chairman Roberts, which Senator \nHatch and I signed, Joe Wilson went on a media blitz with his \nallegations, appearing on more than 30 television shows in order to \ntell anyone and everyone that the President lied to the American people \nand that he was the ``patriot'' who debunked the claim of what he \ncalled in his book ``the 16-word lie.'' Joe Wilson states on the ``John \nKerry for President'' Web site:\n\n       The President misled the Nation in his State of the Union \n     Address.\n\n  Then there was an ABC news story in which ABC said:\n\n       A former Ambassador told ABC news that almost a year before \n     Bush's speech he informed the CIA that the information was \n     not credible. The Ambassador, who asked not to be identified, \n     said the CIA asked him in February 2002 to investigate \n     reports that Iraq was trying to buy uranium from Niger. After \n     spending 8 days in the west-central African nation, the \n     Ambassador said he told the CIA the information about uranium \n     was ``bogus and unrealistic.''\n\n  That is pretty hard hitting.\n  This was a CNN headline:\n\n       Diplomat: U.S. knew Uranium Report Was False.\n\n  Then Joe Wilson did Internet interviews. In one on Buzzflash, he \nsaid:\n\n       I urged the Government to come clean with this story that \n     was patently not true.\n\n  Then he went on Meet the Press and stated that he believed he had \n``effectively debunked the Niger arms uranium sale.''\n  Andrea Mitchell asked him:\n\n       Were they not properly briefed on the fact that you had the \n     previous February been there and that it wasn't true?\n\n  Wilson said:\n\n       No. No. In actual fact, in my judgment, I have not seen the \n     estimate either, but there were reports based upon my trip \n     that were submitted to the appropriate officials. The \n     question was asked of the CIA by the office of the Vice \n     President. The office of the Vice President, I am absolutely \n     convinced, received the very specific response to the \n     question it asked and that response was based upon my trip \n     out there.\n\n  Well, now we have the facts, Madam President. The facts don't square \nwith the claims. We not only have the Senate committee report, but \nyesterday we had Lord Butler's report investigating the intelligence \nobtained by British intelligence services that was shared with the U.S. \nand cited in the President's State of the Union Address. The Butler \nreport states at paragraph 499:\n\n       We conclude that, on the basis of the intelligence \n     estimates at the time, covering both Niger and the Democratic \n     Republic of Congo, the statements on Iraqi attempts to buy \n     uranium from Africa in the Government's dossier, and by the \n     Prime Minister in the House of Commons, were well founded. By \n     extension, we conclude also that the statement in President \n     Bush's State of the Union Address of January 28, 2003, ``The \n     British Government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently \n     sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa,'' was \n     well founded.\n\n  That is what they said after looking at all the evidence. Paragraph \n503 of the Butler report goes into detail and says:\n\n       From our examination of the intelligence and other material \n     on Iraqi attempts to buy uranium from Africa, we have \n     concluded that:\n       A. It is accepted by all parties that Iraqi officials \n     visited Niger in 1999.\n       B. The British Government had intelligence from several \n     different sources indicating that this visit was for the \n     purpose of acquiring uranium. Since uranium constitutes \n     almost three-quarters of Niger's exports, the intelligence \n     was credible.\n       C. The evidence was not conclusive that Iraq actually \n     purchased, as opposed to having sought, uranium and the \n     British Government did not claim this.\n       D. The forged documents were not available to the British \n     Government at the time its assessment was made, and so the \n     fact of the forgery does not undermine it.\n\n  Well, that is the first pitch. Facts 1, Joe Wilson 0.\n  What does the Senate Intelligence Committee say? On page 44 of our \nreport, it says:\n\n       When the former Ambassador spoke to Committee staff, his \n     description of his findings differed from the DO intelligence \n     report and his account of information provided to him by the \n     CIA differed from the CIA official accounts. . . .\n\n     . . . The former Ambassador said he discussed with his CIA \n     contacts which names and signatures should have appeared on \n     any documentation of a legitimate uranium transaction. In \n     fact, the intelligence report made no mention of the alleged \n     Iraq-Niger deal or signatures that should have appeared on \n     any documentation of such a deal.\n\n  Then we went on to page 45:\n\n       The former Ambassador [Wilson] also told Committee staff \n     that he was the source of a Washington Post article (``CIA \n     Did Not Share Doubt on Iraq Data: Bush Used Report of Uranium \n     Bid''), which said, ``Among the Envoy's conclusions was that \n     the documents may have been forged because `the dates were \n     wrong and the names were wrong.' '' Committee staff asked how \n     the former Ambassador could have come to the conclusion that \n     the ``dates were wrong and the names were wrong'' when he had \n     never seen the CIA reports and had no knowledge of what names \n     and dates were in the reports. The former Ambassador [Joe \n     Wilson] said that he may have ``misspoken'' to the reporter \n     when he said he concluded that the documents were \n     ``forged.'' He also said he may have become confused about \n     his own recollection after the International Atomic Energy \n     Agency reported in March 2003 that the names and dates on \n     the documents were not correct and may have thought he had \n     seen the names himself.\n\n  Second pitch: Facts 2, Joe Wilson 0.\n  Joe Wilson said in his book about how he was selected for the trip to \nNiger that his wife ``Valerie had nothing to do with the matter. . . . \nShe definitely had not proposed that I make the trip.\n  A Time Magazine article stated that Wilson ``angrily said his wife \nhad nothing to do with his trip to Africa.'' ``That is bull \n[expletive]. That is absolutely not the case.''\n   Page 39 of our report looks into the facts. Facts can come back to \nbite you when you make all kinds of charges. That conclusion was:\n\n       Interviews and documents provided to the Committee \n     indicated that his wife, a CPD employee, suggested his name \n     for the trip. The CPD reports officer told the Committee \n     staff that the former Ambassador's wife ``offered up his \n     name'' and a memorandum to the Deputy Chief of the CPD on \n     February 12, 2002, from the former Ambassador's wife says, \n     ``My husband has good relations with both the PM and the \n     former Minister of Mines (not to mention lots of French \n     contacts) both of whom could shed light on this sort of \n     activity.''\n\n  The report also states:\n\n       On February 19, 2002, CPD hosted a meeting with the former \n     Ambassador, intelligence analysts from both the CIA and INR, \n     and several individuals from the DO's Africa and CPD \n     divisions. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the \n     merits of the former Ambassador traveling to Niger. An INR \n     analyst's notes indicated that the meeting was ``apparently \n     convened by [the former Ambassador's] wife who had the idea \n     to dispatch [him] to use his contacts to sort out the Iraq-\n     Niger uranium issue.'' The former Ambassador's wife told \n     Committee staff she only attended the meeting to introduce \n     her husband and left after about 3 minutes.\n\n  Third pitch: Facts 3, Wilson 0. Three strikes and you are out--and \nyou should be.\n  Let me add a couple of other things. This is from the additional \nviews of Chairman Roberts. These are findings that the staff made that \nwere not accepted by our Democratic colleagues for inclusion in the \nfinal reports. The former Ambassador's public comments suggested that \nthe Vice President had been briefed, but that is not correct. While the \nCIA responded to the Vice President's request for the agency's \nanalysis, they never provided the information gathered by the former \nAmbassador.\n  The former ambassador, on ``Meet the Press,'' said he was absolutely \nconvinced the Vice President received the specific response based on \nhis trip. The former ambassador was speaking on the basis of what he \nbelieved should have happened based on his Government experience, but \nhe had no knowledge that it did happen.\n  These and other comments from the ambassador about his report \ndebunking the Niger-Iraq uranium story were incorrect and has led to a \ndistortion in the press and the public's understanding of the facts \nsurrounding the Niger-Iraq uranium story.\n  The committee staff found that for most analysts, the former \nambassador's report lent more credibility, not less, to the reported \nNiger-Iraq uranium deal. When we looked into it, not only was the trip \nby Joe Wilson to drink mint tea with his friends in\n\n[[Page S8150]]\n\nNiger not a debunking of the British intelligence that Iraq had sought \nuranium from Africa, but he did include things that suggested that it \nwas even more likely.\n  Why did he go off on such a tangent? In an interview with the \ncommittee staff, Joe Wilson was asked how he knew some of the things he \nwas stating publicly with such confidence. On at least two occasions, \naccording to the committee staff report, he admitted he had no direct \nknowledge to support some of his claims, and that he was drawing on \neither unrelated past experience or no information at all.\n  For example, when he was asked how he knew that the intelligence \ncommunity had rejected the possibility of a Niger uranium deal, as he \nwrote in his book, he told committee staff that his assertion may have \ninvolved ``a little literary flair.''\n  ``A little literary flair,'' when you charge the Vice President of \nlying based on information you had that was insufficient, inaccurate, \nand did not relate to the basic underlying information the British \nGovernment intelligence service provided? I think ``a little literary \nflair'' is not accurate. It is a fraud and a hoax. His statements were \nfraud. They were a hoax.\n  I have talked before about the people who owe some apologies for the \nassertions they have made about the President and Vice President. Let \nme add Joe Wilson as one who owes the Vice President a public apology--\na public apology--for the unfounded, unbased accusations he made with \njust ``a little literary flair.'' I think he owes the Vice President \none, but I guess I will not hold my breath waiting until he provides \nit.\n  Unfortunately, that has been the practice. We have seen too often in \ntoo many places grand charges made and covered in the news media, and \nthe committee goes back and we search and we search and we search to \nfind what were the actual facts.\n  Democratic friends said the administration pressured analysts to \nchange it or they influenced the views of the analysts. Chairman \nRoberts pursued every angle, invited everybody, pursued everyone, over \n200, I think 240 interviews, and we came up with some conclusions.\n  Conclusion No. 83--and this is unanimously agreed to by Republicans \nand Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee:\n\n       The committee did not find any evidence that administration \n     officials attempted to coerce, influence or pressure analysts \n     to change their judgments related to Iraq's weapons of \n     mass destruction capabilities.\n\n  Conclusion 84:\n\n       The committee found no evidence that the Vice President's \n     visits to the Central Intelligence Agency were attempts to \n     pressure analysts, were perceived as intended to pressure \n     analysts by those who participated in the briefings on Iraq's \n     weapons of mass destruction programs, or did pressure \n     analysts to change their assessments.\n\n  I read an op-ed piece by one of my colleagues saying the \nadministration did not do a good enough job of checking up on the \nanalysis by the intelligence agencies. And in another breath, another \none of my colleagues said they asked too many questions.\n  Madam President, let me tell you something I have learned as one new \nto the workings of the intelligence field. A good intelligence analyst \nputs forth his best or her best judgment on what to conclude from the \noften sketchy, incomplete facts they have before them and the reports \nthat have to be evaluated, and they expect to be questioned. They want \nto know that the policymakers who are using that information have the \nbest sense of what they know. And the Vice President, who was \ndiligent--he was doing due diligence--went over and questioned them \ntime and time again. Did he tell them to change their analysis? Did he \ntell them what judgment they wanted? No. What he told them was what the \nintelligence community knew they had to do, and that was to do their \nvery best job to get it right.\n  There has been a lot of criticism of how the intelligence agency \nanalyzed it. But we have lots of good people who work very hard. There \nare structures in place that have kept them from sharing. They did not \nhave the information they needed. But to the best of their ability, \nthey gave the Vice President what they thought was the best analysis.\n  The report also found in conclusion No. 1--most important:\n\n       The committee found no evidence that the IC's--\n\n  Intelligence community's--\n\n     mischaracterizations or exaggeration of the intelligence on \n     Iraq's weapons of mass destruction (WMD) capabilities was the \n     result of political pressure.\n\n  Conclusion No. 11:\n\n       No analyst questioned by the committee stated that the \n     questions were unreasonable, or that they were encouraged by \n     the questioning to alter their conclusions regarding Iraq's \n     link to al-Qaida.\n\n  That is, the link to terrorism.\n  As I said before, all of the charges, all of the outline of the \nDemocrats' secret memo of November 2003 on how they were going to use \nthe Intelligence Committee to attack the President, to influence the \nelection have been debunked.\n  A lot of apologies are owed for the baseless charges that have been \nmade against the President, the Vice President, the Department of \nDefense, and particularly Douglas Feith, who is attempting to serve the \nSecretary of Defense by asking questions and trying to get the best he \ncould out of the intelligence community for the decisionmaking in the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  I hope, I trust--maybe I am gullible, but I trust now we can move \nbeyond this and recognize that the intelligence that the administration \nhad, the same intelligence that this body had when we approved going \ninto Iraq, the same intelligence the world had when they said that \nSaddam Hussein was a bad guy and U.N. Resolution 1441 said that we need \nhim to disarm, that was the best information we had at the time.\n  When we look back on it, we were absolutely dead right to go into \nIraq to depose Saddam Hussein. As David Kay said after he finished, \nIraq was a far more dangerous place than we knew. It had the \ncapability, it had the equipment, it had the scientists ready to turn \nout weapons of mass destruction, chemical and biological, to turn over \nto terrorist groups. Let us hope and pray they were not able to turn \nover any.\n  The world is safer, the Iraqi people are safer, and the United States \nis safer because of the bold leadership of President Bush and Vice \nPresident Cheney and our magnificent men and women in the military who \nare putting their lives at risk in Afghanistan and Iraq. We remember \nthem and thank them in our prayers, and we also offer our best wishes \nand support for the Iraqi people to regain a decent country out of the \nmess that Saddam Hussein left.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign).

Mr. President, on behalf of Chairman Grassley, I call \nup a substitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the substitute.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], for Mr. \n     Grassley, proposes an amendment numbered 3562.\n\n  (The text of the amendment (S. 1637) is printed in the Record of May \n18, 2004.)\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the distinguished majority whip \nleaves the floor, I want to say something. We get things done around \nhere in a number of different ways. One of the ways we get things done \nis we have to trust each other. To be at the point we are on this piece \nof legislation today took a lot of trust.\n  Last night, about 9:30, the floor leaders met right here in the aisle \nand the Senator from Kentucky indicated he wanted to do something \ndifferently. I today extend to him, through the chairman, my \nappreciation. There was a slight misunderstanding, nothing intentional, \nand that is certainly underlined and underscored. We could have had a \nbig puff-up here this morning and had name-calling--You should have \nunderstood, you didn't, it is your fault--but I have to say the Senator \nfrom Kentucky is a man of his word and indicated if there was any \nmisunderstanding he would take care of it. And he did.\n  I want the record to reflect I appreciate that very much. We are now \ngoing to go forward with a very important piece of legislation. But we \ncould not have done that with good will prevailing but for the act of \nthe Senator from Kentucky, for which I, on behalf of the whole Senate, \nextend my appreciation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say to my friend and colleague, \nthe assistant Democratic leader, I do think we had a good discussion \nlast night, and reached an agreement on moving forward with this \nimportant piece of legislation. The minor snafu my friend referred to \nwe were able to work out in short order this morning, and that is the \nway the Senate ought to work.\n  I congratulate him for his important contribution to moving this \nmatter forward as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3563\n\n (Purpose: To protect the public health by providing the Food and Drug \nAdministration with certain authority to regulate tobacco products, to \neliminate the Federal quota and price support programs for tobacco, and \nto provide assistance to quota holders, tobacco producers, and tobacco-\n                         dependent communities)\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk that I \ncall up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine], for himself, Mr. \n     Kennedy, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Hollings, and Mr. Durbin proposes \n     an amendment numbered 3563.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be suspended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am offering the amendment on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Kennedy, Senator McConnell, and Senator Durbin.\n  Mr. President and Members of the Senate, the amendment I offer this \nmorning is a long time coming, but it is an amendment that I think has \nhistoric meaning for this Senate and for this country. It really is two \namendments that we are combining. One is Senator McConnell's bill, the \ntobacco buyout. The other part of the amendment is Senator Kennedy's \nand mine and Senator Durbin's FDA regulation of the tobacco bill. Each \nof these bills has been worked on for a long time. These bills are \nbeing combined in this amendment.\n  There is a time and a place for legislation. The time for both of \nthese bills has come. This amendment is in a sense a marriage, a \nmerger. Some people have referred to this as a shotgun marriage or an \ninteresting marriage, an interesting alliance. I happen to think it is \na proper marriage. I think it is a marriage that makes sense, and I \nbelieve it is a marriage that will last. I believe it is a marriage \nthat will last not only through today when the Senate will vote on this \namendment, and I believe will pass this amendment, I believe it is a \nmarriage that will last through the conference committee that will \ncome. I believe it is a marriage that will last to see this amendment \nand this bill become law. So I believe it will be a permanent marriage, \na lasting marriage.\n  I will talk this morning about the FDA side. But before I do, let me \nsay, I support Senator McConnell's bill because, you see, I understand \nthe problems of tobacco farmers. We have, along the Ohio River, north \nof the Ohio River, tobacco farmers, certainly not as many as my \ncolleague does from Kentucky, but we have them. I understand the \nproblems they have. They need this bill. They need the tobacco buyout.\n  My colleague from Kentucky and I have had many conversations about \nthe need and the necessity to merge these two bills. It makes eminent \nsense to do it. So I thank my colleague for his good work. I thank him \nfor his good counsel. It has been a pleasure to work with him for, \nfrankly, over a year, as we have worked together.\n  Let me also say to my colleague from Massachusetts, it has been a \ngreat pleasure to work with him as we have worked on the FDA part of \nthis bill.\n  Let me talk about the FDA regulation of tobacco. Senator Kennedy and \nI have worked on this issue for some time. We introduced this \namendment. This part of the amendment is designed to help protect \nconsumers, especially children, from the dangers of tobacco.\n  Simply put, our amendment would finally--finally--give the Food and \nDrug Administration the authority it needs to effectively regulate the \nmanufacture and sale of tobacco products. I say ``finally'' because \nmany of my colleagues--first Senator McCain, back in 1997, 1998, began \nworking on this. Senator Frist did great work, as well as Chairman \nGregg, who put a great deal of effort and work into this as well; and \nthen Senator Kennedy and myself. We have all been seeking FDA \nregulation of tobacco products. Congressman Davis and Congressman \nWaxman have a companion piece of legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I say ``finally'' because the bill we are offering today is the \nproduct of long and hard discussions and negotiations that I have had \nwith Senator Kennedy and others and public interest groups and \nindustry. Our bill has the support of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free \nKids. Our bill has the support of Philip Morris. Our bill has the \nsupport of the American Heart Association, the American Lung \nAssociation, and the American Cancer Association.\n\n  It is a bill of which I am proud. It is worth the Senate's \nconsideration and passage. It will provide the FDA, finally, with \nstrong and effective authority over the regulation of tobacco products.\n  Why do we need this bill? I think we all know why we need it. Every \nday, nearly 5,000 young people under the age of 18 try their first \ncigarette. In my own home State of Ohio, 33 percent--one-third--of \nchildren smoke. These kids in Ohio by themselves go through 45 million \npacks of cigarettes each year. If that is not bad enough, think about \nthis: 90 percent of smokers start smoking before the age of 19. More \nthan 6.4 million children across this country will die prematurely \nbecause of a decision they will make as adolescents; that is, the \ndecision to start smoking.\n  While States may have limited the options available for tobacco \nadvertising under the 1998 master settlement agreement, the reality is \ntobacco companies are still able to choose the content of their \nadvertisements, their ads that they run in magazines such as Sports \nIllustrated.\n  Sports Illustrated is read by tens of thousands of children across \nthis country every single day. Kids read it every single day. These \ncompanies are savvy. They are smart. They have changed their marketing \nstrategies. They have concentrated more money into different \nadvertising markets. As a result, years after the major tobacco \ncompanies agreed to stop marketing to children as part of the tobacco \nsettlement, children are still twice as likely as adults to be exposed \nto tobacco advertising. That is who is reading it. That\n\n[[Page S8152]]\n\nis who is seeing it. That is who is hearing it.\n  According to the Federal Trade Commission's ``Annual Report on \nCigarette Sales and Advertisement''--just to take 1 year, the year \n2000--that year represented the largest increase ever in tobacco \ncompany spending on ``promotional allowances.'' That is the money \ntobacco companies pay retailers to promote their products in prominent \nlocations in stores or for highly visible shelf space such as near the \ncash register on an aisle that a customer must walk by to pay the \ncashier. That particular year, cigarette manufacturers spent a record \n$9.57 billion on advertising and promotion.\n  That is an increase of 16 percent from $8.24 billion spent in the \nprevious year. Tobacco companies also spend billions of dollars \nadvertising enticing promotional items--lighters, hats, other \nproducts--they give away for free at the point of sale or, in other \nwords, the cash register or the place of checkout in a grocery or \nconvenience store. In fact, spending on such promotional or value-added \nitems increased by 37 percent in just 1 year.\n  Let's not fool ourselves. These promotional strategies and \nadvertisements reach our children. Three-fourths of the children visit \nconvenience stores at least once a week. The places where tobacco \nproducts are marketed influence their decisions. It is that simple. We \nmust not allow the industry to continue targeting children.\n  This isn't just about an advertising and marketing scheme. It is \nabout that, but it is about more. Our bill not only addresses \nadvertising, it also addresses the second problem. What is the second \nproblem? It is also about tobacco manufacturers' failure to disclose \nthe specific ingredients in their products. While simply listing the \ningredients, toxic as they might be, might not seem like much to some, \nthink of it this way: Current law makes sure we know what is in \nproducts to help people quit smoking, such as the patch or Nicorrette \ngum but not the very products that get people addicted in the first \nplace, the cigarettes themselves. Isn't that crazy?\n  Think about this: Right now the Food and Drug Administration requires \nPhilip Morris to print the ingredients in its Kraft macaroni and cheese \nbut not the ingredients in its cigarettes, a product that contributes \nto the deaths of more than 440,000 people a year.\n  I ask unanimous consent to display in the Senate three different \nproducts: macaroni and cheese, a milk carton, as well as a cigarette \ncarton I have right here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Right now, the FDA requires Philip Morris-owned Nabisco \nto print the ingredients contained in Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers \nbut not the ingredients in its cigarettes, even though cigarettes cause \none-third of all cancer deaths and 90 percent of lung cancer deaths. It \nis unfathomable to me that we would require the listing of ingredients \non these products yet not require the listing of ingredients for one of \nthe leading causes of death and disease.\n  Right now, the FDA requires printed ingredients for chewing gum, \nlipstick, bottled water, ice cream, but not for cigarettes, a product \nthat causes 20 percent of all heart disease deaths and is the leading \ncause of preventable death in the United States.\n  A product that I consumed this morning, this carton of milk, we see \nall the ingredients on here. We can read them right on here: Reduced \nfat milk, vitamin A, et cetera, nutrition facts. It goes into great \ndetail on the back. We can read all the details right here. It tells \nyou anything you want to know. There it is. Here is the macaroni and \ncheese. We can turn it over and get the calories and all the \ningredients: enriched macaroni product, durum wheat flour, wheat, \nniacin. It goes on and on and on and on, all the way down.\n  We see people, when they go to the grocery store, today they are so \nhealth conscious. They pick these things up and they start reading \nthrough to see if they have an allergy to something, to see what their \nkids are eating. They will read down to see if they want to buy the \nproduct. The same company that makes this, makes cigarettes. Yet \ncertain brands of cigarettes they will get, there is nothing on here. \nThere is the warning that has to be on here. It has been on here a \nnumber of years. There is nothing else on here--absolutely \nunbelievable.\n\n  Another way to look at this, another problem, if a company wants to \nmarket a food product that is fat free or reduced fat or light, that \ncompany is required to meet certain standards regarding the number of \ncalories, the amount of fat grams in that product. Yet cigarette \ncompanies can call a cigarette, light or mild, and not reveal a thing \nabout the amount of tar or nicotine or arsenic in that supposedly light \ncigarette.\n  Not having access to all the information about this deadly product \nmakes no sense. It is something that needs to change. By introducing \nthis bill, we are finally saying we are not going to let tobacco \nmanufacturers have free reign over markets and consumers anymore. Today \nwe are taking a step toward making sure the public gets adequate \ninformation about whether to continue to smoke or even to start smoking \nin the first place.\n  With this bill, we are not just saying: Buyer beware. We are saying: \nTobacco companies, be honest. We are saying: Tobacco companies, stop \nmarketing to innocent children. Tobacco companies, tell consumers about \nwhat they are really buying.\n  I realize full well that tobacco users and nonusers alike recognize \nand understand that tobacco products are hazardous to health. They \nunderstand that. But that is not what I am talking about. I am talking \nabout requiring the tobacco companies to list the ingredients that are \nin their products, things such as trace amounts of arsenic and ammonia. \nIt is time we finally give the FDA the authority it needs to fix these \nproblems. The legislation that we are introducing would do just that.\n  First, the bill would make changes regarding tobacco advertising. It \nwould give the FDA authority to restrict tobacco industry marketing, \nconsistent with the first amendment, that targets our children. \nAdditionally, our bill would require advertisements to be in black and \nwhite text only, unless they are an adult publication and would define \nadult publication in terms of readership. Tobacco advertising is in \nmagazines and on billboards along the highway. Tobacco advertising is \nin convenience stores, along the aisles and at the checkout counter, \nright beside the candy, where children are likely to see it. Tobacco \nadvertising is at sporting events, part of promotional items where \nconsumers can buy one and get one free. Tobacco advertising is on the \nInternet and in the daily delivery of mail.\n  Our bill would make changes regarding tobacco advertising. It would \ngive the FDA authority to restrict tobacco advertising marketing \ncontent, consistent with the first amendment, that targets our \nchildren. Our bill would require advertisements to be in black and \nwhite text only and would define adult publications in terms of \nreadership.\n  An issue that is related to advertising and marketing of tobacco \nproducts has to do with the flavored tobacco products which clearly \ntarget our children. We have probably all seen the flavored \ncigarettes--flavors such as strawberry, chocolate, and wild rum. The \nscent of strawberries filters through the unopened pack of cigarettes. \nGuess what. The cigarettes smell like candy.\n\n  A recent New York Times article described the scent of chocolate-\nflavored cigarettes ``as if someone had lifted the lid on a Whitman \nSampler.''\n  We need to stop this. Children will be curious about something that \nsmells or tastes like candy. Cigarettes should not be flavored and \nmarketed in such a way to attract children and to encourage children to \nsmoke. Our bill bans the use of flavors such as strawberry and grape, \norange, cinnamon, pineapple, vanilla, coconut, and coffee, and other \nflavorings that would attract children to the product.\n  Second, our legislation would give consumers more information about \nwhat is in tobacco products. Specifically, the bill would provide the \nFDA with the ability to publish the ingredients of tobacco products. \nDespite the fact that 40 million Americans use tobacco products, many \nof them do not know what is inside the cigarettes or the tobacco \nproduct they ingest. They do not know the ingredients like tar and \nnicotine that are in the product they use. Consumers do not know what\n\n[[Page S8153]]\n\nadditives are included in the product, additives such as ammonia which \nmakes the tobacco product more addictive because it increases the \ndelivery of nicotine.\n  Tobacco companies do not disclose the specific ingredients in their \nproducts because they don't have to. Tobacco products are unregulated. \nOur legislation would give consumers more information about what is in \ntobacco products.\n  Specifically, the bill would provide the FDA with the ability to \npublish the ingredients in tobacco products. It would require a listing \nof all ingredients, substances, and compounds added by the manufacturer \nto the tobacco paper or filter.\n  It would require the description of the contents, delivery, and form \nof nicotine in each tobacco product. It would require information on \nthe health, behavior, or psychological effect of the tobacco product. \nFinally, it would establish the approval process for all new tobacco \nproducts entering the market, new products like Advance, with this \n``trionic filter,'' which claims to have all of the taste but less of \nthe toxins of other cigarettes.\n  One of the most dramatic changes our bill makes is that tobacco \nproducts will now have to be approved before they reach consumer hands. \nIt makes sense that tobacco products should not be able to imply that \nthey may be safer or less harmful to consumers because they use \ndescriptions such as ``light,'' ``mild,'' or ``low tar'' to \ncharacterize the substance in the product. The National Cancer \nInstitute found that many smokers mistakenly believe that low-tar and \nlight cigarettes cause fewer health problems than other cigarettes. Our \nbill would require specific approval by the FDA to use those words so \nthe consumers could be informed.\n  Mr. President, this bill will make a difference. It is a bill that \nwill save lives. I will have more to say about this later in the \ndebate.\n  At this point, I yield the floor to my colleague, Senator McConnell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The assistant \nmajority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this is indeed a historic moment for \nKentucky. Tobacco and the growing of tobacco has been an integral part \nof my State since it came into the Union in 1792. In fact, if you look \ncarefully around the Capitol, you will find tobacco leaves actually \npainted here in the Capitol of the United States of America. Many \npeople argue--and this is probably an exaggeration--that if it hadn't \nbeen for tobacco, the United States might not have been colonized \nbecause it was far and away the most profitable agricultural activity. \nThat is most of what the people of that era did back in the beginning \nof our country.\n  The Senator from Ohio has correctly stated the important health \nconsequences of the use of tobacco. It has taken us several hundred \nyears to figure that out and to reach the point where we are today.\n  I want to start by commending my colleague, Senator Mike DeWine from \nOhio. I have never observed a more skillful legislator than he during \nmy time in the Senate. You can always tell when the senior Senator from \nOhio has an idea on his mind: He will come up to you quietly and pull \nyou off in the corner and begin to twist your arm. You know he is a \nformidable force who, when he has made up his mind about an issue, \nnever lets go. Many bills that have cleared the Senate in the 10 years \nthe Senator from Ohio has been here obtain the fingerprints of Mike \nDeWine. He is truly an extraordinary legislator. I know he is excited \ntoday that the bill he believes so deeply in has a chance to be added \nto this bill. It is very likely to be added to this bill as it goes to \nconference. I congratulate him for his outstanding work.\n\n  Having said that, the Senator is correct; this was a marriage of \nconvenience. I can recall as recently as 1996, when I was running for \nreelection in my State, we were wearing T-shirts that said ``keep FDA \noff the farm.'' The idea of FDA regulating this product, particularly \nif it went down to the farm, was universally unpopular in my State. I \nam not a great fan of FDA regulation today, but these two issues needed \nto be married in the U.S. Senate if we were to get either one of them \nout of the Senate and on the way down the legislative road toward some \naccomplishment.\n  Mr. President, there is simply no way to overstate how central \ntobacco has been to the history of my State. We started growing it from \nthe beginning of the country. Kentucky's soil and climate were \nparticularly suitable for this cash crop. Even with all of the problems \ntobacco has today, we always laughingly say in Kentucky that tobacco is \nthe most profitable thing you can grow on a per-acre basis in our State \nthat is legal. We also have a little marijuana problem in the mountains \nthat we try very hard to stay on top of, and I expect that growing \nmarijuana is more profitable. But even with all of these problems, \ntobacco is the most profitable thing to grow on a per-acre basis, far \nmore profitable than corn, wheat, and the other crops we also grow.\n  In the 1930s, tobacco got in serious trouble, as a lot of agriculture \ndid. Part of the New Deal, in establishing farm programs, included the \nestablishment of the Tobacco Program. Unlike the other farm programs, \nit was a permanent program. It didn't have to be reauthorized \nperiodically, like the other commodities that are under a Federal farm \nprogram. It was a permanent program. It assigned the land, based on how \nmuch tobacco was being grown in the 1930s, a certain amount, a certain \nacreage, and it did that in Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, the \nCarolinas, and Georgia. In that acreage, you had a legal right to grow. \nIt was like owning some stock--you could sell it; you could lease it; \nit had value. We called them ``quotas.'' By the time I started moving \naround the State in the early eighties and learning more about tobacco, \nwe had 100,000 growers in 119 of our 120 counties.\n  In many of these counties, there is not much flatland; but since \ntobacco was so profitable on a per-acre basis, even if you had a tiny \nlittle plot, or quota, you could make pretty good money. You would see \nthese quotas tucked back up in the hollows, right up on the edge of \nwhere the mountain went straight up. We had it in 119 of 120 counties. \nIt was sold at auction around Thanksgiving. Farmers would cut the \ntobacco, strip it, put it into the barns, where it would dry for a \nmonth or two. It would be sold at these auctions, and the auctions \nwould start around Thanksgiving, go through the Christmas season, and \nfinish up in the early part of the year. Many of these farmers were \npart time.\n  When I came to the Senate, the average grower in Kentucky had three-\nquarters of an acre. That was the average. A lot of these folks were \npart time. But this was dependable cash. They could count on it being \nproduced around Christmastime. For many very low-income Kentuckians, it \nprovided Christmas money; for some it provided the opportunity to send \ntheir kids to college. It has been an integral part of our culture for \na very long time.\n  None of these folks, of course, are engaged in selling the product to \nkids. They were making a legal living producing an agricultural crop \nthat is older than America itself. But beginning with the Surgeon \nGeneral's report in 1964, it was increasingly clear that this is a \nproduct that is not good for you.\n  The campaign that has gone on over the last 40 years is legitimate. \nIn Lexington, KY, today, the heart of tobacco country, you cannot smoke \nin a restaurant. That is in Lexington, KY, the heart of tobacco \ncountry. And in Louisville, KY, my hometown, they have been having a \nbig debate about the same issue.\n  I say to my friend from Ohio, if anything sums up how this has all \nchanged, it is when you cannot smoke in a public place in Kentucky. So \nI think the health argument has been made. It is, however, a legal \nproduct. The health groups are not trying to make smoking illegal. \nThat, of course, would produce an enormous black market and no good \nresult.\n  So it occurred to this Senator back in 1998 when we were considering \nanother tobacco proposal that it was time for a buyout. I never will \nforget joining Senator Lugar of Indiana in advocating a buyout back in \n1998. I was rimracked--rimracked--by the two big newspapers in my \nState. They said I turned my back on Kentucky culture; I had gone \nWashington; I had been up\n\n[[Page S8154]]\n\nthere so long I had forgotten what it was like in the hollows and the \ntobacco fields of Kentucky.\n  I was criticized by the Farm Bureau and the Burley Tobacco Co-op and \nall the establishment: How could you possibly be for a buyout? You are \nturning your back on us.\n  I took a survey of tobacco growers. I got a pollster and said: Let's \ngo out and ask them how they feel about it. Frankly, they were against \nit, too. Fifty percent were against it; about 35 percent were for it. \nSo the whole tobacco establishment was against the buyout in 1998 when \nI first advocated it.\n  Now, Mr. President, I am treated as a visionary. I was ahead of my \ntime. If we had only joined you 6 years ago, we would have gotten this \njob done sooner.\n  Being treated as a visionary is kind of fun, but it does not get the \njob done. What is happening here today is we have an opportunity to \nmove on down the road toward achieving something that neither the \nSenator from Ohio nor I thought was going to be achieved, which is some \nkind of FDA proposal, which I am not, as I said, very wild about, and a \nbuyout which I enthusiastically support, and I cannot find a tobacco \ngrower in Kentucky today who is not for the buyout.\n  The occupant of the Chair I know has tobacco farmers in his State as \nwell. I bet he has not run into any lately who are not favorable to a \nbuyout. There has been a complete shift in thinking, and the reason for \nthat is apparent. This quota, this asset, is a shrinking asset. As the \nasset shrinks, the land values go down, and it has a real impact on our \npeople.\n  Some people say: Why should the Government buy out this program? The \nanswer to that is the Government created the asset. The Government, by \nestablishing the quota program, created the asset, and now if the \nGovernment is going to terminate the asset, it is appropriate for the \nGovernment to compensate those for whom the asset was created.\n  As I said earlier, 20 years ago, we had 100,000 growers in 119 of the \n120 counties in my State, and the average quota was about three-fourths \nof an acre. We do quotas by poundage these days, but three-quarters of \nan acre, which gives you the sense of the size, was the average.\n  Today, we are still growing burley in 117 of Kentucky's 120 counties, \nbut the average has gone up to 5.7 acres. So we can see, Mr. President, \ntobacco farmers are leaving, consolidation is occurring even with the \nprogram.\n\n  The 2002 census of agriculture, which was released a year and a half \nago, reflected about a 40-percent drop in the number of farms growing \ntobacco in all of the States--not only Kentucky, in all of the States. \nA 40-percent drop in the number of farms from 93,000 in 1997 down to \n56,000 in all of the States. In Kentucky, from 1997 to 2002, we have \ngone from 46,850 tobacco farms down to a little under 30,000. That is \nstill a lot of farmers--a lot of them--but their asset is shrinking.\n  That brings us to today. The House of Representatives--and I \nparticularly commend two Congressmen, Congressman Richard Burr of North \nCarolina and Congressman Ron Lewis of Kentucky, who spearheaded that \neffort over on the House side and very skillfully leveraged the votes \nthey had on a bipartisan basis in tobacco country to make it possible \nfor the FSC/ETI JOBS bill to pass the House at all. So that proposal, a \nbuyout only, is in the House bill.\n  The occupant of the Chair and the rest of us from tobacco-growing \nStates in the Senate knew we could not get a buyout only through the \nSenate. That would have been our first preference. I say to my friend \nand colleague from Ohio, he knows that would have been my first \npreference. So we have a marriage of convenience here, not a shotgun \nmarriage. It is a marriage of convenience. These two issues converge, \nand in the best of the legislative process, we put them together and \nbelieve we will be able to pass them later this day to go into \nconference. Congressman Burr and Congressman Lewis deserve a lot of \ncredit.\n  I also commend my colleague from Kentucky, Jim Bunning, who has been \na stalwart on this issue from the beginning and extraordinarily helpful \nin every way.\n  I would be remiss if I did not mention Senator Elizabeth Dole, who \nhas been every bit as intense and committed to achieving this issue as \nanyone I have ever seen. It was a big issue in her election in 2002. \nShe came into the Senate and said it was her top priority for North \nCarolina agriculture, and she has pursued it with intensity, with \nconviction, with one-on-one meetings, with Senators who were in a \ncritical place to make a difference. I know she and others are going to \nbe speaking on this issue later. But I say to her, we would not be here \ntoday without her extraordinary effort on behalf of this proposal.\n  This does not guarantee a buyout. I want to make it perfectly clear \nto my folks at home the job is not finished. But we have come further \nthan I, frankly, thought we would get. Toward the end of last year, I \nhad pretty much given up on the prospects of being able to get this \nproposal through. But now we are on the verge of having a buyout. They \nare a little different. The Senate version will be different from the \nHouse version--that frequently happens in the legislative process--but \nwe are on the verge of having the tobacco quota buyout in both the \nSenate bill and House bill in conference, and that is closer than we \nhave ever been before.\n  So we have made extraordinary progress, but I do want to caution \nthose folks at home who care deeply about this issue that we are not \nthere yet. We have come a long way, but we are not there yet. I know \nall of us in the Senate from tobacco-growing States on a bipartisan \nbasis are going to continue to press this issue as hard as we can and \nhopefully conclude the buyout process.\n  I say in conclusion, it will be a big change. We have had a tobacco \nprogram in the burley and flue-cured States going back to 1938. It has \nbeen a way of life. But change is already occurring. The warehouse \nsystem is basically going away. People are growing tobacco under \ncontract now, not selling it to warehouses in the way they used to. \nChange is coming. This is an opportunity to manage that change in such \na way that people will be fairly compensated for the value of today's \nquota.\n  Mr. President, I am optimistic that we may be able to succeed, and I \nthank all of those who contributed to this process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my good friend and colleague from \nKentucky for his very kind comments. Those of us who work with Senator \nMcConnell in the Senate every day know he is a visionary. We know he \nunderstands his State.\n  We also know if Senators want to know how to get something done, they \ngo to Mitch McConnell. I do go to him and I do talk to him and I do get \nhim aside, and I do not know if I twist his arm or not. I do talk to \nhim and seek his counsel and advice. I am kind of a pest sometimes.\n  He was the one who said these two bills are natural to come together. \nHe said that well over a year ago, and here we are today. It was his \nidea or his thought that these two bills could be married, and now we \nare sort of at the altar today. Yes, it is a marriage of convenience, \nbut I happen to believe it is going to be a good marriage. I think it \nis going to be a marriage that will last, not only through this vote \ntoday, but I think it is going to be a marriage that will last through \nconference, and it is going to be a marriage that will make its way to \nthe President's desk.\n  I think it is going to be for the benefit of the American people, the \ntobacco farmers, and the children of this country. I think it will be \nfor the benefit of all Americans and for the health of all Americans. \nSo I think it is going to be a good marriage, and I thank him for his \nhelp in bringing it about.\n  I yield time now to my colleague and friend who has worked so very \nhard on the FDA portion of this bill and has brought us to the Senate \nfloor, the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join in commending my friend and \ncolleague from Ohio, Senator DeWine. Today I am joining him in \npresenting this amendment. We welcome obviously the workings and the \ncontributions of Senator McConnell together\n\n[[Page S8155]]\n\nwith the proposal that has been described as a shotgun wedding because, \non the one hand, as we have heard a very informative and eloquent \nstatement of the history of the growth of the tobacco industry, the \nindustry itself--not the farmers but the industry itself--by and large \nhas resisted the ability of the Food and Drug Administration, which \ngenerally has the overall jurisdiction in dealing with health issues, \nto be able to deal with this issue in order to protect the children of \nthis country.\n  I was here in 1964 when we received the Surgeon General's report. It \narrived like the crack of a whip when we read the Surgeon General's \nreport and found for the first time the dangers of tobacco and its \nimpact in terms of the health of the population generally, in \nparticular with regard to children.\n  For years, those of us who were trying to deal with the health \naspects of this issue, and particularly the health aspects of these \nissues as they relate to children, found strong opposition by the \ntobacco industry. They resisted the commonsense efforts that were being \nmade to try and provide protections for the children of this country.\n  Now we have a working partnership with those who are interested in \nthe tobacco farmers, which I am interested in, and those who are \ninterested in protecting the children. We have come together to try to \nmake a recommendation, the result of which will provide equity and \nfairness to tobacco farmers, paid for by the industry itself and not by \nthe taxpayers, but also to provide the Food and Drug Administration \nwith the kind of authority to help protect the children of this country \nfrom the No. 1 preventable health disease for people that the Federal \nGovernment can do something about. Tobacco causes one out of every \nthree deaths from cancer, one out of five deaths from heart disease and \n87 percent of lung cancer cases. We must slow down the amount of \nchildren smoking and the addiction that has taken place.\n\n  We have had a considerable period of time since the 1964 Surgeon \nGeneral's report. We have the efforts that were made in the 1970s and \n1980s to try to provide labeling on cigarettes to give information to \nthose who were going to start smoking, and it has not been very \neffective. On the contrary, it was used by the tobacco industry as an \noffset, saying, look, we are not responsible. There was information \nthat was on the various tobacco products and people were acting on \ntheir own.\n  We tried to strengthen the Office of Preventive Health. We tried to \nput some labeling on smokeless tobacco. We made some very modest steps \nforward in trying to deal with this issue. Then in 1998, when we had \nthe great debate on the tobacco issue about compensation, there was a \nprovision in that legislation which had a good deal of the kind of \nprotections that are included in the DeWine-Kennedy amendment. A great \ndeal of that was actually fashioned by our majority leader, Senator \nFrist, who was very much involved in helping shape that particular \nproposal.\n  It is interesting, as we had this long debate on the Senate floor on \ntobacco, there was not a single amendment to try and alter that \nauthority. It was generally agreed that that was a pretty good balance, \ngoing back to 1998. From that time, Senator DeWine has picked up this \nopportunity and has continued to press this in the committee, and a \nnumber of our colleagues have been particularly involved in this issue. \nI think of our colleagues from Iowa and Illinois, Senator Harkin and \nSenator Durbin, and a number of others who have been extremely involved \nin trying to make sure we were going to provide some protections.\n  I mentioned the 1964 Surgeon General's report. I will include in the \nRecord an appropriate part of the new Surgeon General's report that was \nissued on May 27, 2004. This is from the U.S. Surgeon General appointed \nby President Bush. He is this administration's Surgeon General, and \nthis is what his findings are:\n\n       U.S. Surgeon General Richard H. Carmona today released a \n     new comprehensive report on smoking and health, revealing for \n     the first time that smoking causes diseases in nearly every \n     organ of the body. Published 40 years after the surgeon \n     general's first report on smoking--which concluded that \n     smoking was a definitive cause of three serious diseases--\n     this newest report finds cigarette smoking is conclusively \n     linked to diseases such as leukemia, cataracts, pneumonia and \n     cancers of the cervix, kidney, pancreas and stomach.\n\n  It goes on:\n\n       Statistics indicate that more than 12 million Americans \n     have died from smoking since the 1964 report. . . .\n       Another major conclusion, consistent with recent findings \n     of other scientific studies, is that smoking so-called low-\n     tar low-nicotine cigarettes does not offer a health benefit \n     over smoking regular ``full-flavor'' cigarettes.\n\n  Then it continues:\n\n       There is no safe cigarette, whether it is called ``light,'' \n     ``ultra-light,'' or any other name, Dr. Carmona said. The \n     science is clear: The only way to avoid the health hazards of \n     smoking is to quit completely or to never start smoking.\n       The report concludes that quitting smoking has immediate \n     and long-term benefits.\n\n  And then it illustrates these, which is very hopeful.\n\n       Dr. Carmona said it is never too late to stop smoking. \n     Quitting smoking at age 65 or older reduces a person's risk \n     of dying from a smoking-related disease by 50 percent.\n\n  This is an enormously important document. It updates the science and \nit demonstrates what an extraordinary challenge we are facing.\n  Now why do Senator DeWine and I feel so strongly about giving the FDA \nthe power to give particular focus with regard to children?\n  This chart, ``Smoking begins early, adults who are daily smokers \nbegan smoking,'' shows that 16 percent of all of the smokers begin \nsmoking by age 12; 37 percentage by age 14; 62 percent by age 16; and \n89 percent begin smoking by age 18.\n  This is a very clear indication of what is happening out across this \ncountry. For children, starting at the age of 12, 16 percent are \nsmokers. Five thousand start every day, and 2,000 become regular \nsmokers. Every single day, 5,000 children start smoking, and 2,000 \ncontinue.\n  We have to ask ourselves, what are the circumstances? Why does \nDeWine-Kennedy give the FDA the power, as he has mentioned--and I will \ngo over that shortly--why particularly about children? As we see, the \nchildren are the ones who get started, they are the ones who get \naddicted to cigarettes. Now we ask ourselves, why is that?\n  This is the result of International Communications Research:\n\n       Have you seen any advertising for cigarettes or spit \n     tobacco in the last 2 weeks?\n       Teens, 64 percent; adults, 27 percent.\n\n  Do we understand that? It is 64 percent of teens, 27 percent of \nadults. All we have to do to understand this is to look at the various \nmagazines that are coming out. In Rolling Stone, here it is: the large \nWinston cigarette, ``Leave The Bull Behind.'' Everybody is young, \nbeautiful, and enjoying themselves. All they have to do is light up a \nWinston in order to reach those circumstances.\n  Take Sports Illustrated. It is filled with the same kinds of \nadvertising. Camels, here it is:\n\n       The Roaring Twenties. Get it with a Camel. Smoke back-alley \n     blend with a hint of bourbon.\n\n  My friend talked about the new chocolate cigarettes. This is what we \nare seeing.\n  The appeal is to children. The danger is to children. What we are \ntrying to do is give the FDA the authority and the power to do \nsomething about protecting children.\n  As the Senator from Ohio knows, we lag behind virtually every other \ncountry in the world. Our neighboring country of Canada has done \nsomething about it; Australia has done something about it; and now the \nEuropean Union is doing something about this issue. Now we have the \nopportunity to do something about it with our particular proposal.\n  This is a very modest program. As the Senator from Ohio has pointed \nout, it is a fair and balanced approach to the FDA regulation. It \ncreates a new section in FDA for the regulation of tobacco products \nwith standards that allow for consideration of the unique issues raised \nby tobacco use. It is sensitive to concerns of tobacco farmers, small \nbusinesses and nicotine-dependent smokers, but it clearly gives the FDA \nthe authority it needs to prevent youth smoking and reduce addiction to \nthis highly lethal product. This amendment also provides the financial \nrelief for the hard-pressed tobacco farmers that has been outlined and \ncommented about earlier by Senator McConnell.\n\n[[Page S8156]]\n\n  This proposal is a legitimate buyout plan designed by tobacco State \nmembers for the benefit of their tobacco farming constituents. It is \nfar superior to the ill-conceived proposal in the House.\n  The heart of this amendment is the FDA provision which will lead to \nfewer children starting to smoke and to fewer adults suffering with \ntobacco-induced disease. Public health groups tell us it is the most \nimportant legislation we can pass to deal with the Nation's No. 1 \nhealth hazard. We must deal firmly with the tobacco companies' \nmarketing practices that target children and mislead the public. The \nFood and Drug Administration needs broad authority to regulate the \nsale, distribution, and advertising of cigarettes and smokeless \ntobacco.\n\n  The tobacco industry currently spends over $9 billion a year to \npromote its products. Much of that money is spent in ways designed to \ntempt children, as I pointed out, to start smoking before they are \nmature enough to appreciate the enormity of the health risk. When you \nget 16 percent of children 12 and younger to start smoking, they \ncertainly do not understand the health risks they are going to be faced \nwith so that they can make a judgment or decision about the risk. The \nindustry knows that more than 90 percent of smokers begin as children \nand are addicted by the time they reach adulthood. If we are serious \nabout reducing youth smoking, the FDA must have the power to prevent \nindustry advertising designed to appeal to children wherever it will be \nseen by children.\n  This legislation would give the FDA the ability to stop tobacco \nadvertising which glamorizes smoking where it will be seen by \nsignificant numbers of children; it grants FDA full authority to \nregulate tobacco advertising ``consistent with and to the full extent \npermitted by the first amendment.''\n  The FDA authority must also extend to the sale of tobacco products. \nNearly every State makes it illegal to sell cigarettes to the children \nunder 18, but the survey shows those laws are rarely enforced and \nfrequently violated. The FDA must have the power to limit the sales of \ncigarettes to face-to-face transactions in which the age of the \npurchaser can be verified by identification. This means an end to self-\nservice displays and vending machines.\n  We have the chart that will show where cigarettes are being sold. It \nis right next to the candy in stores. This is an average store where \nyou see the candy bars. Who eats the candy bars? The children will eat \nthis candy. Right above it are all the advertisements for tobacco \nproducts as well as tobacco products that have the same smell, the same \nscent and taste as candy as well.\n  This legislation will give youth access and advertising restrictions \nalready developed by the FDA the immediate force of law, as if they had \nbeen issued under the new statute. There are rules that have gone \nthrough the process extensively. They are ready to be implemented. This \nlegislation provides that.\n  Nicotine in cigarettes is highly addictive. The medical experts say \nit is as addictive as heroin or cocaine. Yet for decades tobacco \ncompanies have vehemently denied addictiveness of their products, and \nno one should forget the parade of tobacco executives who testified \nunder oath before Congress that smoking cigarettes is not addictive. \nOverwhelming evidence in industry documents obtained through the \ndiscovery process proved the companies not only knew of this \naddictiveness for decades but actually relied on it as the basis for \ntheir marketing strategy. As we now know, cigarette manufacturers \nchemically manipulated the nicotine in their products to make it even \nmore addictive.\n  Given the addictiveness of their products, it is essential the FDA \nhave the authority to effectively regulate them for the protection of \npublic health. Over 40 million Americans are currently addicted to \ncigarettes. The FDA should be able to take the necessary steps to help \naddicted smokers overcome their addiction and to make the product less \ntoxic for smokers who are unable or unwilling to stop. To do so, the \nFDA must have the authority to reduce or remove the hazardous \ningredients from cigarettes to the extent it becomes scientifically \nfeasible. The inherent risks in smoking should not be unnecessarily \ncompounded.\n\n  This legislation will give the FDA the legal authority it needs to \nreduce youth smoking by preventing tobacco advertising which targets \nchildren, to prevent the sale of tobacco products to minors, to help \nsmokers overcome their addiction, to make tobacco products less toxic \nfor those who continue to use them, and to prevent the tobacco industry \nfrom misleading the public about the dangers of smoking.\n  Now is the time for the Senate to address the critical health issues. \nThe interest of tobacco State members in passing a tobacco farmers \nbuyout provides a golden opportunity. By joining a strong FDA bill with \nrelief for tobacco farmers, this amendment should receive broad, \nbipartisan support. We can accomplish both of these worthy goals during \nthe session. This approach is supported by the public health community \nand by the farmers' organizations. Most importantly, it is the right \nthing to do for America's children.\n  (Disturbance in the Visitors Gallery.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Order will be restored in the gallery.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleague for his very strong statement. \nAgain, I congratulate him for all his great work. He has been just a \nwonderful advocate. His advocacy for this issue goes back many, many \nyears.\n  Let me yield to my friend and colleague from Virginia just for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished manager. I \ncommend him, Senator Kennedy, and many others who have worked on this \nlegislation which I wholeheartedly support.\n  We are privileged to have, in my State, a number of tobacco farmers \nwho are enduring extraordinary economic hardships. Also, I serve on the \ncommittee on which serves the distinguished manager of this \nlegislation, the Health Committee, as it relates to the Federal Drug \nAdministration.\n  I understand you have coupled the two together.\n  That has been the objective of our committee some several years now \nduring which we have looked at this, and the two will be put together. \nI once again indicate my support and accommodation to those who made it \npossible.\n  Mr. President, I speak today with a great deal of anxiousness and \nanticipation. As a result of the World Trade Organization's finding of \nU.S. noncompliance with international trade obligations, retaliatory \ntariffs have been exacted on U.S. exports. Each month these tariffs \nwill increase until Congress passes the FSC/ETI bill. The costs to the \nAmerican economy can be avoided. I am pleased that we can pass this \nbill today and am hopeful that it can move swiftly through conference.\n  Oftentimes things move at a glacial pace here in the U.S. Senate. But \nif there is one thing I have learned in my many years as a Member of \nthis institution, it is that there are rare instances that the pace \nbecomes so swift that one could miss something if he or she were to \nblink. The announcement that we would return to consideration of the \nFSC bill with an amendment on tobacco may have struck many of us as an \nindication that today was to be one of those days. However, today is \njust the next step in the long journey for many of us in this room.\n  For a number of years I have worked with many of my colleagues in the \nSenate and Members of the House of Representatives to address an issue \nof vital importance to the rural communities of the South. We have met \nwith our farmers, drafted numerous pieces of legislation, consulted \nwith experts in economic and agriculture policy--and we have done it \nover and over again. Today, the Senate finally stands poised to speak \nas a body to end the outdated tobacco quota system.\n  Our tobacco-growing communities, long dependent on the cultivation of \ntobacco, have been devastated by foreign competition and the quota \nsystem that keeps the price of leaf artificially high. The amendment \nsubmitted by the Senator from Ohio contains language from a bill \ncrafted by a coalition of members from the tobacco farming States of \nKentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, and \nVirginia. The Tobacco Market Transition Act will end the current \ntobacco quota system, provide compensation to growers and owners of \nquota, and provide grants to States and institutions of higher \neducation to reduce\n\n[[Page S8157]]\n\ncommunity reliance on the production of tobacco.\n  I have been a member of this body for 26 years and can say without \nequivocation that for the farm communities of southside and southwest \nVirginia there is no more important national policy. I can also say \nthat not much is more controversial and polarizing than tobacco \nlegislation. There are concerns with a buyout that ``makes farmers \ninstant millionaires,'' or that it raises taxes, or that it imposes a \ncost to the general treasury. I am pleased to say that this amendment \ndoes none of those things.\n  Still, many have stated that a buyout will not pass the Senate \nwithout being coupled to legislation specifically giving the Food and \nDrug Administration the authority to regulate tobacco products. While \nthese two policy goals have for years seemed mutually exclusive, \nsometimes in the legislative process major national needs that appear \nto be in conflict come together to forge a comprehensive national \npolicy. Such is the case today, as we consider both a tobacco quota \nbuyout and FDA regulation of tobacco as part of one amendment.\n  While many tobacco farmers vehemently opposed FDA regulation of \ntobacco not even 10 years ago, the issue has evolved since then. Today, \nthe simple fact today is that most tobacco farmers support FDA \nregulation so long as it is coupled with a tobacco quota buyout. That \nhas certainly become the predominant view of Virginia tobacco farmers \nwho I have spoken with over the last several years. And, that is \nclearly the view of several groups who represent growers in my State. \nThe Virginia Farm Bureau; the Virginia Tobacco Growers Association; the \nVirginia Sun-cured Growers Association; the Virginia Dark-Fired Growers \nAssociation; the Virginia Agricultural Growers Association; Allies for \nTobacco, Inc.; and Concerned Friends for Tobacco all have signed on to \na set of core principles stating that it is in the best interests of \nthe public health community and the tobacco producer community for the \nFDA to have authority to establish fair and equitable regulatory \ncontrols over tobacco products.\n  But not only has the farm communities' position on FDA regulation of \ntobacco evolved over the years, so has the position of the largest \ntobacco company in the United States, if not the world. Less than 10 \nyears ago, Phillip Morris actively opposed efforts to grant the FDA \nauthority over tobacco. Today, that same company, now known as Altria, \nwhich is headquartered in the Commonwealth of Virginia, is actively \nsupporting legislation to grant the FDA the authority to regulate \ntobacco.\n  What we have seen over the last 10 years is an amazing coming \ntogether of public health advocates, tobacco farmers, and a major \ntobacco company. Many in the Congress have helped lead the way. The \namendment that stands before us is the culmination of the hard work of \nmany, including Senators Frist, McConnell, Kennedy, DeWine, and the \nchairman of the HELP Committee, Senator Gregg, who always helped keep \nthis issue on the committee's agenda. My colleague from Virginia, \nCongressman Tom Davis, also played an important role.\n\n  The compromise that has been reached in the Senate is an important \none not only because, as I stated earlier, it will provide the help \nthat our tobacco farmers so desperately need. It is also important \nbecause it will improve our public health. And that second point is an \nimportant one to me.\n  You see, my father was a doctor. He was a surgeon gynecologist, and \nhe dedicated his life to medical research. Much of his research was \nspent on efforts to eradicate cancer. Ironically enough, though, it was \nultimately this same devastating illness that my father worked so hard \nto find a cure for that ultimately took his life.\n  So, as I think about my father today, I know that he is smiling down \nbecause the Senate is about to pass a bill that could help reduce the \ncases of cancer and reduce the number of premature deaths in this \ncountry related to tobacco.\n  We know that smoking is one of the foremost preventable causes of \ndeath in the United States. It is estimated to cause over 400,000 \ndeaths in America each year. That is why we have warning labels on \ncigarette packages and public awareness campaigns against smoking. The \ndangers of smoking are clear.\n  The bill before us today will help us reduce those dangers in many \nways. Most notably, in my view, is the modified risk section, which I \nbelieve is the hallmark of the FDA portion of this amendment. This \nsection provides the FDA the authority to approve modified risk tobacco \nproducts that reduce harm of tobacco-related disease and benefit the \npublic health. With the imprimatur of the FDA, current users of high-\nrisk tobacco products could be encouraged to use these reduced risk \nproducts. And, as they move down the continuum or risk with the \nproducts they use, we should see a corresponding decrease in the number \nof tobacco related illnesses as well.\n  While the public health benefits of this amendment are strong, it is \nalso very important to make clear that the FDA legislation before us \ntoday is balanced. I worked extensively with Senator DeWine and Senator \nKennedy to make sure of that. For example, this legislation will in no \nway restrict the rights of adult Americans who wish to smoke or use \nother tobacco products. At my request, and the request of others, \nSenator DeWine and Senator Kennedy modified their original legislation \nto make it clear that the FDA would not have the power to ban all \ncigarettes and other tobacco products. Under this amendment, that power \nis reserved to Congress, where it properly belongs.\n  Today we take a great step to protect the public health of all \nAmerican citizens and the economic health of our tobacco farmers, their \nfamilies, and their communities. The passage of this amendment is a \ngreat triumph for this body and represents the spirit of legislative \ncooperation and compromise that has long been the cornerstone of this \ninstitution. It is my sincere hope that we can soon celebrate the final \nconference report for this bill and the inclusion of the amendment on \nwhich we vote today.\n  Thank you, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his support and \nfor his very good statement.\n  I yield at this time to my friend and colleague from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the FSC/ETI \nbill that will end tariffs on our manufactures. But also, it will \nfinally bring much needed relief to the tobacco growers of my State.\n  The bill before the Senate today addresses many important tax issues \nthat face American companies, both at home and abroad.\n  The many international provisions that are contained in the bill are \nimportant changes to a badly outdated part of the Tax Code.\n  The centerpiece of this bill, of course, is a provision to expand tax \nincentives to America's manufacturing sector. During debate on this \nbill, I was pleased that we adopted the bipartisan amendment that I \noffered with Senator Stabenow.\n  Under our amendment, America's manufacturing companies--small and \nlarge--will see their tax rate decline by almost 1.5 percent this year. \nThat is compared to the rate cut this year of only one-third of 1 \npercent that was previously contained in the bill. It is imperative \nthat we get this relief to our U.S. manufacturers as quickly as \npossible.\n  We were also able to include in this bill my amendment to extend the \nnet operating loss period to 5 years rather than the 3-year period \nincluded in the original bill. This important provision, which will \nallow companies facing financial challenges to see increased cash flow \nto assist them in investing and hiring, is one that Senator Conrad and \nI have worked on together in committee.\n  The WTO ruling on the FSC-ETI regime authorized the European Union to \nstart imposing sanctions of over $4 billion on U.S. exports. During the \nfirst month of tariffs we have seen products from apparel to paper hit \nwith penalties approaching 10 percent. Many other products important to \nmy State, such as horses, are on the initial retaliation list and will \nalso face this tariff.\n  They have a list of over 1,600 U.S. products from nearly every part \nof the\n\n[[Page S8158]]\n\nU.S. economy that will be penalized because we have not repealed the \nFSC/ETI regime.\n  But most importantly, this amendment will help my tobacco growers.\n  Since Daniel Boone first came through the Cumberland Gap, farming has \nbeen both the economic and cultural backbone of the Commonwealth. The \nfamily farm is the basis of Kentucky culture and it has been based \naround tobacco.\n  For years we in Kentucky have tried to diversify from the tobacco \ncrop.\n  We have had some success, vegetables, beef cattle, cat fish, corn, \nchicken and other crops have been quite successful, worm farms and \nother have not been as successful. But nothing brings as much as a \nreturn as tobacco.\n  Most of the tobacco farmers in my State are not full-time tobacco \nfarmers. They either have an off-farm job, or primarily raise other \ncrops or raise livestock.\n  But the money they get from tobacco, pays their mortgage, or puts \ntheir kids through school or allows them to keep farming. Outside of \nthe western part of Kentucky, we do not have tens of thousands of acres \nof flat land. We need a crop that grows on rolling hills and that \nthrives in our climate. Tobacco does that.\n  But a number of things have conspired against tobacco in the last few \nyears.\n  The previous administration declared war on tobacco and by extension, \ntobacco farmers. The Asian economic crises have hurt exports. The \nMaster Settlement Agreement and State tax increase have dramatically \nraised the price of cigarettes. And although American tobacco is still \nsuperior, the companies have invested so much overseas that the gap has \nnarrowed between American tobacco and cheap foreign tobacco.\n  As I am sure most of my colleagues know, there are no direct payments \nto tobacco farmers, but we do have a price support and production \ncontrol program. Growers own quota which they can buy, sell, or lease. \nThe government administers this program to make sure it runs \neffectively and that growers only sell what they are allowed to under \nthe quota system. If you grow too much, you can't sell it.\n  But the quotas have lost 60 percent of their value since 1998. Not \nmany businesses would be around if they lost 60 percent of their income \nin 5 years, and we have lost a lot of growers. We have many who are \nbarely holding on. They need help, we can give that to them and get the \ngovernment out of the tobacco business at the same time.\n  We don't have big tobacco in my State. The last big tobacco company \npulled out a few years ago.\n   What we have is little tobacco. We have over 30,000 tobacco growers. \nWe also have over 100,000 tobacco quota owners. Many of those are \nelderly who can no longer work their land, so they lease their quota \nand that income becomes a major part of their retirement security.\n  That quota is tied to the land. It has a direct effect on the \nproperty taxes Kentuckians pay.\n  Those taxes build and fund schools, provide clean water, pay for \nemergency services, pave roads and help fund every community in \nKentucky. If we don't help my growers get relief, we face the very real \nprospect of having ghost towns in Kentucky.\n  The amendment we have before us today will buy out the tobacco \nprogram.\n  We will give our growers relief and end the federal price support \nprogram. We will also let many growers, whose average age is 62, retire \nand get out of the business. Dr. Will Snell, of the University of \nKentucky, estimate 70-75 percent of tobacco growers will get out of the \nbusiness with a buyout. We will allow growers to pay off their debts \nand enjoy their retirement.\n  The amendment also has FDA Authorization of tobacco. This is a \ndramatic increase in the regulatory authority of the FDA.\n  I am not comfortable with it. I do not want the FDA inspecting my \ngrowers' crop.\n  FDA regulation is a bad idea. My growers are in dire straits. They \ndesperately need help. FDA regulation is a very steep price to pay for \na buyout, but if it is the only way to get my growers relief, this \nSenator will vote for it.\n  Make no mistake about it, the program will end. The only question is \nwhether we end it on our terms or big tobacco terms. Please, please \nsupport the tobacco growers in this country and give them an equitable \nsolution for the little tobacco growers all across this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Kentucky for his \nvery good statement. I assure my colleague that with the language which \nhas been drafted in the FDA section, we have taken certainly one of his \nconcerns into consideration and the FDA is not allowed on the farm. \nThere is protection in there. I appreciate his comments.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Collins as a cosponsor of this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, one of the very enlightening aspects about \nthis legislation, the FDA part of this legislation, is how many of the \neditorial writers--not just in the national papers but many of the \npapers throughout the country--have weighed in on this issue and they \nhave done this very eloquently. Frankly, they have been more eloquent \nabout this than I have been in the Senate.\n  I will take a couple of minutes and read what some of the editorials \nhave said about this issue. I start with the Lexington Herald Leader, \nLexington, KY, May 21 of this year.\n\n       Tastier poison; New cigarettes prove need for FDA control.\n       Mandarin Mint. Smooth Fusions. Midnight Berry. We're not \n     talking herbal teas or fruit smoothies, folks. We're talking \n     cigarettes.\n       The latest evidence that the tobacco industry has no shame \n     is the marketing of sweet-flavored cigarettes. . . . \n     Straight-faced company spokesmen say the new brands are aimed \n     at adult palates. Please. The goal is obvious: Appeal to kids \n     and hook new smokers.\n\n  This lethal version of candied cigarettes, along with the appearance \nof the new generation of ``safer cigarettes'' is also the latest \nevidence that Congress should at long last give the Food and Drug \nAdministration oversight of tobacco.\n  The FDA has the authority to monitor a manufacture's claim about a \npack of breath mints or chewing gum but the tobacco industry can roll \nout new brands of cigarettes and claim they pose less risk of emphysema \nand cancer or help smokers quit, and the FDA has no say-so at all.\n  This is from the Columbus Dispatch, Columbus, OH, June 26, 2004:\n\n       The legislation to allow FDA regulation of the tobacco \n     industry is far from frivolous. It has the support of many \n     anti-smoking groups, along with cigarette maker Philip \n     Morris. The tobacco industry has operated irresponsibly for \n     decades, and every time it shows a sign of turning over a new \n     leaf, it does something to remind people that it is not \n     trustworthy. FDA regulation should have happened decades ago.\n       That smoking-cessation products are heavily regulated, but \n     the products that actually kill people are not is the \n     ultimate absur-\n     dity. . . .\n       Congress has a duty to protect public health, not to shield \n     an industry that has a long history of deceit and death.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I yield to my colleague from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. There was reference made by our friend, the Senator from \nKentucky, about the FDA and its ability to interfere with farmers, to \nsomehow impose their guidance or will upon farmers.\n  I ask if the Senator from Ohio does not agree with me that we \naddressed this issue on page 23 of the amendment, which says:\n\n       The provisions of the chapter shall not apply to tobacco \n     leaf that is not in possession of a manufacturer of tobacco \n     products, or to the producers of tobacco leaf, including \n     tobacco growers, tobacco warehouses, and tobacco grower \n     cooperatives, nor shall any employee of the FDA have any \n     authority to enter on to a farm owned by a producer of \n     tobacco leaf without the written consent of such producer.\n\n  This issue is of concern. This was not what we were looking for. \nLooking at it is enormously important. Those under that view will have \nassurances from the Senator from Ohio. Not only our assurances but the \nlegislative assurances that the FDA is not in any way going to have any \nrole whatever in\n\n[[Page S8159]]\n\ndealing with any of the producers themselves, the farmers.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleague for the question. I am looking at \nthe same language. He read it correctly. It is directly in the \namendment. It was originally in the bill that my colleague from \nMassachusetts and I wrote and introduced.\n  I have penciled in here ``FDA can't go on the farm,'' which is a \nshorthand version of what he said. But actually it goes further than \nthat. It is not just on the farm but it is basically any kind of FDA \ninterference in this area.\n  In earlier versions, years ago, the bill may have given my colleague \nfrom Kentucky something to worry about but this version clearly makes \nit abundantly clear the FDA cannot do this. I am glad my colleague has \npointed this out.\n  I have other editorials I can read but I see my colleague from \nIllinois is in the Chamber. If he is ready to speak, I am more than \nhappy to yield him time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Ohio. I don't know how much time \nis remaining. I don't want to take too much.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I inquire of the Chair how much time remains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirteen minutes remain.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, the Chair, and to \nmy colleagues in the Chamber, I have only had one Senator come to me \nrequesting time in opposition. I probably would propound a unanimous \nconsent request to take some time from the opposition with the \nunderstanding that--I have not done that yet--anyone who wants to speak \nin opposition, obviously, we would make that time available.\n  I yield 10 minutes to my colleague from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Ohio and the \nSenator from Massachusetts for their leadership.\n  This is an issue which hits close to home for many Americans. It is \nan issue we have faced in our families where people we dearly love have \nbeen victims of tobacco-related disease. It is an issue which we face \nevery day in America when children make the decision to start using \ntobacco products--either spit tobacco or cigarettes--and become \naddicted, and one out of every three of those children who choose the \naddiction will die from it. That is a reality.\n  Tobacco is still the No. 1 preventable cause of death in America \ntoday. It is preventable if we do our job, regulating the product.\n  The bill before the Senate says we will give to the Food and Drug \nAdministration the authority to regulate tobacco. The Food and Drug \nAdministration operates under a law which specifically excludes \ntobacco. It said tobacco is neither a food nor a drug. It falls between \nthe cracks.\n  So the Food and Drug Administration has the responsibility, when it \ncomes to macaroni and cheese, to make sure it is wholesome, to make \ncertain it is safe, but it does not have that same opportunity or \nauthority when it comes to Marlboro cigarettes or any other package of \ncigarettes. When you look at the back of the macaroni and cheese, it \nstates the contents and ingredients. You can look all over the Marlboro \ncigarette package and you will never figure out what is in it. It is \nmore than just natural tobacco. There are a lot of chemicals in here, \nand these chemicals are harmful.\n\n  What Senator DeWine and Senator Kennedy do today is to call us \ntogether and say, finally, after so many years--40 years of being \nconvinced that tobacco causes cancer, heart disease, stroke, lung \nproblems--after all these years we are going to give to the Food and \nDrug Administration the authority to regulate this product.\n  This is not a radical idea. This is common sense. Mr. President, 15 \nyears ago, as a Member of the House of Representatives, I offered an \namendment to ban smoking on airplanes. It was an amendment that was \nopposed by the tobacco lobby, opposed by the leadership, Democrat and \nRepublican, in the House of Representatives, and no one thought I had a \nchance. But I won, and I passed it. It became the law of the land. Now, \nif you went into an airplane and said: ``Incidentally, we decided to \nchange the rules. Anybody who wants to smoke, go ahead,'' people would \njust stand up and say: ``Are you crazy? Secondhand smoke can kill you. \nWe're not going back to those old days.''\n  What Senator DeWine and Senator Kennedy are doing is telling us: Look \nforward to a future where we start making commonsense health decisions \nthat are going to save the lives of millions of Americans.\n  Now, what is going on politically here? Sadly, there is an effort \ncoming out of the House of Representatives to put together an $8 or $9 \nbillion buyout of those who have tobacco allotments in America. It is \nan old piece of agricultural law that some people were able to claim \nthe right to grow tobacco and be given a Government allotment. It is \nthe closest thing to being given some title or royalty that you can \nimagine because those folks are then entitled to grow tobacco and have \nspecial treatment under the law.\n  What they have said is, if we want to end this program, you have to \npay us to end it. We have made money over the years with it, but you \nhave to pay us to end it, $8 or $9 billion.\n  Well, I swallow hard when I think about that notion of giving $8 or \n$9 billion from hard-working taxpayers across America to these tobacco \ngrowers. But I finally was brought to the conclusion that if that is \nthe only way we can get FDA regulation of tobacco products in America, \nall right, I will buy that compromise. It is a painful compromise to \nthink of that much money, but that is the reality.\n  What we have today with this proposal from Senator Kennedy and \nSenator DeWine is to move us in the direction of what we need: to put \ninto FDA law the power to regulate tobacco; for the first time in our \nhistory, to give the Food and Drug Administration the authority to \nrestrict tobacco advertising.\n  Cross the border into Canada and look at a package of cigarettes. \nThere is a clear warning--not the worthless warnings we have been stuck \nwith for four decades--clear warnings that might give somebody some \npause before buying this dangerous product. Our FDA ought to have that \nsame authority.\n  We also need more authority to aggressively stop the sale of these \ndeadly tobacco products to our kids. The Food and Drug Administration \ncan do that, but they need the authority to do that.\n  We also need to make sure the Food and Drug Administration has \nstronger warning labels that prevent the tobacco industry from making \nterrible misrepresentations about their product.\n\n  Do you remember ``light'' cigarettes--lower in tar, lower in \nnicotine, and so forth? It turns out it was a complete fraud on the \npublic. A class action lawsuit brought against the tobacco companies \ndisclosed that they knew they were lying to the American consumers but \ndid it anyway. They made so much money at it they were going to do it \nanyway.\n  Well, they were nailed with a lawsuit that a lot of people are \ntalking about. But it is because of their deliberate misrepresentations \nabout the facts of their product that they were nailed by this lawsuit.\n  The passage of this law gives the Food and Drug Administration the \nright to police tobacco advertising, to make certain they do not lie \nand mislead American consumers.\n  It also sets standards for reduced-risk products. There is a lot of \nresearch going on here. I do not know if it will lead to anything \npositive, but it leads us in the right direction, as far as I am \nconcerned.\n  I know there are others on the floor who want to speak. I am happy to \ncosponsor this measure. I believe this is a historic moment that the \nSenate has a chance to acknowledge what the tobacco companies \nthemselves have acknowledged. When they entered into an agreement with \nthe States' attorneys general across America, they acknowledged that \nthe Food and Drug Administration needed to have the authority to \nregulate their product. A major company, Philip Morris, has come \nforward and said they accept that. They are prepared to accept this \nproposal from Senator DeWine and Senator Kennedy. Now we have a chance \nto put it in law.\n  What we are going to do with this legislation is save lives in \nAmerica. We are going to reduce the incidence of pulmonary disease, the \nincidence of disease and stroke and heart attack and death associated \nwith tobacco.\n  If we did nothing else in this session--and we may do nothing else--\nthis\n\n[[Page S8160]]\n\nis the single most important thing we can do to make America a \nhealthier place and to give our kids a fighting chance. I stand in \nstrong support of this proposal by Senator Kennedy and Senator DeWine.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Snowe \nbe added as a cosponsor of S. 2461, the Family Smoking Prevention and \nTobacco Control Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I see my colleagues on the floor. Before I \nyield time, I want to read one more editorial. As I said, to me, it is \ninteresting how the editorial boards across this country have spoken \nout about this bill, and I think have done so very eloquently.\n  On June 19, 2004, the Cleveland Plain Dealer wrote as follows in \ntheir editorial:\n\n       Most people know that smoking cigarettes is risky. But no \n     one can say for sure what's in them, or if ``low tar'' \n     cigarettes and other ``safer'' smokes live up to their \n     claims.\n       The bill would give the FDA the power to approve \n     cigarettes, to force them to live up to their billing and to \n     allow the states to regulate advertising. Altria, alone among \n     cigarette makers, has blessed the DeWine-Kennedy bill--\n     possibly as a shield from lawsuits, although aggressive trial \n     lawyers will try to turn that shield into a smoke screen.\n       However, the bill does not exceed its grasp. For example, \n     it forces companies to eliminate tutti-frutti scents that \n     appeal to youngsters, but it prevents the FDA from banning \n     nicotine, that poisonous active ingredient in cigarettes.\n       The growth of so-called ``low-tar'' or ``mild'' cigarettes, \n     the lure of fruit scents and the biochemical stew of \n     ingredients stuffed into smokes demand some government \n     supervision.\n       Cigarettes can't be banished. That would make outlaws of \n     thousands whose only crime is destroying their own health. \n     But the FDA should know exactly what Americans are smoking \n     when they light up. The DeWine-Kennedy bill will help clear \n     the air.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield to my colleague, Senator Reed from Rhode \nIsland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I commend and thank my colleague Senator \nDeWine and my colleague Senator Kennedy for this legislation. They have \nbeen in the vanguard for many years of protecting the health of all \nAmericans, but particularly protecting the health of children. I have \nalso been active, along with Senator Durbin and others, in this effort.\n  Actually, in August of 1996, the FDA promulgated rules to regulate \nthe tobacco industry. But these rules were litigated to the Supreme \nCourt. In a very closely divided decision--5 to 4--the Court \nessentially said: Congress, you must make it clear that the FDA has the \nauthority to regulate the tobacco industry. That is what the DeWine-\nKennedy amendment is doing--making it very clear, very explicit that \nthe Food and Drug Administration may regulate the tobacco industry.\n  Now, there was a question about the law, but there was no question in \nthe minds of the Justices about the effect of tobacco as a public \nhealth issue. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor stated, in her majority \nopinion, that tobacco was ``perhaps the single most significant threat \nto public health in the United States.'' Justice Breyer, who was in the \nminority, recognized that the FDA should already have this power \nbecause essentially their mandate is ``the overall protection of the \npublic health.'' And this is the gravest crisis in public health we \nface in terms of a product that is unregulated, certainly in our \neconomy.\n  The DeWine amendment brings this issue to, I hope, resolution today. \nI hope we will give authority to the FDA to involve itself in the \ngreatest public health issue that faces the United States; that is, the \nconsumption of tobacco products.\n  This DeWine-Kennedy amendment also is very timely because less than a \nmonth ago a 50-year study was published in the British Medical Journal \nchronicling the outcomes of almost 35,000 British doctors who smoked.\n  This detailed, longitudinal study is the first one to clearly link \ncigarette smoke to lung cancer and show that on average, a life of \nsmoking will be a decade shorter than a life without smoking. Of the \n35,000 subjects, epidemiologist Richard Doll reports that almost half \nof all persistent cigarette smokers died because of smoking, and a \nquarter died before age 70. Perhaps more striking was a finding that \nquitting smoking can mitigate or even reverse these effects. For \ninstance, stop smoking by the time you are 30 and you will have the \nsame average life expectancy as a nonsmoker. Stop at 50 and you will \nlose only 4 years of life instead of 10.\n  Clearly, there is still time to help, and particularly to help the \nchildren of America. But that can only be done if the FDA has the power \nto regulate the sale and distribution of cigarettes.\n  That is something at the heart of the Kennedy-DeWine amendment. It \nwill ensure that children will not have easy access to tobacco products \nby restricting tobacco advertising and limiting the sale of cigarettes \nto face-to-face transactions where the purchaser's age can be verified. \nIt will provide for stronger warning labels and allow the FDA to change \ntheir text over time to keep their impact strong. And it would help the \n46 million Americans addicted to cigarettes by authorizing the FDA to \nreduce or remove hazardous ingredients from cigarettes, as science \nallows. These are important provisions that will have a real impact on \nthe health of all Americans, and it is no surprise that this \nlegislation has enlisted the strongest possible support of, among \nothers, the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, \nthe Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, and the American Lung Association.\n  We understand the dangers of cigarette smoking. This legislation will \nempower the Food and Drug Administration to confront those dangers head \non, to confront the most significant public health problem that faces \nAmerica. It will allow them particularly to protect children. It is \ntypical of the concern and the conscientious efforts of the two \nprincipal sponsors, Senators DeWine and Kennedy. I thank them for their \neffort, and I join them in this endeavor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his eloquent \nstatement.\n  There are still some who question whether the tobacco industry is \ntargeting young people. If anybody doubts that, I refer them to what \nthe tobacco industry is continuing to do as far as advertising. Sports \nIllustrated is read by adults, but it is certainly read by kids, \nanybody who has a teenager who is interested in sports. And you don't \nhave to be a teenager. Kids start reading Sports Illustrated when they \nare 9, 10 years old. I did. When you look at some of the advertising in \nSports Illustrated, it is absolutely, unbelievably focused on kids.\n  Here is an example. This is Sports Illustrated, 2002 NFL preview. \nLook at the back. An awful lot of kids are going to see that. Here is \nadvertising for smokeless tobacco. Just take a look at that. ``Where's \nthe chicks? Intense premium tobacco taste, Rooster, icy minute, the \nbold one.'' If that isn't targeted to kids, teenagers, I don't know \nwhat is.\n  The next one, if that is not targeted to young kids, I don't know \nwhat is. I suppose it is targeted to someone 22, 23, but it is also \ntargeted to someone 16. We know where they are going and what they are \ndoing.\n  Let me get back to some of the editorials. The Hartford Courant said \nit very well on June 14:\n\n       Four decades ago the Government linked smoking to lung \n     cancer and urged Americans to kick the habit.\n       Now the Surgeon General Richard Carmona says the impact on \n     health is ``even worse than we knew'' and has added nine \n     diseases to a growing list conclusively linked to cigarettes. \n     The latest includes leukemia, cataracts, pneumonia and \n     cancers of the cervix, kidney, pancreas, and stomach.\n       Although many people have quit, smoking remains the leading \n     contributor of death in America, killing 440,000 people each \n     year. Smokers typically die 13 to 14 years younger than do \n     nonsmokers. With 2 percent of adults smoking, the rate is \n     declining so slowly that the Government concedes it will not \n     meet its goal of 12 percent by 2010. The Surgeon General's \n     sobering report ought to stir Members of Congress to take up \n     legislation to give the Food and Drug Administration \n     authority to regulate tobacco. A proposed bill would let the \n     FDA prohibit the marketing of tobacco to minors, require \n     stronger warning labels, a listing of ingredients on \n     packages, and limit the use of harmful chemicals in the \n     product.\n\n\n[[Page S8161]]\n\n\n  That was from the Hartford Courant.\n  An editorial from the Columbus Dispatch, May 30:\n\n       Congress needs to grant FDA the power to regulate big \n     tobacco. Because of its long history of reckless disregard \n     for the truth, the tobacco industry is in dire need of strong \n     Federal regulation. The latest demonstration of industry \n     irresponsibility is the introduction of cigarettes in flavors \n     such as mandarin mint and mocha taboo. Such cigarettes would \n     seem to be a violation of the multibillion-dollar 1998 \n     tobacco settlement which was supposed to prohibit tobacco \n     companies from marketing to minors. This isn't the first time \n     the tobacco companies have blown smoke in the face of the \n     tobacco settlement. A study in the New England Journal of \n     Medicine reported in August 2001 that tobacco companies spent \n     more on advertising in youth-oriented magazines in the 2 \n     years after the agreement was signed than they did in the \n     year it was signed. Let's not forget the years of lies \n     spewed by the tobacco companies as they claimed cigarettes \n     posed little or no danger to smokers, all the while \n     knowing the deadly truth. Congress needs to pass it. Then \n     the FDA needs to take aggressive action. The tobacco \n     companies have operated for far too long with inadequate \n     oversight, leaving death in their wake. It is time for \n     Congress to stand up for the people and grant the FDA the \n     power to crack down on this irresponsible industry.\n\n  So said the Columbus Dispatch on May 30 of this year.\n  The Hartford Courant again, another editorial, January 26, 2004:\n\n       The U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulates food, drugs \n     and medical devices, but it has no authority over tobacco \n     products which annually are linked to millions of deaths.\n       When he was FDA commissioner in 1994, David Kessler \n     proposed regulation of cigarettes, but the Supreme Court \n     nixed the idea, saying only Congress could give the agency \n     such power.\n       Giving the FDA oversight of a product that is detrimental \n     to public health seems like a matter of common sense. \n     Congress, however, hasn't seen it that way.\n       The FDA has long performed a critical service by testing \n     and regulating consumer products to ensure safety. That \n     authority should extend to tobacco.\n\n  Another editorial, this one from the Akron Beacon Journal, dated June \n28 of this year:\n\n       The Federal Food and Drug Administration can make \n     manufacturers disclose what goes into your bottled water, \n     foods and medications. [But] it can't make tobacco companies \n     reveal what goes into their cigarettes and other tobacco \n     products. The agency can demand that drug companies support \n     with research the health claims they make for their products. \n     [But] not so with tobacco companies.\n       Tobacco products were identified as leading causes of \n     cancers, heart disease, and other serious ailments decades \n     ago. They account for billions of dollars in health care \n     costs and are a factor in the deaths of several hundred \n     thousand people every year. It is long past time to put the \n     products under regulations at least as strict as those for \n     ice cream.\n\n  The Akron Beacon Journal continues:\n\n       It has been four years since the U.S. Supreme Court told \n     the Food and Drug Administration and its commissioner at the \n     time, David Kessler, that Congress had not given the \n     authority to regulate tobacco products. Congress has an \n     opportunity to fill the void through bipartisan bills \n     recently introduced in the Senate by Ohio's Mike DeWine, a \n     Republican, and Democrat Edward Kennedy, and in the House by \n     Tom Davis, a Virginia Republican, and Henry Waxman, a \n     Democrat from California.\n       This legislation would grant the FDA the necessary \n     authority, none too soon, to protect the public health and \n     guard children, in particular, against addictive and risky \n     tobacco use.\n       Among other provisions, the legislation would give the FDA \n     approval authority over all new tobacco products entering the \n     market, bar the use in tobacco products of flavors that are \n     enticing to children, and restrict advertising and promotions \n     that target children. It also would require companies to \n     provide research information for claims on reduced-risk \n     products and to submit a list of product contents and \n     components, including the paper and filters.\n\n  This is an editorial from the Akron Beacon Journal, June 28, 2004.\n  Mr. President, we are getting close to the end of this debate. I say \nto any of my colleagues who have any desire to come to the floor of the \nSenate and argue in favor of this amendment or come to the floor and \nargue in opposition to the amendment, we are getting close to closing \nout this debate. I invite them to come to the Senate floor. We are \ngetting very close to coming to the end of the debate. Now would be the \nappropriate time to come to the floor.\n  At this point, I yield to my colleague, Senator Lautenberg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Ohio for the \ngood work he so often does on behalf of the safety and well-being of \nyoung people. Therefore, it is no surprise to see Senator DeWine \nsponsoring or creating this kind of amendment--something that can \nmarkedly affect the well-being of children in our society in general.\n  I want to lend my support to the DeWine-Kennedy amendment, to see if \nwe cannot finally get past these years of delay and obstruction, to \npermit the FDA to have jurisdiction over tobacco products. It is long \noverdue, and I am hopeful that the Senate will take this historic step \ntoday.\n  There are very few people my age who weren't induced to smoke by all \nkinds of influences. When I was a soldier many years ago in Europe \nduring the war, the thing we used to look for in our emergency pack was \nthe little packet of four free cigarettes. We never realized it, but \nthe military was marketing for the cigarette companies, because once \nsomeone had a few cigarettes, that was it for almost a lifetime. \nNothing, other than perhaps some illegal drugs, illicit drugs, such as \ncocaine, is more addictive than tobacco. Perhaps even they don't \ncompare.\n  I used to smoke. I smoked a lot. Fortunately, my youngest daughter, \nwho was about 7 years old at the time, had more sense than I did. She \nsaid to me: Daddy, today we learned in school that if you smoke, you \nget a black box in your throat.'' She said, ``I love you; I don't want \nyou to have a black box in your throat.'' That was after dozens of \ntimes that I tried to stop smoking. I smoked for 25 years. There were \ndozens of times I swore I would stop smoking and never could quite \nmuster the energy or conviction to do it. But when she gave me that \nmessage, within 3 days I was no longer smoking. All I had to do was \nremember how her eyes looked at me so pleadingly and said, ``Daddy, \nstop smoking.'' That was it for me.\n  When I came to the Senate, I was determined to do something where I \nmight be able to protect Americans, especially our young people, from \nthe dangers of tobacco. I am pleased to have worked on tobacco control, \nstarting long before it became a mainstream issue.\n  In 1987, along with now-Senator Durbin, formerly Congressman Durbin, \nwe authored the law banning smoking on airplanes. It was a tough fight \nand it was said, ``You will never get it done.'' But we persisted and \nconvinced a lot of people that changing the rules about smoking in \nairplanes was worthwhile. It had a long, arduous trip. First, we were \nable to negotiate for 3 hours, or 2 hours, and settle for 2 hours, with \na promise that we would examine the result and maybe change our minds \nin 18 months and relent.\n  I had a friend in the tobacco business, and one day he said to me, \n``Frank, come on, this hasn't been proven dangerous yet.'' This goes \nback to the 1980s. I said, ``I'll tell you what. If you can convince \nyour father and the other members of your family to start smoking and \nconfirm that they smoke two packs a day, and do it for a year, I will \ncall off my opposition.'' Obviously, that never happened. They knew how \ndangerous tobacco was, as did the manufacturers of tobacco products \ngoing back to the 1930s.\n  The addiction and the harm that comes from nicotine was widely known \nby the people in the industry, again, in the 1930s. We saw that once \nnonsmokers could experience a smoke-free environment in the cabin of an \nairplane, they began to demand it in more places than that. It changed \nthings radically for people who were unable to fly because they had \nrespiratory conditions. And they learned something. If cabin attendants \nwho didn't smoke were on a flight, they learned that the nicotine \nresidue could last for many days after in their body fluids. So it was \npervasive. The attitude on tobacco began to change radically.\n  I had an opportunity to write further law, and I put into the \nstatutes a law that required that any building that children inhabited, \nwhether it was a library, hospital, youth hostel, daycare center, could \nnot have any smoking present unless it was in a confined room, a single \nroom that was ventilated to the outside, as long as Federal\n\n[[Page S8162]]\n\nmoney was being given there. That succeeded in turning into law and \nprotecting our children even further.\n  I have long supported FDA jurisdiction over tobacco--a milestone I \nhope we will reach today.\n  Mr. President, make no mistake, tobacco addiction is still a huge \nproblem in America. Tobacco continues to be the No. 1 cause of \npreventable death and disease in our Nation.\n  Each year, tobacco claims over 430,000 lives in the United States and \nserious health impairment occurs as a result of tobacco--emphysema, \nheart trouble, all kinds of terrible conditions associated with \ntobacco.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control, if current tobacco use \ncontinues in the United States, an estimated 6.4 million children will \ndie prematurely from a smoking-related disease. This is alarming \nbecause every day nearly 5,000 young people buy cigarettes for the \nfirst time.\n  Once again, that addiction is enormous. In addition to the human \ncosts, huge economic costs occur in our Nation. It is estimated that \ndirect medical expenditures attributed to smoking total now more than \n$75 billion each and every year.\n  Despite all of this, the Food and Drug Administration has not been \nable to take action to reduce tobacco's harm on society. By way of \nexample, right now the FDA, as we have seen on a poster displayed here, \ncan regulate a box of macaroni and cheese but not a pack of cigarettes. \nIf you want to know the ingredients in macaroni and cheese, it is on \nthe label. But for cigarettes, there is scant information on \ningredients, toxins, chemicals, et cetera. It makes no sense.\n  Today, we have worthless health warnings, no control over what \ntobacco companies claim about the relative health effects of their \nproducts, no authority to curtail tobacco marketing to kids, and no \nability to order the industry to remove especially hazardous \ningredients.\n  The amendment before us today has the support of the entire public \nhealth community, including the American Cancer Society, the American \nHeart Association, the American Lung Association, and the Campaign--an \neffective campaign, by the way--for Tobacco-Free Kids.\n  Today, we have a historic opportunity to give the FDA the legal \nauthority it needs to prohibit tobacco advertising that targets \nchildren, the authority to prevent sale of tobacco products to minors, \nand the authority to make tobacco products less toxic than they need to \nbe, although I am very suspicious about that because there is much \nmisleading advertising talking about tobacco light cigarettes, et \ncetera. There is no assurance they are less lethal than ordinary \ncigarettes. We want to give them the authority to prevent the tobacco \nindustry from misleading the public about the dangers of smoking.\n  I join with other colleagues and hope that we can muster enough \nsupport for this bill to give the U.S. Food and Drug Administration the \nauthority it needs to regulate tobacco, as it does other drugs. We owe \nit to families across this country. We owe it to young people who think \nit is going to be a kick, but it is a kick they will remember for the \nrest of their lives once they start.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank all the cosponsors of this \namendment for their good work. Senator Hollings has done an excellent \njob. I congratulate him, as well as the other cosponsors. I thank my \ncolleague, Senator Lautenberg, for his very eloquent remarks. He and I \nhave worked on issues that affect public safety. He has been a leader \nin highway safety. He and I have been on this floor together and have \nworked on legislation that we hope has saved the lives of children. He \nhas been a good partner. I appreciate his comments again today. It is \ngood to be working with him again.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If I may intervene, Mr. President, for one moment, \nwith Senator DeWine's approval, we worked on issues that focus on \nprotecting children's health in particular. We want the drunks off the \nhighways. We want to get tobacco out of the grasp of children. We want \nthem not to be seduced into smoking to look like they are bigshots, \nlike they have grown up to a point. I remember the days--and I am sure \nthe Senator from Ohio does--when athletes were endorsing tobacco \nproducts and doctors were endorsing tobacco products. Thank goodness we \ndo not have that anymore.\n  I commend the Senator from Ohio. I have always enjoyed working with \nhim on issues. I pay my respects to his excellent work on this \namendment. I hope it is adopted.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague's good comments \nbut, more importantly, I appreciate his good work.\n  I know from talking to a few of my colleagues that there is some \nreluctance to grant the FDA this authority. I want to make a few \ncomments directly to those colleagues.\n  I do not think there should be this reluctance. We do not worry about \nhaving a product, such as macaroni and cheese, that has labeling \ninformation on it. We have come to accept that. We have come to think \nit is a pretty good idea to know what is in a product. If tomorrow we \nwent to the grocery store and all this information on the side panel, \nnutrition facts, was all blank, some of us would think that was rather \nstrange. We have come to accept that. We think it is OK. In fact, we \nexpect it. It is the right thing to do. We want to know what is in the \nproduct.\n  Every product we buy, from bottled water to macaroni and cheese, we \nknow what is in it, every product except tobacco. Every product we \nconsume we know what is in it; there is a label; it is regulated, \nexcept tobacco.\n  How did we get here? We got here because there is an anomaly in the \nlaw. Without going through all the lawyer talk and all the \nconstitutional and statutory history, basically the Supreme Court \nlooked at Congress and said: If you guys want to change that and give \nFDA the authority to regulate tobacco, too, you have to do it. You are \nthe ones who have to do it. That is why we are here today. We are the \nones who have to do it. It makes sense for us to pass legislation that \nsays to the FDA: You go ahead and do it. That is what this is all \nabout.\n  This is not exactly a radical idea or a revolutionary idea. The only \nreason it sounds strange is we have just never done it before. But it \nis time to do it.\n  It is also time, when the tobacco companies make outlandish claims \nabout low tar and ultra light, for them to be held to the same \nstandards as the macaroni and cheese is or the milk. There are certain \nstandards, and when you say the food product is thus and so, it has to \nbe thus and so. There are certain standards. It ought to be the same \nway with tobacco.\n  Again, all we are saying is they ought to be held to the same \nstandards as anything else we put into our bodies.\n  We all know that even tobacco, a legal product, if used as it is \nintended to be used, is still dangerous.\n  So it still makes common sense to have some regulation and have the \nFDA do it. So this is not a radical, crazy idea. This just makes good, \ncommon sense. The reason it is in front of us is because the courts \nhave said, if the FDA is going to have this authority, it has to be \ngiven to them and it has to be given to them by statute, and we are \nsimply giving it to them by statute. So in a sense, it is a simple bill \nthat a quirk in history, a quirk in the law previously, has brought us \nto this point. So we are the ones who are doing it.\n  That is one major part of the bill. The other major part of the bill \nis to say we are going to control how they market this dangerous \nproduct, and there is no doubt it is a dangerous product. That debate \nended years ago. Legal, yes, but dangerous, yes. We have a right, as a \nsociety, to control how this dangerous product is marketed to children, \nand we are going to control that within the bounds of the first \namendment.\n  The court is going to confine us to the first amendment. We are not \ngoing to violate the first amendment because the courts are not going \nto allow us to do that. But we are going to confine it and say there \nare limits. Kids cannot be targeted because it is a dangerous product. \nThere is no dispute it is a dangerous product. We know it is a \ndangerous product. We cannot make it illegal for all the reasons we \nknow we cannot make it illegal because that just is not going to work. \nProhibition will not work. But it is dangerous.\n\n[[Page S8163]]\n\n  We do not want kids to get addicted. We know that most people who \nsmoke today started smoking when they were minors. We know if one makes \nit to 19 or 20 and they have not started smoking they are probably \nnever going to smoke in their life. So there is an inherent societal \ninterest in not having our kids smoke before they are 19 or 20. If they \ncan make it that far, they are probably going to be OK.\n  So we have an interest in not allowing these companies to target \nyoung kids, and we are going to do everything we can within the \nconfines of the Constitution, and that is what this bill is trying to \ndo and will do.\n  This bill will save lives. It will save lives because we are going to \nallow the FDA to do what it can in regard to regulation, and because we \nare going to allow more regulation in regard to advertising a lot of \nlives will be saved by this bill. It is the right thing to do. The time \nfor the bill is now.\n  I see my colleague from Georgia is on the floor, and I yield to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I thank the Senator from Ohio for yielding me some \ntime to talk a about this bill today. I want to talk about three \nthings. First, with respect to the issue of smoking, all of us know and \nnow understand that smoking is hazardous to one's health. There is \nsimply no question about that. That is not even in the debate. \nFortunately, I am one who has never smoked in my life, but I come from \na part of the country, as does the Presiding Officer, where tobacco has \nbeen a mainstay. So I want to talk about the effect of what we are \ndoing today is going to have on tobacco-growing regions of our country.\n  Tobacco has been a mainstay of the agricultural community since the \nIndians first inhabited this country. Tobacco has been a product that \nhas been traded and bartered for literally hundreds of years, both in \nAmerica as well as outside of America. In my part of the country, which \nis a heavy growing tobacco area, it has been the mainstay and the \nstaple product of small family farms for literally hundreds of years. \nThat is going to be coming to an end, in my opinion, with the passage \nof this legislation.\n  The tobacco industry has taken any number of hits over the last two \ndecades, and some of it for the right reasons. We need to educate \npeople about the hazards of smoking tobacco. We need to educate people \nthat if they do smoke, it is likely going to kill them.\n  The fact is, there are a number of individuals in this country who \nhaving been educated have still made a conscious decision to use \ntobacco products. The last thing I think we need for the Federal \nGovernment to do is to intrude further into the lives of Americans and \nsay they cannot do this.\n  Now, that is one thing we are doing with this legislation. I think it \ngoes that far. Maybe not saying one absolutely cannot do it but it is \npretty well going to limit the number of customers to future tobacco \ngrowers and future tobacco manufacturers in this country, which means \nthat jobs in the tobacco industry are going to be moving out of this \ncountry and we are going to see a complete overhaul and change in that \nmanufacturing sector, as well as in the growing sector.\n  I can remember very well in my hometown where we had three tobacco \nmarkets, and we used to sell all tobacco at the auction market. We \nwould have buyers come in every summer and all of the farmers and their \nfamilies would go to the tobacco market on opening day. We would \nliterally have an auction bale by bale or pile by pile of tobacco that \nwould be bought by one of the tobacco companies and used in the \nmanufacturing of various tobacco products.\n  As soon as that auction was completed on the sale of the farmer's \ntobacco, he would take his family downtown in my hometown, and this \nhappened literally across dozens of other communities in the South, and \nhe would buy the family clothes for school that year. The opening day \nof the tobacco markets was a big deal because that is the product that \nprovided the income for the family farmer for literally hundreds of \nyears in the South.\n  Today, it still does. Even though over the years with the attacks \nthat have been made on the tobacco industry and we have seen the \ntobacco quota cut in half, our farmers are generating half the income \ntoday with about double the expenses that they were 20 years ago. This \nis simply because the demand for tobacco has decreased due to Federal \nregulations and because we are seeing imported tobacco replace domestic \ntobacco. This is a result of the price that the farmer needs to receive \ndue to the cost of production that he faces each and every year.\n  What we are doing today to that farmer is we are going to increase \nthe price even more. We are going to make him less competitive and we \nare, as a practical matter, going to drive the American farmer out of \nthe tobacco-growing business, which is going to be a change in a way of \nlife for many small towns across the South. Is it the right thing to \ndo?\n\n  Well, I am not sure everything in this bill, outside of the FDA, is \nperfect, but I do agree with the way we are doing it and the reasons \nwhy we are doing it. Now I am going to talk about the FDA for a minute.\n  What we are saying to the tobacco farmer is, look, we gave you a \nquota that you earned over the years through your growth of tobacco. We \nknow you bought this quota in some instances and in some instances it \nwas passed down from father to son to grandson. In some instances you \nbought it when you bought the farm. But in any event, a price was paid \nfor the ownership of the tobacco quota. Today, we have cut your asset \nthat you bought and paid for by 50 percent just in the last 5 years. We \nhave taken the ability away from you to generate an income sufficient \nto meet the needs of the quality of life that your family is used to \nliving.\n  So what we are doing is compensating those farmers. We are going to \ngive some money to them for this quota that we have taken away. We are \nnow going to take it all away and, even though we did not compensate \nthem for that 50 percent they have lost in the past 5 years, we are \ngoing to compensate them for the remaining quota that they have. I \nthink that is a fair and reasonable thing for us to do.\n  I have been adamant from the very first day that we engaged in this \nissue regarding the buyout, and I have been working on this for 4 years \nnow, but we have been very adamant that the taxpayer ought not to fund \nthis buyout.\n   I don't think that is right. I don't think we should use money from \nother valuable programs to pay for this buyout. I think it can be \nfunded in the right way, by those folks who use tobacco products.\n  Is that going to be injurious to the tobacco industry? You bet it is. \nBut that is the only way it should be funded in a reasonable and \nrational society in which we live today when you are dealing with such \na controversial product.\n  What this bill does is it provides compensation to the tobacco \ngrower, compensation to the quota holder, and the funding of that \ncompensation to be paid for by those individuals who use tobacco \nproducts. That is fair and reasonable, and I support that aspect of \nthis particular amendment wholeheartedly.\n  Last, I want to talk about FDA. I have been very strongly opposed to \nthe inclusion of FDA regulation in any tobacco buyout bill or as a \nstand-alone without a buyout. However, I intend to support this today \nbecause it is the only means by which we are going to get this buyout \nbill done. I support it because I hope that in conference we are going \nto be able to change some of the provisions that are included in the \nFDA portion of this amendment. I want to mention some of those \nspecifically.\n  First of all, what we are granting to the FDA in this amendment is \nthis: It will grant FDA indirect authority to mandate changes in \nfarming practices. This bill places no limits whatsoever on FDA \nauthority to reduce or ban compounds found naturally in tobacco leaf. \nMany new mandates FDA is likely to adopt will be achievable only \nthrough dramatic changes in tobacco farming operations--for example, \nchanges in things like types of soils where tobacco may be grown, \nchanges in cultivation practices or even curing techniques. If we think \nthat by passing this bill we are not going to put FDA on the farm, we \nare wrong. That is simply going to happen.\n  Next, the bill would give FDA extremely broad authority to regulate\n\n[[Page S8164]]\n\nadvertising, sale, and promotion of tobacco products, thus giving the \nbigger tobacco companies a tremendous advantage over smaller tobacco \ncompanies. The effect of that is going to be this: Anyone who does \nsmoke--and I encourage everybody to quit smoking--but if you are going \nto smoke and you are going to buy tobacco products, when you go into \nthe 7-Eleven to buy a pack of cigarettes, they are not going to be \nvisible. The only thing you are going to be able to do is either tell \nthe proprietor of that store, Let me see all of your tobacco products, \nor you are going to walk in and announce what brand of cigarettes you \nwant to buy.\n  We all know that name-brand identification is key to marketing of any \nproduct, particularly when it comes to something like tobacco. The \nbigger companies who have been around for years and years and have made \nbrand names very popular and very identifiable are going to be the \nsuccessful entrepreneurs and the successful companies at the end of the \nday. The smaller companies that have come into business in the last \nseveral years do not have a chance. We are telling those companies: We \nare sorry but nobody knows the name of your product, so, in effect, \nnobody is going to walk up to the counter and say: I want a pack of \nthat cigarette brand that was started just a couple of years ago. That \nis not going to happen. We are going to put the smaller companies \ntotally out of business, in my opinion, and we are going to make the \nbigger companies bigger. They are going to still keep marketing \ntobacco, they are still going to keep selling tobacco, and it will \ncontinue to have the same harmful effect it has today.\n  Again, the FDA should focus on its primary business. It is widely \nacknowledged that the FDA approval process for new drugs is not as fast \nas it could or should be. If the FDA has additional regulations to \nadminister to make cigarette products safe, it will no doubt remove the \nprimary mandate of ensuring a safe food supply and safe effective \ndrugs.\n\n  In effect, what we are going to do with the passage of this bill is \nto put the FDA on the fender of every tractor that is driving across a \ntobacco field in the South. It is going to be a new day for a lot of us \nwho come from very rural areas where tobacco has been a mainstay of the \neconomy of our particular counties and communities. It is not going to \nbe a very pleasant day. But on that day, if it is going to happen, we \nneed to make sure those individuals who have made it their life's work \nto grow a legal product and send it to a manufacturer to manufacture in \na legal way will get some compensation to offset the negative impact \nthis is going to have on their lives. We need to make sure as we do \nthis we do not get unreasonable with respect to the thousands and \nthousands of jobs that are dependent upon this industry.\n  Tobacco products are going to be sold anyway. My guess is it is going \nto be manufactured by offshore manufacturing facilities in Europe or \nsome other country and shipped into the United States. These jobs are \ngoing to be lost here and moved to those facilities. If it is going to \nhappen, we need to make sure that the individuals at the very lowest \nlevel, at the grower level, are compensated for the loss they are going \nto have.\n  I compliment my friend from Ohio, who has been very open to discuss \nthis issue. I know he feels just as passionately about his amendment \nand making sure that we strengthen FDA regulations. I respect that. We \njust happen to disagree on this particular issue.\n  But I say, too, my friends over on the House side--Congressman \nRichard Burr from North Carolina, Congressman Jack Kingston from my \nState of Georgia, Congressman Bill Jenkins from Tennessee--that have \nbeen real stalwarts in making sure they included the buyout provision \nin the FSC/ETI bill, thank you for your hard work. We are here today to \nmake sure a buyout is included the Senate bill.\n  I am very hopeful in the conference committee, as it moves forward, \nthey will look at the result of this FDA regulation. What we as \nconservatives need to think about is keeping the Government out of our \ndaily lives on a more regular basis rather than putting the Government \non the shoulder of every individual in the tobacco industry, more than \nthey are today. I believe that is wrong. I do not think that is the \nroute we ought to take. But I am going to support this amendment simply \nbecause it appears that is the only way we can get a buyout that is \ngoing to adequately compensate our tobacco farmers.\n  I thank the Senator from Ohio for yielding the time. I thank him for \nhis cooperation in moving this amendment forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Georgia for his \nstatement. Obviously we have a disagreement about the impact of FDA on \nfarmers. He knows I do not agree with him in regard to that impact. The \nlanguage of this bill is pretty clear. I believe we have done a good \njob keeping the FDA away from the farmers, but that is certainly \nsomething we can discuss in the future.\n  Let me yield to my colleague from North Carolina who has just come to \nthe Senate floor, Senator Dole.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, significant progress has been made toward \nachievement of a tobacco quota buyout which our farm families and rural \ncommunities in North Carolina and other tobacco-producing States so \ndesperately need. A few weeks ago, thanks to the commitment and hard \nwork, in particular, of Richard Burr and Mike McIntyre from the North \nCarolina delegation as well as Chairman Thomas and House leadership, a \ntobacco buyout passed the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. \nToday, we have the historic opportunity to get a tobacco buyout across \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate. I thank Senator McConnell for his \nlegislation and his leadership in bringing us to this point.\n  Why should we go along with the tobacco buyout on the FSC/ETI bill? \nWhy is a buyout necessary? Because the status quo is simply not an \noption. If nothing happens this year, according to noted agricultural \neconomist Blake Brown, tobacco families and farmers face a 33-percent \ncut in quotas for the 2005 crop year.\n  Let's take a look at how we got where we are today. Look at this \nchart. By 1996, tobacco farmers had experienced 7 straight years of a \nstable and significant supply of quota. In 1997, quota increased 12 \npercent, leading many farmers to expand their operations. Barns were \nbought to cure more tobacco, equipment was bought to replace that which \nwas worn out, and land and quota was bought to make their operations \nmore efficient. Significant amounts of money were borrowed to make \nthese investments.\n  Since 1997, quota has dropped almost 60 percent. Farmers still have \noutstanding loans at the bank to pay for quota they no longer have. To \nput this in layman's language, this type of cut in quota is equivalent \nto cutting your paycheck more than half while you are still paying the \nbank for an asset you no longer own.\n  The current devastation our farm families and their rural communities \nface is certainly not of their making. The current tobacco program was \nnever designed to accommodate the significant changes that have \nengulfed this industry. It is an outdated New Deal program that is \ndiscouraging purchases of American tobacco by domestic and foreign \nbuyers because it has made the United States uncompetitive on the world \nmarket. Foreign buyers who once looked to the U.S. market are now \npurchasing tobacco from other countries and bypassing the U.S. market \naltogether for their supply.\n\n  The numbers do not lie: The U.S. now accounts for only 7 percent of \nall flue-cured tobacco production in the world. Let me be clear: All we \nare doing under current policy is allowing countries such as Brazil and \nChina to reap the economic benefits of worldwide tobacco production. We \nare not reducing overall tobacco production--we are simply allowing it \nto be siphoned off by other countries.\n  Let me bring a little more perspective to the buyout of quota. People \nin North Carolina and other tobacco-growing States invested in tobacco \nquota since the 1930's. The Government created this asset--allowing it \nto be bought and sold. As a result, the value of quota makes up a \nsubstantial portion of many farmers' balance sheets.\n\n[[Page S8165]]\n\nThe value of quota is recognized by county governments; it is taxed \njust like land and other assets. In fact, tobacco quota is even subject \nto the inheritance tax.\n  It is estimated that more than 60 percent of the tobacco farmers \ntoday will exit the business entirely if a tobacco buyout is achieved. \nMost are at retirement age, just hanging on a little while longer in \nhopes of being able to pay off their debts. They have hung on and \ncontinued to produce in hopes that things would get better, knowing \nthat if they got out now they would have to sell their farm and \nliquidate other assets to settle up with their lenders. Even with a \nbuyout, many will still be short.\n  Every week my office continues to receive numerous calls from tobacco \nfarm families in desperation. There is a deep feeling of helplessness. \nAnd all they can do is get on their knees and pray that those of us who \nhave been given the privilege of serving in Congress will act--and act \nsoon.\n  A tobacco quota buyout is sorely needed. It will allow those who want \nto pay off their debts, and who want to retire, the opportunity to do \nso with dignity. The opportunity to know that all they have worked for \nhas not been in vain. It will allow the widow whose sole source of \nretirement income is from quota rent and social security the \nopportunity to get a fair return in exchange for the taking of her \nquota.\n  If nothing happens this year, these farmers will be forced to give up \nall that they have. After 6 years of loaning on collateral, there is \nnothing left for the banks to do except foreclose, especially with \nanother 33 percent cut in quota for the 2005 crop year on the horizon. \nThere will be no holding out for just a while longer. This may sound \nlike rhetoric to some, but it is the precise truth for countless \nthousands of farm families. I have been there to see it and I could not \nbe more dead serious about this. Status quo is simply not an option.\n  It is absolutely critical that this legislation is achieved this \nyear, and I am grateful for the progress that has been made to get this \nbill to conference. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nensure that this much needed legislation becomes reality.\n  It is either now--or never. These rural citizens--the very ones who \nhave helped make this country great--are barely hanging on for their \nvery survival. And it is not just them. It is the retailers, equipment \ndealers, chemical and fertilizer dealers and a whole array of small \nlocal businesses. These are the very small businesses that create the \nmajority of new jobs in tobacco-producing States--and jobs that are \nmuch needed. With enactment of a tobacco buyout, rural communities will \nbe able to grow back the jobs that have since left our borders and \nrestore hope to countless families who have labored all of their lives \nunder the sun to feed and clothe America and the world.\n  My State has thrived on traditional industries such as textiles, \nfurniture and tobacco. In recent years, thousands upon thousands of \njobs have been lost--leaving rural economies devastated and creating \npockets of poverty in many of North Carolina's counties.\n  And now, as tobacco farmers and rural communities reach for a life-\nline, we have the opportunity to help them. Rather than conceding \ntobacco production to countries such as China, rather than allowing \nforeclosures to thousands of farmers, rather than allowing the negative \neconomic ripple effect to be felt throughout rural southeastern \nAmerica, let us do the right thing for our farmers and rural \ncommunities.\n  It is way past the time for us to take action, and getting this bill \nto conference is a very important and critical step.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Carolina \nfor her eloquent comments.\n  At this time, I yield time to my friend and colleague from the State \nof Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleague, Senator \nDeWine, for yielding.\n  Let me commend the eloquent remarks of the Senator from North \nCarolina, Mrs. Dole. Her remarks are the same sentiments that I will be \nexpressing, maybe not with the same eloquence but with the exact same \nconcern we both share for the citizens of North Carolina and Virginia.\n  I also thank Senator Chambliss for looking out for the people of his \nState. But most importantly, when we listen to the remarks of the \nSenators from Virginia, from North Carolina, from Georgia, South \nCarolina, Kentucky, and Tennessee, it is common sense why this is such \nan important issue for the people of our States, for our economies, and \nthe opportunities for many people.\n  I commend Senator DeWine for his efforts in this regard. But mostly I \nwant to commend Senator McConnell of Kentucky for his leadership. He \nhas worked very hard, along with the others of us in the tobacco-\ngrowing States in this effort to achieve a tobacco quota buyout.\n  In the other body, as was stated by Senator Dole, Congressman Burr \nand Congressman McIntyre worked very hard, as well as Congressman \nVirgil Goode from Southside Virginia. I know many of my colleagues have \nsaid on many occasions that it is all important to be advocating \npolicies and ideas that promote freedom, that promote job \nopportunities, and improve the competitiveness of America. That is why \nI think we must equitably find a way to end this tobacco quota system.\n  As I said, I agree with the comments of Senator Dole and Senator \nChambliss who spoke before me. But some people question, ``Why is it so \nimportant to end this outdated, old, punitive quota system?'' The \nreason it is important is because it is antiquated, it is a restrictive \nquota system which harms the ability of tobacco-growing families to \nearn a living by artificially increasing their costs of production \nbecause they have to pay the quota holder.\n  If you are producing a product and you have added costs per pound, \nthose dollars per pound for the right to grow has to go into the price \nfor which you sell that product. Otherwise, you keep running a loss and \nyou go bankrupt. Senator Dole was talking about the similar experiences \nfarmers are having in her State. I know these tobacco-growing families \nare hard-working families in Southside and Southwest Virginia who have \nworked long and hard hours on these farms. Their families have owned \nthose farms and those lands for many years. Growing is not easy. You \nhave to prepare the soil, you have to get seedlings going, you have to \nplant them at the right time, and you have to tend the crop. You have \nto worry about pests and mold. Then there is the harvesting which has \nto be done, whether it is flue-cured or whether it is a burley tobacco \nwhich has different harvesting requirements, and then the curing of \nthat crop after you have harvested. It is a lot of hard work.\n  In Virginia, there is estimated to be about 8,400 tobacco farmers and \nmore than 120,000 tobacco-related jobs throughout the Commonwealth of \nVirginia. Virginia is the fifth largest tobacco-producing State. It is \nthe second largest manufacturer of tobacco products. Virginia is the \nlargest exporter of tobacco products. Clearly, tobacco plays an \nimportant role in Virginia's economy, agricultural or otherwise.\n  These tobacco-growing families and farmers and communities in my own \nState of Virginia, as well as many other tobacco-growing States, need \nthis quota buyout to remain competitive in the world marketplace. They \nhave to be competitive because our States are not the only places in \nthe world that grow tobacco. It is grown all over the world, whether it \nis in South America, Africa, or Asia. Without getting rid of this quota \nsystem, we stand to lose thousands of jobs at a time when a lot of our \nmanufacturing base is being lost to other countries.\n\n  There are provisions--and I know the Senator from Georgia, Mr. \nChambliss mentioned this--in this amendment which I do not favor, \nspecifically, the potentially burdensome oversight by the FDA on \nmerchants who sell tobacco products. However, I believe this buyout is \nneeded to allow an important element of our American economy to \nsurvive. This buyout will allow farmers who wish to continue to grow \ntobacco to do so in a competitive environment or at least allow them to \nbetter compete. If they do not care to grow it any longer, they will be \nable to use this buyout in a way to find a transition to\n\n[[Page S8166]]\n\nsome other farming or another line of work, rather than allowing this \njust to continue, which will be a long suffering collapse and disaster \neconomically for those families.\n  We talk about many of the farmers. One of the farmer's name is Kevin \nMottley, a fourth-generation young farmer who says he wants to carry on \nwith his family tradition. That is something to be proud of. We are \nhappy to hear that. Of course, he is talking about a tough situation \nwith international competition, but he wrote that, ``With the recent \ncuts in tobacco quotas and prices on other farm commodities down, it's \nharder to keep our farm operating.''\n  That is the economic impact on a real farmer, a real person, in \nVirginia. He understands this buyout is not only important for \nindividual families; it is also important for the communities that \ndepend on the strength of the tobacco-growing segment of our economy. \nThe current quota system makes Virginia-grown tobacco less competitive \nversus foreign-grown tobacco. While U.S.-grown tobacco is generally a \nbetter quality, it does cost much more due to this onerous quota \nsystem. Thus, the cigarette manufacturers are using or have an \nincentive to use more foreign-grown tobacco.\n  As less tobacco is grown, it is less profitable, obviously, to \ngrowing families in this country and also in their communities and \ncounties in which they are farming. If we can achieve this buyout, it \nwill make U.S. tobacco more competitive, thus positively impacting the \neconomies of rural communities and towns.\n  Some will grouse about the cost of this buyout. I believe it is fair \ncompensation to end this government program. Well, look at how much the \nFederal Government taxes tobacco. There is a 39-cent tax per pack of \ncigarettes. The Federal Government garners about $8 billion a year on \ntobacco taxes. Throw in all the State and local taxes, heck, it is \naround $30 billion. Beginning July 1st, 2005, Virginia cigarette taxes \nwill increase to 30 cents a pack. Those that will be hurt by this \nincrease are all the businesses along the Tennessee and North Carolina \nborders. Raising those taxes means they will lose sales at those \nconvenience stores and country stores.\n  The Federal Government gets plenty of money, $8 billion a year, from \ntaxing tobacco. We need to realize when farms are hurt, it also hurts \nour economy. When the tobacco farming sector suffers, there are other \nnon-tobacco sectors that are affected, as well. The economic losses \nassociated with the recent changes in the tobacco sector have resulted \nin the loss of more than 57,000 jobs in the six major tobacco-growing \nStates. While the primary sector affected is the tobacco-growing \nsector, losing more than 39,500 jobs, these tobacco sector job losses \ncreated an additional loss of nearly 18,000 jobs in the non-tobacco \nsectors.\n  It demonstrates that the tobacco production prices impact such \ndiverse businesses as local farm supply stores, banks, health care \nproviders, manufacturers, retail businesses, and many others in the \nnon-farm sector in these communities.\n\n  One needs to understand there is no crop that produces the yield per \nacre that tobacco does. When the tobacco quota is reduced, that affects \nall of the money, all of the revenues available within these rural \ncommunities.\n  I have previously stated I am not in favor of FDA regulation. The \nreality, however, is that it has been joined to this measure. It is the \nway that the salutary, vitally necessary quota buyout will be addressed \ntoday in the Senate.\n  I am voting for this because of the quota buyout. I hope the \nconference report--I know Senator DeWine may not have the same hopes \nbut I will express my views--I hope the conference report will knock \nout or diminish the harmful impact of FDA on convenience stores and \nadvertising consistent with First Amendment rights.\n  I have heard Senator DeWine state this will not have an impact on \ngrowers. I hope it will not have an impact on growers. There may be \nsome certain aspects we ought to look at. Maybe it ought to be done \nthrough USDA in making sure foreign-grown tobacco meets the same \nstandard we want for tobacco grown in this country, for pesticides or \nchemicals that are not naturally occurring in the tobacco plant.\n  I do believe, however, that we do not need FDA regulation to prohibit \nand protect children from purchasing cigarettes. That is usually the \nargument, that we have to protect the children. That is fine, but I \nthink it can be done without onerous FDA regulations. I fear, if FDA \nhas regulatory authority over tobacco manufacturers and producers, we \nwill end up with decisions being made further away from the people, \ngiven to officious and meddling regulators. Rarely do I see the federal \ngovernment or any agency resisting a temptation to expand its power. \nOnce the FDA has control over tobacco retailers and manufacturers, they \nwill be subject to ever changing restrictions dictated by future \npolitical considerations.\n  I do commend the efforts of Senator DeWine and Senator McConnell and \nothers who worked on this; I will be voting for this measure to keep \nthis bill moving and gaining momentum. It is very important. We are \ntaking a major step forward with this measure in making sure our \ntobacco-growing families can be competitive with foreign-grown tobacco.\n  It is also important that we understand there are a number of aspects \nin the underlying bill, the JOBS bill, which are important to our \neconomy. There are aspects of it I have worked with my colleagues on to \nput in, including the Homestead Preservation Act which helps displaced \nworkers who have lost jobs due to international competition. There are \nfolks, and many are in the same areas as the tobacco farmers, in rural \ncommunities who have lost textile jobs. The Homestead Preservation \nprovision will help them with mortgage assistance for 1 year to help \nthem keep their homes and protect their credit ratings as they work \ntoward strengthening and updating their skills and getting back on \ntheir feet with a new job. That is an important provision.\n  There are also provisions that help make the United States more \nattractive for foreign companies to invest and create jobs in this \ncountry.\n  The main point is this is an amendment that advances a long talked \nabout, long sought after, absolutely essential provision, the tobacco \nquota buyout, which is so important to people not only in Virginia but \nalso tobacco-growing States across this country.\n  I am glad, while there may be some differences clearly on the FDA \nprovisions, that the Senate has come together and has put forth this, \non balance, very positive, competitive idea in an amendment. I hope my \ncolleagues will vote for it, it will be passed, and we can move to the \nconference committee, and, ultimately, next fall pass this JOBS bill \nwhich is so important for our country.\n  I thank my colleague Senator DeWine and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Virginia for his \ngood statement. I thank him for his support of the amendment. I just \nsay that our hope for this bill, after passage, obviously, is \ndifferent. I hope this marriage continues. He hopes for a divorce. I \nhope the marriage will be a long-lasting one. As I have said earlier, I \nthink it will. It is a logical marriage. I think the FDA regulation \nwill not be onerous. It is logical.\n  I think tobacco farmers will not in any way be burdened by this \nlegislation. But the children of tobacco farmers, as well as the \nchildren of all Americans, will be benefited by FDA regulation, just as \nthey are benefited by FDA regulation of milk and macaroni and cheese \nand of every other product we consume. It just makes sense to me, and \nit makes absolutely no sense we would not be regulating products such \nas tobacco. The time is finally here that we will recognize this, and \nthe American people will recognize it today, that we should, in fact, \nbe regulating a tobacco product.\n  At this time, let me yield to my colleague Senator Harkin. Before I \ndo that, let me inquire of the Chair, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seventeen and a half minutes.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Seventeen and a half minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Seventeen and a half minutes total?\n\n[[Page S8167]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seventeen and a half minutes total.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Seventeen and a half minutes total is remaining.\n  How much time would my colleague from Iowa need? I ask my colleague \nfrom Alabama, do you seek time as well?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Seven minutes.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Senator Kennedy wants some time at the end, I know. He \ntold me he wants 5 minutes at the end. I probably will want a minute or \nso.\n  I ask the Senator from Iowa how much time he would like.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would ask for 15 minutes, if I could have it.\n  Mr. DeWINE. We only have 17\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seventeen minutes.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Seventeen and a half, and Senator Lott wants some time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We only have 17\\1/2\\ minutes left on the whole debate?\n  Mr. DeWINE. Seventeen and a half minutes total.\n  Senator Lott is going to speak in opposition.\n  I ask the Senator from Alabama, are you in opposition?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. In opposition.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I say to the Senator, Senator Lott and my colleague from \nAlabama both have preference because it is all opposition time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask the floor leader, the Senator from Ohio, did I hear \ncorrectly, there is only 17\\1/2\\ minutes left on the side that is for \nthe amendment?\n  Mr. DeWINE. No. There is no time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the total time, the total time on the \namendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Is it 17\\1/2\\ minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixteen minutes now.\n  Mr. DeWINE. We need to move.\n  I wonder if I give my colleague, to start with, 4 minutes, and then \ngo from there.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will try. Thank you.\n  Mr. DeWINE. And then maybe an additional minute, if you need it, and \nwe can go from there.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I know Senator Lott wants to speak, \nalso. I will try to keep my comments to 6 minutes or 5 minutes. So I \ndon't want to object to the 4 minutes, but I think the Senator would \nneed to come in on that time or there won't be enough for this side to \nbe heard effectively. So I will not object.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Let me ask the Chair, is the time now controlled by the \nopposition or is it total time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The remaining time can be controlled by the \nopposition.\n  Mr. DeWINE. All right.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Iowa 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment. We \nhave an opportunity to address one of the most significant health \nthreats of our lifetime; and that is tobacco use.\n  Quite frankly, we have been trying for some time to get FDA \njurisdiction so they could better control advertising. I have a couple \ncharts to show why we need to do that. The tobacco companies continue \nto say they do not advertise to minors, but here is Kool cigarettes. \nThey have advertisements for hip-hop and rappers and all that. They are \nnot going after me. They are going after kids. This is what Big Tobacco \nis doing. That is why we need to regulate tobacco.\n  Here is another one: Liquid Zoo flavored cigarettes. This happens to \nbe strawberry. They are not going after adults. They are going after \nkids to get them hooked on tobacco.\n  Then we get this fraudulent kind of advertising. This is Eclipse \ncigarettes: The best choice for smokers who worry about their health is \nto quit. Here's the next best choice. But there is absolutely nothing \nto back up their claim that it is some kind of a healthier cigarette, \nof which I say there is no such thing. That is why we do need to get \nFDA authority.\n  Secondly, as a member of the Agriculture Committee, and as ranking \nmember, I am sorry this did not come to the Agriculture Committee. It \nis the committee of jurisdiction.\n  But I will say this, that we have a lot of farmers who hold quotas on \ntobacco. They have held them for many, many, many years. They are now \nseeing that the amount of tobacco they can produce under the quotas is \nbeing reduced, so their future and their ability to earn a living from \ntobacco is slipping away. This buyout will help them to build a better \nfuture. For many, it will not be in tobacco growing, and they need help \nto move to something else. But at least this tobacco buyout will give \nthem some equity, some hope. Many of these farmers are growing tobacco \nbecause their parents did. Many of them have small plots of tobacco. \nThey are using that for their family income.\n  Now, as we try to phase out tobacco use in this country, to get \npeople to smoke less and less because of the health costs and health \nrisks, we cannot forget about a lot of these farmers who, let's face \nit, their family incomes are based on this, so they need help. That is \nwhy I have been for a tobacco buyout in the past, to help these farm \nfamilies. As they transition out of growing tobacco--maybe into other \ncrops--they need help. I hope those of us on the Agriculture Committee \nwill help them to do so. I think this amendment is a good amendment. It \nwill tend to move us in the right direction on both fronts.\n  I say, in closing, in my estimation, the FSC bill needs this. The \nHouse approached it the wrong way. They put it on the backs of \ntaxpayers, when it ought to be paid for by the manufacturers, which I \nassume would pass the cost on to users of tobacco. That is the way it \nought to be done. That is the way we had agreed upon doing it prior to \nthe House adding that amendment.\n  So I say the conference committee must adopt the approach that \ninsists on combining a strong FDA regulation with an industry supported \nbuy-out for tobacco farmers unlike the approach the House took by \nputting the buy-out on the backs of the taxpayers and completely \ndisregarding FDA regulation.\n  So again, this amendment moves us in the right direction, both to \nhelp a lot of family farmers but also to help our kids, to help future \ngenerations so they will not be bombarded with this kind of phony \nadvertising we are seeing from the tobacco companies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I guess it is only in the Congress that \nwe can have one bad bill that cannot be passed on its own, and we can \nadd to that another bad bill that cannot be passed on its own, and, lo \nand behold, we can have two bad bills that you would think would not \nhave a dog's chance of passage, and here we are on the verge, I am \nsure, of passing this amendment.\n  I do not know how the quotas need to be paid out, and how much people \nought to get, but we really need to spend some time on it. It was \nbasically suggested to me recently that we ought to be thankful this \nbill started out at $18 billion in buyout costs and that now it is only \n$13 billion. We are supposed to say thank you for saving us. But I \nwonder how we started out at that figure to begin with.\n  Mr. President, I ask to be notified when I have used 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the chairman of the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions, Senator Judd Gregg, has worked very \nhard on the tobacco regulation issue. He has had hearings. He has \nstudied it. His staff has worked on it. Members of the committee have \nbeen engaged in it. His ideas have been completely bypassed in this \namendment that is going forward today.\n  Senator Mike Enzi is a champion of small business, who has spent a \nlot of time dealing with small convenience stores and working with them \non their problems. The breadth of this language they feel very strongly \nabout. He had amendments and some ideas to fix that. All of that has \nbeen bypassed.\n  The trade bill is a critically important bill. We want to see that \npass. It is just too typical of how we have to do business or feel we \nhave to do business that the bill gets these two pieces of \nlegislation--neither one of which has been thoroughly considered and \neffectively analyzed--attached to it. I don't believe it is about \npublic policy, and it is something we ought not support.\n\n[[Page S8168]]\n\n  They say they are going to tax the manufacturers. I can understand \nsome of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle believing that is \nnot a tax on consumers, but everybody knows a tax on the manufacturer \ndrives up the cost of the product and is, in fact, a tax on the people \nwho consume the product. We might as well put it on the cigarette \npackage so the citizens will know how much the Federal Government has \nmade them pay extra for the cost of the product they wish to consume.\n  I do not favor tobacco. I believe it is a deadly product. We ought to \neliminate it in any way we possibly can in a reasonable way. But I also \nbelieve in freedom, and I know that there are people who believe that \nthey have a right to smoke and have been given that right. To just \nexorbitantly continue to exercise more and more of our ability to put \ntaxes on it is not a good idea.\n  The regulations in the FDA bill are very troubling. We know there was \na lawsuit over this issue sometime ago, and the courts ruled that the \nFDA did not have the power to regulate tobacco. As a result of that, we \nnow come back with this legislation.\n  I know there are some good people involved in this, wanting to see \nthis bill pass for various reasons. One group is absolutely committed \nto increased regulation of tobacco, and they don't care if we spend $50 \nbillion on the buyout. Another group wants a big buyout, and they don't \ncare what kind of regulations we put on convenience stores or on the \nsale of this product.\n  The net result is an unhealthy deal for public policy in America. I \nwish we had more time to get into it. I am told that the cost of the \nbuyout per acre is $20,000. I know Senator Lott has some fine farmland \nin Mississippi. I don't know how much he could buy at $20,000. It would \nbe more than one acre, I am sure. He probably could buy land in \nJackson, MS. I am just kidding.\n  I think we are moving in the wrong direction. I want to be on record \nas objecting to this process. I am sorry that it was sprung on us this \nway. It is adding too much. We should not allow this to happen. I hope \nwe can make this thing better as time goes by.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time for this \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, are we still operating under the 3-hour time \nagreement with regard to the tax bill and the tobacco issue?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. The opposition has \napproximately 6 minutes remaining. The proponents have no time.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I \nam not sure whether I could be considered pro or in opposition to in \nthis particular case, but I do want to be heard on the broader issue \nand also on the tobacco provisions.\n  I begin by congratulating and expressing my appreciation to leaders \non both sides of the aisle for finally coming to an agreement on a \nprocess that will get us into conference on this important legislation. \nIt is unfortunate that it has been delayed for weeks. We should have \nbeen in conference a month ago or more. Some of the demands about how \nwe would go to conference or what would happen in that conference have \nbeen very inappropriate. One can't preordain what will come out of a \nconference. They can't say that any one person will determine whether a \nconference is reported, whether it is a leader or anybody else. But \nthis issue is so important that we need to go into conference. It is \nabout some important tax provisions that will help manufacturing, \nservice, and our high-technology businesses and workers.\n  It is a way to deal with a problem we have caused by a ruling by the \nWorld Trade Organization saying that our tax provisions, our alleged \nsubsidies, were not in compliance with WTO, and we are being penalized \nin an increasing amount each month on a lot of American products \nbecause we have not dealt with this issue. We should have dealt with it \na year or two ago, but at least now we will have an opportunity.\n  Without rewriting the history, I think we need to get this bill into \nconference. We need to deal with this problem caused by the World Trade \nOrganization's ruling, and we need to deal with the funds that are \navailable because of that in a way that will help job growth and the \neconomy.\n  This is all well-intentioned. I have been pushing to go to \nconference. I must say, I am very worried about what is going to come \nout of conference. This bill and the one from the House have acquired a \nlot of barnacles. If you allow enough barnacles to be attached to the \nhull of a ship, it will sink. This one is in real jeopardy of sinking.\n  First of all, as has become our pattern in the Congress, we are \ngreedy. A bill that should be revenue neutral or should be somewhere \naround $50 billion has become--I don't know how much--$150 billion. How \nfar is it going to go? The distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee tells me it is $170 billion. We do have a little deficit. \nAnybody notice that?\n  Here we have taken a good opportunity to do something good that would \nbe responsible in dealing with trade practices and protecting our own \nproducers and creating jobs, and we are going to distort it way out of \nproportion. It has become a pretzel. I went along with adding the \nenergy tax provisions to the bill. I didn't think that was the way to \ndo it; I said so at the time. But it was at least the tax provisions, \nand it gave us some way to maybe deal with the energy needs of the \ncountry. But that was the first of the barnacles that was added.\n  And then in the House, I saw on the media this week where all these \nprovisions have been added that will benefit General Electric, that \nwould give them additional tax breaks and will contribute probably to \nmore jobs going overseas. How did that happen? Did somebody miss that? \nDid it get in there without anybody being aware of it?\n  Then the House added about $10 billion for a tobacco allotment \nbuyout. I assumed that was just an aberration in the House and that \nDemocrats and Republicans would say they are not going to do that and \nwe would get back to the basics of this bill. Now the Senate is going \nto join the stampede. We are going to regulate tobacco with the FDA, \nand we are going to have a buyout even bigger. I guess this alternative \nwould be paid for by the industry. What in the world is tobacco policy, \nwhether it is the amount of the allotment or the FDA, doing in this \nbill?\n\n  I am very worried that this bill is going to--and we are adding to \nthe confusion--sink under its own weight in conference, and our \ncompanies and producers in America will be hit with an ever-increasing \nimport fee every month.\n  Here is what we ought to do. We need to get a grip, cut out all of \nthis unrelated stuff in this bill. Some of it I would have to \nsacrifice, too. I want an energy bill. This may be the only vehicle \nleaving town. I would like to put the entire energy bill, with some \nmodifications that may be necessary, in this bill. But this bill, on \nits own, needs to be done. It needs to be done clean. It needs to be \ncut by probably two-thirds. And we need to get all the undergrowth that \nhas been added to it off of it.\n  If we could do that and still find a way to get an energy bill, a \nhighway bill, and a jobs growth bill done without all of the adds that \nare costing billions of dollars, we could go out of this session with \nour heads held high. But we are setting up a box that we may not be \nable to get out of.\n  I oppose this proposal on tobacco. I am very much concerned about how \nwe are going to get through conference and get this bill down into the \n$50 billion range where it should be instead of $170 billion. We have \nall contributed to the problem. I plead guilty. We all have. But now is \nthe time where generally, when you go to conference, you get over your \ntemporary political fantasies and you do the right thing. You produce a \nbill that can pass and will help the economy.\n  Will we do it this time? I am sure that the distinguished chairman of \nthe Finance Committee, who enters the Chamber smiling, can work \nmiracles in this conference. I am expecting it and looking forward to \nsupporting him in that effort.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on the \nFSC/ETI bill for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S8169]]\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, most of the speakers have been \nproponents. I compliment Senator DeWine and Senator McConnell for \ngetting included this deal. I want to make two or three comments. One \nis on the process. The FDA bill we are now going to vote on--I venture \nto say nobody knows much about it because, and correct me if I am \nwrong, it has not been reported out of any committee. The very \nextensive bill, very important bill, has 155 pages of regulations and \nnot 1 paragraph that says the FDA has regulatory authority over \ntobacco. It is a lot of regulatory statute proposed to be the law of \nthe land.\n  There is a tobacco buyout provision that costs $12 billion. I have \nyet to see the language. Neither of these bills was reported out of \ncommittee, and neither should have had a time agreement. I wasn't \nconsulted on a time agreement on these particular amendments. All of a \nsudden, we find out at 9:30 there is a time agreement and we are \ntalking about spending $12 billion--and, oh, yes, you cannot amend it. \nI am kind of offended by that.\n  Senator Grassley used to say we should have some kind of limitation \non payments. We find out, according to some analysis, some farmers will \nmake millions of dollars on the tobacco buyout. I would say, wait a \nminute, if we are going to buy out a quota--a quota is a Government \nbenefit basically which we have given and which has benefited a few. We \nfind out that 85 percent of the quotas go to nonfarmers. I would like \nto have the benefits go to the farmers. We don't have a chance to offer \nthat amendment. I would like to say the benefit should be going to \ntobacco farmers. We don't have a chance to offer that. We have an FDA \nbill before us. Senator Gregg has a proposed amendment; I would like to \noffer that or consider it. We don't have a chance to do that. We don't \nhave a chance to offer one amendment. Yet we are saying let's add this \nto the FSC/ETI bill.\n  I agree with Senator Lott, who says we should pass the FSC/ETI bill, \nand we are held up for weeks after we already passed it on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  The House, in my opinion, made a mistake. The House made a mistake \nwhen they passed FSC/ETI. They put in a $9.6 billion tobacco buyout as \npart of their package. Now we are getting ready to say that two wrongs \nmake a right. Since they do it, we will do it, too, except where they \nspent $9.6 billion, we will spend $12 billion. At least, to their \ncredit, they got out of the tobacco program when they spend $9.6 \nbillion. They are going to pay the tobacco farmers and get out of the \nFederal price support program for tobacco. But we don't do that on this \nproposal. We are going to spend $12 billion on supposedly buying out \nquota. Guess what. At the end of the day, you still have a tobacco \nprogram, a price support program. That is ludicrous. What a waste of \nmoney. We are going to spend $12 billion and not end the program? I \ncannot imagine doing that. I cannot imagine that we would pay people \nfor a quota, most of whom are not farmers, and then we are going to \ncontinue a price support program at the end of the day. That is in this \nbill. It is all tied together. You don't have a chance to break it \napart, don't have a chance to amend it. This is very offensive to the \nlegislative process. It is very offensive to the taxpayers.\n\n  The regulatory authority I have heard many people bragging on is very \nbroad. For example, I don't know if people are aware of it, but maybe \nwe want to give the Secretary of HHS a blank check to regulate and/or \noutlaw tobacco. In reading on page 45, it says:\n\n       The Secretary may, by regulation, require restrictions on \n     the sale and distribution of a tobacco product, including \n     restrictions on the access to and the advertising of and \n     promotion of the tobacco product, if the Secretary determines \n     such regulation will be appropriate for the protection of \n     public health.\n\n  The Secretary can do anything he darn well pleases, including banning \ntobacco, I guess. I am no fan of tobacco. Frankly, I have had family \nmembers who got cancer as a result of it. It almost took my mother's \nlife--lung cancer, emphysema, all probably directly related to tobacco. \nI had a brother with serious cancer. I am no fan of tobacco. I don't \nuse it. I don't want my kids to use it. I urge people not to use it. I \nquestion having a new Federal program where we are going to have $12 \nbillion to buy people out of their quotas, including most of the people \nwho don't even grow tobacco, and then we are going to say, yes, at the \nend of the day, we are going to continue the tobacco program, and then \nwe are going to put it on a FSC/ETI bill where it doesn't belong.\n  We need to pass the tax bill and resolve conflicts with the WTO so we \ncan eliminate surcharges and tariffs on products coming into the U.S. \nWe need to do our work.\n  This tobacco provision, which has not had a hearing in the \nAgriculture Committee or in the HELP Committee, and hasn't had a \nhearing on either FDA or a markup of the appropriate legislation before \nthe appropriate committees--all of a sudden we are getting ready to \npass legislation that is going to make, according to one estimate, over \n500 people millionaires--millionaires--and we don't even have a chance \nto amend it. I wonder how many of my colleagues are aware of that. I \nwonder how many have a clue what is in this proposal. I venture to say \nthat very few do. Maybe the sponsors do. Maybe there was some deal \ncooked up last night. I don't know. I am looking at the size of that \namendment and saying, Mr. President, that is pretty thick. I wonder how \nmany billions of dollars are going to be spent as a result of this \namendment without people really knowing what they are voting on.\n  I will vote no on the amendment. I urge my colleagues to vote no on \nthis amendment. If we pass this, there is going to be a tobacco \nprovision in the House bill and the Senate bill, and that will make it \ndifficult to delete in conference. As a conferee, I plan on opposing \ntobacco. I was going to oppose energetically having the House pass that \nas part of the FSC/ETI bill. It doesn't belong there. If we put a \nsimilar provision in the Senate bill, it more than likely will be \nthere. I will tell you it may be too much of a load for that bill to \npass conference. I can see all kinds of ways that this could bog down \nthe conference totally, and we will end up having no bill. Who wins out \nof that? Certainly not the tobacco growers. Certainly not tobacco.\n  Some people allege that the regulations benefit one tobacco company \nat the expense of the others. I don't know. I just know this is a \ncrummy way to legislate. This is not the way we should be doing \nbusiness in the U.S. Senate. We should not be gumming up an already \noverloaded bill by including this provision.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment when we vote later \ntoday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased that we are finally able to \nproceed with this legislation and remove serious barriers to American \nagricultural exports.\n  Since the World Trade Organization ruled against the United States \nover our Foreign Sales Corporation and Extraterritorial Income tax \nrules, we have had ample time to address this issue. In fact, the \nSenate Finance Committee reported legislation that would bring the \nUnited States into compliance with our trade obligations on October 1, \n2003.\n  European Union tariffs on our farm exports have steadily increased, \nmaking them increasingly less competitive in international markets. The \nEU retaliation list includes about 400 agricultural, food and forest \nproduct tariff lines of imports from the United States. Proceeding with \nthis legislation will help us regain market share and export \nopportunities that will have added benefit for truckers, rail lines, \nshippers and related businesses. This will help the export of U.S. \nagricultural products to hit a projected record of more than $60 \nbillion this year.\n  In addition, I am pleased that an agreement could be reached to allow \nfor the consideration of a tobacco buyout amendment to this \nlegislation. I commend our members of the Senate Agriculture Committee \nwho have worked diligently to reach this point. Particularly, Senators \nMcConnell, Chambliss, Dole and Miller and their staffs have brought us \nto this point through careful negotiation.\n  Over the past decade, tobacco producers have seen their tobacco quota \ncut in half and resulting in an economic crisis among tobacco-dependent \ncommunities. This buyout provision will provide the estimated 57,000 \ntobacco farms in the United States the\n\n[[Page S8170]]\n\nnecessary resources to continue their livelihood or transition into \nmore diversified operations. The amendment is also a move in the right \ndirection in eliminating the archaic tobacco quota system. It is my \nhope that this important provision will enable tobacco producers the \nability to better compete in a free market system.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, \nI look forward to working with my colleagues in both the Senate and \nHouse of Representatives to ensure that farmers in the United States \nwho choose to continue to grow tobacco will have that opportunity. I \nurge my colleagues to support this amendment and the underlying bill.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I discuss the amendment we are about to \nvote on. Let me state at the beginning: I am supportive of a tobacco \nbuyout for our tobacco producers and quota holders, and I will work to \nhelp them achieve this goal. However, it should be a buyout without \nstrings attached and that will truly end the program.\n  Unfortunately, this legislation does not achieve this goal. While the \nbill does provide a buyout, it then implements annual restrictions on \nacreage and production. I have previously stated on this floor my \nopposition to acreage and production controls for all crops and \ncommodity programs. This program should be no different.\n  I am also concerned that these acreage controls may not be legal \nunder our World Trade Organization commitments. If these controls would \nindeed be declared illegal under our commitments, we could be subject \nto a ruling that would put us far above our WTO agriculture spending \ncaps. This would not only have significant impacts for tobacco and this \nprogram, it could have a significant impact on all our commodities and \nfarm programs. I cannot support voting for this proposal and putting \nall our other commodities at risk.\n  If these provisions were removed, I believe there would be no \nquestion that this proposed program would be WTO legal, and I would \nhave no trouble supporting the buyout. I will let my colleagues that \nserve on the conference of this bill make their own decision regarding \nFDA regulation and the funding mechanism for the buyout. But, I urge \nthem to support the House language implementing a buyout with no future \nacreage and production restrictions being put in place.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will support the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Ohio, Mr. DeWine, and the Senator from Massachusetts, \nMr. Kennedy, but in doing so I also want to note my concern about the \npotential for unconstitutional infringement on commercial speech that \nthe amendment may engender in the regulations it directs to be \npromulgated to regulate tobacco advertising. There is little doubt that \nthe health of our citizens, and in particular the health of our \nchildren, are a substantial governmental interest. And given that \nsubstantial interest, some regulation of tobacco advertising may be \nappropriate.\n  Further, the amendment appropriately sets forth some safeguards that \nstrive to prevent unconstitutional infringement on commercial speech, \nand I commend the authors for including that sensible protection. \nMoreover, in the wake of the Lorillard case in 2001, we now have a \nsomewhat clearer legal standard in this area that can guide these \nproposed regulations.\n  But the rights spelled out in the first amendment of our Constitution \nare so fundamental to our liberties that we must be especially \nsensitive to the potential for Government overreaching. For that \nreason, while I will support the amendment, I will also be monitoring \nthis aspect of the amendment closely as regulations of tobacco \nadvertising are developed and implemented.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I address the DeWine-Kennedy amendment to \nH.R. 4520, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.\n  Let me say at the outset that I will vote for this proposal tonight, \nbecause I am fully supportive of measures to end tobacco use in the \nUnited States. I can think of few public health dangers worse than \ntobacco, and this is especially true for young people. Certainly, in my \nhome state of Utah, I hear time and time again from concerned parents \nand health advocates who point out the devastating health consequences \nof tobacco use.\n  So, I think it is critical that we go to conference on this issue. \nHowever, my support for the amendment is not without some serious \nreservations, and I hope they can be addressed and corrected in \nconference.\n  My first concern is that the committee of jurisdiction, the HELP \nCommittee, should have had the opportunity to consider fully the text \nof S. 2461, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, \nwhich is included in the DeWine-Kennedy amendment, before it is brought \nto the floor for this vote.\n  Having been the chairman of that committee for several years, I know \nfull well the complexities of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. \nThree hours of debate are not enough time to consider legislation that \nmakes such dramatic changes to current law.\n  I have only had a short time to review this legislative language but \nI believe there are several troubling components. For example, the \ntobacco company marketing provisions alone in this amendment raise \nserious 1st Amendment issues, as do the provisions granting authority \nto state and local governments to impose specific bans or restrictions \non the time, place and manner of tobacco advertising. I would have \npreferred we have a more lengthy debate on about the implications of \nthese provisions before we vote.\n  I also think we need to give serious study to the drafting of the \nlanguage providing the FDA with the authority to regulate tobacco \nproducts. This area of the law is extremely complex. In addition, I \nmust point out that the FDA already has been charged with numerous \nresponsibilities and has been criticized time and time again for its \ninability to meet statutory requirements due to funding constraints. In \nfact, just yesterday, I held a hearing in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee on the safety of imported drugs where FDA officials told \nmembers of my Committee how difficult it would be for them to ensure \nthe safety of imported drugs because the agency is already strapped for \nresources. How can we expect the FDA to take on new responsibilities \nwithout supplying the agency sufficient funding for performing its \ncurrent duties?\n  In closing, let me address the tobacco buyout provisions.\n  Mr. President, I am all for measures to reduce our Nation's \ndependence on tobacco, and measures to encourage less tobacco \nproduction are an important part of that equation.\n  I am encouraged that the amendment we are considering tonight does \nnot use taxpayer funds to accomplish the buyout. That is an important \npoint. I also recognize that the program will help get the Government \nout of the farming business while making temporary assistance available \nto farmers as they adjust to the free market. That being said, \nquestions worthy of serious consideration have been raised about where \nthis assistance will go, and I think we need to study that more.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to support the amendment \noffered by my colleagues Senators DeWine and Kennedy. The amendment \nthey have offered today is the product of many years of hard work and \nleadership.\n  The amendment combines legislation to empower the Food and Drug \nAdministration, FDA, to regulate tobacco products with Senator \nMcConnell's tobacco buyout bill.\n  I believe this is the right approach. Last week, seven of my \ncolleagues and I wrote to Senators Frist and Daschle to express our \nview that no tobacco buyout plan should move ahead if it does not \ninclude meaningful and effective FDA oversight of tobacco.\n  The 5-year, $9.6 billion tobacco buyout provision in the House FSC/\nETI bill is not only worse for tobacco growers than the McConnell bill, \nbut it does nothing to protect public health and to reduce tobacco's \ntremendous toll in health, lives and money.\n  The DeWine-Kennedy amendment gives the FDA the authority to: Restrict \nadvertising and promotions that appeal to children; stop illegal sales \nof tobacco products to children; require changes in tobacco products, \nsuch as the reduction or elimination of harmful chemicals, to make them \nless harmful or less addictive; prohibit unsubstantiated health claims \nabout so-\n\n[[Page S8171]]\n\ncalled ``reduced risk'' tobacco products that would have the effect of \ndiscouraging current tobacco users from quitting or encouraging new \nusers to start; and require the disclosure of the contents of tobacco \nproducts and tobacco industry research about the health effects of \ntheir products.\n  This amendment is supported by the American Cancer Society, the \nAmerican Heart Association, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, and the \nAmerican Lung Association.\n  Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death in the United \nStates. Every year in America, tobacco use kills more than 400,000 \npeople and costs our Nation more than $75 billion in health care bills. \nToday approximately 4,000 children under age 18 will try smoking for \nthe first time and 2,000 children will become regular smokers. Smoking \nis the cause of one-third of all cancers.\n  Unless we act to pass FDA regulation of tobacco, this number will \nonly get worse.\n  During my time in the Senate, I have become very involved with \ncancer. I am the co-chair of the Senate cancer caucus and the vice-\nchair of C-Change, formerly the National Dialogue on Cancer, which is \nchaired by former President and Barbara Bush.\n  The cancer community is united in the belief that the single most \nimportant preventive measure is to place tobacco products under the \nregulatory control of the Food and Drug Administration. I stand behind \nthe cancer community and express the same belief.\n  I firmly believe that cancer cannot be conquered without addressing \nsmoking and the use of tobacco products.\n  Smoking results in death or disability for over half of tobacco \nusers, according to the Centers for Disease Control, CDC.\n  Over the past two decades, we have learned that tobacco companies \nhave manipulated the level of nicotine in cigarettes to increase the \nnumber of people to their product.\n  There are more than 40 chemicals in tobacco smoke that cause cancer \nin humans and animals, according to the CDC. Tobacco smoke has toxic \ncomponents, as well as tar, carbon monoxide and other dangerous \nadditives.\n  It is long past time to reduce the addictive nature of cigarettes and \ncurtail the marketing of these products to young people. I believe that \nempowering the FDA to regulate tobacco will help do that.\n  The U.S. Surgeon General and the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention have unequivocally demonstrated that, for example, \nantismoking campaigns can reduce smoking, a major cause of cancer.\n  California is a good example. My State started an aggressive tobacco \ncontrol program in 1989 and throughout the 1990s. As a result of \nCalifornia's aggressive approach, is the first State in the Union to \nsee a decline in lung cancer among women, as a result of the State's \nactive prevention efforts.\n  This amendment will provide meaningful regulation by the Food and \nDrug Administration of the content and marketing of tobacco products, \nespecially the addicting and carcinogenic components.\n  I am pleased to note that even the Philip Morris companies has \nacknowledged the need for FDA to regulate tobacco.\n  It is long past time to reduce the addictive nature of cigarettes and \ncurtail the marketing of these products to young people. This amendment \ngives FDA the power to regulate tobacco products' content, design, \nsale, and marketing.\n  I am a strong supporter of this amendment. However, I will not \nsupport any final proposal that weakens the DeWine-Kennedy amendment or \ncontains a tobacco buyout provision that is fully funded by general \nrevenues.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I cannot support this amendment that would \nplace the regulation of tobacco products under the jurisdiction of the \nFood and Drug Administration.\n  The question is not whether the Federal Government should regulate \ntobacco products. It should and it does already, through a variety of \nagencies. The regulations are based on a variety of laws that Congress \nhas passed over the past few decades.\n  We have Federal laws to require health warnings on all packaging and \nin all print and outdoor advertisements. We have prohibited the \nadvertisement of tobacco products on television and radio. We require \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services to report to us every 3 \nyears on research findings about tobacco and addiction.\n  We also require States to prohibit the sale of tobacco products to \nanyone under age 18. States that do not comply with this requirement \nrisk the loss of Federal block grant funding.\n  The question again is not whether Federal regulation of tobacco \nproducts is appropriate. It is whether the FDA should be responsible \nfor a broad new regulatory scheme that would cover everything from the \nmanufacture of smokeless tobacco to the sale of cigarettes at the \ncorner store.\n  At a time when the FDA's challenges have never been greater or more \nsignificant, the last thing we need is to give the FDA a huge task that \nwill draw attention and focus away from its already considerable \nresponsibilities.\n  The FDA is already overworked and underfunded. We ask the FDA to be \nresponsible for so many things: ensuring that new drugs and medical \ndevices are safe and effective, safeguarding the Nation's blood supply, \nregulating the manufacture and distribution of food additives and drugs \nthat will be given to animals, and increasing the security of our food \nsupply. Consumer and industry groups regularly complain that the FDA's \nbudget is inadequate and its mandate is too broad to enable the agency \nto manage its current workload.\n  Yet here we are, proposing to give the FDA another huge \nresponsibility, for which it will have to create another huge \nbureaucracy within its already sprawling structure. Now, more than \never, our families and children need to know that the FDA can meet its \ncurrent obligations.\n  I recognize that a number of important voices in the public health \ncommunity are calling for FDA regulation of tobacco products, but I \nfail to understand why regulation by this particular agency is so \ncritical.\n  Those who support FDA regulation of tobacco say that they are not \ninterested in banning cigarettes or other tobacco products. This makes \nno sense to me. With everything we know about the dangers of tobacco \nuse, how would the FDA arrive at any other conclusion but to ban \ntobacco products?\n  One of the purposes of the bill would ``vest the FDA with the \nauthority to regulate the levels of tar, nicotine, and other harmful \ncomponents of tobacco products.'' Well, we know that nicotine is an \naddictive drug and by itself may cause health problems. And we also \nknow that tar and other chemicals in tobacco products are very harmful \nto our health.\n  How would the FDA remain true to its mission without requiring \nmanufacturers of tobacco products to reduce the level of nicotine to \nzero? Reducing the level of the addictive drug in tobacco products \nwould effectively result in a ban of tobacco products--after all, how \nwould a smoker get their ``nicotine high'' from a nicotine-free \nproduct?\n  Having said that, I believe an outright ban on tobacco products is \nimpractical. If I thought that banning cigarettes would stop people \nfrom smoking, I would say let's pass a law and make it so. Banning \ncigarettes will not stop people from smoking, though, just like \nprohibition failed to stop people from drinking.\n  So if we are not going to ban tobacco products, then what is the \npoint of FDA regulation of tobacco? We already have the necessary tools \nto address the other concerns that some use to justify giving the FDA \nthis new power.\n  For instance, the Federal Trade Commission has broad authority to \nprevent false or misleading claims for consumer products, and Congress \nhas given the FTC the explicit authority to oversee the labeling and \nadvertising of tobacco products.\n  For health or safety claims in advertising, the FTC generally \nrequires a high level of substantiation, including competent and \nreliable scientific evidence. The record shows that the FTC has not \nhesitated to exercise its enforcement authority to prevent or correct \nfalse or misleading tobacco product advertising, including express or \nimplied claims about exposure and other health-related issues.\n  So, if a cigarette manufacturer were to promote a ``reduced-risk'' \nproduct\n\n[[Page S8172]]\n\nwith misleading advertising or unsubstantiated claims, I am confident \nthat the FTC would take decisive action against them. In fact, \nresearchers supported by the National Institutes of Health are already \nstudying ``reduced-risk'' products with a skeptical eye, providing the \ntype of independent scientific review that goes well beyond anything \nthe FDA customarily produces on its own. This suggests to me that \nmanufacturers of ``reduced-risk'' products are not going to be able to \ncount on the Government's silence in response to any advertising claims \nthey may make.\n  I would rather have the FTC continue its vigorous enforcement against \ndangerous or deceptive advertising claims rather than set up a \nregulatory scenario under which the FDA puts its ``stamp of approval'' \non a reduced-risk cigarette. Most Americans see the FDA as the \nprotector of the public health, yet everyone agrees that smoking kills, \nand that there is no such thing as a ``safe'' cigarette. The FDA would \nsend a mixed and confusing message if it were suddenly to begin \napproving tobacco products that would still kill the user, just at a \nslower pace.\n  Another argument for FDA regulation of tobacco products is that we \nneed to involve the FDA if we are going to crack down on illegal sales \nof tobacco products to children. Right now, this job belongs to State \nand local governments, and I believe it should stay that way.\n  Every State has laws against selling tobacco to people under the age \nof 18, so the issue is enforcing these laws, not creating new ones. And \nthese current laws are working. The number of kids who have purchased \ntobacco in retail stores has dropped by 50 percent since the \nimplementation of the Federal Synar amendment in the late 1990s.\n  Working together with States, communities and retailers, we already \nare making great strides in preventing kids from purchasing tobacco. \nOur current efforts are working, so it makes no sense to change horses \nin mid-stream and bring the FDA into every convenience store across \nAmerica.\n  To reduce underage access to tobacco, we ought to build upon the \nsuccesses of the Synar amendment. This Congress is due to reauthorize \nthe agency that oversees the implementation of the Synar amendment. \nThis gives us the perfect opportunity to consider how the Synar \namendment is working and what we could do to make it even more \neffective.\n  Combining greater education with tougher enforcement is the answer to \ntobacco prevention. The States that take the most comprehensive \napproaches to tobacco prevention, particularly those that work closely \nwith local programs and coalitions, have achieved some of the best \nrecords, in preventing the initiation of tobacco use by kids.\n  We should hold these States out as models for others, instead of \ninserting a new Federal bureaucracy into the equation. Our Federal \nefforts should support our communities by providing tools and \ninformation for adults on the dangers of tobacco use, teaching our kids \nabout these dangers so that they don't start using tobacco, and on \nenforcing the laws we already have on the books. But our local \ncommunities and states should take the lead.\n  Stopping kids from smoking will require continuing collaboration \nbetween State governments, local governments, community organizations, \nacademic institutions, and Federal agencies like the FTC and the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. And this partnership is \nworking. It has successfully reduced the prevalence of smoking in the \nUnited States by 22 percent from 1990 to 2002. It also has reduced the \nprevalence of smoking by high schoolers by 22 percent from 1997 to \n2001.\n  These numbers show that we are making progress. Let's not mess with \nsuccess. Let's stick with what is working.\n  I am no fan of tobacco, but I am going to vote against giving a huge \nnew responsibility to the already overburdened FDA. Giving tobacco \nregulation to the FDA will not stop adults from smoking, and I doubt \nwhether the FDA would to any better at keeping cigarettes out of the \nhands of kids than our States and communities are doing.\n  I reject the notion that the way to show you're ``for kids'' and \n``against big tobacco'' is by voting for the creation of a new and \nunnecessary bureaucracy that would operate under a mandate that is \nsimultaneously too broad and too vague.\n  This vote is not a choice between kids and big tobacco. This vote is \nabout the best way for the Federal Government to continue regulating \ntobacco products.\n  I will oppose this amendment because I believe the best role for the \nFederal Government in tobacco prevention is to focus on education and \nenforcement. We already have the laws and regulations in place. Let's \nuse them to the fullest before we create new ones.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, for several years, those in tobacco \ncountry have been working to enact a program to transition tobacco \nfarmers out of the current tobacco quota program. At the same time, \nmany of us have been working to give the Food and Drug Administration \nregulatory authority over tobacco. Today we have the opportunity to \npass legislation that does both.\n  In the finest tradition of the U.S. Senate, this amendment embodies \ncompromise that represents a careful balance of often disparate and \ncompeting interests. While no member got everything they wanted, each \nparticipant has won important victories that made this proposal \nstronger.\n  Senators from tobacco areas have been pushing for a tobacco buyout, \nto transition tobacco farmers from the antiquated quota system. Being \nfrom a rural State, I understand the economic engine that agriculture \nprovides rural America. And, I appreciate the struggles that tobacco \nfarmers have faced in recent years.\n  The tobacco buyout included in this amendment provides tobacco \nfarmers and quota holders important economic assistance as they \ntransition from the current tobacco quota program to the free market. \nThe buyout has several features that are superior to the House-passed \nbuyout bill. First, the buyout is paid for through assessments on the \ntobacco manufacturers instead of by the taxpayers. Second, the \nlegislation limits the production of tobacco to traditional growing \nareas. This ensures that tobacco farmers who choose to continue growing \ntobacco do not have to unfairly compete with startup tobacco production \nin other parts of the country. Third, this legislation provides \nimpacted states with economic development grants to help diversify \ntobacco dependent economies.\n  On the Democratic side, both Senator Edwards and Senator Hollings \nhave been working tirelessly on tobacco for several years. And, Erskine \nBowles has personally called scores of my colleagues to let them know \nhow important a buyout is, and how important it was to get this done. \nIn large part, his efforts to educate members about the effects the \nquota cuts have on farmers and communities helped ensure passage of the \nbuyout today. His advocacy also helped ensure an additional $50 million \nin economic support for North Carolina was included in the bill.\n  Many of us also feel very strongly that we need to provide FDA with \nauthority to regulate tobacco. Each year, I am visited by South Dakota \nyouth advocates who volunteer their free time to discourage tobacco use \nby their peers. They are some of the most impressive young people you \ncould hope to meet. And their cause couldn't be more important.\n  In the United States, over four million high school students are \ncurrent or past smokers--29 percent. Thirty-three percent of South \nDakota high school students smoke. In South Dakota alone, 5,100 kids \ntry cigarettes for the first time each year. Of those, 2,300 South \nDakotans under the age of 18 become regular, daily smokers each year. \nThese numbers are alarming because it is truly a matter of life and \ndeath.\n  Four-hundred thousand people die each year from their own cigarette \nsmoking. Forty thousand die because other people smoke. In South \nDakota, 900 children have lost at least one parent to a smoking-caused \ndeath. And, in addition to the human cost, there are significant \nfinancial costs. The total public and private health care expenditures \ncaused by smoking in this country total over $75 billion each year. \nMedicare alone has over $20 billion each year in smoking-related \nexpenditures.\n  Today, we are considering legislation to address this critical public \nhealth\n\n[[Page S8173]]\n\nneed. I thank Senators DeWine and Kennedy for their hard work on this \nissue. The bipartisan bill we have before us would give the FDA the \nauthority to restrict tobacco advertising, particularly advertising \nthat targets children. Under this bill, the FDA could prevent tobacco \nsales to children and limit cigarette sales to face-to-face \ntransactions in which age can be verified. The bill calls for stronger \nwarnings on packaging and allows the FDA to prevent cigarette \nmanufacturers from misrepresenting the facts. It would also allow the \nFDA to reduce or remove hazardous ingredients from cigarettes, when \nfeasible, in order to help those who are addicted.\n  The FDA authorities provided by this amendment are critical to \nreducing smoking, particularly among our children. And the provision to \nassist tobacco farmers are critical to remedy a growing problem. This \nbipartisan amendment represents a true compromise and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we have a chance today to address one of \nthe most significant public health threats of our lifetimes--tobacco \nuse. For my entire tenure in Congress I have been working to protect \nour children from big tobacco and the horrendous health risks \nassociated with the deadly habit. It was in 1977 that I first \nintroduced legislation calling for repeal of the tax deductibility of \ntobacco advertising and marketing so taxpayers would not have to \nsubsidize billions to promote smoking. Back in 1998, I introduced the \nKIDS Deserve Freedom Act to give FDA authority to regulate tobacco and \nmore specifically set up a plan to cut the number of kids who start \nsmoking in half. More recently, I introduced the HeLP America bill to \nreform our health care system to focus more on prevention and wellness. \nIt would require tobacco companies to reduce teen smoking rates or \ninstead face a stiff financial penalty.\n  Unfortunately, victories in the tobacco wars have come few and far \nbetween. But I am more hopeful now than ever that we can pass a \ncomprehensive plan that would once and for all change how this Nation \ndeals with tobacco and dramatically cut the number of our kids addicted \nto this deadly product. More that 400,000 Americans die of tobacco \nrelated illness at a cost of over $100 billion. And the tobacco \nindustry has been engaged in a systematic campaign of distortion and \ndeceit to hook kids and hide the facts from the American people.\n  Our goal is to be on the Senate floor 3 years from now announcing \nthat, indeed, child smoking has been cut in half.\n  The time is ripe for regulation. Every day, 4,000 children under age \n18 start smoking, of which 1,000 will ultimately die of smoking-related \ndiseases. Almost 90 percent of adult smokers started using tobacco at \nor before age 18; the average youth smoker begins at age 13 and becomes \na daily smoker by age 14\\1/2\\.\n  We cannot wait another day to end these senseless and preventable \nstatistics. The Dewine-Kennedy-McConnell amendment will once and for \nall give the FDA the authority they need to regulate this industry \nwhile at the same time give tobacco farmers the ability to get out. I \nwant to be clear, though, there has already been a tremendous amount of \ncompromise to get to this deal and this FDA authority/buyout \ncombination must be kept together for any FSC conference to occur. But \nthe time has come for desperately needed regulation.\n  Five years after the multi-billion-dollar settlement with big \ntobacco, I think we can all agree that we still have a great deal of \nwork to do to protect our Nation's children from tobacco. While the \ntobacco settlement prohibits television and billboard marketing of \ntobacco and direct advertising to children, the end result has been \nless than perfect.\n  The tobacco companies have perceived kids as young as 13 years of age \nas a key market. As an RJR Tobacco document put it, ``Many \nmanufacturers have `studied' the 14-20 market in hopes of uncovering \nthe `secret' of the instant popularity some brands enjoy to the almost \nexclusion of others. . . . Creating a `fad' in this market can be a \ngreat bonanza.''\n  The tobacco industry spent an estimated $10 billion on advertising \nand promotion in 2001. That is $30 million every day. This number is \nmore alarming in light of the fact that this $11 billion is a 67 \npercent increase in spending from 1998 when the settlement took effect.\n  I suppose the tobacco industry can respond by saying that none of \nthis spending was directed specifically at young people. But we do know \nthat in 2000, $60 million was spent on advertising in youth-oriented \nmagazines. We know that, while promotional items such as t-shirts, \nbackpacks, and CD players are ostensibly for smokers over 21 the end \nresult is that 30 percent of kids 12 to 17 years old own at least one \nof these promotional items. This is frightening because students who \nown a promotional item are 4 times more likely to be smokers than kids \nwho don't own these items. Even though we don't see tobacco packaging \nas blatant as Joe Camel, the industry has become more sophisticated in \ntheir approach. Let's take a look at some of these products. You tell \nme a hip-hop picture on Kool cigarettes is not directed at kids.\n  A package of Liquid Zoo cigarettes looks more like a candy package \nthan anything.\n  And there is more. Big tobacco is using promotions and more creative \nmarketing strategies but they are also using slicker tactics than that. \nTake for example a study that found 50 percent of tobacco retailers had \ntobacco ads at young kids' eye level. That is tobacco marketing at \nthree feet or lower. Twenty-three percent of these tobacco retailers \nhad cigarette product displays within 6 inches of candy. How can we say \nthat this is not marketing directed at our kids? These are the kinds of \ntactics that are unconscionable and must be stopped. The FDA must be \ngiven the necessary authority to regulate tobacco.\n  And what about disclosing ingredients? Tobacco can make claims that \ntheir cigarette is safer, and we have no way of proving that.\n  Today, the Senate will consider an amendment that is critical to the \nhealth of both the kids and the adults in our country. This amendment \nwould give the Food and Drug Administration the authority to protect \nourselves from the dangers of starting smoking. This amendment would \ngive the FDA the authority to regulate the sale, distribution, and \nadvertising of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco in order to stop \ntobacco company marketing practices that target children and mislead \nthe public. It would also give the FDA the authority to crack down on \nvendors who continue to sell cigarettes to kids.\n  HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson testified just this morning that over \n$150 billion was spent on tobacco-related illness last year. That is \nonly the monetary cost of this lethal product. Forty-seven million \nAmericans smoke, and 400,000 people a year die because of it. Smokers \nhave a one in three chance of dying from smoking-related conditions. \nThis is not the future that we want to doom our children to. I hope my \nSenate colleagues will join me in protecting the health of our youth by \nsupporting this important amendment.\n  This quota buyout is far from perfect, but I can go along with it as \nlong as it is inextricably bound together with the FDA authority. It is \nabsolutely essential that these two components remain tied together in \nany final legislation that is sent to the President for signature.\n  The quota buyout has been sought by tobacco growers and by the \ntobacco companies. Basically, they say that the current system, begun \nin the Great Depression, is out of date. It cannot accommodate the \npresent-day global market in tobacco and tobacco products.\n  A new system without quotas will be easier for tobacco growers and \nthe tobacco companies to operate under. The buyout of quota will help \nfarm families who face a bleak economic future in tobacco farming make \nthe transition to other opportunities. Clearly, ending the quota and \nprice support system will lower the cost to the tobacco companies of \nacquiring tobacco for manufacturing.\n  If we are giving the tobacco companies an easier system--a less \ncostly system--in which to procure tobacco and conduct their business \nof manufacturing and selling tobacco products, then it is absolutely \ncritical--even more critical--that the FDA have basic\n\n[[Page S8174]]\n\nauthority to regulate the marketing of tobacco to the public--and to \nchildren most importantly.\n  It is also essential that the quota buyout be paid for through \nassessments on the tobacco companies, as it is in this amendment. That \nis so for several reasons. In essence, the funding approach in this \namendment is a continuation of the principle that has been in effect \nfor over two decades, called the No-Net-Cost Tobacco Program.\n  The No-Net-Cost principle--although it has not been followed 100 \npercent--is that the taxpayers do not bear the cost of operating the \ntobacco quota and price support loan program. By the same token, if we \nare ending the tobacco quota and price support loan program in this \namendment then the taxpayers should not be forced to bear that cost. If \nthe taxpayers pay for the quota buyout that would take our policy \nbackwards and abandon the principle established, as I say, more than 20 \nyears ago.\n  We have learned much in the intervening years since the No-Net-Cost \nprinciple was adopted in 1982 about the actions and behavior of the \ntobacco companies. In the face of the companies' infamous record, it \nwould be a blatant travesty of justice to use taxpayer dollars now for \nthe benefit of the tobacco companies through ending the quota and price \nsupport loan program.\n  In any case, the taxpayers don't have the money to fork over for a \ntobacco quota buyout. The House of Representatives has adopted a quota \nbuyout spending $9.6 billion of taxpayer money. In this time of record \nbudget deficits, it would be irresponsible to saddle our children and \ngrandchildren with another nearly $10 billion in debt plus interest \ncosts for years into the future. And it would be even more \nirresponsible to use taxpayer funds for that purpose when critically \nimportant farm bill programs for conservation, rural development, \nresearch and renewable energy have been cut.\n  One last point. This legislation should have been considered by the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry prior to floor action. \nIt is unfortunate that something as significant as the elimination of \nan existing agricultural program and the creation of a new program did \nnot benefit from consideration by the committee of jurisdiction.\n  I would like to turn my attention very briefly at this time to the \nissue of overtime. We are about to go to conference on the FSC/JOBS \nbill, and as we all know, our Senate version of that bill contains my \novertime provision, which passed this body with 52 votes.\n  We voted in the Senate to ensure that any worker who currently has \nthe right to earn overtime as a result of his or her job duties, would \nnot lose that right under the Bush administration's new rules, due to \ntake effect next month.\n  When we debated the new rules back in May, I and others argued that \nthey represented a shameful assault on the paychecks of millions of \nhard-working Americans. We were right. Earlier this week, three former \nDepartment of Labor, DOL, officials, who worked under Republican and \nDemocratic administrations, released a report that detailed their \nassessment of the new rules. It states unequivocally that in every \ninstance where DOL has made a change to existing rules, with the \nexception of the salary-level adjustment, it has weakened the criteria \nfor overtime exemptions.\n  The portion of the rule that expands overtime eligibility for low-\nincome workers by raising the minimum-salary threshold is a good step. \nMy amendment allows that portion of the rule to go forward. I believe \nthe salary threshold should be raised even higher than in DOL's \nproposal, to take inflation into account.\n  Also this week, the Economic Policy Institute, EPI, released its \nanalysis of DOL's final rule, which found that 6 million workers will \nlose their right to overtime when the new regulations take effect. \nEPI's analysis of the administration's new rules include these \nfindings:\n  Nearly 2 million administrative workers will lose overtime rights \nunder a rule change that makes ``team leaders'' ineligible, even when \nthey don't supervise others on the team.\n  A change in the definition of who is a ``learned professional'' will \nmean the end of overtime eligibility for about 920,000 workers without \na college or graduate degree.\n  Overtime rights will end for about 1.4 million workers reclassified \nas executives under the new rules, even though they do little \nsupervision and a great deal of manual or routine work, and they only \nrecommend ``changes in status'' of other workers.\n  Others who will lose their current overtime rights under various \nprovisions of the new law are: 130,000 chefs, sous chefs, and cooks (to \nbe reclassified as ``creative professionals''); 160,000 financial \nservices workers; 117,000 teachers and computer programmers.\n  The stakes for workers--and for our economy--are high. Time-and-a-\nhalf pay accounts for about 25 percent of the total income of Americans \nwho work overtime. I hope the conferees will retain our provision. \nMillions of American workers deserve an iron-clad guarantee that their \novertime rights are safe.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I support the Kennedy-DeWine \ntobacco amendment to the JOBS bill. I believe that FDA authority must \ngo hand-in-hand with any tobacco buy-out. I am pleased that we were \nable to reach this compromise. Although I was unable to cast my vote \nfor this important amendment, I did want to be on the record in support \nof the amendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we have repeatedly regulated tobacco \nconsumption because it is a real public health hazard and we need to \nmake certain that people are aware of the risks they take in using it. \nOf course, that does not mean that any law that regulates tobacco is a \ngood one. The amendment we are discussing would indeed not make good \nlaw. I would like to call your attention to troubling aspects of this \ncurrent amendment that authorizes Food and Drug Administration, FDA, \nregulation of tobacco.\n  This amendment would create more bureaucracy and increase the size of \ngovernment by giving the FDA more control over the tobacco industry. \nThis increased bureaucracy will lead to the need for more funding and \npersonnel to enact the new regulations. This amendment would give the \nSecretary the power to impose ``restrictions on the sale and \ndistribution of a tobacco product, including restrictions on the access \nto, and the advertising and promotion of, the tobacco product, if the \nSecretary determines that such regulation would be appropriate for the \nprotection of the public health.'' Here are some further examples of \nthe increased FDA authority: It would allow the Secretary to require \nwarning labels to cover half a pack of cigarettes, even requiring \ncolors, graphics, and formats.\n  It would give the Secretary authority to require disclosure of any \ncigarette or other tobacco product constituent including any smoke \nconstituent that he deems to benefit public health. This could very \neasily be an impossible burden levied at the Secretary's whim.\n  When it comes to record keeping, this bill simply says that the \nSecretary of the FDA will take into account the size of businesses when \nputting the regulations into place. This new authority is too vague, \nand it could be interpreted as giving the FDA the ability to \ndiscriminate based on arbitrary ideas of what size a business should \nbe. This amendment would give the FDA wholesale authority to regulate \nevery aspect of construction, ingredients, components or properties, \nincluding the sale, distribution, access, marketing and labeling, \nthrough the application of ``product standards.''\n  I am also troubled by the fact that we do not have the option to make \namendments to such an expansive bill since it is being rushed through \nthe Senate attached to the FSC/ETI bill instead of following \ntraditional committee procedures such as hearings and markup and floor \namendment.\n  This amendment cites underage tobacco use as a reason for increased \nregulation. Underage use is troubling, but the fact is that there are \nalready decisive laws in place to prevent minors from purchasing \ntobacco. There is a need for better enforcement, not more FDA \nregulation. The authority given to the FDA in this amendment no longer \nfocuses on reducing youth usage, but rather, on adult consumption by \nstating that the new restrictions focus on protecting the public \nhealth.\n\n[[Page S8175]]\n\n  Another problem is that this amendment holds retailers accountable \nfor labeling when it is the manufacturer's responsibility. ``This \nparagraph shall not relieve a retailer of liability if the retailer \nsells or distributes tobacco products that are not labeled in \naccordance with this subsection.''\n  These FDA regulations would reduce competition by increasing \nregulatory costs and restricting the ability to communicate with adult \nsmokers.\n  These proposals place so many barriers to the introduction of new \nconventional products, those making no health claims and potentially \nreduced risk, that it discourages their development.\n  It increases black market attractiveness. The numerous restrictions \nand regulations provide ample incentives to illegal operators.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of several statements made by \nthe National Association of Convenience Stores, the American \nConservative Union, the Association of National Advertisers, the \nAmerican Association of Advertising Agencies, the American Advertising \nFederation, the American Wholesale Marketers Association, and many on \nthe HELP Committee, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                        of Convenience Stores,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, June 17, 2004.\n     Re KEY VOTE ALERT.\n\n     Hon. Senator Frist,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist: I am writing on behalf of the National \n     Association of Convenience Stores (NACS) to inform you that \n     as drafted, and without significant changes, the Kennedy-\n     DeWine amendment to the FSC/ETI bill, regarding FDA's \n     authority to regulate the sale of tobacco products has a \n     significant negative impact to the retailing community and \n     therefore, NACS urges you to oppose this effort.\n       NACS is an international trade association that represents \n     the over 130,000 convenience stores across the United States \n     whom employ over 1.4 million hard working Americans. Small \n     family- owned operations predominant in the convenience store \n     industry, and in fact, 70 percent of NACS members own and \n     operate 10 or less stores.\n       This legislation, introduced by Senators Ted Kennedy and \n     Mike DeWine and Representatives Henry Waxman, Tom Davis and \n     Marty Meehan, has several fundamental problems.\n       Convenience Stores Receive Unequal Treatment: Under this \n     legislation, all tobacco retailers are NOT treated equally. \n     To be comprehensive, all retailers of tobacco, including \n     those selling over the internet, through the mail, through \n     adult-only locations, and on Indian reservations, must abide \n     by the same regulations, however, these bill fall far short. \n     Further the bill does not specify how the law will be \n     enforced (state, local or federal authorities), thereby \n     neglecting the issue of Native American sovereignty and \n     enforcement on tribal lands (to which all consumers have \n     access through the internet).\n       Responsible Retailers Treated Unfairly: Authors of this \n     legislation continue to hold retailers liable for actions out \n     of their control. For example: If a company trains its \n     associates in an agreed-upon age-verification course, that \n     company should not lose its tobacco license if a trained \n     associate makes a mistake (knowingly or accidentally). If the \n     company is irresponsible and does not prepare its associates \n     properly, only then should the store have its tobacco license \n     suspended. Additionally, retailers should not be held \n     responsible for the numerous warning labels being required on \n     product delivered to them.\n       Missing Penalties on Minors: Minors, not retailers, \n     initiate attempted illegal transactions. There should be \n     adequate penalties to discourage both supply and demand of \n     underage tobacco consumption. These bills have no such \n     provision.\n       Lacking Key Provision: Retailers need tools to help \n     continue to crack down on illegal sales. Another provision \n     missing would allow for easier electronic age verification \n     for retailers choosing to use this tool.\n       Unconstitutional Provisions Included: There are also \n     advertising restrictions, which the U.S. Supreme Court has \n     already struck down as unconstitutional. Moreover, these \n     restrictions could negatively impact signage inside a store \n     since it may be visible from outside the store.\n       Although the authors indicated that retailers' concerns \n     were addressed in this legislation bill, they fell short in \n     several areas and failed to address several major points of \n     contention. Without significant changes to the Family Smoking \n     Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (S. 2461 and H.R. 4433), \n     NACS urges Members to oppose this legislation and will KEY \n     VOTE AGAINST any similar amendment that negatively impacts \n     the retailing industry.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Allison R. Shulman,\n     Director, Government Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  American Conservative Union,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, July 15, 2004.\n       Dear Senator: The American Conservative Union has learned \n     that anti-smoking and public health advocates are dropping \n     their support of the proposed FDA legislation which is \n     scheduled for consideration on the Senate floor today. \n     Members of these groups have concluded that no evidence \n     exists that links established performance standards by the \n     FDA to safer products and fewer deaths, as argued by Philip \n     Morris.\n       In fact, public health advocates are convinced that the \n     basic regulatory framework established by the FDA bill will \n     make it virtually impossible for reduced-risk products to \n     enter the marketplace. When the economic incentive for \n     companies to fund comprehensive and meaningful research into \n     significantly safer products is taken away, the economic \n     enticement of profit ceases to exist.\n       FDA regulation could potentially be used to encourage \n     research, develop and market actual reduced risk products, \n     but the proposed legislation does the opposite. It acts as a \n     roadblock preventing development and marketing of these \n     constantly evolving products.\n       The passage of FDA regulation is good for only one thing: \n     padding Philip Morris' bottom line.\n       This new information further reinforces ACU's opposition to \n     the current FDA regulation legislation. On behalf of our one-\n     million members and supporters, the American Conservative \n     Union strongly urges you to oppose and vote against FDA \n     regulation of American tobacco, an industry that already is \n     sufficiently regulated by the federal government. This \n     harmful prospect is bad for American business, and more \n     importantly, curbs the incentive for continuing the research \n     and development of safer products, as public health experts \n     have concluded.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     June 1, 2004.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     Chairman, Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, \n         U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the Association of National \n     Advertisers (ANA), the American Association of Advertising \n     Agencies (AAAA) and the American Advertising Federation \n     (AAF), we are writing to express our opposition to several of \n     the marketing provisions of S. 2461, the ``Family Smoking \n     Prevention and Tobacco Control Act.''\n       We oppose section 102 of the bill, which would direct the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services to publish an interim \n     final rule that is ``identical in its provisions'' to the \n     proposed rule promulgated by the FDA in 1996. Legal experts \n     from across the political spectrum agree that the sweeping \n     and unprecedented restrictions in that proposal, which would \n     result in a de facto ban on tobacco advertising, would \n     violate the First Amendment. In fact, the U.S. Supreme Court \n     held in the Lorillard case in 2001 that a Massachusetts \n     tobacco regulation that was virtually identical to one part \n     of the FDA proposal was unconstitutional.\n       Section 201 of the bill would add new disclosure \n     requirements for all tobacco advertising on top of those \n     contained in the FDA's 1996 proposed rule. In addition, the \n     bill would require the FDA to conduct a rulemaking to \n     determine whether it should mandate the inclusion of tar and \n     nicotine yields in all labels and advertising. All of the \n     various disclosure requirements of S. 2461 place the \n     government in the role of copywriter. By ``seizing'' a \n     substantial portion of every tobacco ad for government-\n     mandated disclosures, the bill raises First Amendment \n     concerns about ``compelled speech'' and could result in an \n     unconstitutional ``taking'' of a company's commercial \n     property in violation of the Fifth Amendment.\n       We also oppose section 203 of S. 2461, which would grant \n     new authority to state and local governments to impose \n     ``specific bans or restrictions on the time, place and \n     manner'' of tobacco advertisements. Much of the advertising \n     for tobacco products occurs in interstate commerce. Allowing \n     individual states and local governments to impose their own \n     bans or restrictions would result in a crazy-quilt of \n     inconsistent laws, making tobacco advertising virtually \n     impossible.\n       We take no position on the provisions of the bill that \n     would generally grant the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \n     the authority to regulate tobacco products.\n     Enacting the FDA's 1996 Tobacco Advertising Restrictions \n         Would Violate the First Amendment\n       We believe that the sweeping tobacco advertising \n     restrictions promulgated by the FDA in 1996 violate the First \n     Amendment rights of tobacco companies to communicate with \n     adults. The FDA's proposal would impose the following \n     restrictions on tobacco advertising:\n       Ban all outdoor advertising for tobacco products within \n     1,000 feet of any elementary or secondary school or \n     playground;\n       Require all permitted tobacco advertising, including direct \n     mail, to be black text on a white background, except in \n     magazines, newspapers or other periodicals with adult \n     readership of 85% or more, or fewer than 2 million readers \n     under the age of 18;\n       Require all advertisements and labels to identify the \n     tobacco product as a ``nicotine delivery device'';\n       Require all advertisements to contain a government-dictated \n     ``brief statement'' (in\n\n[[Page S8176]]\n\n     addition to the current Surgeon General's warning) to serve \n     as a warning about possible dangers associated with the use \n     of tobacco products;\n       Ban the use of promotional items such as hats or T-shirts \n     containing the name or logo of a tobacco product, and \n     prohibit other promotional techniques such as product give-\n     aways, rebates or refunds;\n       Require sponsorship of athletic, musical, social or other \n     cultural events in corporate name only;\n       Require all advertisers of tobacco products to fund and \n     participate in a national public education campaign designed \n     to discourage the use of tobacco products by minors. The FDA \n     would require the annual fund established for this campaign \n     to total $150 million;\n       Require compliance with more stringent requirements as \n     enacted by state and local governments; and\n       Authorize the enactment of additional restrictions seven \n     years after implementation of a final rule if the number of \n     minors who use tobacco products has not decreased by 50% from \n     1994 levels.\n       The net effect of the FDA proposal would be a de facto ban \n     on advertising tobacco products. This regulatory package \n     violates the First Amendment protections for commercial \n     speech.\n       The U.S. Supreme Court has made it clear that truthful, \n     nondeceptive commercial speech cannot be banned or restricted \n     unless the restriction ``directly and materially advances'' a \n     ``substantial governmental interest'' and is ``narrowly \n     tailored'' to ``reasonably fit'' that interest. See Central \n     Hudson Gas and Electric Corporation v. Public Service \n     Commission of New York, 447 U.S. 557 (1980).\n       In 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U.S. 484 \n     (1996), a unanimous Supreme Court reaffirmed that all \n     truthful, nondeceptive advertising about a legal product is \n     entitled to the same level of First Amendment protection, \n     regardless of the product.\n       In the Lorillard case, the Supreme Court struck down a \n     regulation promulgated by the Attorney General of \n     Massachusetts that was similar in many respects to the FDA's \n     proposed rule. The Massachusetts regulation banned outdoor \n     ads within 1,000-feet of schools, parks and playgrounds and \n     also restricted point-of-sale advertising for tobacco \n     products. See Lorillard Tobacco Company v. Thomas Reilly, \n     Attorney General of Massachusetts, 533 U.S. 525 (2001).\n       In finding that the Massachusetts regulation was not \n     narrowly tailored, Justice O' Connor actually noted a similar \n     problem with the FDA regulation: ``First, the Attorney \n     General did not seem to consider the impact of the 1,000-foot \n     restriction on commercial speech in major metropolitan areas. \n     The Attorney General apparently selected the 1,000-foot \n     distance based on the FDA's decision to impose an identical \n     1,000- foot restriction when it attempted to regulate \n     cigarette and smokeless tobacco advertising. (Citations \n     omitted) But the FDA's 1,000-foot regulation was not an \n     adequate basis for the Attorney General to tailor the \n     Massachusetts regulations. The degree to which speech is \n     suppressed--or alternative avenues for speech remain \n     available--under a particular regulatory scheme tends to be \n     case specific. (Citations omitted) And a case specific \n     analysis makes sense, for although a State or locality may \n     have common interests and concerns about underage smoking and \n     the effects of tobacco advertisements, the impact of a \n     restriction on speech will undoubtedly vary from place to \n     place. The FDA's regulations would have had widely disparate \n     effects nationwide. Even in Massachusetts, the effect of the \n     Attorney General's speech regulations will vary based on \n     whether a locale is rural, suburban, or urban. The uniformly \n     broad sweep of the geographical limitation demonstrates a \n     lack of tailoring.'' (Emphasis added)\n       Thus, the Supreme Court has already examined one provision \n     of the FDA proposal--the 1,000-foot ban on outdoor ads--and \n     suggested that it violates the First Amendment because it is \n     not narrowly tailored.\n       The Supreme Court rejected the efforts of the Massachusetts \n     Attorney General to ``childproof' the flow of information in \n     our society. Children deserve to be protected from \n     inappropriate or harmful material, but the government may not \n     use the guise of protecting children to impose sweeping \n     restrictions on information intended for adults. In Bolger v. \n     Youngs Drug Products Corporation, 463 U.S. 60 (1980), the \n     Court stated that efforts to restrict advertising cannot \n     lower discourse in society ``to the level of the sandbox'' \n     and citing Butler v. Michigan, 353 U.S. 383 (1957), that \n     ``Government may not reduce the adult population . . . to \n     reading only that which is fit for children.'' 463 U.S. at \n     73.\n       One of the most vocal critics of the tobacco industry, \n     Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe, argued that the \n     tobacco advertising bans included in the master settlement \n     agreement between the tobacco companies and the states, if \n     legislated, would raise serious First Amendment concerns. So \n     have a broad range of public policy groups, from the \n     Washington Legal Foundation to the American Civil Liberties \n     Union (ACLU). In testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     on February 20, 1998, the ACLU stated: ``The ACLU believes \n     that . . . both legislation and proposed regulation by the \n     Food and Drug Administration (FDA) . . . on tobacco \n     advertisements . . . is wholly unprecedented and, if enacted, \n     will most likely fail to withstand constitutional challenge. \n     Moreover, we believe that the enactment of the proposed \n     tobacco advertising restrictions would impose a drastic \n     curtailment of commercial speech and could have a chilling \n     effect on the right of the public and businesses to engage in \n     free speech about controversial subjects.''\n       A number of legal scholars, including Judge Robert Bork; \n     Burt Neuborne, Professor of Law at New York University School \n     of Law; Rodney Smolla, Professor of Law at the College of \n     William & Mary; and First Amendment expert Floyd Abrams have \n     all publicly testified regarding the constitutional problems \n     with legislating this type of speech restriction. In a \n     Washington Legal Foundation publication in 1996, Judge Bork \n     stated: ``[T]he recent proposal of the Food and Drug \n     Administration (FDA) to restrict severely the First Amendment \n     rights of American companies and individuals who, in one way \n     or another, have any connection with tobacco products [is] \n     patently unconstitutional under the Supreme Court's current \n     doctrine concerning commercial speech as well as under the \n     original understanding of the First Amendment.''\n       While the government has a legitimate interest in fighting \n     the use of tobacco products by minors, the FDA's proposed \n     regulations sweep far too broadly and result in massive \n     censorship of truthful speech aimed at adults.\n     New Disclosure Requirements Would Overload Advertisements\n       As noted above, the FDA's proposed rule from 1996 would \n     require that all ads identify the tobacco product as a \n     ``nicotine delivery device'' and contain a government-\n     dictated ``brief statement,'' in addition to the current \n     Surgeon General's warnings. Section 201 of S. 2461 would add \n     another layer of disclosures to all ads. It would require the \n     ``label statement'' to comprise at least 20% of the area of \n     the ad, to be placed at the top of each ad with specific \n     type-sizes. Further, section 206 of the bill requires an FDA \n     rulemaking to determine whether the agency should also \n     mandate the inclusion of tar and nicotine yields in all \n     labels and advertising.\n       These various disclosure requirements would result in \n     information overload for all tobacco product ads. By \n     mandating these disclosures and requiring specific type \n     sizes, the bill would place the government in the role of \n     copywriter. It raises serious First Amendment concerns about \n     ``compelled speech.'' It could ultimately result in an \n     unconstitutional ``taking'' of the company's commercial \n     message in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Advertising is \n     not free. When a tobacco company purchases advertising space, \n     it acquires an important property interest. The multiple \n     disclosure requirements of S. 2461 would literally ``seize'' \n     a substantial portion of the company's space and conscript it \n     for government-mandated messages. This would be an \n     interference with both free speech and property rights.\n     New State/Local Ad Restrictions Would Make Tobacco \n         Advertising Impossible\n       We are strongly opposed to section 203 of S. 2461. That \n     provision would authorize states and thousands of local \n     governments to impose ``specific bans or restrictions on the \n     time, place and manner, but not content,'' of tobacco \n     advertising. This could result in a crazy quilt of \n     inconsistent advertising restrictions, both intra-state and \n     inter-state. For example, tobacco advertising is often placed \n     in publications with regional or national distribution. How \n     could a tobacco company place an ad in a popular magazine \n     that complies with hundreds or potentially thousands of \n     inconsistent restrictions on the ``time, place and manner'' \n     of tobacco ads?\n       This provision would make tobacco advertising impossible on \n     a regional or national basis and result in a defacto ban on \n     this category. It would authorize state and local governments \n     to engage in censorship of one form of speech based solely on \n     its content.\n     Conclusion\n       Some claim that tobacco products are unique, so that it is \n     permissible to ignore the First Amendment just for those \n     products. The Supreme Court has rejected this theory in a \n     series of cases, including Lorillard and the 44 Liquormart \n     case. What you do to tobacco advertising today, you will be \n     urged to do to advertising for many other ``controversial'' \n     products tomorrow. Justice Thomas recognized this in his \n     concurring opinion in the Lorillard case: ``Nevertheless, it \n     seems appropriate to point out that to uphold the \n     Massachusetts tobacco regulations would be to accept a line \n     of reasoning that would permit restrictions on advertising \n     for a host of other products.''\n       Don't start down this road to content-based censorship of \n     advertising. We urge you to remove these marketing provisions \n     from S. 2461. The government can take strong, effective steps \n     to restrict tobacco sales and access to minors without \n     trampling on the First Amendment.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our views.\n           Sincerely,\n       Daniel L.

Many of our \n     members are your constituents. On behalf of my AWMA members, \n     I am writing to let you know of our deep concerns over the \n     devastating impact this legislation would have upon our \n     industry.\n       Tobacco products are among the many goods distributed by \n     our members and many of these businesses are small, family-\n     owned operations. The burdensome recordkeeping requirements \n     and the onerous regulations resulting from this legislation \n     would work a tremendous hardship on these business owners. In \n     addition, there are concerns that this legislation could be \n     ``the camel's nose under the tent'' and create a back door \n     ban on tobacco products through additional restrictions on \n     the approval, sale, distribution and advertising of these \n     products. And, the costly layer of regulation to be imposed \n     by this legislation would cause problems for these family-\n     owned businesses while providing no real benefit to the \n     public.\n       Our AWMA members consider this issue to be of vital \n     importance and, therefore, I urge you to vote against any \n     legislation that would provide for FDA regulatory authority \n     over tobacco products. Thank you in advance for your kind \n     consideration of these concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Scott Ramminger,\n\n                                                        President,\n     American Wholesale Marketers Association.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   Statement by Members of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \n                               Committee\n\n       Many on the HELP Committee have concerns with the FDA \n     aspect of the amendment based on the following reasons, ``In \n     our view it does not represent principles of good government. \n     It does not produce a strong uniform FDA. For example, we are \n     concerned about the preemption provisions--we are concerned \n     about the lack of due process in the reissuance of a Clinton \n     era tobacco rule--also we are concerned about the claims of \n     the provisions of the bill.''\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. These groups are all concerned about the bill. I echo \ntheir concern. This proposal will greatly increase Federal mandates and \nregulations on tobacco that lead to more Government control. I find it \ntroubling that Congress is willing to grant so much authority to an \nexecutive agency while not allowing us adequate time to evaluate and \npossibly amend this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that whoever is in \nopposition have an equal amount of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, as we close debate, I thank Jeff Tites, \nSenator Kennedy's very able assistant, who has worked on this \nlegislation, and I also want to thank my assistants, Abby Kral, Paul \nCallogi, Mike Dawson, and Carla Carpenter, who could not be here \nbecause she had a baby. We miss Carla, and we welcome into the world \nRavis Mathew, her son who was just born. We are very glad about that.\n  Let me respond very briefly to my friend from Oklahoma and his \ncomments about the FDA bill not having seen the light of day. The \namendment that is in front of us is the DeWine-Kennedy bill, which is \nnow an amendment. The DeWine-Kennedy bill was actually introduced in \nMay of this year. It is the only FDA regulation of tobacco bill that \nwas introduced, so it has been out here for people to look at for a \nlong time. It was the product of lengthy negotiations between health \ngroups and others. We went back and forth for a long time. It is not \nreally dissimilar to other bills that have been talked about before in \nother negotiations. It has evolved over a long period of time. It is \nthe work product of Senator Kennedy and myself, but it is the second \ngeneration or third generation of what others have done.\n  So the concepts in this bill are not fundamentally new. There is \nnothing in this bill that should come as a surprise to anyone.\n  As I said, this has been on the floor for a long time. People have \nhad an opportunity to look at it. Interested parties have had a chance \nto examine it.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. I think we are getting \nclose to closing this down.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, Senator Kennedy would like to close at \nthis point. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will take a moment to once again thank \nSenator DeWine for his strong leadership in our Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee on this issue. I thank our leaders for \nbringing us to where we are. I thank Senator McConnell for the \nopportunity to work with him on this issue. And I thank our colleagues \nfor the strong support we have seen during the course of this \ndiscussion.\n  This health issue is the most important health issue we are facing on \nwhich we can make serious progress, progress that is almost the \nequivalent of conquering cancer--it is that important--because we have \nan epidemic of smoking that is affecting the children of this Nation. \nIt is enormously adverse to their health conditions, and it is a source \nof premature death to them as they grow and develop in the future, \ncausing all kinds of health ailments.\n  This is a children's issue, a health issue, a family issue because \nwith this legislation, there are going to be more children who are \ngoing to be able to see their parents when they grow older and there \nare more children who will see their grandparents when they grow older. \nWe have an opportunity to make a major downpayment and major progress \nin the quality of health for these children.\n  I thank those who have spoken in favor of the legislation. Hopefully, \nwe will get strong support for it when the votes are cast.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of supporters be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             List of Supporters of DeWine-Kennedy FDA Bill\n\n       American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of \n     Nurse Practitioners, American Academy of Pediatrics, American \n     Cancer Society, American College of Cardiology, American \n     College of Chest Physicians, American College of Physicians, \n     American College of Preventive Medicine, American Dental \n     Association, American Heart Association, American Lung \n     Association, American Medical Association, American Public \n     Health Association, American Psychological Association, \n     American School Health Association, American Society of \n     Addiction Medicine, American Society of Clinical Oncology, \n     American Thoracic Society, Association of Maternal and Child \n     Health Programs, Association of Schools of Public Health.\n       Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, Center for Parish Nursing & \n     Health Ministries, Center for Tobacco Cessation, Children's \n     Defense Fund, Church of the Brethen Witness/Washington \n     Office, Church Women United, Evangelical Lutheran Church in \n     America, General Board of Church and Society of the United \n     Methodist Church, General Board of Global Ministries The \n     United Methodist Church, Special Program on Substance Abuse \n     and Related Violence (SPSARV), Health Ministries Association, \n     Interreligious Coalition\n\n[[Page S8178]]\n\n     on Smoking or Health, Islamic Society of North America, \n     National Latino Council on Alcohol and Tobacco Prevention, \n     National Association of County and City Health Officials \n     (NACCHO), National Association of Local Boards of Health, \n     National Center for Policy Research for Women & Families, \n     National Education Association, National Woman's Christian \n     Temperance Union, National Women's Law Center, Oncology \n     Nursing Society.\n       Office of Family and Children's Ministries of Disciples \n     Home Missions of the Disciples, Praxis Project, Presbyterian \n     Church (USA), Washington Office, Seventh-day Adventist \n     Church, Society for Public Health Education, Tobacco Program, \n     Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, United Church \n     of Christ.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I have a couple comments. Again, I \ncompliment my colleagues, Senator Kennedy and Senator DeWine. They have \nbeen steadfast in their advocacy. Senator DeWine is right, he and \nSenator Kennedy introduced this a long time ago. If I am correct, it \ndid not pass out of a committee, it is not on the calendar, and all of \na sudden it appears on the floor.\n  These are two bills combined, and my biggest objection is with the \nbuyout. The buyout is $12 billion. How often do we spend $12 billion \naround here without having any hearing on it? The buyout did not pass \nout of a committee. It did not pass out of the Agriculture Committee. \nIt certainly was not considered by the Budget Committee.\n  There is no payment limitation, I say to Senator Grassley. In the \nHouse bill, with the $9.6 billion, it is estimated by one group to be \n480 millionaires. Some estimates are 85 percent of the quota owners are \nnot farmers. I do not know how many of those will be made millionaires.\n  The Senate bill we are going to vote on does not even eliminate the \ntobacco program. A lot of people are thinking we will spend this money, \nwe will buy the quotas back, and then be done with it. No, there will \nbe a Federal board set up by the Secretary. The Secretary will \nestablish a permanent advisory board for the purpose of setting what \nkind of tobacco shall be in the Acreage Limitation Program, I tell my \ncolleague from Nevada, where they limit acres, make recommendations on \nacres.\n  The Secretary, with the Tobacco Quality Board, shall establish and \nmaintain the Acreage Limitation Program for each crop, each kind of \ntobacco. If we have an acreage limitation program, that is a price \nsupport program. That is a continuation of the tobacco program.\n  So we are going to throw away $12 billion and maybe benefit one \ntobacco company versus all the other tobacco companies, spend a whole \nlot more money, have another 100 some-odd pages of regulations, some of \nwhich were so intrusive--I have not had a chance to review these \nregulations in detail, but in past years, some of these regulations \ndealt with convenience stores. If a convenience store did not check IDs \nof people up to age 21 or age 25, they could be penalized and fined and \nsuccessively with higher penalties. If they did not check IDs three or \nfour times of somebody who is 24 years old--they are military and \nobviously old enough to smoke--if they did not check their ID, the \nfines could be in the thousands of dollars.\n  That was in previous regulations. I am not sure if it is in these \nregulations because I have not had enough time to decide. I know there \nis a blank check for the Secretary to outlaw tobacco if he so desires, \nto ban advertising if he so desires.\n  I don't like tobacco consumption. I don't want people to smoke. If \nCongress wants to ban tobacco, let's do it. Let Congress do it. Let the \nelected officials do it, not the Secretary of HHS. These regulations \nare too broad. I know Senator Gregg had a proposal that was not quite \nas aggressive. I would like to vote on it. I would like to consider the \ntwo. We don't even have the option. The option is take these \nregulations, 155 pages--and my guess is most were promulgated by the \nClinton administration which we rejected earlier--and then let's add a \n$12 billion buyout program that almost guarantees we will have a buyout \nprogram that comes out of conference on the FSC/ETI bill.\n\n  My final comment is, two wrongs do not make a right. The House was \nwrong to put in a tobacco buyout in the FSC/ETI bill. Now we are going \nto double that wrong and almost ensure it is going to come back from \nconference with a multibillion-dollar buyout, where some people are \ngoing to make millions of dollars. We are going to pay people a whole \nlot of money and maybe even continue the program. That is absurd. That \nis a waste of money. That is paying people for the privilege--frankly, \nif they had a quota, the Government gave them a quota; they had a \nspecial benefit over all other landowners in the United States. \nOklahoma did not have a quota. We could not grow tobacco if we wanted \nto. We could not get the higher prices. Now we give a special reward to \npeople who have a quota. We buy them out, and we are going to have a \nprice support program in addition if we pass the Senate language.\n  That is bad legislation. I hope our colleagues will recognize if they \nvote for this today and if it comes back from conference in any way \nresembling this, they are going to be embarrassed because a year or so \nfrom now, somebody is going to do a report saying XYZ tobacco quota \nowner--and there are several in the District of Columbia. I don't know \nhow much tobacco is grown in the District of Columbia, but quotaholders \nin the District of Columbia get millions of dollars. They are going to \nbe reading about this and be upset, and they are going to say: \nCongress, how could you do this? Then they are going to go back and \nsay: Congress didn't debate this much.\n  I compliment my colleague from Ohio. Most of the debate has been on \nthe FDA regulations, not the buyout.\n  I hope my colleagues reject the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, this has been a very good debate. In \nclosing the debate, I thank all those who have participated. I ask my \ncolleagues to vote yes. Ultimately, this is a question about common \nsense, having the FDA regulate this product, and it is a question of \nsaving lives. That is what we will do.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/15/senate-section/article/S8178-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8178-S8217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    UNITED STATES-AUSTRALIA FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I now ask unanimous consent that the FSC bill be \ntemporarily set aside and I now move to proceed to H.R. 4759, the \nAustralia Free Trade Agreement. I further ask consent that there be 6 \nhours equally divided between the chairman and ranking member or their \ndesignees; provided further that all other provisions of the statute \nremain applicable to the bill.\n  Further, I ask unanimous consent that following the use or yielding \nback of the time the Senate proceed to a vote on the passage of H.R. \n4759, and immediately following that vote the Senate resume \nconsideration of the FSC bill and proceed to a vote in relation to the \nDeWine amendment as provided under the order.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes equally \ndivided for debate prior to the second vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we would have 2 \nminutes on each side, if there is opposition to this, which I think \nthere will be. Is that right?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes. That would be on the DeWine amendment?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator modify his request?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Before the distinguished chairman makes his statement, for \nthe\n\n[[Page S8179]]\n\n3 hours on our side, I would ask that 90 minutes of that time be \nassigned to Senator Dorgan, 60 minutes to Senator Conrad, 15 minutes to \nSenator Dayton, and 10 minutes to Senator Feingold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will now proceed with 6 hours of \ndebate equally divided.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, for staff and Senators who are not on \nthe floor, I call attention to the fact that we are starting the debate \non the United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement. We have 3 hours on \nthis side. I have not had many requests for time, and I know that two \nor three Members want to speak. I urge those Members to come over early \nto speak because if we can yield back time we do want to do so.\n  I was only going to speak about 7 or 8 minutes. The Senator from \nOklahoma wanted to speak 5 minutes. Is there any problem if I give the \nSenator from Oklahoma 5 minutes right now and then I speak 7 or 8 \nminutes and then the Senator from North Dakota can have the floor?\n  Mr. DORGAN. No problem.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4759) to implement the United States-Australia \n     Free Trade Agreement.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Grassley and \nSenator Baucus for the way they have managed this bill. They have \nconducted their work in a very appropriate way. They had hearings on \nthis bill. I want to compliment Ambassador Zoellick. Our trade \nnegotiator did an outstanding job in putting this together.\n  This trade agreement is a win/win. It is a win for Australia and it \nis a win for the United States. I am pleased to see the Senate work as \nit is supposed to work. We had hearings on it. We had a markup in \ncommittee. We are now having it considered on the floor.\n  This is going to open additional markets and reduce tariffs for the \nUnited States. It is going to be a win for Australia as well. Both \ncountries, strong allies, will benefit as a result.\n  Prime Minister Howard of Australia has been a good friend and ally of \nthe United States. He has been steadfast in helping us in many ways, \ntrade being one of them. Again, free trade, equal trade, open access, \nwe are winning or gaining more because the tariffs were higher on their \nside in many respects and so this is positive for United States \nconsumers and for Australian consumers.\n  Again, I want to compliment the administration for proposing this \nagreement, for the work that was done by our trade negotiators, and \nalso by Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus for bringing this up so \nquickly on the floor, getting it through the Finance Committee and \nultimately through the Senate today. I also want to compliment our \nleader, Senator Frist, for making this happen.\n  I led a delegation to Australia earlier this year. We felt very \nstrongly in our support not only for this agreement but frankly in \nstrengthening our relationships with such a great ally and friend as \nAustralia. So I am very pleased to support this agreement. I urge our \ncolleagues to support it with an overwhelming vote later this \nafternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senate majority \nleader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n Unanimous Consent Request--authorizing the Judiciary Committee to meet\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the agreement we have underway provides for \ntwo votes later this afternoon. The first is final passage of the \nAustralia free-trade bill and the second is the DeWine amendment to the \nFSC legislation. I hope we will not need all 6 hours set aside for the \nAustralia bill. Some members have already spoken over the course of \nyesterday, and therefore we may be able to expedite consideration of \nthis bill over the course of the afternoon by yielding back some time.\n  In any event, for the benefit of Senators, I wanted to notify them we \nwill be stacking these two votes later today.\n  On another matter, I have been notified that the minority objected to \nthe Judiciary Committee meeting today at 2. The other 12 committee \nrequests were granted, and that one request was objected to. There is a \nlot of important work to be done by the Judiciary Committee. As I look \nat it, the chairman has four judges on the agenda, as well as \nlegislation. As I look at the schedule, I note that the Hatch-Feinstein \nconstitutional amendment on flag desecration was scheduled as well \ntoday. I feel it is important to get to both the nominations as well as \nthe legislation.\n  It was only the other day there were complaints on the floor about \nnot taking constitutional amendments through committee, and that is on \ntheir agenda today. Now we have objections to going through the process \nof having the committee meet to consider the nominations and \nlegislation. I hope my colleagues on the Democratic side will rethink \ntheir objection so we can proceed and the Judiciary Committee can \nproceed with this important business and allow these committees to do \ntheir work.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on the Judiciary be \nauthorized to meet to continue its markup on Thursday, July 15, 2004, \nat 2 p.m. in the Dirksen Senate Office Building, Room 226.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while the distinguished majority leader is \non the floor, we have already started receiving calls in the cloakroom \nand I am sure the Republican cloakroom has received similar calls. If \nwe are able to finish the work on the trade bill and the FSC conference \nlegislation that is now before the body, will we have votes tomorrow?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, before I commit to no votes tomorrow, these \ntwo bills we are voting on today are very important and I would think \nwe would not have votes tomorrow, but before people take that and sort \nof run with it, let me have some conversations over the next 30 minutes \nor so.\n  Mr. REID. Also, I ask the leader, through the Chair, would he also \ngive some indication before the day is out as to what he plans on \nMonday?\n  Mr. FRIST. We will. There are a lot of Members whose schedules very \nmuch depend on when we vote either tomorrow or later tonight--hopefully \nnot later tonight, but earlier tonight as well as on Monday night or \nTuesday morning. We will work all of that out within the next hour or \nso, so we can notify Members.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. FRIST. Be happy to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the majority leader is speaking of \nschedules, in this case the schedule of the Senate Judiciary Committee. \nI inquire of the majority leader about the schedule with respect to \nlegislation he and I have spoken about at great length. The last \noccasion was about midnight on the floor of the Senate, after which I \nallowed the nomination of Dr. McClellan to proceed. As a result of \nthat, the issue of allowing prescription drug reimportation in this \ncountry and legislation that is bipartisan in scope with over 30 \nSenators now cosponsoring it, I had intended and hoped we would have an \nopportunity to vote on that on the Senate floor. I have not had the \nopportunity to speak with the majority leader at length in recent days, \nbut my hope would be we could go back and revisit what is put in the \nCongressional Record. And my hope is what was put in the Congressional \nRecord will then allow us to have an opportunity on the floor of the \nSenate to advance the legislation that we previously discussed dealing \nwith the reimportation of prescription drugs and allowing us to put \ndownward pressure on prescription drug prices in this country.\n\n  I ask the majority leader whether he has had an opportunity to go \nthrough that and whether he could give me some advice as to when he \nwould allow that to be debated on the floor of the Senate?\n\n[[Page S8180]]\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will be happy to be in discussion with my \ncolleague. Since our discussion, now many weeks ago, we have made real \nprogress in terms of understanding the potential impact of allowing the \nreimportation of drugs. I think there has been a lot of discussion on \nboth sides of the aisle. We had an extended meeting yesterday talking \nabout the safety issue surrounding it.\n  Since our discussion, there have been hearings in the appropriate \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pension Committee. There has been a bill \nput together by the principals in the committee, the responsible \ncommittee. There have been scheduled markups, and I believe there is a \nmarkup scheduled for next week on that particular bill. So progress is \nbeing made.\n  It is a very important issue. We are talking about not just \nreimportation and the cost of drugs, but we are talking about the \nsafety of drugs being used. I think we have made a huge amount of \nprogress over the last several weeks, so in terms of scheduling and \nlooking at what time that might be considered on the floor of the \nSenate, I will be happy to be in discussion with my colleague.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am happy to bring to my colleagues the \nUnited States-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act. This \nis a bill that Congress must pass to actually implement what has been \nnegotiated as the United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement. This is \nunder the process that we call trade promotion authority. This is a \nprocess by which Congress, which has the constitutional power to \nregulate interstate and foreign commerce, has delegated negotiating \nauthority to the President to negotiate certain trade agreements. But \nbecause we have that constitutional authority, we cannot give to the \nPresident of the United States the authority to change U.S. law as it \nmight be negotiated.\n  So we are now dealing with legislation that changes U.S. law and \nmakes the United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement not a treaty \napproved just by the Senate of the United States, as we know treaties \nare, by two-thirds vote, but this is basic law. It has passed the House \nof Representatives by a majority vote, hopefully it will pass the \nSenate by a majority vote, and it is to be signed by the President.\n  We are dealing with the constitutional authority of the Congress to \nregulate foreign and interstate commerce, but understanding that it is \nnot reasonable to expect 535 Members of Congress to deal with foreign \ncountries, we have asked the President to do that for us but under \nguidelines that we have set down and with Congress having the final \nauthority. We are in the process of exercising that final authority.\n  As is true of almost any agreement, this one might not be perfect. \nHowever, I believe it will provide significant benefits to the United \nStates, our economy, and particularly to the economy and the people of \nmy home State of Iowa.\n  During committee consideration of the agreement, we heard from a \nnumber of different sectors of the economy which stand to benefit from \nthe agreement. At the top of the list is the U.S. manufacturing sector \nand all the jobs that exist in that sector that will be stabilized and \nenhanced as a result of American manufacturing selling a lot more to \nAustralia because certain duties that now are on those products will be \ngone.\n  Under the agreement, more than 99 percent of U.S. manufacturing \nexports to Australia will become duty free immediately after this \nagreement is signed by the President. This is the most significant \nreduction of manufacturing tariffs ever achieved in any U.S. free-trade \nagreement.\n  This is very good news for manufacturers such as the Al-jon company \nof Ottumwa, IA, employing 100 people. Today, about 10 to 15 percent of \nAl-jon's production is exported. They are confident that with a level \nplaying field they can do even better. This bill helps level that \nfield.\n  During testimony before my committee, John Kneen, chairman of the \nboard of Al-jon, testified that while they have had some success \nselling in Australia, their exports are currently limited by two \nfactors: First, Australia currently imposes a 5-percent tariff on their \nexports. And, second, the cost of shipping heavy equipment to Australia \nis very high. While we cannot do much about the cost of shipping, we \nsurely can eliminate the 5-percent barrier with the enactment of this \ntrade agreement.\n  It is not just the company of Al-jon that will benefit. Mr. Kneen \ntestified that over 19,000 U.S. companies that currently export to \nAustralia are likely to benefit from what he termed the ``instant \ncompetitive advantage'' provided by the elimination of these tariff \nbarriers on U.S. manufacturing exports.\n\n  These companies include other Iowa manufacturers such as John Deere, \nwhich has four manufacturing plants in my State. John Deere anticipates \nincreased exports to Australia on account of this free-trade agreement.\n  The U.S. agricultural sector stands to benefit from the agreement as \nwell, as duties on all U.S. farm exports will be eliminated, reducing \ntariffs on U.S. agricultural exports by over $700 million. Processed \nfood, soybeans, oilseed products, fresh and processed fruits and \nvegetables, all will benefit from these duty reductions. For U.S. \nfarmers and our ranchers who compete with Australian agriculture, \nspecial safeguards and tariff rate quotas are included as part of the \nagreement to make sure that trade is not only free but fair.\n  The free-trade agreement negotiating process also opened the door to \neliminate scientifically unfounded barriers to the importation of U.S. \npork and U.S. pork for processing. These are all major Iowa products \nbecause we are No. 1 of the 50 States in the production of pork. While \nAustralia made its scientific determination regarding pork outside of \nthe free-trade agreement negotiations, the intensive consultation \nprocess that naturally flows from engaging in bilateral trade \nnegotiations helped in the resolution of that very important matter. \nDermot Hayes, an economist at Iowa State University, estimates that the \nelimination of these unfounded barriers could increase U.S. exports of \npork to Australia by over $50 million annually.\n  The United States-Australia Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary \nMeasures, and the Standing Technical Working Group on Animal and Plant \nHealth Measures, which are established under the FTA, will help to \nensure that all Australian standards on United States agricultural \nimports are based on sound science and are not used as a basis for \nprotectionism.\n  Iowa's service providers will also benefit from new market-access \nopenings in Australia for our service exports. These commitments, along \nwith new, transparent trading rules, should provide a lot of important \nnew market opportunities for Iowa's service exports.\n  And, for the first time, this agreement opens much of Australia's \nlucrative government procurement market to United States exporters. The \ngovernment procurement provisions are especially important, as \nAustralia is one of only a few developed countries that are not members \nof the World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement.\n  In sum, the United States will benefit from the United States-\nAustralia Free Trade Agreement. I urge my colleagues to vote for S. \n2610, the United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation \nAct.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today the Senate begins \nconsideration of the U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement. I support \nthis agreement for one simple reason: Trade means jobs.\n  The U.S. economy is the most flexible, vibrant, and dynamic in the \nworld. We owe that to the ingenuity of the American people and their \nrelentless thirst to create and to innovate.\n  We also owe it to the policies we have put in place to support the \ninnovation that keeps our economy growing and creating jobs. That \nincludes embracing open trade.\n  Twelve million Americans--1 out of every 10 workers--depend on \nexports for their jobs. And these jobs pay thousands of dollars more \nthan jobs unrelated to trade.\n  Now, some think of trade as helping only big multinational companies. \nIn reality, trade helps companies of all sizes. Firms with fewer than \n20 workers\n\n[[Page S8181]]\n\nmake up two-thirds of American exporters.\n  Trade also creates benefits for communities across the country. In \nMontana, nearly 6,000 jobs depend on manufacturing exports. And more \nthan 730 Montana companies, mostly small and medium-sized businesses, \nexport products overseas.\n  Despite the well-known benefits of trade and the vibrancy of the U.S. \neconomy, the last few years have been difficult ones.\n  Since January 2001, the American private sector has lost nearly 2 \nmillion jobs--mainly in manufacturing. And service-sector jobs--once \nvirtually immune to international competition--have begun to move \noffshore in increasing numbers.\n  When people talk about jobs moving overseas, they frequently talk \nabout trade. Too often, the proposed solution is to retreat into \nisolationism and raise barriers to trade. In my view, that's exactly \nthe wrong approach. We should engage in more trade, not less.\n  But we must be smart about trade. We must enforce our trade laws and \nour trade agreements. We must ensure that markets remain open to U.S. \ncompanies, and that U.S. companies can compete on a level playing \nfield.\n  We should reject the notion that we must lower standards in this \ncountry to compete. Instead, we must look to raise standards in the \ncountries we trade with. The Trade Act of 2002 made tremendous progress \nin this regard, but we must continue to ``race to the top.''\n  The free trade agreement with Australia is the kind of agreement we \nshould be negotiating. It offers both broad commercial benefits and \nhigh standards.\n  Australia is one of the few countries with whom the U.S. enjoys a \ntrade surplus, with the bulk of this surplus in manufactured goods.\n  With this agreement, U.S. manufacturers predict that U.S. exports \nwill grow by an additional 20 percent--$2 billion per year. Montana \nalready exports $3.4 million per year in industrial goods to Australia. \nAnd these exports will grow with this agreement.\n  This is great news to manufacturing workers who have been hard hit by \nmassive job losses. It is especially important in a State like Montana, \nwhere we have lost 3,300 manufacturing jobs in the past 4 years. These \nlosses represented 15 percent of the Montana manufacturing workforce.\n  But it's not just about manufacturing. This agreement will also \nbenefit U.S. service providers. Australia will expand access for cross-\nborder services, and to enhance regulatory transparency. That will mean \ngreater opportunities in financial services as well as those services \nprovided through new and innovative technology.\n  Beyond these benefits, the agreement also increases protections for \nintellectual property. And it requires Australia to offer greater \nopportunities to U.S. bidders in government procurement.\n  All of these improvements will translate into a more fair and open \nmarket for U.S. producers. That will mean more jobs and higher wages \nfor U.S. workers.\n  At the same time, this agreement opens the door to a greater \nrelationship with one of the most vibrant and promising economies in \nthe world. Australia stands as a gateway to the fast growing markets of \nSoutheast Asia. This agreement will help U.S. companies further develop \ntheir export potential.\n  Now, some have expressed concerns regarding agriculture. Australia \nexports many of the same commodities that the U.S. produces--most \nnotably, beef, dairy, and sugar. Yet Australia offers a much smaller \nconsumer market in return.\n  Those of us from States that produce these commodities were \nconcerned. However, given the close relationship between the U.S. and \nAustralia, and given the substantial benefits to the manufacturing and \nservice sectors, it was clear to me that Congress would approve an \nAustralia agreement.\n  The only solution to this challenge for U.S. agriculture was good, \nold-fashioned tough negotiating. I urged Ambassador Zoellick to work \nhard to preserve the interests of rural America, by treating U.S. \ncommodities sensitively.\n  I pushed him to ensure a long transition period, and to provide \nstrong safeguards where necessary. I am pleased to report that U.S. \nnegotiators responded to these concerns and met me more than half way.\n  For beef, there is an 18-year transition period and two automatic \nsafeguards. As we drafted the implementing legislation for this \nagreement, I worked hard to ensure that there were significant \nprotections for Montana's ranchers.\n  For dairy, the agreement ensures a slow pace for increased market \naccess, while maintaining over-quota tariffs--a chief priority for U.S. \nproducers.\n  Finally, U.S. negotiators preserved current sugar policy, in order to \nenhance our prospects to achieve global reform in the WTO.\n  These protections help shape an agreement that is balanced and sound. \nIt enhances opportunities for U.S. companies and workers, while also \nbeing sensitive to the interests of our farmers and ranchers.\n  Let me turn to one final issue that has been receiving attention \nlately. In the last couple of days, some Members have questioned \nwhether this agreement affects U.S. government regulation of \nprescription drugs.\n  These concerns involve the potential impact of trade agreements on \nU.S. healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and the VA and \nDOD programs, and the implications of the agreement on the adoption of \ndrug reimportation legislation in the future.\n  USTR has assured Congress that the provisions in the agreement will \nnot require any changes to the administration of U.S. health programs. \nAnd that no changes to current U.S. law or administrative practice are \nnecessary to implement the agreement.\n  Furthermore, because Australia itself does not permit most \npharmaceuticals to be exported, we are assured that this agreement will \nnot impede Congress from considering and enacting reimportation \nlegislation.\n  My own view is that the concerns raised by these provisions are more \nhypothetical in nature than concrete. Nonetheless, this is an issue \nthat Congress--and the Finance Committee--should explore more \nthoroughly as we move forward on trade negotiations in the future.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this agreement. This is an agreement \nthat will help our long-term competitiveness. This is an agreement that \nwill create jobs. This is an agreement that is good for Montana and \ngood for America. I hope it will receive strong support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we meet here in the Senate again to talk \nabout the issue of international trade, a very important issue for our \nown country.\n  I would like to follow up on my colleague's comments about the \nConstitution. The Constitution does, indeed, talk about trade. It talks \nabout who is responsible for international trade in this country. It is \narticle I, section 8 of the Constitution. It says:\n\n       The Congress shall have power to regulate commerce with \n     foreign nations.\n\n  Yet Congress has largely given away that opportunity and the \nresponsibility with respect to trade.\n  What the Congress has done, strangely enough, is to put itself in a \nstraitjacket by voting and passing legislation called ``fast track''--\nwhich doesn't sound like English, perhaps, to most people--fast-track \ntrade authority.\n  Fast track means that Members of Congress will promise that when a \ntrade agreement is negotiated somewhere else in the world in secret, \nbehind closed doors, by our trade ambassador, when it is finally \nbrought back to the Senate for a vote up or down, the Congress will \nprevent itself from ever being able to offer amendments to change it if \nit thinks something in it is wrong. That is fast track. The Congress \nhas decided to limit its own ability to fix problems. I didn't vote for \nfast track, but the majority of my colleagues did.\n  So we have a situation where we have a rather innocuous trade \nagreement today between the United States and Australia. There is not \nmuch in this agreement that is of great moment. There are a couple of \nbad things in it that should be taken out. We should have a vote on the \nprovision dealing with pharmaceutical drugs. We ought to have an \nopportunity to amend this trade agreement in a way that deals with \ntrading authorities, such as the\n\n[[Page S8182]]\n\nAustralian Wheat Board and the authority in Australia that deals with \nthe sale of cattle. These are state trading enterprises that would be \nillegal in this country. We are actually having to say, let's trade \nwith someone else who has a monopoly in marketing operations in \nagriculture, and we will consider that fair. It is not fair at all. I \nwill talk about that at some length.\n  In any event, the Congress, through its lack of wisdom, I must say, \nhas decided to use what is called fast-track trade authority, which \nmeans this agreement is here now and no one may offer any amendments \nbecause Congress decided to put itself in a straitjacket. So we have a \ncircumstance with no amendments.\n  Let me at least describe where we are with international trade. Most \npeople do not want to talk about it.\n  This is a massive failure. This is a colossal failure of this country \non international trade.\n  This chart shows the countries with which we have trade surpluses. \nThey are not in red, they are in green. All these countries in red are \ncountries with which we have trade deficits--some very large. You look \nat a map of the world and you will see that we have on only a very few \noccasions trade surpluses. One of them happens to be with Australia. \nThat will soon be gone after we pass this trade agreement. That is the \ncase with every trade agreement we have done. But Australia, Egypt, \nBelgium--there are just a few countries with whom we have a surplus. \nWith the rest of the world, of course, we have a large, abiding, \nsubstantial trade deficit.\n  Last month, I put this on a chart and showed it on the floor of the \nSenate. The Washington Post says, ``U.S. Trade Deficit Set Another \nRecord In April.'' That trade deficit was $48 billion in 1 month, \nalmost $50 billion in 1 single month. Month after month after month we \nsee this trade deficit.\n  Let me go through a bit and perhaps show some charts that might give \nus the opportunity to ask the question, Are we really doing well here?\n  This is all about jobs, as you know. It is about where the jobs are \nlocated. It is about outsourcing. It is about moving jobs from here to \nanother country.\n  Let us look at what is happening to our trade balance. This is the \nmerchandise trade deficit. You will see this is dangerous, in my \njudgment, and very alarming. You won't hear anybody come to talk much \nabout it. This is sort of the unseen, the hidden part of our policy \nthat will cause, in my judgment, substantial problems in the future. \nYou can make a case that the budget deficit, the big budget deficit--\nincidentally, it is the biggest in history--will be repaid. It is a \ndeficit the American people will repay to themselves. You can make that \npoint. But you cannot make that point with the trade deficit. This \nlarge trade deficit will inevitably be repaid by a lower standard of \nliving in this country. It is getting worse and worse year after year \nafter year. And every single year, when another trade agreement is \nbrought to the Senate floor, we are told what a wonderful agreement it \nis and how much we are going to sell and what good times we are going \nto have as a result of this agreement. Yet in every single case our \ntrade deficit grows, jobs leave this country, and you will see that we \nare mortgaging this country's future.\n  Let me talk about some specifics, if I might. This is our trading \npartner to the north, Canada, a country with which we have a wonderful \nrelationship. They, of course, have a terrific relationship with us \nwith respect to this trade balance.\n  When we passed something called the North American Free Trade \nAgreement, we had a relatively modest trade deficit with Canada--\nsomewhere in here. But now it has grown to be a very substantial trade \ndeficit with Canada. I will talk a little about why in a few moments.\n  China is the granddaddy of trade deficits. You will see what is \nhappening in China. We are seeing massive and record trade deficits, of \n$130 billion a year. It is getting worse, worse, worse, and it is going \nto hurt this country.\n  What about the European Union? We used to actually have a bit of a \ntrade surplus with the European Union. That has gotten worse and worse. \nIt is now nearly as large as the merchandise trade deficit we have with \nChina.\n  Japan is another interesting one. Japan, while not quite as large as \nEurope and China, demonstrates the fundamental and relentless \nincompetence of policymakers in trade. Over and over again, year after \nyear, every single year, we have this deficit with Japan, somewhere \nbetween $50 billion, $60 billion, $70 billion a year, every single \nyear.\n  Now Mexico. We had this big old NAFTA, North American Free Trade \nAgreement we negotiated with Mexico and Canada. When we negotiated it, \nwe had a trade surplus with Mexico and a modest deficit with Canada. We \nturned that into a big deficit with Mexico and a larger deficit with \nCanada. So much for whether this North American Free Trade Agreement \nworked.\n  We could not offer any amendments to any of these agreements because \nof this foolishness called fast track, which, incidentally, inhibits us \ntoday in the Senate on this trade agreement with Australia.\n  I will go through some of the examples. I could start by talking \nabout Japan. I mentioned the circumstance with Japan. We have a large \ntrade deficit with Japan, and it just keeps on going every single year, \n$45, $60, $70 billion, forever. Europe will not allow that, by the way, \nbut we do. I am talking about Europe and its relationship with Japan. \nWe are a country that, in most cases, converts what should be hard \neconomic policy--that is, trade policy--into softheaded foreign policy \nand we do not want to take action anywhere to stand up for America's \ninterests.\n  I will talk about Japan in the context of my State. We produce a lot \nof beef. We have a lot of ranchers who work hard. They get up in the \nmorning and work on that ranch. They are hoping to make a decent \nliving. They want to sell some beef to Japan. But guess what. Nearly 15 \nyears after a beef agreement with Japan between our country and Japan, \nwhich was trumpeted on the pages of all the newspapers--the United \nStates and Japanese trade negotiators reach agreement on beef--15 years \nlater, there is a 50-percent tariff on every single pound of American \nbeef that goes into Japan. That would be considered a failure under any \ncircumstance here, but in our relationship with Japan, it is just \nfine--a 50-percent tariff on every pound of beef. Should we be able to \nsend more T-bones to Tokyo? I think so, sure. The tariff actually went \ndown to 38 percent, and because we got a little more beef in to Japan, \nit snapped back to 50 percent. It is symbolic of the trade problems we \nhave.\n  Does anyone want to do anything? Do we hear anyone rushing off to try \nto solve that problem? No. No one talks about that problem.\n  Let me use the Chinese tariffs on cars for a moment. Two years ago we \ndid a bilateral agreement with China--actually, almost 3 years ago, \nnow--a bilateral trade agreement with China. Our country decided, \nthrough our negotiators with China--a country with which we have a \nlarge deficit and it is growing dangerously high--we decided in our \nbilateral trade in automobiles we would agree to the following: China, \nyou can put a 25-percent tariff on any cars that we try to sell in \nChina after a long phase-in and we will apply a 2.5-percent tariff to \nany cars that you might want to sell in our marketplace.\n  In other words, our negotiators signed up to a deal that said, we \nknow you have a really big surplus with us, or we have a big deficit \nwith you, but with respect to automobile trade, you go ahead and impose \na tariff that is 10 times higher than the one we will impose on \nautomobiles going back and forth between China and the United States.\n  Of course, right now, China is gearing up an auto industry for \nexports and our negotiators said it is fine for them to have a tariff \nthat is 10 times higher than we would have. That is fundamentally \nincompetent. We do not know who negotiated that, of course. This is not \na matter of Democrats or Republicans. It is just incompetence, gross \nincompetence.\n  I will talk a little about Korea and automobiles, and I have used \nthis example many times. I don't have the latest year's data, but trust \nme, it is about the same. Over 600,000 Korean vehicles are coming into \nthis country. Ships are on the high seas, packed with Korean cars, \ncoming in so the American consumers can purchase them.\n\n[[Page S8183]]\n\nGood for our consumers. But when 618,000 Korean cars come into our \ncountry for our consumers to purchase, guess how many American cars are \nin the Korean marketplace for Koreans to purchase? There are 2,800 U.S. \ncars able to be sold in Korea and over 600,000 Korean cars in the \nUnited States.\n\n  With respect to Korea, I might point out that we actually were making \nsome progress recently. It was with a vehicle called the Dodge Dakota. \nWhen it looked as if that was beginning to pick up, we were actually \ngoing to be able to sell some in Korea, they did not like that and took \naction quickly to begin to shut that down.\n  The question is, Why will this country, when all of this translates \nto jobs here or there, why will this country decide it is all right in \nour relationship with Korea to have them ship 600,000 cars this way and \nthen keep American cars out of Korea? It does not make any sense to me. \nWhat that means is fewer jobs in the United States and more in Korea. \nThat means people are laid off here and people are hired there.\n  I know the agreement we are debating involves Australia, and I will \ntalk about Australia in a couple of minutes, but it is important to put \nthis discussion in a frame of reference. We will hear today by those \nwho support this trade agreement that this is a wonderful agreement, \nthis is nirvana, and if we just step back and we can see into the \nfuture, this will be new jobs, new economic growth, new opportunity. \nNonsense. Total nonsense.\n  In each and every circumstance, our trade negotiations have resulted \nin trade agreements that have undermined our jobs and undermined our \neconomic growth.\n  Want to talk about specifics? I will put the charts back up. Europe, \nJapan, China, Korea, Canada, Mexico--show me one of these circumstances \nwhere the trade agreement has buttressed the producers in this country, \nthe employers in this country, the workers in this country toward new \nopportunities. In the aggregate, with each of those circumstances, we \nhave lost ground rather than gained ground.\n  I know when we talk about this, people, especially the more \ninstitutional thinkers on this subject, say, well, your discussion \ndemonstrates you do not get it, you do not see over the horizon, you do \nnot understand what is happening internationally. This is a global \neconomy. Why not shape up and listen and you will finally begin to \nunderstand this. You are nothing but a xenophobic isolationist stooge. \nJoin the rest of the protectionists and just sit down.\n  I am not a protectionist, unless that means you want to protect the \neconomic interests of this country, and if so I plead guilty and demand \nto be called that. I want to protect the economic interests of this \ncountry. I believe it is in this country's best interest to expand \nopportunities to trade. I believe that strongly.\n  For the first 25 years after the Second World War, our trade policy \nwas almost exclusively foreign policy because we were trying to help \nothers get back on their feet. But in the second 25 years after the \nSecond World War, trade policy continued to be foreign policy when, in \nfact, it should have been harder nosed economic policy.\n  I began to raise questions about trade as a result of a trade \nagreement with Canada some long time ago. I suppose it was around 14 \nyears ago. I was serving in the House of Representatives and I was on \nthe Ways and Means committee. They were going to vote on the United \nStates-Canada Free-Trade Agreement. It, too, was done with fast track, \nwhere no one was able to offer an amendment. A little provision was \nstuck in that agreement that allowed the Canadian Wheat Board, a \nsanctioned monopoly in Canada and which sells Canadian wheat through \nthe monopoly--and that would be illegal in this country--to continue to \nmove massive quantities of Canadian grain, underselling our farmers \nwith unfair prices and secret prices into our country, into our \nmarketplace. I raised those issues but to no avail.\n  So we came to the final vote on the United States-Canada Free-Trade \nAgreement and the vote in the Ways and Means Committee of the House of \nRepresentatives was 34 to 1. I was the one who opposed it.\n  I was told by all my colleagues: We want this to be a unanimous vote. \nIt is very important for our committee. You must join us to get a \nunanimous vote on this trade agreement. I said: But the agreement is \nbad. The agreement is wrong. The agreement is going to hurt farmers and \nranchers in an awful way in this country. So I voted no.\n  About 3 years later, I drove to the Canadian border one day, the \nborder between North Dakota and Canada. I rode with Earl Jensen, who \nwas driving a 12-year-old orange truck. It was a little old 2-ton \norange truck. We rumbled up to border with some durum wheat on the back \nof his truck, all the way to the Canadian border.\n  On this windy day, we saw 18-wheel trucks coming from Canada to the \nUnited States, all loaded with Canadian grain, all of them headed to \nour marketplace, all of them with secret pricing, all marketed by the \nCanadian Wheat Board--a monopoly--which would be illegal in this \ncountry. All the way to the border we saw those trucks, dozens and \ndozens of trucks. The Canadians were saturating our marketplace, \ninjuring our farmers in dramatic ways.\n  Well, we got to the border in this little old orange 12-year-old \ntruck. We had about, I guess, 100 bushels of durum wheat in the back. \nWhen we got to the border station, the Canadian folks said: What do you \nhave in the back of this truck? We said: We have durum wheat from North \nDakota.\n  Remember, all the way to the border, we had 18-wheel trucks full of \ndurum wheat from Canada going into our marketplace at secret prices. We \nfound later, incidentally, they were at prices that were dumped prices \nthat were designed to undermine our farmers. But we were told at the \nborder station entering Canada we could not get just a small amount of \nwheat from the United States into Canada. Why? Because you just cannot. \nIt is the way this works. It is a trade agreement. One side gets to \ndump all their products into our marketplace, and a little orange truck \ngets stopped going into their's.\n  A woman from Bowman, ND, married a Canadian. She told me she came \nhome to Bowman one day, and because she liked to make whole wheat \nbread, her dad from the farm loaded up some grain in a couple grocery \nsacks. She drove back to Canada after Thanksgiving. She got to the \nborder. Again, all these 18-wheel trucks were hauling Canadian durum \nsouth. She got to the border, and they forced her to throw out these \ntwo bags of wheat from a North Dakota farm that she was going to take \nback into Canada to make whole wheat bread. It was because you could \nnot take that into Canada.\n  There is not one person in this Congress, in my judgment, not one in \nthe U.S. House, not one in U.S. Senate, who will stand up and say: Yes, \nthat is fair. That is right. We support it. We stand by it. That is \nwhat we intended. Not one. Yet none will lift a finger to change it. \nAnd that is just one small example that got me involved in this \nquestion of fair trade. Why on Earth will this Congress not stand up \nfor this country's economic interest?\n  When it comes to international trade issues with respect to the \nproduction of manufactured goods--I have mentioned before and let me do \nit again because I am not at all embarrassed by repetition, so let me \ndo it again and again and again--the Huffy bicycles that are made in \nthis country, which I have spoken about repeatedly, are a wonderful \nbicycle, but they are no longer American bicycles. Huffy bicycles, most \npeople know, are bought at K-Mart and Wal-Mart and Sears. They are 20 \npercent of America's marketplace for bicycles. They were made in Ohio \nby workers who made $11 an hour. They were proud of their jobs. In \nfact, the Huffy bicycles had a decal on the front just below the \nhandlebar with the American flag. But those workers in Ohio do not make \n$11 an hour. They were fired. Huffy bicycles are made in China for 33 \ncents an hour by people who work 7 days a week, in some cases 12 to 14 \nhours a day. And the people in Ohio, who were proud to make these \nbicycles, had to go home one day to say to their spouse: Honey, I've \nlost my job. It wasn't because I didn't do a good job. It wasn't \nbecause I didn't like my job. It was because I can't compete with 33-\ncents-an-hour labor.\n\n  I don't know, I guess this truly is a globalized economy. \nGlobalization has galloped along, and we are not going to change it. \nHave the rules for globalization moved along quite so\n\n[[Page S8184]]\n\nquickly? I don't think so. What are the rules for globalization?\n  The next picture is of a little red wagon most of us have ridden in. \nThe little red wagon is called the Radio Flyer. This little red wagon \nwas an American fixture for 100 years. For 100 years, they made the \nlittle red wagon in our country. Not anymore. It is gone. You buy labor \nfor pennies an hour somewhere and have them make the little red wagon, \nand then make sure you have them make it in a way that allows them to \nsell it back into the American marketplace.\n  Yes, you can still buy the little red wagon. You can still buy Huffy \nbicycles in the American marketplace. But they are not made here. They \nshow up as a big red bar on that trade chart I showed you, and that big \nred bar means jobs, and it means jobs that left here and went there. It \nmeans a worker in Ohio who made the Huffy bicycle now does not have a \njob. Because they are bad workers? No. Because they will not work for \n33 cents an hour. They cannot do that.\n  So there are all kinds of elements to this issue of international \ntrade, something that, in my judgment, is going to impose a substantial \nburden on this country with the kind of Federal deficits and kind of \ntrade deficits we are now waging. You cannot experience these deficits \nyear after year after year and not be forced, at some point, to turn to \nthem, face them, and deal with them.\n  We ought not, in my judgment, deal with them by saying that we want \nto retreat from trade. Our country, in my judgment, should lead the \nworld in trade--but lead the world in saying to others: There is an \nadmission price to the American marketplace. There is an admission \nprice here. You cannot, as a country, decide you are going to hire \nkids, pay them pennies, put them in unsafe plants, fire them if they \ntry to form a labor union, and then produce your product and ship it to \nPittsburgh or Fargo or Los Angeles or Denver. You cannot do that \nbecause we won't let you do that.\n  I will give you an example in China. This is a story from the \nWashington Post that I was interested in. It is a tragic story, but it \nis a story that mirrors a story of a couple of young women who came to \na hearing I held a few months ago from Honduras who worked in a \nfactory. You can find them all over the country--the young kids who \nwork in a carpet plant at age 11. They tell us they have their \nfingertips burnt deliberately so that when these young kids are making \nthese carpets with needles and they stick their fingers, it won't hurt \nbecause the burning of the fingertips creates scarring, so it does not \nhurt the kids when they stick themselves. You can find this all over \nthe world.\n  Let me describe this story. This happened to be in China. In this \narticle, it says:\n\n       On the night she died, Li Chunmei must have been exhausted.\n       Co-workers said she had been on her feet for nearly 16 \n     hours, running back and forth inside the Bainan Toy Factory, \n     carrying toy parts from machine to machine.\n       It was the busy season before Christmas. Orders peaked from \n     Japan and the U.S. for stuffed animals.\n       Long hours were mandatory, and at least two months had \n     passed since Li and the other workers had enjoyed even a \n     Sunday off.\n       Lying in her bed that night, staring at the bunk, the 19-\n     year-old claimed she felt worn out.\n       The factory food was so bad, she said she felt as if she \n     had not eaten at all.\n       ``I want to quit,'' one of her roommates . . . remembered \n     her saying. ``I want to go home.''\n       Finally the lights went out. [She] started coughing up \n     blood. They found her in the bathroom a few hours later, \n     curled up on the floor, moaning softly in the dark, bleeding \n     from her nose and mouth. Someone called an ambulance, but she \n     died before it arrived.\n       The cause of Li's death remains unknown. But what happened \n     to her last November . . . in southeastern Guangdong province \n     is described by family, friends and co-workers as an example \n     of what China's more daring newspapers call guolaosi.\n       The phrase means ``over-work death,'' and applies to young \n     workers who suddenly collapse and die after working \n     exceedingly long hour days, day after day.\n\n  Stories of these deaths highlight labor conditions that are the norm \nfor a new generation of workers in China. Tens of millions of migrants \nhave flocked from the nation's impoverished countryside to its \nprospering coast.\n  Perhaps more evidence is in a story about child labor in El \nSalvador--a country that our trade ambassador has just signed a new \ntrade deal with:\n  Jesus Franco has scars crisscrossing his legs from his ankles to his \nthighs, and many more on his small hands. For more than half of his \nyoung life--he is age 14--he has spent long days cutting sugar cane, \nand he has the machete scars to prove it. And so do his four brothers \nage 9 to 19.\n  The point of this is simple: The rules of trade, in my judgment, have \nto be rules that recognize what we have accomplished in this country. \nWe had people die on the streets in this country, demonstrating for the \nright to organize as workers. We had people demonstrate and die in the \nstreets over that principle. It was a hard-fought battle to demand that \nworkplaces be safe for workers in this country but which got there. It \nwas not easy to get kids out of coal mines and kids out of \nmanufacturing plants with child labor laws, but we did it.\n  This country battled long and hard on the question of what is fair \ncompensation, and we have a minimum wage. We fought all of those issues \nand established standards. Do we now believe the conditions of \ninternational trade shall be that anyone who produces anything anywhere \nshould have admission to the American marketplace to sell that product \nin our marketplace? I don't think so. We ought to lead on the basis of \nwhat fair trade relationships really are.\n  There are so many more issues dealing with international trade, many \nof them that affect our farmers, affect ranchers, affect workers. They \naffect businesses, small businesses trying to make a living.\n  The Australia trade agreement is brought to us as an innocent, rather \ninnocuous agreement. It is not the CAFTA agreement, the Central \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement, which is completed but will not be \nbrought to this Congress before the election. That, of course, is for \npolitical reasons. The Australia agreement, despite the fact that I \nwill vote no--and perhaps a few of my colleagues will vote no--will \npass today. It is not as controversial as the Central American Free \nTrade Agreement, which is going to have difficulty in the Senate. But \nCAFTA won't come before the Senate in the coming months, because the \nPresident and the trade ambassador decided they don't want to bring it \nhere before the election. They don't want to have this debate.\n  I want to have this debate. I don't think that is a Republican or \nDemocratic problem. I think both political parties have shortchanged \nthe country over two decades on trade policy. But we ought to have the \ndebate now because it is about jobs, growth, and opportunity in the \nfuture.\n  Let me talk for a moment about Australia. As I indicated earlier, the \nAustralia trade agreement is with a country that is similar to ours in \nmany respects, a much smaller economy but similar. I don't allege this \nis the kind of problem we had when we were trying to connect a trade \nagreement with the country of Mexico, where you were trying to connect \ntwo countries with dissimilar wages and dissimilar standards. That is \nnot the case with Australia. Australia is a wonderful country with \ngreat people. I would love to visit Australia. I have not yet visited \nAustralia and would love to do that at some point.\n  My complaint is that we reach a trade agreement that consigns farmers \nand ranchers to great jeopardy. Let me tell you why. The Australians, \nlike the Canadians, sell their grain, their wheat, through an \nAustralian wheat board. In fact, it is the second largest exporter in \nthe world, with 16 percent of the global share. Every grain of that \nthat is sold internationally is sold through the Australian wheat board \nwhich is a sanctioned state monopoly, a state trading enterprise that \nwould be illegal in our country.\n  We have been told time and again by the trade ambassador that we are \ngoing to deal with that. In future trade agreements we will not allow \nstate trading enterprises to exist in circumstances where they can \nundercut our prices and dump their products into our country.\n  I described the circumstance in Canada with the massive quantity of \ngrain coming down to our country and my not being able to get into \nCanada with a little orange truck with a few bushels. We have for years \nattempted to get\n\n[[Page S8185]]\n\ninformation from the Canadian wheat board about the conditions under \nwhich they are selling into our marketplace at secret prices, and they \nhave said: Go take a hike. We don't intend to tell you a thing. The \nprices are secret. We don't intend to disclose them. Get out of here. \nThey told that to the GAO, which went up there at my request: We don't \nintend to tell you a thing.\n  What evidence we do have suggests that they, as most monopolists will \ndo, abused their pricing power and decided at secret prices to undercut \nour marketplace, and they have dramatically injured our farmers. That \nis not only me speaking. That is from studies that have been done by \nthe Center for Agriculture and Trade Research. They have calculated the \ndramatic amount of money lost by family farmers as a result of unfair \ntrade.\n\n  Now we have an Australia trade agreement. The Australian wheat board \ncontinues to exist in this trade agreement. There is nothing in this \nagreement that says, as we hitch together and connect our two countries \nin a trade relationship, you must divest yourself or create a \ncircumstance where you are not using a state trading authority \nunfairly. Nothing here prevents them from doing exactly what the \nCanadians do.\n  The Australians are also positioned to do great harm to our country \non beef trade. There are almost no export benefits for our cattle and \nbeef producers with this free-trade agreement. Given Australia's \nrelatively small population, its very large cattle herd, and its \nposition as the world's largest beef exporter, the potential of \nAustralia becoming any kind of an importer of our beef is almost nil. \nInstead, the only significant benefit I can see and many can see as a \nresult of this with respect to cross-beef trade will be the U.S. beef \npacking industry which will profit from increased imports brought in \nunder this agreement.\n  The beef industry is highly concentrated in a way that is pretty \ndangerous. I mean dangerous to consumers because the more concentration \nyou have, the more pricing power they have and the more they price \nprofits away from ranchers and towards themselves. They price it in a \nway that is disadvantageous to consumers.\n  There are serious problems that could exist with respect to \nagriculture, and there is nothing anybody can do about that. I would \nlove to offer an amendment that deals with these two issues, but you \ncan't because of fast track.\n  Finally, there is a provision in this agreement that is particularly \npernicious. This is a trade agreement with Australia that includes a \nprovision on prescription drugs. This is from the New York Times:\n\n       Congress is poised to approve an international trade \n     agreement that could have the effect of thwarting a goal \n     pursued by many lawmakers of both parties: The import of \n     expensive prescription drugs to help millions of Americans \n     without health insurance.\n       The agreement, negotiated with Australia by the Bush \n     administration, would allow pharmaceutical companies to \n     prevent imports of drugs to the United States.\n\n  This is a trade agreement, and they stick in a provision about \nprescription drugs. They did the same in Singapore. My guess is, they \nwill do it every chance they get. What is this? It is anticonsumer, \npro-pharmaceutical industry. It is an attempt to thwart those in this \ncountry who want to find a way to put downward pressure on prescription \ndrug prices. How might one do that? By allowing the market system to \nact.\n  We pay the highest prices for prescription drugs in the world, and \nyet we are not able to purchase the identical prescription drug, the \nsame pill put in the same bottle, made by the same manufacturer, from a \npharmacist who is 5 miles north of the United States-Canada border.\n  A man talked to me the other day in North Dakota. He said his wife \nhad breast cancer and she has taken the drug Tamoxifen for her breast \ncancer for 5 years and has just finished. She is now off the drug. For \n5 years they traveled to Canada to buy their 90-day supply of Tamoxifen \nand bring it back across the border because they will allow 90 days of \nimportation for personal use of prescription drugs. A pharmacist can't \ndo it, but an individual can if they live near the border. So for 5 \nyears they traveled to Canada. Why? Because you can buy Tamoxifen in \nCanada for 10 percent or 20 percent of the price you will pay in the \nUnited States.\n  Why can't a pharmacist or a distributor go to Canada and buy that \nprescription drug? It is FDA approved, a drug that is put in the same \nbottle, made by the same company.\n  Another example is Lipitor. Lipitor is made in Ireland. It is one of \nthe best-selling drugs in our country for the lowering of cholesterol. \nIt is sent from Ireland to two places. It is made in Ireland in an FDA-\napproved plant. It is sent to Winnipeg and then Grand Forks, ND, and \nall over the world, of course. But the difference between the same \nbottles that are sent to Grand Forks, ND and Winnipeg is in Winnipeg \nyou will pay $1.01 per tablet, and in Grand Forks you pay $1.81 per \ntablet. What is the difference? About 100 miles and a border and a \nprovision that protects the pharmaceutical industry from reimportation. \nThat is helped, with respect to Australia and other countries this \nadministration intends to negotiate trade agreements with, by their \nsticking in this trade agreement a provision dealing with the \nreimportation of prescription drugs. It is anticonsumer, and it shows \nhow little regard those who negotiated this have for the marketplace. \nLet's let the marketplace be the arbiter of consumer prices on \nprescription drugs. Let consumers have opportunities to access \nprescription drugs in other areas where there is a safe supply.\n\n  The Australia Free Trade Agreement is going to be passed by the \nCongress today--not with my vote, I might add, because I think it \nundercuts and potentially injures family farmers and ranchers and our \nsenior citizens who need affordable prescription drugs.\n  I hope that even as we do this, as the Congress addresses this issue, \nthose who care about the long-term economy, long-term economic health \nof this country, opportunities and growth of this country--I hope they \nwill take a hard look at these trade relationships and about our \naggregate trade deficits that are growing alarmingly. I am not asking \nthat we today do anything that is particularly radical. I am saying we \nneed to address these things. Can we, will we, should we address the \ntrade deficit with Europe that is growing rapidly? Should we, can we \naddress the trade deficit with China that is moving rapidly up, the \nhighest in the world? Mexico? Canada? Korea? Can we address any of \nthose? All of them relate to American jobs.\n  It is safe to say there is not one Member of the Senate who comes to \nwork with a blue suit every day and takes a shower in the morning, not \nat night, because that's the nature of our job--it is safe to say there \nis not one Member of the Senate that ever lost his or her job because \nof a bad trade agreement. It is probably safe to say there is not one \njournalist in this country who consistently writes about trade issues \nand seldom talks about these trade balances. It is safe to say they \nhave never lost their job because of a bad trade agreement. But we can \ntalk about a lot of people who have. We have a chart that shows the \nnumber of people who have lost their jobs with respect to NAFTA. This \nis not my speculation; these are companies that actually applied to the \nDepartment of Labor as a result of laying off workers due to the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement. There was a provision in NAFTA that if \nyou lay off workers as a result of NAFTA, you can apply for trade \nadjustment assistance. Here are the top 100 companies certifying they \nlaid off United States workers due to our trade agreement with Mexico \nand Canada--mostly Mexico in this case.\n  Levi Strauss is No. 2. They laid off 15,676 people. Levis are all-\nAmerican. That is like bicycles and little red wagons, right? When you \nbuy Levis these days, you are not buying American.\n  Fruit of the Loom shorts and T-shirts used to be made in America. I \nalways said it is one thing to lose your shirt but now Fruit of the \nLoom is gone.\n  From these 100 companies alone, a couple hundred thousand people lost \ntheir jobs. They all had hopes, dreams, and aspirations. They love this \ncountry and try to do their best. They were told by any one of these \ncompanies, sorry, you are out of work, we are moving to Mexico.\n  Next time you buy a Fig Newton cookie, guess what. You are eating\n\n[[Page S8186]]\n\nMexican food. Fig Newtons were made in America for a long, long, long \ntime. But Fig Newtons, like Levis, like Fruit of the Loom, are now \nMexican. When somebody says let's have Mexican food, go buy some Fig \nNewtons.\n  The point is this: We had people working in all these areas producing \nthese products. I will go back to the chart that I used when I began \nabout what has happened in the aggregate to our trade deficit year \nafter year after year. It shows this very substantial failure. All of \nthese big deficits represent jobs that moved, jobs that should have \nbeen here but are not, jobs that could have been created here but \nweren't, or jobs that were here and left.\n  Let me again say I don't believe the solution to this is putting up \nwalls, deciding that we are isolationist, that this is not an \ninternational economy. I believe the answer to this is to finally use \nthe term fairness in the context in which it ought to really mean fair \ntrade for all countries. Trade agreements should be mutually \nbeneficial. But these trade agreements, the ones I have described, \nconsistently and relentlessly have been unfair to this country. We were \nbig and strong enough in the 25 years after the Second World War to \nwithstand that. We were the biggest, strongest, and best in the world, \nand we could take any country on in economic competition and beat them \nwith one hand tied behind our back. After World War II, we were that \ngood. As other countries grew and became stronger and better, they \nbecame tough international, economic competitors. Our trade policy \nnever changed. It largely remained foreign policy.\n\n  Last year, the administration's Trade Policy Review Group recommended \ntake action against China, for failing to live up to its obligations on \nChina trade. But the administration didn't. Why? Because the \nadministration concluded that this would upset the Chinese. That is \nforeign policy; it has nothing to do with hardnosed economic policy.\n  This country lives in a world in which we have incredibly tough \ncompetitors. It requires us, it seems to me--if we are going to \nmaintain this standard of living, it requires us to care a little about \nthe preservation of that standard of living, and that in turn depends \non both the entrepreneurs and those who work, the producers and the \nworkers.\n  We have not done nearly what we should do in this country to stand up \nfor our economic interests on international trade. I believe trade can \nbe good, but much of the trade we have been engaged in in recent years \nhas resulted in the largest trade deficit in history and will \ninevitably detract from this country's opportunity to grow, prosper, \nand create new jobs in the future, unless and until this Congress and \nthis administration stand up and understand we need to take action on \nbehalf of our country to protect our economic interests. All I ask for \nis fair trade.\n  I will vote against the Australia Free Trade Agreement because it \ncontains three bad trade provisions, because we cannot get these \nremoved due to fast track, which itself is an unfairness perpetrated in \nthe Congress.\n  My expectation is that, even without my vote, this free-trade \nagreement will pass. But I will be back to talk about trade issues in \nthe future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, with a sense of regret, I come to the \nSenate floor to speak in opposition to the legislation before us to \nimplement the free-trade agreement negotiated by the administration \nwith our good friend and ally, Australia.\n  One thing I have made clear throughout my career in Government is the \nfact that I believe in free trade. As Governor of Ohio, I supported \nNAFTA and the establishment of the WTO. As a Senator, I supported \npermanent normal trade relations for China, the Andean Trade Preference \nExpansion Act, and the so-called ``fast track'' trade negotiating \nauthority. I also supported our FTAs with Jordan, Chile, and Singapore.\n  Until very recently, our economy has been bleeding jobs--23,000 \nmanufacturing jobs lost in my State of Ohio between May of 2003 and May \nof 2004, which is over half of the total 41,000 jobs lost in all \nsectors.\n  While I still firmly believe in free trade, I cannot stand idly by \nwhile our trade laws are ignored by other countries and go unenforced \nby our own. I will no longer allow the illegal trade practices of other \ncountries that put good, hard-working Americans in the unemployment \nlines to be disregarded, because that is exactly what is happening.\n  When it comes to trade, China is the elephant in the room that \neveryone is afraid to acknowledge because they fear it will rear its \nugly head. It seems as if we want to waltz with the Chinese and, for \nsome reason, we are afraid to step on their toes for fear they might \nget mad.\n  As I and many of my colleagues see it, the two most prevalent trade \nissues we face are the manipulation of China's currency and their \nresistance to reform and enforcement of their intellectual property \nrights laws as required by their WTO accession agreement.\n  My good friend and colleague from South Carolina, Senator Lindsay \nGraham, and I held a press conference last month to highlight a finding \nin a report by the United States-China Economic and Security Review \nCommission, a Commission we in Congress created to suggest changes to \ncurrent U.S. policies with regard to China.\n  The report issued by the Commission was quite alarming, and I suggest \nthat every Member of both this and the other body read the trade \nsections of that report.\n  The Commission reinforces what I have been hearing from Ohio \nbusinesses and what I have been saying for years: China is not trading \nfairly and is hurting Ohio workers and American workers. As we know, \nsince the early 1990s--this is the early 1990s--China has pegged its \ncurrency at 8.28 yuan per dollar, which is believed to be anywhere \nbetween 15 and 40 percent lower than it should.\n  This action has the effect of making U.S. products more expensive \nthan items produced domestically. It also makes the retail prices paid \nhere in the United States for Chinese goods artificially low, \ngenerating less demand for our domestic products. If demand is lowered \nboth here and overseas of U.S.-manufactured goods, companies will lose \nmoney and lay off workers. They already have.\n  The Commission's report states that if China were to end its currency \nmanipulation, it is believed other East Asian countries, such as Japan, \nTaiwan, and South Korea that have also manipulated their currencies in \norder to remain competitive with China, would also follow suit and end \ntheir manipulation.\n  The Commission has arrived at a unique solution to China's currency \nmanipulation. They do not believe China's currency should be floated, \nas are most developed countries' currencies, because China's banking \nsystem and financial markets are simply not prepared. Instead, they \nrecommend that it be pegged to a ``market basket'' of several trade-\nweighted currencies to avoid fluctuation of any one country. That is \nexactly the kind of ``outside the box'' thinking Congress had in mind \nwhen we created the Commission as part of the fiscal year 2001 Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  The Commission recommends that the administration take strong action \nto thwart China's exchange rate practices, something I have repeatedly \nurged the administration to do myself.\n  Last fall, I introduced the Currency Harmonization Initiative through \nNeutralizing Action, CHINA, of 2003. This legislation requires the \nSecretary of the Treasury to analyze and report to Congress within 60 \ndays whether China is manipulating its currency to achieve an advantage \nin trade. The CHINA Act also expresses the sense of Congress that the \nadministration should pursue all means available to remedy China's \ncurrency manipulation.\n\n  The other pressing trade issue is China's lack of enforcement of \nintellectual property rights laws. This issue at least is getting some \ntraction in the Senate. Unfortunately, not enough of my colleagues are \naware of how bad this situation is or of how long the situation has \npersisted.\n  In April 1991, China was named a priority foreign country by the USTR \nunder section 301. After further investigation, the U.S. threatened to \nimpose $1.5 billion in trade sanctions if an IPR agreement was not \nreached by January\n\n[[Page S8187]]\n\n1992. While that deadline was met, by 1994, the USTR again listed China \nas a priority foreign country because they failed to properly enforce \ntheir laws. New talks failed for almost a year before a new agreement \nregarding Chinese IPR laws was reached.\n  As part of their new commitment, China agreed to take immediate steps \nwithin 3 months, establish mechanisms for long-term, effective \nenforcement, and provide greater market access for U.S. products. In \n1996, USTR again listed China as a priority foreign country for not \nfully complying with the latest agreement. Talks stalled until China \nwas threatened with $2 billion in sanctions when they reportedly \nsatisfied U.S. demands.\n  However, the problem remains as estimates show the piracy rate for \nIPR-related products in China to be around 90 percent. Chinese law \nenforcement officials often lack the resources or the will needed to \nvigorously enforce IPR laws. Under the terms of the Chinese accession \nto the WTO, they were to immediately bring their IPR laws into \ncompliance with the WTO Agreement on Trade Related Aspect of \nIntellectual Property Rights.\n  This also has not happened as promised. U.S. firms are still losing \nbillions of dollars per year in China alone, and all we have to show \nfor it is a string of broken promises that started in 1991.\n  I remember being in China in 1995 with a trade mission and speaking \nto the Chinese Government about the importance of enforcing their \nintellectual property rights. They said: Yes, we are going to do it. \nHere we are, 2004, and they have not continued to do the job they are \nsupposed to be doing.\n  Regardless of China's staggering piracy and counterfeiting \noperations, they are far from being the only problem area in the world. \nThe U.S. Trade Representative lists 18 countries as ones with which we \nhave ``significant concerns'' with respect to their IPR laws and \nenforcement. In my opinion, this is far too many countries flouting \ntheir international obligations.\n  In the Governmental Affairs Subcommittee which I chair, I held a \nhearing on April 20, 2004, that focused on intellectual property \nviolations in the manufacturing sector of the economy, and another on \nDecember 9, 2003, which examined the ability of the Department of \nCommerce and the U.S. Trade Representative to negotiate, monitor, and \nenforce our complex trade laws in a rapidly shifting global trade \nenvironment.\n  Also, just last month, I participated in a hearing held by Chairman \nLugar in the Foreign Relations Committee which focused on China's \ninability to enforce intellectual property rights when it comes to \nmusic, films, and software. To quote the testimony of Jack Valenti, the \nhead of the Motion Picture Association of America:\n\n       Piracy problems are only becoming more severe. In 2002, the \n     piracy rate in China for American films, home videos, and \n     television programs was about 91 percent. In 2003, the \n     pirates captured at least 95 percent of that market. The \n     current level of piracy is worse than it has been at any time \n     since 1995 when it was 100 percent.\n\n  But these industries are only the beginning of those suffering from \nChina's disregard for international standards.\n  Perhaps the greatest problem to overcome is to change the perception \nin many countries that intellectual property rights do not exist. For \nU.S. manufacturers, artists, filmmakers, and others, the protection of \nintellectual property is not an abstract concept because at stake are \ntheir livelihoods and those of the people who work with them and for \nthem.\n  We must make it clear we will not tolerate these trade violations. If \nthe United States were to, in some way, violate a trade pact, the whole \nworld would be beating down our door demanding we change our ways and \npay for damages. But when we ask that countries follow the trade pacts \nto which they already agreed, we are denounced as bullies. Well, I say, \nlet's be bullies.\n  My concern is that we may not be able to be bullies because, as I \nlearned in my hearings, we do not have the mechanism in place to \nenforce our trade laws. In other words, we do not know who we should \nbully around because we do not know who is breaking what agreement. \nMoreover, testimony indicated that our Government is not doing anything \nto help the companies that are having their intellectual property \nstolen.\n  The state of enforcement is nothing short of abysmal. Amazingly, USTR \nonly employs a grand total of 225 people. It has become painfully \nobvious that this is an insufficient number of employees to negotiate, \nmonitor, and enforce our trade deals.\n  Given the impact of changing global economic forces, it is important \nfor our trade agencies to have the right people with the right skills \nand knowledge to effectively monitor and enforce our complex trade \nagreements.\n  It was clear from the testimony delivered at the hearing that our \nDepartment of Commerce, the Customs and Border Protection Agency at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, the USTR, and the rest of the 17 or \nmore Federal agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcement of our \ntrade agreements cannot do so effectively.\n  This could accurately be described as a case of the left hand not \nknowing what the right hand is doing. In my days of service in \ngovernment as a Senator, Governor, and mayor, I have never seen such a \nhodgepodge of agencies and departments struggle with a relatively \nsimple mission to enforce our trade laws.\n  Following my April hearing, I visited the Web site given as an \nexample of what the Federal Government was going to do to help \nmanufacturers that had become victims of counterfeiting. On that Web \nsite was a telephone number, which I called. However, the person on the \nother end of the line had no idea that anyone but those with problems \nrelating to immigration would ever be calling that number.\n  So I called later and I told them who I was, George Voinovich, U.S. \nSenator, and that I wanted to know what resources were available to \nvictims of counterfeiting, and eventually I was connected to the \ncorrect person. Small business owners should not have to deal with such \nnonsense when asking their Government for assistance.\n  I am pleased to say that those answering the line are now aware of \nthis other function. But the way it works is, if I am an Ohioan who has \nan IPR problem, I call this number and then they give me the number of \nmy local Customs office and ask me to call them to begin my complaint. \nThat is ridiculous. It is absolutely no help whatsoever to smaller \nmanufacturers in this country.\n  I have been pressuring this administration at the highest levels to \naddress the many issues we have with China. In March of this year, \nalong with Senators Lindsey Graham, Schumer, and Durbin, I sent a \nletter to President Bush requesting an emergency meeting with the \nPresident, Treasury Secretary Snow, and Ambassador Zoellick to discuss \nconcrete action regarding continuing illegal undervaluation of China's \ncurrency. That was 5 months after I wrote to Ambassador Zoellick, \nSecretary Snow, and Commerce Secretary Evans urging them to initiate a \n301 investigation into China's practice of currency manipulation.\n  The response we received from the administration? None. Nothing was \nknown about the stance of this administration until April 28 of this \nyear when Secretaries Snow, Chao, Evans, and Ambassador Zoellick held a \npress conference to announce they would reject a yet-to-be-filed 301 \npetition requesting an investigation into China's currency \nmanipulation. Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed that the \nadministration would announce such a position before even receiving the \npetition documents.\n  China continues to tolerate rampant piracy of copyrighted U.S. \nmaterial, with rates of piracy running above 90 percent across all \ncopyright industries for 2003.\n  This year, piracy is estimated to cost U.S. industries $2.6 billion. \nTechnology has made it much easier to copy or steal the engineering, \npackaging, and so forth of a product than in the past.\n\n  I was talking with a shareholder in a golf club manufacturing outfit \n6 months ago. He said that within 3 days after they put a golf club out \non the market they were already counterfeiting it in China and sending \nit to the United States.\n  Another example, in my own State, Gorman-Rupp Company of Mansfield, \nwhich testified at my April hearing,\n\n[[Page S8188]]\n\nsince 1933 has designed and manufactured pumps used for many \napplications, including water, wastewater, petroleum, government uses, \nand agriculture. A Chinese company has not only copied and exploited \nGorman-Rupp product manuals and performance specifications, but the \nGorman-Rupp logo is still displayed on the products in the Chinese \ncompany's literature. In other words, this is a case where they copied \nthe machine, the pump, to a ``T,'' then they used the same promotional \nmaterial that Gorman-Rupp uses for their material. They copied it line \nand verse and are using it to promote their pirated product.\n  Unfortunately, patents do not protect American manufacturers.\n  America's competitive edge is derived from innovation and the \nresulting steady influx of new products and services. Intellectual \nproperty rights protect and promote this innovative spirit. In too many \ncases with too many foreign countries, our intellectual property is the \nlast edge we have because of a fundamentally unbalanced playing field.\n  Many of our competitors do not have to consider environmental \nstandards, labor laws, employee safety, litigation costs--and this \nCongress has to do something about litigation costs in this country. It \nis a tornado cutting through the economy and we just sit here and do \nnothing--health care costs. Losing our intellectual property is the \nlast edge we have.\n  The United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission \nbelieves the administration should file a WTO dispute on the matter of \nChina's failure to protect IPR and to promulgate and enforce WTO-\nrequired laws. To quote the report:\n\n       Follow through and action have been limited. . . . The \n     Commission believes that immediate U.S. action is warranted.\n\n  I hope my colleagues read the report. The Commission believes that \nimmediate U.S. action is warranted on this issue. There is a sense of \nurgency. We are just going to Tweedledee Tweedledum? We have done \nnothing since 1991 on IPR and it is now 2004 and we are still doing \nnothing?\n  As I said, I believe in a fair playing field in which competitive and \ncomparative advantage wins the day. We cannot continue to let countries \nwalk all over us. The one country that everyone seems to be afraid to \ncall on the carpet for flagrant violations of their international \nagreements is China. I do agree with some of my colleagues that maybe \nthe reason we are not doing it is because of foreign policy decisions, \nbut we have to put a stop to China's illegal and unethical trade \npractices.\n  There are people who come into my office and literally shed tears, \npeople who have been in business for years, and they are going out of \nbusiness because of competition from China because of the fact they \nhave taken their patents. So we need to do something. We have to do \nsomething now.\n  Despite these overwhelming problems facing our \nNation's manufacturers, I must say I have yet to see any significant \naction on behalf of the administration to respond. Now I have talked to \nsome people and they say, oh, yes, George, we are working on this; we \nare talking to people; we are negotiating and we are doing this.\n\n  Well, it is time to bring it to the surface. Let the American people \nknow what they are doing instead of hiding out. Make it an issue. Let \nthe Chinese know we are serious about this thing. Let them know the \nU.S. Congress is serious about it. Let them know the administration is \nserious about it. So we can get some action.\n  Last month I made it known that I would not support any new trade \nagreements until there was a movement on these two fronts, and that \nmakes me feel very bad. I am a free trader. I believe in free trade. \nBut we do not have fair trade. Maybe the only way this Senator from \nOhio, who has a lot of people who are on the edge of losing their \nbusinesses, can maybe get someone's attention in the administration to \nget out and start talking about this the way they should be so the \nAmerican people, and particularly the voters in Ohio and the \nmanufacturers and the people losing their jobs, is to say to them I \nwill not support any other trade agreement on the Senate floor until \nthey do something about the currency manipulation in China and the \nenforcement of intellectual property rights.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I see the Senator from South Carolina. \nI know he wants to speak so I will be succinct in my remarks.\n  I have listened to the Senator from Ohio, whom I greatly respect. I \nbelieve there are good free-trade agreements and there are bad free-\ntrade agreements. I believe the proposed United States-Australia Free \nTrade Agreement is a good free-trade agreement. I intend to vote for \nit. I believe it will strengthen our economy. I believe it will create \nmore jobs in the United States and it will also strengthen the historic \nclose ties between our two countries.\n  I have a special fondness for Australia. In 1987, when I finished two \nterms in the Governor's Mansion, our family moved to Australia and we \nlived there for 6 months, my wife and I and three teenagers and a 7-\nyear-old. I remember my 7-year-old son wanting to know if there would \nbe McDonalds there. I remember fly fishing in Tasmania with my older \nson Drew, and thinking I was about as far from Nashville as I could get \non Earth. I think maybe I was.\n\n  We didn't know much about Australia when we went, but we learned \nabout Australia there, and we found it a great place to learn more \nabout our own country. In spite of the distance between our countries, \nour countries could not be closer. Australians and Americans are \nliterally cousins, almost first cousins. We are both pioneers. We both \nstarted out as underprivileged people. In some cases, our ancestors \nstarted out as prisoners, stuck in a new place, far from home, trying \nto find a new life.\n  They lived hard lives, those earlier ancestors, but each generation \nworked hard to make life better for the ones who came next. We \nsuccessfully settled continents and, from a patchwork of natives and \nimmigrants, created a unique identity, of which we are each proud.\n  It is our similarities that have led us to the close relationship we \nenjoy today. Australia has been one of our staunchest allies in our \ntoughest times. We stood together in World War II, in Korea, in \nVietnam, in the first gulf war, and in Iraq today. Australia \ncontributed more than 2,000 troops to the effort in Iraq and has been a \nstrong supporter in the war on terror. Their F-18 fighter aircraft have \njoined ours in air strikes on enemy military targets. Few countries in \nthis world have been stronger allies of ours than the Australians.\n  Even before this agreement, Australia has been one of our major \ntrading partners--$28 billion in two-way trade annually passes back and \nforth between the United States and Australia. In fact, the United \nStates enjoys a rare trade surplus with Australia, $9 billion last \nyear.\n  This agreement means our relationship can only grow stronger. It is \ngood for us. It is good for them. The U.S. Trade Representative \nestimates the agreement will generate at least $2 billion per year in \ndollars for both countries by the year 2010. More than 99 percent of \nUnited States exports of manufactured goods to Australia will become \nduty free immediately upon ratification of this agreement--the most \nsignificant, immediate reduction of industrial tariffs ever achieved in \na United States free-trade agreement. Australia in turn will see the \nelimination of tariffs on more than 97 percent of its exports. U.S. \ninvestment in Australia will increase, and closer ties with the United \nStates economy will generate investment in Australia from all over the \nworld.\n  I believe the United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement is good \nfor our economy and it is good for our alliance. It benefits the \nfarmers and manufacturers and investors and citizens of Australia as \nwell. It further opens the door to trade in Southeast Asia, one of the \nfastest growing regions in the world.\n  I am pleased to add my voice in support of this momentous agreement \nand to celebrate the further strengthening of the tie between the \nUnited States and our first cousins in Australia.\n  The Senate will be talking about the tobacco buyout later today. I \nwill be voting for the proposed amendment when it comes up.\n\n[[Page S8189]]\n\n  Tobacco farmers in Tennessee have increasingly struggled to succeed \nunder the antiquated federal supply and price controlled tobacco \nprograms. I grew up in East Tennessee, and small family tobacco farms \nwere a part of the lifestyle and economic vitality of that area where \nmy family has lived for seven generations. Because of the Depression-\nera federal tobacco programs, the number of tobacco farmers in \nTennessee has decreased from more than 35,000 farms in 1980 to roughly \n20,000 today. Revenue has gone down by $25 million. We have 80,000 \nTennesseans who depend on quota lease payments for some part of their \nincome.\n  This legislation, that I intend to vote for, will provide a short \nterm bridge to tobacco growers and quota holders and the communities in \nwhich they live. Tennesseans who own quotas will receive a fair \ntransition away from lease income they have received. Growers will \nreceive transition payments as well. The buyout would last over ten \nyears and mean roughly $1 billion to the family farmers, quota lease \nowners, and communities in Tennessee.\n  I believe if we pass this legislation that it can be combined with \nwhat has passed the House of Representatives to be a program that is \nfair to the tobacco growers, good for the economy and doesn't cost the \nAmerican taxpayer one red cent. It's hard to come up with a combination \nthat good very often.\n  I have not been a fan historically of FDA regulation of tobacco, a \nlegal product, and while I am not 100 percent satisfied with the FDA \nproposal, I am willing to accept this compromise in order to move the \ntobacco buyout forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 20 \nminutes of the time under the control of the Democratic manager.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, right to the point with respect to the \nAustralia trade agreement, I join my friend from Tennessee in endorsing \nthis particular trade agreement. Trade is what we say it is, a trade \nfor the benefit of the particular countries involved. It is not aid. \nPeople wonder why we are in such difficulty. The difficulty lies in the \nproposition that the old David Ricardo doctrine of comparative \nadvantage has been superseded now, not by any doctrine of natural \nadvantages, such as Ricardo had in the early 19th century when he \nenunciated that particular doctrine, but it is contrived and we are the \ncontrivers. We are looking at them, my colleagues in the Senate and the \nHouse, the Government itself.\n  If anybody wants to improve our position on trade, we can go right to \nthe particular beef with respect to the distinguished Senator from \nOhio. He said he called the Secretary of Treasury and asked that there \nbe a petition for an investigation of China's trade practices, a 301 \nproceeding. He didn't get any results.\n  I see the distinguished ranking member, former chairman of our Budget \nCommittee, on the floor. If you looked at 11 o'clock this morning, the \npublic debt to the penny is $484 billion. Last year we ran a deficit of \n$562 billion. Don't give me this off-budget and on-budget, public \nbudget, Government budget, private budget, or whatever else. No, that \nis how much more we spent than what we took in. It is already $484 \nbillion and I will take all bets it will exceed $600 billion.\n  In fact, although they talk about the war and everything else of that \nkind, during the 5 years of World War II from 1941 to 1945, during that \n5 years we added to the debt $200 billion, in the war to end all wars. \nWe add that every 4 months under this administration, some $200 \nbillion.\n  I mean, we are up, up, and away. So when you call over to the \nSecretary of Treasury and the Secretary of Treasury calls over to the \nMinister of Finance in Beijing, China, and he says: You know, you have \ngood Senators. They are on my back. They are complaining. We have to \nget something done.\n  He says: Well, I am sorry, but we will have to quit, we will have to \nstop buying your bonds, quit financing your debt.\n  Japan has $400 billion of this Treasury. The Chinese have over $150 \nbillion. So when we do not pay the bill and everybody says tax cuts, \ngot to have tax cuts to get reelected--you now meet yourself coming \naround the corner. That is why you can't get the Secretary of Treasury \nto do anything on trade.\n  But let me go to Australia. The general measure of a good trade \nagreement is that it is with those countries that have relatively the \nsame standard of living. The reason I point this out is because they \nwould be amazed for me to come up in favor of a trade agreement. They \nhave me down as a textile protectionist, and I have passed four textile \nbills that have gone through the House and Senate and been vetoed by \nPresidents Carter, Reagan, and George Herbert Walker Bush.\n  But be that as it may, yes, I voted for the Canadian Free Trade \nAgreement but against the Mexico Free Trade Agreement on NAFTA. Why? I \ncan see my friend Senator Moynihan from New York saying: Wait a minute, \ndown in Mexico they have to have a free market before they can have \nfree trade.\n  There was the common market approach in Europe. Before they allowed \nGreece and Portugal into the common market, they taxed them as members \nof the European Union over a period of years for $5 billion, so that it \ncould develop the entities of a free market, labor rights, respected \njudiciary, property rights, and the other things that go along with \ncapitalism. Obviously, Australia, we always whine. I can hear my labor \nfriends: We have to have labor rights, we have to have environmental \nprotection. They have better labor rights in Australia and better \nenvironmental protection in Australia. But they have relatively the \nsame standard of living.\n  Right to the point: We have a plus balance on trade. You don't get \nevery one of the protections. There are some protections in there for \nbeef, and there is a gradual opening. They phase out the tariff rate \nquota on dairy products over an 18-year period. And they import sugar. \nIt is not liberalized in any way. That has been protected for the \nUnited States. Australia has maintained its monopolies on wheat, \nbarley, and rice. They receive the right to maintain or restrict the \nforeign content of television programs.\n  In other words, they protect local production and the \npharmaceuticals. We thought a bill was coming up shortly with respect \nto pharmaceuticals in Australia. They subsidize the drugs for the \npopulation there. Therefore, they wanted to restrict drugs coming from \nAustralia into the United States because they didn't want to start \nsubsidizing American consumers.\n  There are a few exceptions. But it is a solid agreement.\n  We don't have a better friend--whether we were going into Korea, \nwhether we were going into Vietnam, whether we were going into Iraq. I \nam telling you right here and now that the best friend we have ever had \nis Australia.\n  We have relatively the same standard of living with different \nrestrictions here, there, and yonder. If we can't get an agreement with \nthem, who?\n  Let me talk about another particular point. There is none better in \nthe Senate than my distinguished colleague from North Dakota, Senator \nByron Dorgan. He was talking about fairness.\n  After World War II, we started the Marshall Plan, and financed the \ndevelopment of Europe and the Pacific rim countries. We sent the \nequipment, the expertise, the money, the technology, and it worked. We \nspread capitalism. It has prevailed over communism in the Cold War, and \neverybody is happy. But in that 50-year period, instead of following \nour example by giving up a good part of the textile industry, giving up \na good part of the automobile industry, giving up a major part of the \nelectronics industry--and I could go right on down the list, steel and \notherwise--they didn't follow suit.\n  When they talk about free trade, it is interesting to look at the \n1992 foreign trade barriers. Some act like we have to set the example. \nWe tried that for 50 years and flunked. We have flunked the course.\n  In 1992, they had 265 pages of restrictions in the foreign trade \nbarriers--the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Then in 2002, 10 \nyears later, they had exactly 455 pages. It went up by 200 pages. Since \nI have been doing this, the Trade Representative has put out a\n\n[[Page S8190]]\n\nnewer one in smaller print. No kidding. They are clever over there. \nThey don't think you are watching.\n  The movement is to protectionism. How in the Lord's world do you \nthink we are going to survive in a trade war? That is what we are in--\nprotectionism for free trade.\n  The question before this body is how to get there. Come on.\n  It is like world peace. Everybody is for world peace, but the best \nway to preserve the peace is to prepare for war. The best way to attain \nfree trade is raise the barrier to a barrier. We then remove both. It \nis competition.\n  It is trade. The word ``trade,'' free trade is an oxymoron. There is \nnothing free. There is no free lunch.\n  I can tell you now in this globalization, come on. Senator, you don't \nknow anything about globalization. You don't want to compete. You don't \nunderstand. We have globalized. We have globalization going on.\n  Did you know that the United States of America invented \nglobalization? We invented it under Alexander Hamilton. We had just won \nour freedom as a fledgling colony.\n  The Brits said, Wait a minute, to Hamilton, we will trade with you \nwhat Britain produces best, and you in the new United States of America \ntrade back with us what you produce the best. Hamilton started \nglobalization. He told the Brits to bug off in his Report on \nManufacturers.\n  We started globalization, and we have continued it.\n  Do you know what it takes for protectionism? We didn't even pass an \nincome tax until 1913. We financed government for 100 and some years.\n  Theodore Rex said, on page 21--this is the turn of the last century \nunder Teddy Roosevelt.\n\n       This first year of the new century found her worth twenty-\n     five billion dollars more than her nearest rival, Great \n     Britain, with a gross national product more than twice that \n     of Germany and Russia. The United States was already so rich \n     in goods and services that she was more self-sustaining than \n     any industrial power in history.\n       Indeed, it could consume only a fraction of what it \n     produced. The rest went overseas at prices other exporters \n     found hard to match. As Andrew Carnegie said, ``The nation \n     that makes the cheapest steel has other nations at its \n     feet.'' More than half the world's cotton, corn, copper, and \n     oil flowed from the American cornucopia, and at least one \n     third of all steel, iron, silver, and gold.\n       Even if the United States were not so blessed with raw \n     materials, the excellence of her manufactured products \n     guaranteed her dominance of world markets. Current \n     advertisements in British magazines gave the impression that \n     the typical Englishman woke to the ring of an Ingersoll \n     alarm, shaved with a Gillette razor, combed his hair with \n     Vaseline tonic, buttoned his Arrow shirt, hurried downstairs \n     for Quaker Oats, California figs, and Maxwell House coffee, \n     commuted in a Westinghouse tram (body by Fisher), rose to his \n     office in an Otis elevator, and worked all day with his \n     Waterman pen under the efficient glare of Edison lightbulbs. \n     ``It only remains,'' one Fleet Street wag suggested, ``for \n     [us] to take American coal to Newcastle.'' Behind the joke \n     lay real concern: the United States was already supplying \n     beer to Germany, pottery to Bohemia, and oranges to Valencia.\n\n  We walked into the World War II Memorial and over on the right-hand \nside you see a saying by President Roosevelt in 1942 of how we won that \nwar. He gave tribute to Rosie the Riveter, the American production \nmachine. That is how we built it, with protectionism.\n  Now for 50 years, we have given it away. We continue to want to give \nit away and put ourselves in the hands of the Chinese and Japanese by \nnot paying our bill. They are financing our debt.\n  There you are. That is the reason for the situation we are in. We are \nthe ones to blame. Before you open up Smith Manufacturing, you have to \nhave clean air, clean war, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, minimum \nwage, plant closing notice, parental leave, safe working place, safe \nmachinery, the Americans with Disabilities Act--I can keep on going. \nBut you can go to China for 58 cents an hour and have none of those \nrequirements.\n  America is leaving and organized against us and the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce has turned into the International Chamber of Commerce. The \nmultinationals are taking it over and they are all hollering, ``free \ntrade,'' ``free trade,'' continuing to produce overseas, dump back into \nthe United States. And we are in the hands of the Philistines; namely, \nWTO.\n  Every time we bring a dumping case, they say it is violative of WTO. \nYou can't sell a product at less than cost in the United States but you \ncan take a foreign Lexus automobile and sell it for $35,000. That same \nautomobile sells for $45,000 back in the Tokyo market. The competition \nis market share; it is not profit.\n  This is a very complicated subject. We have to come to grips with it. \nThere are going to be exceptions to those countries that have the same \nstandard of living. You have your national interests and national \nconcerns.\n  I voted for free trade with Jordan. She is our only friend out there \nhelping us with Israel in the Middle East. So you make those exceptions \nbecause it is in our national interest to do so.\n  But the general rule of thumb is, it is the standard of living, and \non trade itself, we have to get organized. We need, instead of a \nDepartment of Commerce, a Department of Trade and Commerce. We need to \ntransfer the special Trade Representative over there. We need to start \nenforcing our laws, get a U.S. attorney, an assistant U.S. Secretary of \nthe Department of Justice as we have on the antitrust division and put \nhim in there in the trust division with us in trade.\n  We have to get more Customs agents. We have to get in and start \ncompeting and quit whining against each other and understand we are not \ngetting anywhere. We are going out of business every day. Exports and \nimports have been going up years on in, but, for the first time, our \nexports, now, have gone down in the last 4 years, rather than up.\n  Yes, thank Heavens for the farmer. I see the American farmer on the \nfloor of the Senate. Thank Heavens we have the plus balance of trade \nthere. Other than that, we are not making anything anymore.\n  Of course, in Europe, which was a good market, they do not want to \nbuy anything from us on account of Iraq. We have turned them off. We \nare not only having to pay for Iraq in human tragedy and otherwise, but \nwe have to pay for it in our trade balance now with Europe.\n  I could go right on down the list. Just one word. Yesterday, I picked \nup the article with respect to William Safire. Safire said we had no \nagents in Iraq, none. I have seen one figure $30 billion and another \nfigure $40 billion intelligence effort and we had nobody in Iraq. It \nreminds me when I served for 8 years on the Intelligence Committee and \nwe came back in before the gulf storm--the ``we'' being Senator Bill \nCohen and myself--and we wanted to get briefing on Saddam going into \nKuwait. They told us the CIA didn't have anybody that could brief us. \nWe had to send over to the Defense Department.\n\n  George Tenet was the staff director at the particular time. Here, \nsome 10 years later, we still don't have anybody. Do you know what they \ntold me why we didn't have anybody? Because Israel will tell us. Mossad \nis the best intelligence in the world. And all of this dog chasing its \ntail about whether the intelligence was distorted or misinterpreted or \npressured or what have you, I can tell you now the survival of Israel, \nour best friend, depends on having intelligence on what is going on in \ndowntown Baghdad, all over Iraq, all over Syria, all over Iran, and in \nEgypt. They know. They got to know. And therein you do not need \nintelligence. That is the dog that didn't bark.\n  My friend Bob Novak was talking about the dog that didn't bark. If \nthere had been any weapons of mass destruction, our friend, Israel, \nwould have said: Go there, go here, go there. They knew it. And George \nHerbert Walker Bush said:\n\n       I firmly believe we should march into Baghdad. . . . It \n     would take us way beyond the imprimatur of the international \n     law bestowed by the resolutions of the Security Council, \n     assigning young soldiers to a fruitless hunt for a securely \n     entrenched dictator and condemning them to fight in what \n     would be an unwinnable urban guerilla war. It could only \n     plunge that part of the world into even greater instability \n     and destroy the credibility we were working so hard to \n     reestablish.\n\n  It would turn the whole Arab world against us.\n  That is where we are.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n[[Page S8191]]\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota \nfor his courtesy in letting me make a brief statement before he makes \nhis statement.\n  I rise today to express my strong opposition to the United States-\nAustralia Free Trade Agreement and the legislation that has been \nintroduced to implement it. This is the latest in a string of deeply \nflawed trade agreements. It is a bad deal for dairy farmers, it is a \nbad deal for consumers, and it is a bad deal for Wisconsin.\n  The agreement undermines our dairy industry by displacing the \ndomestic milk supply. It proposes to increase quota access to the U.S. \nmarket for Australia's dairy producers, while failing to address the \nflood of milk protein concentrate imports that is entering the country \nthrough a tariff loophole and that has been harming U.S. dairy farmers \nfor some time. There can be no doubt that this agreement will put \ndownward pressure on dairy prices and will further accelerate the loss \nof dairy farms in Wisconsin and across the Nation, which is something I \nhave been working hard to stop.\n  Wisconsin is still the No. 1 producer of cheese in the United States. \nBut this agreement will hurt Wisconsin cheesemakers as they attempt to \ncompete against the ever-rising flood of Australian imports. By signing \nthis agreement without addressing MPCs, the administration turned a \nblind eye to the concerns of the Wisconsin dairy industry.\n  The adverse effects of the agreement are not limited to our dairy \nfarmers. During the informal mock markup, a majority of the Senate \nFinance Committee expressed concerns about safeguards to protect \nAmerican ranchers and cattle producers from unfair imports of beef \nproducts. Those concerns underscore the importance of the \nadministration consulting and working with Senators in the drafting of \nthe implementing legislation.\n  Instead of honoring the informal process set forward in the trade \npromotion authority, the administration and the Senate leadership \nignored these concerns. The result is to further undermine the ability \nof the Senate to weigh in on trade agreements, which was already \ngreatly weakened by the passage of fast-track authority.\n  This is not the only problem with the trade agreement between the \nUnited States and Australia. As an original cosponsor of bipartisan \nlegislation that would allow Americans to safely purchase prescription \ndrugs from countries including Australia, I am particularly troubled by \nreports that this agreement would effectively ban reimportation of \nprescription drugs from Australia.\n  In February, I wrote to the Senate Finance Committee and urged them \nto address this issue before the unamendable legislation implementing \nthe trade agreement was brought to the Senate floor for a vote. Now, \nreports raise real questions about whether Congress can repeal the \ntrade agreement's ban on reimportation of prescription drugs from \nAustralia, even if it later passed legislation permitting \nreimportation. I do not see why we should be voting now on a trade \nagreement that would potentially tie the hands of both Australia and \nthe United States on this vitally important issue.\n  This legislation may well be a template for future trade agreements \nto include similar provisions that restrict the safe reimportation of \ndrugs. I strongly disagree with efforts by trade negotiators to address \nan issue that Congress is currently actively considering. Congress \nshould be setting policy on an issue as important as the importation \nand the reimportation of prescription drugs, not our trade negotiators.\n  There continue to be many concerns about the impact of this agreement \non the U.S. health care system, particularly the Federal programs aimed \nat helping our veterans, our seniors, and our neediest citizens. These \nquestions need to be resolved to ensure access to safe and affordable \nprescription drugs.\n  I have introduced a bill, S. 1994, which would address what I believe \nis one of the biggest flaws of the new Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit. My bill would allow Medicare to negotiate the prices of \nprescription drugs offered under this new benefit. There is widespread \nsupport for giving Medicare this authority. It only makes sense we let \nMedicare use its considerable leverage to help lower the cost of \nprescription medicines for seniors. But there are questions about how \nthis agreement would impact Medicare's ability to negotiate drug \nprices, should legislation such as mine be passed by Congress.\n  We need more time to answer these questions and to fully understand \nthe possible interaction of this agreement with legislation to allow \nthe safe reimportation of prescription drugs. Trade promotion authority \nprovides expedited consideration of trade agreements, but we are well \nahead of any deadlines imposed. This Chamber could easily have waited \nuntil next week or even into September to consider this measure. With \nonly 20 hours of debate allowed, the Senate should not have rushed \nheadlong into this debate today. There is simply no excuse for Congress \nhastily taking up the Australia Free Trade Agreement before resolving \nthese questions.\n  The administration presented a bad deal to Congress and the American \npeople. Not only will this agreement hurt Wisconsin's dairy industry, \nbut the whole process has undermined Congress's constitutional \nauthority over trade policy and it has weakened our ability to make \npolicy. For those reasons, I will oppose the United States-Australia \nFree Trade Agreement implementing legislation, and I urge my colleagues \nto vote against this measure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong opposition to \nthe so-called United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement. This is \nreally not a free-trade agreement at all. This is a negotiated trade \nagreement, and our side, once again, lost the negotiation.\n  I believe the United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement is one \nmore example of the United States trading away its economic strength \nfor some other agenda. Somebody once said: The U.S. has never lost a \nwar and never won a negotiation. That certainly is true of this \nagreement.\n  First, I believe the focus of our trade policy should be opening \nmarkets to U.S. exports where we have the most to gain. We need to \nlevel the playing field for our producers, and we need to open major \nmarkets around the world that remain closed to us. Unfortunately, that \nis not the trade policy or agenda being pursued by this administration.\n  Our current trade policy is completely off course. Our negotiators \nhave failed to secure a good deal for agriculture in the WTO talks. \nInstead, they have opened trade talks with countries that offer few new \nexport opportunities for the United States.\n  Commercial gain should drive our trade policy. But it has become \nclear that foreign policy considerations are the primary factor \ninfluencing our trade agenda. It is no secret here in Washington what \nthis agreement is about. It is not about a trade advantage for the \nUnited States. It is not about improving the economic strength of \nAmerica. This is a payoff. This is a payoff to Australia for backing \nour Iraq policy. That is what this is about.\n  Not surprisingly, the results of this flawed trade policy are \nabysmal. Our trade deficits are skyrocketing. Last year, the trade \ndeficit hit an all-time record of $497 billion. And this year, what do \nwe anticipate? Well, it is going to be much worse.\n  Mr. President and colleagues, we can look back and see what has \nhappened under this trade agenda. In 1997, we had a trade deficit of \n$108 billion. That was only 7 years ago, and look what has happened. \nEvery year it has jumped, and jumped dramatically. From 1998 to 1999, \nit went up almost $100 billion; from 1999 to 2000, almost $100 billion; \nfrom 2001 to 2002, up, up, and away again, approaching $100 billion for \n2002 to 2003. Goodness knows where it will be this year.\n  These developments have serious consequences for our economy. This is \nnot just numbers on a page. This is not just columns on a chart. This \nhas real-world consequences for the U.S. economy.\n  Earlier this year, the Washington Post carried an article expressing \nthe concerns of economists about our trade and budget deficits and the \nfalling value of the dollar. It reported:\n\n       The twin trade and budget deficits are both approaching a \n     half trillion dollars, and with\n\n[[Page S8192]]\n\n     U.S. consumer debt also at record levels, it is up to \n     foreigners to keep the U.S. economy afloat.\n\n  Let me repeat that: ``it is up to foreigners to keep the U.S. economy \nafloat.''\n  The U.S. economy now borrows $1.5 billion a day from foreign \ninvestors, said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist of Wells Fargo & Co., \nand that level could reach $3 billion a day in the near future.\n  Where are we getting the money from? The Senator from South Carolina \nhad it right. We are approaching $600 billion from Japan, $150 billion \nfrom China. We are even borrowing money from the so-called Caribbean \nbanking centers--$80 billion from the Caribbean banking centers. And we \nhave yet our tin cup out, even in South Korea. Who would have guessed \nthat the mighty and powerful United States would have to go hat in hand \nto South Korea and borrow $40 billion?\n  The Washington Post article went on to say:\n\n       Currency traders fretting over that dependency have been \n     selling dollars fast and buying euros furiously. The fear is \n     that foreigners will tire of financing America's appetites. \n     Foreign investors will dump U.S. assets, especially stocks \n     and bonds, sending financial markets plummeting. Interest \n     rates will shoot up to entice them back. Heavily indebted \n     Americans will not be able to keep up with rising interest \n     payments. Inflation, bankruptcies and economic malaise will \n     follow.\n\n  On agricultural trade, the story, regrettably, is much the same.\n  Things are getting worse, not better. Our surpluses have gotten \nsteadily smaller since 1996. Always agricultural trade has been one of \nour leading areas of surplus, but that surplus is shrinking and \nshrinking steadily. Last year we had the smallest agricultural trade \nsurplus since 1987. We are going full speed in reverse in every sector. \nThis is an ominous warning to the American people of the direction of \nthis flawed and failed trade policy.\n  The fact is, this administration is not leveling the playing field \nfor our producers or opening major new markets for U.S. exports. \nInstead, it is opening our markets to a flood of agricultural imports \nunfairly traded that threaten American family farmers. To me, focusing \non this free-trade agreement and more like it and neglecting a \nsuccessful WTO agreement is a recipe for disaster for American \nagriculture. Mark my words, friends: We are going in the wrong \ndirection.\n  Those with whom we compete are not playing according to some fair set \nof rules. They are subsidizing at a rate, in Europe alone, five times \nour rate here. They account for over 87 percent of the world's \nagricultural export subsidy in Europe, 30 times the rate here. And the \nresults are clear. They are gaining market share year after year after \nyear and now rival our own share of the world market.\n  America needs to wake up to the gathering threat. I regret to say, \nthis agreement with Australia is a perfect example. On agriculture, the \nUnited States had almost nothing to gain and a lot to lose. The simple \nfact is that Australia is never going to be a large export market for \nU.S. commodities, but it poses a serious threat to certain commodities \nproduced here at home such as beef and dairy. It is very clear. Any \nobjective analyst can look and see what was the opportunity for America \nand what was the threat. The threat totally overwhelms the opportunity.\n  In addition, Australia has an export state trading enterprise known \nas the Australian Wheat Board. Grain growers in my State have had a \nbitter experience with these State trading enterprises. Ever since \npassage of the so-called Canadian Free Trade Agreement--again, that was \nno free-trade agreement; it was another negotiated trade agreement, and \nour side lost the negotiation there as well, especially when it came to \nagriculture--the United States has been flooded with a tidal wave of \nunfairly traded Canadian grain, undercutting our producers, \nundercutting our prices, putting our people at risk, costing my State \nnearly half a billion dollars.\n  Our neighbor to the north maintains a government-sponsored monopoly \nknown as the Canadian Wheat Board. The Canadian Wheat Board is the only \nexporter of western Canadian grain. It is a monopoly. It uses this \nmonopoly power to undercut prices to our producers, not just in my \nState of North Dakota but in Montana, in Idaho, in Minnesota, and all \nacross the northern tier of the United States, undercutting through \nunfair trade practices the family farmers who are the heart of the \nheartland of America.\n  We have been fighting for 15 years to resolve problems created by the \nCanadian Wheat Board, and we have learned a bitter lesson. We have \nlearned that once something is permitted in a trade agreement, it is \nvirtually impossible to fix. That is why I was disappointed to learn \nthat the Australia Free Trade Agreement does nothing--I hope my \ncolleagues are listening--to curb the unfair trading activities of the \nAustralian Wheat Board. This was a priority for many farmers. The U.S. \nwheat industry has decided to oppose this agreement because of this one \ndefect alone.\n\n  Some will argue that we have a trade surplus with Australia, and, \ntherefore, it is a good country with which to enter into a trade \nagreement. That argument sounds good, but history teaches us something \nquite different. I remember so well when we debated NAFTA. I want to \nmake clear my own position on trade. I supported the agreement with \nChina. I supported WTO. I opposed NAFTA. I opposed the Canadian Free \nTrade Agreement because in those cases, I believed our negotiators got \ntaken to the cleaners. I will tell you, our negotiators got taken to \nthe cleaners on this one as well.\n  The record, I believe, will be clear. Back in NAFTA, remember what we \nwere told. We were told: We have a trade surplus with Mexico, and if we \njust approve this agreement, the surpluses will grow.\n  We can now go back and check the record. Did the $2 billion trade \nsurplus that existed with Mexico before NAFTA increase? No. Did it stay \nthe same? No. There is no trade surplus with Mexico anymore. Now we \nhave a trade deficit, not a small trade deficit, not $2 billion, not $4 \nbillion, not $8 billion, but $40 billion of trade deficit. And some \ncome on this floor and call it a success. What would it take to call it \na failure? I am amazed to hear people come out on this floor and call \nNAFTA a great success. We went from a $2 billion trade surplus to a $40 \nbillion trade deficit, and they call that a success? What are they \nthinking of? We are full speed in reverse in this country in terms of \nour trade position in the world.\n  Trade agreements are no guarantee of trade surpluses, and opening our \nmarket to further import competition without creating new export \nopportunities is a serious mistake. That is exactly what this agreement \nthat is before us today does when it comes to agriculture. There will \nbe virtually no new agricultural exports to Australia as a result of \nthis agreement. But when it comes to the American beef and dairy \nindustries, there will be significant increases in imports that they \nwill face--and on an unfair basis--because we know of all the hidden \nsubsidies they have in Australia for those industries. We know how they \nplay the game.\n  I have concluded that from the perspective of the farmers and \nranchers I represent, this agreement is a bad deal.\n  Second, the mistake has been compounded by a massive loophole in \nimplementing this bill with regard to beef safeguards. Ever since the \nAustralia Free Trade Agreement was signed, the administration has said \nover and over that the agreement had an automatic guaranteed safeguard \nto protect our U.S. beef industry against unfairly traded imports. That \nis what they told us. That is what they told American ranchers and \nfarmers, that it was automatic, that it was guaranteed. But check the \nfine print. See what they have done in the final hours. They have \nslipped you a Mickey. It is not guaranteed. It is not automatic. It is \nall subject to a waiver and a decision by one person who doesn't happen \nto be in the Congress of the United States.\n  We were told that the industry would not have to worry if imports of \nAustralian beef surged or prices in this country plummeted. The \nsafeguards were automatic and were guaranteed.\n  But now we find the safeguard is not automatic and not guaranteed. In \nfact, this safeguard has a loophole big enough to drive a cattle truck \nthrough. The implementing bill before us specifies that the USTR can \nwaive the beef safeguards whenever it determines that extraordinary \nmarket conditions make it in the national interest to do so.\n\n[[Page S8193]]\n\n  Here is what it says:\n\n       The United States Trade Representative is authorized to \n     waive the application of this subsection if the Trade \n     Representative determines that extraordinary market \n     conditions demonstrate that a waiver would be in the national \n     interest of the United States.\n\n  Who decides? The Trade Representative of the United States. That is \nnot what the Constitution says. The Constitution doesn't say the Trade \nRepresentative decides these questions of international commerce. The \nConstitution of the United States says:\n\n       The Congress shall have power . . . to regulate commerce \n     with foreign nations. . . .\n\n  Not the Trade Representative or Ambassador, but the Congress. And the \nCongress has given away its responsibility in these free-trade \nagreements with the fast-track procedure. We have done that based on a \npromise that is being violated in this agreement for the first time in \na trade agreement.\n  Listen well, my friends. Listen well. Understand what is about to \nhappen on the floor of the Senate. For the first time, in an \nunprecedented way, the role of Congress is being further reduced. The \nlegislation before us does not require the Trade Representative to even \nconsider the effect on the beef industry of waiving the safeguards. If \nhe or she determines that a lower price for hamburger is in the \nnational interest, it can waive the safeguard, even if doing so clearly \ninjures the U.S. beef industry, which the safeguards are supposed to \nprotect. The legislation doesn't give Congress, the body charged in our \nConstitution with regulating tariffs, any meaningful say in this \ndecision.\n  As I show on this chart, Article I, section 8 of the Constitution \nsays Congress shall have the power. In this agreement, it is the Trade \nRepresentative who has the power. The statement of administrative \naction says, ``The United States Trade Representative will notify \nCongress of its decision to waive the safeguard at least 5 days before \nthe waiver goes into effect.''\n  The Congress shall have the power to get a 5-day notice of what the \nTrade Representative has decided. That is not what the Constitution of \nthe United States intended. It didn't intend for a Trade Representative \nto give 5 days' notice to the Congress of the United States before \ntheir decision is made, with no role for the Congress of the United \nStates. That is not what the Constitution says.\n  This agreement does not in any way commit the USTR to even listen if \nthe Congress expresses concerns or objections. I don't think that is \nright. I don't think that is how this agreement had been sold to the \nAmerican people. I know that is not the way it was sold to the ranchers \nand farmers of North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Idaho, and every \nother State. They were told there was automatic guaranteed protection \nfor them.\n  That is why, when the Finance Committee conducted its markup of the \nAustralia agreement 2 weeks ago, I offered an amendment. My amendment \ninsisted that Congress have a say before the Trade Representative \ndecides unilaterally to waive this safeguard.\n\n  This is where it gets interesting, because my amendment was adopted \non a vote of 11-10. Here is the vote: 11 votes for the Conrad \namendment, 10 votes in opposition. The Conrad amendment is not in the \nagreement that is before us. Have you ever heard of that happening \nbefore? Have you ever heard of an amendment passing in a committee that \nhas jurisdiction and it is excluded when it comes out here on the \nfloor? It is as though those 11 Senators never voted.\n  The administration ignored the amendment passed in the Finance \nCommittee and, as a result, the legislation before us contains the very \nsame loophole that was rejected by a majority of the Senate Finance \nCommittee. That is profoundly unfair to America's ranchers and \ncattlemen. It ignores the express will of the Senate Finance Committee, \nand it is yet another example of why I have concluded this legislation \nis a bad deal.\n  Before moving on to discuss why I find this process so troubling, let \nme address one other issue that has been raised with respect to my \namendment. Some have argued that my beef safeguard amendment was \nunconstitutional. That argument is simply a red herring designed to \navoid a discussion of the merits of the amendment. I have yet to hear \nanyone argue that Congress should not have any say before the U.S. \nTrade Representative unilaterally waives the safeguard that was \npromised to America's cattlemen. The Finance Committee has a long \nhistory of considering conceptual amendments rather than requiring \nlegislative language. That is how the Finance Committee of the United \nStates does its work. We offer conceptual amendments that are later \ntranslated into legal language. That is the way it works.\n  My amendment said fundamentally that Congress must act before the \nU.S. Trade Representative can waive the safeguards promised to the beef \nindustry. I have consulted with the Congressional Research Service, \nbecause one of their staff members asserted there might be a \nconstitutional problem with what I proposed. I now have a memo from the \nvery same gentleman who raised the constitutional question saying there \nwere at least two ways to take my conceptual amendment and make it \nconstitutionally permissible. But that is not what happened. As I have \nsaid, CRS has concluded in a memo to me that the concept expressed in \nmy amendment could have been implemented in at least two ways without \nraising any constitutional problems.\n  First, the Conrad amendment could have been implemented through the \nstatement of administrative action. The statement of administrative \naction is a document submitted to the Congress that explains the \nagreement on how the administration intends to implement it. Since the \nstatement of administrative action is an executive branch document, it \nexplains how the executive branch will choose to operate. No separation \nof powers problems would exist.\n  Moreover, this is precisely how a commitment to Senator Baucus with \nrespect to the beef safeguard was implemented. It was not included in \nthe legislation. It was put in the statement of administrative action.\n  Alternatively, it would have been entirely consistent with my \namendment to implement it through a congressional disapproval process. \nThis process is very familiar to Senators. For years, the Congress \nvoted annually on a resolution extending normal trade relations, or \nmost-favored-nation status, as it was then called, treatment for China. \nThere has never been any question that this waiver process was fully \nconstitutional. Thus, had there been any interest in making my \namendment work, it would have been easy to find a way to do it.\n  So I can only conclude that those who talk about the Constitution are \nsimply avoiding the real issue. The real issue is whether the U.S. \nTrade Representative should be given the power unilaterally to revoke a \nsafeguard that was sold to our beef producers as an absolutely \nautomatic guaranteed protection against surges of unfairly traded \nAustralian beef imports that would damage our U.S. beef industry.\n  On that issue, a majority of the committee clearly said no. They \ndidn't just say no, they voted no. I have yet to hear anyone make a \npersuasive argument why the USTR should be able to unilaterally take \naway this safeguard. It is unfair to those who supported my amendment. \nThe process was short-circuited to drop the Conrad amendment. In \nparticular, it is unfair to our ranchers and cattlemen to take away \nthat safeguard.\n  Let me address the process the Finance Committee followed in dropping \nmy amendment, and why it is so troubling.\n  The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee is a fine man. He is, in \nfact, a good friend of mine. But with all respect to the chairman, the \nprocess that was followed to subvert the will of the majority of this \ncommittee was egregious. It sets a very dangerous precedent that \nthreatens the underpinnings of the fast-track process.\n  As all Members of this body already know, the Constitution gives the \nCongress--not the President--the responsibility for regulating foreign \ntrade. Yet in recognition that we cannot have 535 trade negotiators, \nthe Congress has agreed to the fast-track process for considering trade \nagreements.\n  In agreeing to fast track, each Senator gives up the most fundamental \nrights of a Senator. We give up our right to amend, the most \nfundamental right of all Senators. And we give up our right to extended \ndebate, a second\n\n[[Page S8194]]\n\nof the most fundamental rights of any Senator. In essence, we are \ngiving up our right to protect our constituents.\n  In return, there is supposed to be a detailed consultation--a \ndetailed consultation--with the Congress throughout the process of \nnegotiating trade agreements and developing the implementing \nlegislation.\n  In practice, the Finance Committee in the Senate is the focus of this \nconsultation because the Finance Committee has jurisdiction over trade \npolicy. In theory, the committee has extensive input during the process \nof negotiating trade agreements and developing the legislation to \nimplement them. Theoretically, it does not then need to amend the \nimplementing bill once it is formally introduced.\n  Understand, here we are on the floor of the Senate. There is a \ntreaty. Normally, every Senator would have the right to offer \namendments to it. We would have the right to extended debate. We have \ngiven up those rights under the fast-track process. We do not have the \nright to amend. This bill will be considered in less than 20 hours. \nThere is not the right to extended discussion, to illuminate, to \neducate so that people fully understand what is happening. Those \nfundamental rights of any Senator have been given up in the fast-track \nprocess.\n  When it comes to developing the implementing bill, this consultation \noccurs through what is known as the mock markup process because it is \nnot a real markup because we have given up those rights. Instead, we \nhave what is called a mock markup. The mock markup is the Finance \nCommittee's opportunity to amend the implementing bill before it is \nformally introduced, and then cannot be amended under fast-track rules.\n  This informal process has a long history. For past agreements, the \nprocess has lasted months and produced a host of changes. To give just \none example, 14 amendments were adopted during the mock markup of the \nNorth American Free Trade Agreement. The amendments added during mock \nmarkups were addressed in a mock conference and then included in the \nfinal formal implementing bill. I recall this history to make several \npoints because people need to understand what is happening.\n\n  Everything has changed. We have never dealt with a trade matter in \nthe way we are dealing with it today. My colleagues need to understand \nthe consequences of what is about to happen because they are enormously \nserious for every Senator, and they are enormously consequential for \nthis country.\n  First, in the past, the committees have always insisted on sufficient \ntime for all members of the committee to review the draft implementing \nbill and have their concerns addressed.\n  Second, it is not at all unusual for changes to be made, for \namendments to be made during the mock markup process, including many \nthat did not have the support of the administration.\n  Third, when the mock markup process produced changes, it did not \nspell doom for the agreement.\n  Fourth and finally, the chairman of the Finance Committee did not \nvote down the package simply because it included a provision with which \nthe administration or the chairman disagreed.\n  But what happened during the mock markup of this bill, the Australia \nfree trade agreement, threatens to make a mockery--a mockery--of the \nprocess of congressional consultation. In the Australia agreement, we \ngot the bum's rush.\n  The agreement was completed on February 13, but we did not see \nimplementing legislation until June 18. More than 4 months went by with \nno implementing bill to review. And then after 4 months of delay, we \nwere told we would have 4 business days before the mock markup to \nrespond to a provision on the beef safeguards that was totally \nunexpected.\n  When I indicated my intent to offer an amendment, the Trade \nRepresentative made clear that my input was unwelcome. He simply did \nnot want to entertain a serious substantive concern that is important \nto the ranchers and cattlemen whom I represent. Yet addressing these \nconcerns before an unamendable fast-track bill is precisely the purpose \nof the mock markup process. That is the whole point of going through \nthis exercise, is to give Senators a chance in the committee of \njurisdiction to make changes if they prevail in a vote.\n  I did prevail in a vote. My side won, but it is not in this \nagreement. That has never happened before. Mr. President, I say to \nSenators, they better think long and hard about what that means. They \nbetter think long and hard about what that means for the process. They \nbetter think long and hard about what that means for fast track because \nif this trade of giving up our right to amend and our right to extended \ndebate is a hollow one without meaning, that there is supposed to be a \ncongressional consultation, that there is supposed to be a parallel \nprocess that allows Senators to alter the package before it comes to \nthis floor, if that is all hollow, if that is all a sham, if that is \nall a phony exercise, then Senators better think long and hard about \ngiving up that power to amend and that right to extended debate because \nthe rest of this process has become an absolute sham.\n  I offered my amendment. It prevailed on an 11-to-10 vote, but the \nnormal process was not allowed to play out. Instead, the committee \nfollowed the unprecedented course of voting down the amended \nrecommendation in its entirety. Then the administration submitted its \noriginal proposal all over again without the amendment. That is good; \nthat is arrogant.\n  In essence, what the administration is saying is that voting down a \nrecommendation is tantamount to approving it. They are ignoring the \nclearly expressed will of a majority of the members when it comes to \nthe language on beef safeguards. It is like voting down a bill on the \nSenate floor after it has been amended and trying to claim that defeat \nis the same as adopting the bill that was originally brought to the \nfloor. What a sham.\n  That strikes me as dangerous. It opens the process to abuse, and it \nreduces the committee's role in crafting trade policy. It may have been \nexpedient in this instance, but I believe that we will come to regret \nthis precedent and this day. It invites a future President to ignore \nany recommendations made by the committee on future trade-implementing \nlegislation.\n  Remember what the Constitution says? The power is with the Congress \non the question of regulating commerce with foreign nations.\n  This is not a dictatorship. This is not a circumstance where the \npower was vested by the Constitution of the United States in the \nPresident of the United States. The Constitution of the United States \nsays:\n\n       The Congress shall have the power . . . to regulate \n     commerce with foreign nations. . . .\n\n  The Australia Free Trade Agreement promises few, if any, benefits to \nU.S. agriculture and has little or no positive effect on our overall \neconomy or perilously large trade deficits. Instead, it puts certain \nsectors of American agriculture at extreme risk.\n  Before I move on, I remind my colleagues that the fast-track process \nis up for renewal next year. To the extent that it becomes clear to \ncolleagues that the consultation promised in the fast-track process is \na sham, a snare, and a dilution, it will become infinitely more \ndifficult to extend fast track. Who is going to want to give up their \nright to amend, who is going to want to give up their right to extended \ndebate, if there is no right to serious consultation by the committees \nof jurisdiction; if it is all just a game and there is no meaning to \nvotes that are cast? That is what is about to happen. It is a sham.\n  Moreover, the safeguards that were supposed to protect ranchers and \ncattlemen from excessive and unfairly traded Australian imports turned \nout to be a false promise. They are not automatic or guaranteed as \npromised. Instead, they can be waived at any time without any input \nfrom Congress. That is unfair to our ranchers, our beef industry.\n  Finally, the process that the Finance Committee followed sets a \nterrible precedent. No Senator should welcome the precedent that the \nadministration can simply ignore the votes of the committee of \njurisdiction on a particular trade issue important to the people we \nrepresent, secure in the knowledge that a trade-implementing bill can \nbe pushed through as part of a larger take-it-or-leave-it package.\n  For all of these reasons, I will strongly oppose the Australia Free \nTrade Agreement that is before us.\n\n[[Page S8195]]\n\n  I conclude by saying to my colleagues if anybody does not think we \nare setting a precedent that has enormous consequences down the road, \nthink again. I have been here long enough to see what happens when this \nis done. For the purpose of expedient action one year, that precedent \ncan grow like a cancer. Right now, I believe what is being done is so \negregious and so wrong that it sows the seeds for undermining the \nentire fast-track procedure.\n  When Senators awaken to what is being done, I think they will be very \nreluctant to give up their fundamental rights to amend legislation \nimplementing a trade agreement. I think they will be very reluctant to \ngive up their right to extended debate. Those are the most fundamental \nrights of any Senator.\n  There is a reason those rights were extended to Senators. It is so \nthey can protect the rights of the minority, so they could slow down a \nprocess so people could think carefully about the effects and the \nimplications of legislation before this body. That is the fundamental \nconstitutional role of the Senate. It is being jeopardized by this \nfast-track process that has become not just a fast track, it has become \na railroad job.\n  When votes do not matter, when consultation does not matter, when one \nperson decides the commerce with foreign nations, this country and this \nbody has gone off the track.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I was hoping that the Senator from North \nDakota would stay around. First, I support the Australia Free Trade \nAgreement because it is for the sole purpose that it is in the economic \ninterest of the United States of America. I do it within our \nconstitutional power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce. I do \nit in the tradition of the last 70 years, since the 1930s, of the \nUnited States doing everything it could to lead the rest of the world \nin the reduction of barriers to trade; to enhance not only the economy \nof the United States of America but the economy of the entire world.\n  Let no one have any doubt in their mind, this is in the economic \ninterest of the United States and that is the only thing the United \nStates ought to be considering as we consider this legislation.\n  The charge was made that the only reason we are doing this is because \nof the friendship of Australia and their support in our efforts in \nIraq. If I can do something in the economic interest of the United \nStates and at the same time enhance our relationships and show our \nrespect for a friend in the world community of nations, I am not going \nto back away from doing that, because through almost 100 years of the \ninvolvement of the United States in military activity for the promotion \nof peace and liberty around the world Australia has been an ally on \nwhich we could count.\n  Australia is not going to agree to this agreement because they might \nlike the United States of America. Australia is going to look at this \nand ask: Is it in their economic interest? Now, their administration \nhas already said that it is because it is signed. I do not know whether \nCongress has acted down in Australia, but nobody is going to be \nconcerned about the economic interests of America except Americans and \nthe elected representatives of America. Nobody is going to be concerned \nabout the economic interests of Australia except the people of \nAustralia and their elected representatives.\n  It just happens that everything does not have to be black and white, \nthat when we do things in public policy and in international trade and \nin our foreign relations sometimes things can be done to accomplish \nmore than one thing, and it happens that we have an opportunity in this \nvote today not only to do something in the economic interests of the \nUnited States of America but also to enhance our relationship with a \nfriend in the world.\n  From a member of a political party who is always badmouthing our \nPresident of the United States because he is engaged in world \nactivities, military activities without seeking enough help from other \nnations and from the United Nations, I think it is talking out of both \nsides of your mouth when you condemn us for trying to do something for \na nation that has been a friend of ours--in this case, Australia.\n  The other thing I noticed about the debate that just went on is the \ncharts that have been put up all afternoon by people on the other side \nof the aisle bemoaning the unfavorable balance of trade we have. What \ndo they want to do? Do they want to tell the consumers of America that \nyou cannot buy from anywhere in the world you want? Why do we have the \nbalance of trade we do? It is because the U.S. consumers are king and \nthey can do anything they want to do and they are doing it. They are \nexercising their economic freedom. They are also exercising the \nopportunity of the marketplace to buy from what they think is the place \nto get the best quality for a certain price. That opportunity happens \nto be enhanced the greater the competition. The freer the trade around \nthe world and the fairer the trade around the world, the more \nopportunities there are for our consumers to buy whatever they want to \nbuy, of the quality they want, at what they consider a fair price.\n  I don't know that any Member of this Congress who has been \ncomplaining about the unfavorable balance of trade has introduced any \nlegislation saying the consumers of America cannot buy this product or \nthat product. Are they going to tell the consumers of North Dakota what \nthey can buy or not buy? Are they going to certify to their people that \ntheir judgment as political leaders is better than the judgment of the \nconsumer of America and the marketplace, including the consumer of \nNorth Dakota? I don't see them doing that.\n  The other thing is, why do we have an unfavorable balance of trade? \nOne of the reasons is the people of America are not saving as much. But \nwhat do we get from the other side of the aisle when it comes to giving \nthe taxpayers of America an opportunity to have more discretionary \nincome? We hear complaints from the other side of the aisle that this \nside of the aisle is giving too many tax cuts because they happen to \nbelieve that 535 Members of Congress are smarter and better able to \ndecide how to spend the money than the 130 million taxpayers of \nAmerica. I don't believe that. But when taxes are high, there is less \ndiscretion for savings, and it impacts negatively upon our balance of \ntrade.\n  The other thing I wonder about, with the other side of the aisle \ntalking about the high trade deficit--one-third of that trade deficit \ncomes from the importation of energy into America, mostly petroleum. We \nhad an energy bill up last November, and that energy bill is defeated \nby a filibuster on the other side of the aisle. When we want to set an \nenergy policy, so we import less energy, so we reduce our unfavorable \nbalance of trade to some extent, they deliver 13 out of 49 Democrats to \nbreak a filibuster. When they want to kill the confirmation of judges \nwho the President appoints, they can deliver 46 out of 49 Democrat \nvotes to kill those judges. But when their own leader votes for a \nmotion to bring about a national energy policy so we are not importing \nso much energy, so the balance of trade is not so unfavorable, what do \nwe get from the other side? They don't even support their own leader \nwhen he says he needs it for his State.\n  So don't complain about the unfavorable balance of trade in America \nwhen you espouse policies that tend to make it worse, or question the \nwisdom of the consumers of America, to put your judgment above the \njudgment of 280 million people in America, that you know more than they \ndo about what they ought to be doing with their money.\n  Now I want to address whether Congress is giving up constitutional \npower. I am addressing specifically the accusation that has been made \nby the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad, who just finished his \nremarks. First of all, I have yet to see the memo obtained by Senator \nConrad from the Congressional Research Service which he says supports \nhis claim that his amendment could be made constitutional. But in any \nevent, with respect to his argument that one way to implement his \namendment in a constitutional fashion would be in the statement of \nadministrative action--and it is on that point that I want to comment--\nthis is precisely the type of revisionist history that I warned of \nearlier, yesterday, in our committee meeting.\n\n[[Page S8196]]\n\n  I read from the amendment that he put before the committee:\n\n       The amendment enhances the consultation requirement in the \n     waiver provisions by adding a requirement in paragraphs \n     202(c)(4) and 202(d)(5) that the Finance and the Ways and \n     Means Committees must both affirmatively approve a proposed \n     waiver before the USTR can waive the application of a \n     safeguard.\n\n  This amendment calls for specific changes to two sections of the \nimplementing legislation. How could language added, then, to the \nstatement of administrative action possibly effectuate this amendment, \nwhich calls for changes to the implementing bill? The answer is, very \nclearly it couldn't. But even if it could, this argument ignores the \nfact that the statement of administrative action is a statement of \nadministrative action, not a statement of congressional action. But the \namendment calls for action by two committees of Congress, not for \naction by the administration.\n  I would like to remind my colleague from North Dakota of the \nprinciple of separation of powers. In fact, that principle underlies \nthe Supreme Court Chadha case and is the reason why the amendment as \ndrafted and as voted on by the Finance Committee is unconstitutional. \nSo any argument that the statement of administrative action offered a \nway to implement the amendment in a constitutional way is without \nmerit.\n  What about the argument that the amendment could have been \nimplemented in a constitutional way if requirements for action by the \nfull Congress and presentation to the President for his signature were \nadded, according to the decision of Chadha? In effect, under this \ninterpretation, the amendment would require additional legislation to \nbe enacted before a beef safeguard measure could be waived. That is the \nonly way you could remain consistent with our Constitution. And it \nrequires a contorted reading of the language of the amendment that was \nactually introduced and was voted on by the committee that day.\n  But let us assume that a legislative procedure was intended by the \namendment, as contorted as that may be. The problem is, such a \nprocedure conflicts with the obligations assumed by the United States \nin annex 3(a) of the agreement. In sections (b)(4) and (c)(5) of annex \n3(a), the United States commits to retain the discretion not to apply a \nbeef safeguard measure.\n  If the President is required to wait for congressional action before \ngranting a waiver, that deprives the administration of the discretion \nto grant a waiver. Even if the amendment were to be implemented \nconsistent with the U.S. Constitution, it would at the same time be \ninconsistent with the terms of the agreement.\n  Again, we see this amendment for what it truly is. It was political \nmaneuvering, pure and simple. It was intended to obstruct the process. \nIt was intended to force the administration to explain its rejection of \nan unconstitutional amendment or, based on these new arguments about \nconstitutionality, the administration would be forced to explain its \nrejection of an amendment that was inconsistent with the agreement.\n  In either case, the administration's rejection of the amendment would \nhave been used by some to argue that the trade promotion authority \nprocess was flawed, that the administration ignored the will of the \nFinance Committee.\n  They would have also argued that the administration had not done \nenough to protect the U.S. beef industry from imports, an allegation \nthat is completely without merit if you read the terms of this \nagreement.\n  Any way that you revise the reading of the amendment, its purpose was \nto delay formal consideration of the bill and give opponents a \npolitical issue to try to exploit.\n  Again, as chairman of the Finance Committee, I did not want to see \nthat happen. I wanted to end the obstructionism, end the political \ngamesmanship, and end the consideration of an unconstitutional \namendment.\n  The majority of the committee voiced their will, and the amended \nrecommendation was not approved. The trade promotion authority process \nwas on and the process moved forward, leading us to the consideration \nof this very important legislation today, much in the economic \ninterests of our people.\n  Again, I call on my colleagues to recognize the value of the \nunderlying agreement with Australia and to support the implementation \nbill when we vote on it in a short period of time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will be brief. I thank my colleague \nfrom Iowa. I don't want to get into a debate about the Energy bill \nright now. We have our differences there. The only point I would make \nis, without six Members on his side of the aisle, we never would have \nsucceeded. It was not just this side of the aisle.\n  I definitely want to reduce energy dependence, as do most of my \ncolleagues. The bill had virtually no conservation, which many of us \nare for. I am for both new production and conservation. The bill had no \nconservation, and, of course, there is the ``e'' word which is very \ngood for Iowa but not so good for New York. I will not get into the \n``e'' word issue here. But there are different ways to increase \nconservation.\n  In the views of many of us, this bill was not a bill that would have \nreduced energy dependence the way it should have. Certainly, it didn't \nget much bang for the buck. I don't want to get into a debate with my \ncolleague. I know we all want to vote. I appreciate the sincerity and \neloquence which he brings to all of the debates. I enjoy having them \nwith him, but today we will not.\n  I rise reluctantly against the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement \nbefore us today, for one reason only. There have been other issues with \nthis agreement. In my State, we are very concerned about dairy. But I \nthink the people who put the agreement together were mindful of that. \nWhile the dairy farmers of New York State are not overwhelmingly \npleased with the provisions in the agreement, they believe they have \ncome a long way. I think the agreement does do some good for \nmanufacturing export, and I care about that. But what bothers me is one \nprovision in this agreement. It bothers me so that it leads me to vote \nagainst the agreement; that is, the provision dealing with the \nimportation of drugs.\n  It has become clear in recent weeks that the pharmaceutical industry \nhas not only done everything in its power to thwart drug reimportation \nlegislation before this Congress, but now they have hijacked the trade \nagreement negotiation process as well. That practice has to end.\n  Given that we have fast-tracked, many of us, when we see an odious \nprovision put into the agreement, have no choice but to vote it down \nand hope it will come back without that provision. Frankly, that \nprovision has very little to do with the guts of the Australia Free \nTrade Agreement. Prescription drug reimportation is a policy that has \ngained more and more bipartisan support as this year has progressed. My \nguess is that if, say, the bill from the Senator from North Dakota \nwould get a vote on the floor, it would pass. It would pass in a \nbipartisan way. That, of course, is because the cost of drugs is going \nthrough the roof, and it is harder and harder for our citizens to pay \nfor these miracle drugs. They are great drugs. I salute the \npharmaceutical industry for coming up with them.\n  But one of the great problems we face is that the research is borne \nnot by the citizens of the world but only by the citizens of the United \nStates, even though the drugs are sold throughout the world. We have to \ndo something to change that.\n  But as usually happens these days, as a proconsumer idea such as \nreimportation gains more and more momentum and support, the \npharmaceutical industry begins to see the writing on the wall, and they \nlook for every way possible to prevent it from becoming reality.\n  Now it seems, of all things, the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement \nhas become the perfect vehicle to begin the march to put the kibosh on \nimportation.\n  It is no longer enough that this administration refuses to stand up \nto PhRMA and negotiate lower drug prices.\n  The Medicare prescription drug bill, now law, that we have before us, \nis a failure. It is not even being mentioned by the President in his \ncampaign because they refuse to let Medicare negotiate with the \npharmaceutical industry\n\n[[Page S8197]]\n\nfor lower prices. That costs about $200 billion, and that means there \nwas not enough money to create a good program. But that is not enough.\n\n  Now that we have come up with another way to deal with the high cost \nof drugs, reimportation, the administration actively, through trade \nagreements, is helping the big drug companies ensure that they can get \nthe same exorbitant prices in every market around the globe, and at the \nsame time putting up a barrier around our borders to prevent lower drug \ncosts from coming in. That has gone too far.\n  The administration says it is unacceptable that foreign price \ncontrols leave American consumers paying most of the cost of \npharmaceutical research and development--I couldn't agree more. That \nhits the nail on the head.\n  We have to relieve U.S. consumers of some of the burdens of the cost \nof research and development by making sure that other equally developed \ncountries pay their fair share. But that is not what we are talking \nabout with the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement. Absolutely not.\n  What the administration is doing is giving the drug companies the \ntools to raise prices in other countries while pushing policies that \nkeep low drug costs out of this country.\n  Is that fair? Does that provide any relief to the American consumer? \nAbsolutely not.\n  I have heard the argument that this provision doesn't have a \npractical effect because the Australian Government doesn't allow the \nexportation of its drugs anyway.\n  First of all, if you look closely at the way it is written, it isn't \nlimited to restricting importation from Australia.\n  As they say in Shakespeare, there's the rub.\n  If they really were just concerned with Australia, they would say \nnothing in this provision would affect importation anywhere else. But \nthat is not the case.\n  This proposal creates an obligation for the United States to pass \nlaws that prohibit importation not just from Australia but from \neverywhere, including Canada.\n  If it truly doesn't have a practical effect, or if it is not \nreasonable to assume that Australia would hold us to our obligations--\nwho knows--for all we know, the Australian Government could make a deal \nwith the pharmaceutical company to lower their prices--why is the \nprovision in the agreement at all?\n  Why aren't pharmaceuticals at least exempted? Everyone knows what is \ngoing on in this Chamber about reimportation. Everyone knows what is \ngoing on in this country. In my State of New York, citizens from \nBuffalo, Rochester, the North Country, and even New York City get on \nbuses and go for hours to buy drugs in Canada.\n  If this provision has no practical effect in this trade agreement, \nthen its only purpose must be to make it more difficult to pass a drug \nimportation bill. It can and might become precedential--we have it in \nAustralia; we should put it elsewhere.\n  The provision was put in the Australia Free Trade Agreement to set a \nprecedent, to lay the groundwork. The Industry Advisory Committee to \nthe USTR on these issues has clearly stated this purpose. Their report \nstates that ``each individual FTA should be viewed as setting a new \nbaseline for future FTA/s''--that this should be setting a floor, not a \nceiling.\n  If that is the case, that is bad news for the millions of Americans \nwho must pay for prescription drugs and had hoped lower costs of \nimported drugs would prevail.\n  Simply put, this provision fortifies the administration's opposition \nto importation and makes the law that much harder to change. Beyond \nthat, this trade agreement may even affect our ability to negotiate \nprices in the few programs in which the Federal Government still has \nsome control.\n  The provision is nothing more than a backdoor opportunity to protect \nthe big pharmaceutical companies' profits and keep drug prices high for \nU.S. consumers. I have had some talks with the heads of the \npharmaceutical industries. Some of the more forward-looking progressive \nones realize that something has to give; that the U.S. consumer cannot \npay for the cost of research for drugs for the whole world; that the \nprices are getting so high that we have to do something; that the \nbalance between the dollars of profit that are put into research versus \nthe balance of dollars that are put into all kinds of salesmanship has \nto change. I hope those leaders in industry understand that putting \nthis provision in this agreement undercuts that kind of view.\n  The nature of trade agreements is changing. They are not just about \ntariffs anymore. They are getting into other substantive policy issues \nwhich dictate the parameters for health care delivery around the world.\n  These are fundamental policy decisions with serious implications for \naccess to affordable health care which can and will affect millions of \npeople both overseas and, of course, here at home. Yet PhRMA is the \nonly health care expert at the table for these negotiations. That has \nto end.\n  I also argue that adding provisions such as this, virtually \nextraneous provisions that come from someone else's agenda, and putting \nthem into trade agreements hurts the argument for fast track. This is \njust what people who are opposing fast track said would happen. Here it \nis, a year later, it has.\n  There are all kinds of questions swirling about how this trade \nagreement may affect Medicare, Medicaid, the VA, and DOD programs, and \nto be honest, no one seems to be able to explain what its effects on \nthese programs will be.\n  My view is we cannot, we must not wait until after these agreements \nare put together to consider their potential effects on U.S. policy. I \nwarn my colleagues, vote for this and then you find out that you have \nlocked yourself into something on drug policy that you never imagined. \nThis Member is not going to do that. This Senator is not going to do \nthat.\n  This provision can be stripped from the agreement and we can come \nback and pass it next week, next month. We cannot have it as an \nafterthought--something we are all scrambling to understand the day \nbefore the vote.\n  Frankly, drugs are not the same as tractors. There are huge public \nhealth implications to the decisions made by the USTR. It is \nfrightening to think these decisions are being made without the input \nof a neutral public health advisory committee. We have to put an end to \nthe practice of PhRMA inserting provisions into trade agreements that \naffect policy elsewhere. There must be someone at the table to protect \naccess to affordable drugs and other health care in this country. The \nrisks are too great to ignore.\n  For that reason, I will vote no on this agreement in the hopes we can \nstrip out this odious provision and then move forward with the proposal \nwhich I will then support.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a related article from the New York \nTimes be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 12, 2004]\n\n            Trade Pact May Undercut Inexpensive Drug Imports\n\n                 (By Elizabeth Becker and Robert Pear)\n\n       Washington, July 11.--Congress is poised to approve an \n     international trade agreement that have the effect of \n     thwarting a goal pursued by many lawmakers of both parties: \n     the import of inexpensive prescription drugs to help millions \n     of Americans without health insurance.\n       The agreement, negotiated with Australia by the Bush \n     administration, would allow pharmaceutical companies to \n     prevent imports of drugs to the United States and also to \n     challenge decisions by Australia about what drugs should be \n     covered by the country's health plan, the prices paid for \n     them and how they can be used.\n       It represents the administration's model for strengthening \n     the protection of expensive brand-name drugs in wealthy \n     countries, where the biggest profits can be made.\n       In negotiating the pact, the United States, for the first \n     time, challenged how a foreign industrialized country \n     operates its national health program to provide inexpensive \n     drugs to its own citizens. Americans without insurance pay \n     some of the world's highest prices for brand-name \n     prescription drugs, in part because the United States does \n     not have such a plan.\n       Only in the last few weeks have lawmakers realized that the \n     proposed Australia trade agreement--the Bush administration's \n     first free trade agreement with a developed country--could \n     have major implications for health policy and programs in the \n     United States.\n       The debate over drug imports, an issue with immense \n     political appeal, has been raging for four years, with little \n     reference to the arcane details of trade policy. Most trade\n\n[[Page S8198]]\n\n     agreements are so complex that lawmakers rarely investigate \n     all the provisions, which typically cover such diverse areas \n     as manufacturing, tourism, insurance, agriculture and, \n     increasingly, pharmaceuticals.\n       Bush administration officials oppose legalizing imports of \n     inexpensive prescription drugs, citing safety concerns. \n     Instead, with strong backing from the pharmaceutical \n     industry, they have said they want to raise the price of \n     drugs overseas to spread the burden of research and \n     development that is borne disproportionately by the United \n     States.\n       Many Democrats, with the support of AARP, consumer groups \n     and a substantial number of Republicans, are promoting \n     legislation to lower drug costs by importing less expensive \n     medicines from Europe, Canada, Australia, Japan and other \n     countries where prices are regulated through public health \n     programs.\n       These two competing approaches represent very different \n     ways of helping Americans who typically pay much more for \n     brand-name prescription drugs than people in the rest of the \n     industrialized world.\n       Leaders in both houses of Congress hope to approve the free \n     trade agreement in the next week or two. Last Thursday, the \n     House Ways and Means Committee endorsed the pact, which \n     promises to increase American manufacturing exports by as \n     much as $2 billion a year and preserve jobs here.\n       Health advocates and officials in developing countries have \n     intensely debated the effects of trade deals on the ability \n     of poor nations to provide inexpensive generic drugs to their \n     citizens, especially those with AIDS.\n       But in Congress, the significance of the agreement for \n     health policy has generally been lost in the trade debate.\n       The chief sponsor of the Senate bill, Senator Byron L. \n     Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, said: ``This administration \n     opposes re-importation even to the extent of writing barriers \n     to it into its trade agreements. I don't understand why our \n     trade ambassador is inserting this prohibition into trade \n     agreements before Congress settles the issue.''\n       Senator John McCain, an author of the drug-import bill, \n     sees the agreement with Australia as hampering consumers' \n     access to drugs from other countries. His spokesman said the \n     senator worried that ``it only protects powerful special \n     interests.''\n       Gary C. Hufbauer, a senior analyst at the Institute for \n     International Economics, said ``the Australia free trade \n     agreement is a skirmish in a larger war'' over how to reduce \n     the huge difference in prices paid for drugs in the United \n     States and the rest of the industrialized world.\n       Kevin Outterson, an associate law professor at West \n     Virginia University, agreed.\n       ``The United States has put a marker down and is now using \n     trade agreements to tell countries how they can reimburse \n     their own citizens for prescription drugs,'' he said.\n       The United States does not import any significant amount of \n     low-cost prescription drugs from Australia, in part because \n     federal laws effectively prohibit such imports. But a number \n     of states are considering imports from Australia and Canada, \n     as a way to save money, and American officials have made \n     clear that the Australia agreement sets a precedent they hope \n     to follow in negotiations with other countries.\n       Trade experts and the pharmaceutical industry offer no \n     assurance that drug prices will fall in the United States if \n     they rise abroad.\n       Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, the senior \n     Democrat on the panel's trade subcommittee, voted for the \n     agreement, which could help industries in his state. But Mr. \n     Levin said the trade pact would give a potent weapon to \n     opponents of the drug-import bill, who could argue that \n     ``passing it would violate our international obligations.''\n       Such violations could lead to trade sanctions costing the \n     United States and its exporters millions of dollars.\n       One provision of the trade agreement with Australia \n     protects the right of patent owners, like drug companies, to \n     ``prevent importation'' of products on which they own the \n     patents. Mr. Dorgan's bill would eliminate this right.\n       The trade pact is ``almost completely inconsistent with \n     drug-import bills'' that have broad support in Congress, Mr. \n     Levin said.\n       But Representative Bill Thomas, the California Republican \n     who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said, ``The \n     only workable procedure is to write trade agreements \n     according to current law.''\n       For years, drug companies have objected to Australia's \n     Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, under which government \n     officials decide which drugs to cover and how much to pay for \n     them. Before the government decides whether to cover a drug, \n     experts analyze its clinical benefits, safety and ``cost \n     effectiveness,'' compared with other treatments.\n       The trade pact would allow drug companies to challenge \n     decisions on coverage and payment.\n       Joseph M. Damond, an associate vice president of the \n     Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said \n     Australia's drug benefit system amounted to an unfair trade \n     practice.\n       ``The solution is to get rid of these artificial price \n     controls in other developed countries and create real \n     marketplace incentives for innovation,'' Mr. Damond said.\n       While the trade pact has barely been noticed here, it has \n     touched off an impassioned national debate in Australia, \n     where the Parliament is also close to approving it.\n       The Australian trade minister, Mark Vaile, promised that \n     ``there is nothing in the free trade agreement that would \n     increase drug prices in Australia.''\n       But a recent report from a committee of the Australian \n     Parliament saw a serious possibility that ``Australians would \n     pay more for certain medicines,'' and that drug companies \n     would gain more leverage over government decisions there.\n       Bush administration officials noted that the Trade Act of \n     2002 said its negotiators should try to eliminate price \n     controls and other regulations that limit access to foreign \n     markets.\n       Dr. Mark B. McClellan, the former commissioner of food and \n     drugs now in charge of Medicare and Medicaid, said last year \n     that foreign price controls left American consumers paying \n     most of the cost of pharmaceutical research and development, \n     and that, he said, was unacceptable.\n\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the United States-Australia Free Trade \nAgreement negotiated by the administration is not perfect. The \ndistinguished chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee \nwould agree with me on that point.\n  It is often said around here that we should not let the perfect be \nthe enemy of the good. This agreement for which we vote on implementing \nlegislation today passes the ``good'' test, but barely.\n  Throughout my career in public service, I have been an ardent \nsupporter of free trade. Opening markets to the free flow of goods and \nservices benefits America, benefits our trading partners. Trade \nliberalization creates jobs, expands economic growth, and provides \nconsumers with access to lower cost goods and services. The North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement, despite criticism from some, has \nincreased our cross-border trade between our northern and southern \nneighbors by incredible amounts of money, creating economic growth and \nprosperity on both sides of the border.\n  In my judgment, free trade should mean truly free trade. There are \nsome portions of this agreement which take admirable steps in that \ndirection. For example, over 99 percent of the manufactured goods \ntraded between our two countries--manufactured goods--will be duty and \nquota free and textile and apparel tariffs will be phased out.\n  According to the International Trade Commission, U.S. consumers will \nreceive a net welfare benefit increase of between $438 million and $639 \nmillion if the agreement is fully implemented.\n  Ideally, this free-trade agreement would reach 100-percent duty-free \ntreatment and tariff elimination immediately but I recognize that may \nnot be possible.\n  What I find truly offensive are protections for special interests \nsuch as dairy, beef, and sugar. Even these protections, however, pale \nin comparison with the language in this agreement that covers patented \npharmaceutical products.\n  I am astonished by the decision of the U.S. Trade Representative, Mr. \nZoellick, for whom I happen to have the greatest admiration and \nappreciation. I am astonished that he would include language which \nwould impair our ability to pass and implement drug importation \nlegislation.\n  The Singapore Free Trade Agreement, which went into effect on January \n1, was the first free-trade agreement to include language that could \nimpact drug importation. In a side letter of understanding between our \nrespective Trade Representatives, both nations agreed the language \nwould not prevent Singapore from engaging in the parallel importation \nof pharmaceuticals. Thus, the U.S. Trade Representative effectively \nmade the provisions applicable only to the United States.\n  USTR claims this language is consistent with longstanding U.S. patent \nlaw. If that is indeed the case, and if Singapore is not obligated to \nabide by the language, then why is the language included in the \nagreement? I suspect it was included in order to protect powerful \nspecial interests and to provide a template on which to base \nintellectual property provisions in future free-trade agreements.\n  In fact, the Industry Sector Advisory Committee for Chemicals and \nAllied Products, which advised U.S. negotiators on this provision, \nstated that this language ``should not be viewed as setting any \nceilings for the intellectual\n\n[[Page S8199]]\n\nproperty chapters for future free-trade agreements; rather, each \nindividual free-trade agreement should be viewed as setting a new \nbaseline for future free-trade agreements.''\n  This pharmaceutical language was slipped into the Singapore FTA below \nthe radar screen, without recognition of its potential implications for \ndrug importation. Since that time, similar drug provisions have cropped \nup again in both the Australia FTA before us and the recently completed \nMorocco FTA.\n  Let's be clear about this language. It is antithetical to the spirit \nof free trade and serves only to block American consumers from \naccessing lower cost goods and services.\n  Not only does the intellectual property language in the Australia FTA \noffend all free traders, it also contravenes clear congressional \nintent. Let's look at the facts. In 2000, Congress passed the Medicine \nEquity and Drug Safety Act, MEDS Act, to allow American consumers to \nimport lower cost prescription drugs from 25 industrialized countries \nwith regulatory systems similar to ours. Although language added to \nthat law acted as a poison pill and effectively prevented importation \nfrom taking place, congressional intent was crystal clear: We want to \nallow Americans to import safe prescription drugs.\n  In the years after the MEDS Act passed, the cost of prescription \ndrugs has continued to rise, the number of uninsured Americans has \ncontinued to grow, and Congress has continued to debate the issue of \ndrug importation. This week, a study from Boston University found that \ndrug spending, as a share of income, rose by 50 percent between 1998 \nand 2002.\n  In the last 3 years, several additional importation measures have \npassed both Houses of Congress with substantial bipartisan support. In \nStates, cities, and counties across the country, governments are \nimplementing programs that would allow their residents to import lower \ncost prescription drugs. Today, approximately two-thirds of Americans \nbelieve they should be able to import lower cost drugs.\n  Where does this leave us? Congress has repeatedly voted, with \nbipartisan majorities, to allow drug importation. States and local \ngovernments are doing the same. An overwhelming majority of Americans \nbelieve they have a right to import cheaper medicine. AARP, the leading \nadvocacy group for senior citizens, recently joined the battle.\n  So a simple question comes to mind: What is our U.S. Trade \nRepresentative, who is charged with representing the interests of the \nAmerican people, doing? Why deliberately include language in bilateral \ntrade agreements that could thwart importation efforts? Why flagrantly \ndisregard the intent of Americans and their elected representatives? It \nseems to me that the special interests have found friendly territory.\n  Now, supporters of this language will claim that nothing in this \nagreement prevents the Congress from passing legislation with respect \nto drug importation. They are absolutely correct. No trade agreement \ncan prevent Congress from exercising its constitutional right to pass \nlaws that govern our Nation. However, the language in this trade \nagreement does tie the hands of Congress, further complicating our \nefforts to pass a drug importation law.\n  The USTR general counsel, John Veroneau, testified along these lines \nlast month. He told the House Ways and Means Committee that new \nlegislation on drug importation ``could give rise to an inconsistency \nbetween U.S. law and a commitment under this trade agreement.'' Given \nthat similar language is now in not one but three trade agreements, it \nwill presumably present the same problem for each.\n  Let's be intellectually honest here. It is simply bad policy to enter \ninto bilateral agreements knowing we want to modify domestic law and \nthereby place ourselves in violation of these various agreements. \nImagine Americans' response if they knew that domestic health care \npolicy was being crafted not by their elected officials in Congress \nbut, instead, by free-trade negotiators.\n\n  Now that this language is in three agreements, a precedent has been \nestablished for future FTAs. Indeed, USTR officials have indicated they \nintend to pursue similar language in all future FTAs. This means that \nfuture drug importation legislation will leave us in violation of our \nobligations to an ever greater number of trading partners and allies, \nundoubtedly creating a greater challenge to enacting and implementing \nimportation law.\n  When Americans wonder how this continues to happen, maybe they should \ntake a glance at the list of intellectual property ``advisors'' who \nworked with the negotiators. These advisors include representatives \nfrom--guess who--drug companies--guess who--the pharmaceutical industry \nas a whole, and other lobbyists with a direct interest in blocking drug \nimportation. How many public health and consumer advocacy groups were \nincluded on this committee? Zero.\n  There is a popular philosophy among coaches known as game slippage \nwhich offers that you can make your team practice all you want, but, \ninvariably, come gametime, some of what was taught in practice will not \nbe applied during the game. I fear the administration is suffering from \ngame slippage. It appears that Congress's intent over the last several \nyears to address drug importation has slipped from the collective \nconscience of the administration and the U.S. Trade Representative when \nnegotiating gametime comes around.\n  Our trade negotiators must be less mindful of special interests and \nmore responsive to the express intent of the Congress. We granted the \nPresident trade promotion authority in 2002 to demonstrate our Nation's \nreenergized commitment to negotiating strong free-trade agreements. TPA \nwas designed to lead to free trade, not more protection. Yet we have \nprotectionist measures in this FTA for the pharmaceutical, sugar, beef, \nand dairy industries that will likely result in higher prices and, in \nsome cases, less supply.\n  This agreement is not the first in which the administration has made \nuse of TPA to promote its legislative priorities. Last year, \nimmigration provisions were included in the Singapore and Chile FTAs. \nIf the administration is to continue to enjoy the privilege of TPA, \ntrade agreements must no longer be vehicles that include items \nrightfully addressed by Congress under the Constitution.\n  The United States has been and should be the leading promoter of an \nopen global marketplace. Steel tariffs, agricultural subsidies in the \nfarm bill, and other forms of protection, however, have damaged \nAmerica's free-trade credentials. If special interest carve-outs, as \nthe one for the pharmaceutical industry in this FTA, continue to \npollute our trade agreements, we will all be worse off. Our economy \nwill suffer and our leadership role on trade will further decline.\n  I have spoken at length about the very serious drawbacks of the \nAustralia FTA. I will reluctantly support this implementing legislation \nbecause it, nevertheless, will have a net positive impact on the \nAmerican economy. I also will vote for it because of my profound \nrespect for the Government and the people of Australia. They have \nbravely stood by us for many decades and have shown enormous courage in \nhelping us to fight the global war on terror. We are privileged to call \nthe Australian people friends, and my comments here today should in no \nway reflect poorly on the proud nation with which we will embark on a \nnew trading relationship.\n\n  Mr. President, I will vote yes. But the administration must \nunderstand that continuing down a protectionist path harms American \nconsumers and engenders ill will among our allies and trading partners. \nI support passage of this legislation, but should another FTA being \nnegotiated now or in the future come before the Senate with similar \nprotections for special interests, I will find it extremely difficult \nto do so again.\n\n\n                            FSC/ETI Tax Bill\n\n  Mr. President, before I continue, I would like to mention just a word \nabout the FSC/ETI tax bill that we apparently have an agreement to go \nto conference.\n  The June 19 editorial in the Washington Times, not known for liberal \npropaganda, stated:\n\n       The ideal solution would have been a quick, simple repeal \n     of FSC-ETI, which is bad economic policy in any case. . . .\n\n  Unfortunately, both the House and the Senate versions of the bill \nbecame magnets for special interests. A steady train of lobbyists \ntacked on $167 billion\n\n[[Page S8200]]\n\nin tax breaks over the next 10 years to the Senate bill, while the \nHouse bill expanded by $143 billion in similar additions. The Senate \nbill, for example, includes breaks for NASCAR racetracks and foreign \ndog-race gamblers, while the House version lavishes its attention upon \ntobacco growers, timber owners and alcohol distillers. The imminent \nHouse-Senate conference, predictably, promises to be a de facto food \nfight between congressmen, lobbyists and tax watchdogs. And so while \nthe lobbyists duke it out, EU sanctions will continue to rise, and \nAmerican manufacturers and the U.S. economy will deal with the \nconsequences.\n  There are many other editorials about how incredible this bill has \nbecome and how we have lost any possible sense of what we are doing to \nour deficit and to the American people. If we pass this bill in its \npresent form, I will do whatever I can to make sure every American \nknows what we have done here for the special interests in this town. \nDespite the passage of campaign finance reform, they rule in a way \nwhich is almost unprecedented at least in the 22 years I have been a \nMember of Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there is an order in effect allowing 2 \nminutes per side on the matter that will follow the Australia Free \nTrade Agreement, the tobacco amendment. I ask unanimous consent that \nthere be a total of 4 minutes on each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object, when would this time \nbegin?\n  Mr. REID. I would say through the Chair to my friend, we are going to \nvote immediately on the free-trade agreement. We yield back any time on \nthis side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield back time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the third reading and \npassage of the bill.\n  The bill (H.R. 4759) was ordered to a third reading and was read the \nthird time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to support the United States-\nAustralia Free Trade Agreement. I do so because it is good for the \ncause of free and fair trade, it is good for the United States, and it \nis good for Utah.\n  I wish to commend my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee, \nparticularly Chairman Grassley and ranking minority member Baucus. They \nhave assiduously worked with the administration to complete the \nlegislation implementing years of negotiations. Working with our \ncolleagues on the Ways and Means Committee, we have prepared \nlegislation that, I believe, will pass overwhelmingly in both Houses. \nThat it does so reflects on the strengths of this agreement, and on the \nhard work of members in both committees. To date, the process for \nputting this agreement in place has been fair. Members have been given \nample opportunity to voice any concerns they may have about the \nsubstance of this agreement both on the Senate floor and in briefings \nwith the U.S. Trade Representative's office. No one can legitimately \nsay this has been a partisan process. No one can legitimately say they \nhave not had a chance to review and comment on this historic agreement.\n  However, this agreement would not have been completed had Congress \nfailed to provide the President with fast-track trade promotion \nauthority. These agreements are complex, and the interests are vast, \nand, as we know, Congress can slow the process by endlessly nitpicking \ndetails for political advantage. Without trade promotion authority \ngranted by a majority of this body to the President in 2002, the \nPresident would have failed to advance his agenda of creating American \njobs by leveraging the strength of our economy into free and fair trade \nregimes created by us.\n  Toward that last point, I wish to commend the small team at the \nUnited States Trade Representative's Office, led by the extremely able \nRobert Zoellick, for their work through these years in advancing the \nPresident's free trade agenda. The Australia Free Trade Agreement \nbefore the Senate will boost our economy while advancing bilateral \nrelations with our strongest partner in Asia as a result of the \ndedication of Bob Zoellick and the people at USTR.\n  Australia stood with us in our foreign policy challenges throughout \nthe 20th century. In the beginning of this century, which was marked so \nsoon after by the attacks of September 11, and our response with the \nglobal war on terror and the war to destroy the regime of Saddam \nHussein, Australia has continued to stand with us. We have a history of \nfriendship, based on shared civic values of democracy, individual \nfreedom and free markets. We have no closer ally in Asia.\n  Of course this is not a sufficient reason to grant a free trade \nagreement, or FTA. The necessary and sufficient agreements in granting \nFTAs have to do with opening markets in a way that will fairly allow \nU.S. products to compete. I am pleased to observe that in this area, \nthe Australia FTA does a superb job. In fact, the Australia FTA \neliminates 99 percent of Australia's manufacturing tariffs immediately, \ngiving U.S. firms an average 5 percent price advantage over \ninternational competitors in the Australian market. As well, the FTA \ngrants tariff-free access to Australia's agricultural market for U.S. \nexporters, grants enhanced preferential access to U.S. services \nexporters to Australia, and removes foreign investment screening for \nseveral types of U.S. investment.\n  For my home State, this FTA gives Utah businesses a distinct \nadvantage over their international rivals when trading with Australia. \nAustralia's market is the 12th largest market for Utah goods, with \ntotal exports valued at over $67 million in 2003. The implementation of \nthe Australia FTA will provide a large boost to Utah's auto parts, \nprocessed foods, sports equipment and medical equipment companies. \nThese important and large industries within the State of Utah will now \nbe able to export 99 percent of their goods to without facing \nmanufacturing tariffs, this gives them, on average, a 5 percent price \nadvantage over international competitors in the Australian market.\n  There are nine Australian-owned companies currently operating in Utah \nwhich insource several hundred jobs for Utahns. In all, there are over \n320 jobs in Utah that are directly supported by trade with Australia, \nand hundreds more that are indirectly supported by Australian trade.\n  No agreement is perfect, whether it is with a developing economy, or \na modern and developed economy, like Australia's. This FTA will provide \nan immediate opening to Australia's large market for agricultural \nproducts from our States. Currently, our prolific U.S. agricultural \nproducers export more than $400 million in products to Australia.\n  In terms of granting access for Australian beef, the agreement allows \nfor us to increase the beef import quota over an 18-year period. Quota \nincreases to be granted in the first 3 years are conditional upon U.S. \nbeef exports reaching 2003 levels, so that Australian beef exporters \nwill not be able to exploit recent drops in U.S. beef exports caused by \nthe mad cow scare. While quotas within tariffs will be removed, above-\nquota tariffs will also be phased out over time. The Congressional \nResearch Service reports that ``initial quota increases represent an \nestimated $50 million in additional imports--less than \\1/4\\ of 1 \npercent of the value of annual U.S. beef output, and 1.6 percent of the \nvalue of U.S. beef imports.'' In addition, the agreement provides \nsafeguards that will protect U.S. beef producers from surges in imports \nfrom Australia. These safeguards are permanent and apply to the \ntransition periods, as well as after the transition periods.\n\n[[Page S8201]]\n\n  This agreement is going to be good for the American economy. In \naddition to manufacturing and agricultural products, it provides an \nimmediate opening in Australian markets for financial services, \nelectronic commerce and U.S. investment. In the latter category, we \nshould appreciate the implications of allowing U.S. investment to now \nuse Australia as a base for greater expansion into the rapidly growing \nAsian markets. The benefits of this FTA to the U.S. economy equate to \nabout $500 million per year. This translates into more U.S. jobs.\n  And, for me, this is the bottom line. Economic policymakers both in \nCongress and in President Bush's administration recognize that the most \nfundamental goal of economic policy is to support the economy and \ncreate American jobs. American workers, farmers and cattlemen are the \nmost industrious and productive in the world. That is why, as the U.S. \nhas expanded trade regimes based on the principles of fairness and \ntransparency that define our economy, the U.S. has always been a net \nwinner. The rest of the world wants to buy our goods because they are \nthe best quality at the most affordable prices. The rest of the world \nwants to sell in our markets, because to do so, they must create \nproducts that compete in the most open and efficient market in the \nworld. Successful U.S. free trade agreements protect our principles, \nadvance our values, and provide opportunity for all those who compete \nfairly. And fair competition is something the citizens of Utah support. \nFor these reasons and more I support the swift approval of this \nimplementing legislation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the United \nStates-Australia Free Trade Agreement. I maintain reservations about \ncertain sections of this agreement, but overall I believe that this \nfree-trade agreement succeeds in lowering tariffs on American goods \nentering Australia and will benefit my home State of Illinois.\n  The United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement, FTA, includes \nstrong and comprehensive commitments by Australia to open their goods, \nagricultural and services markets to U.S. producers. The agreement \nwould reduce a number of tariffs and duties currently affecting trade \nbetween the United States and Australia, reduce barriers for services \nand increase protections for intellectual property.\n  Under the trade agreement, as ratified by the bill, more than 99 \npercent of U.S. exports of manufactured goods to Australia would become \nduty-free immediately upon entry into force of the agreement. This is \ngood for our country because increasing exports means more jobs here at \nhome. This is beneficial to U.S. manufacturers, who expect to realize \nan additional $2 billion in exports a year.\n  Australia is a major trade and investment partner of the U.S. and is \nthe ninth largest market for the export of U.S. goods, with a total \ntrade close to $28 billion last year. Australia purchases more goods \nfrom the U.S. than any other country, and the U.S. enjoys a bilateral \ntrade surplus of $9 billion. This is quite a difference from the $130 \nbillion dollar trade deficit we have with China.\n  My home State of Illinois will benefit from the U.S.-Australia FTA. \nIn 2003, Illinois' export shipments of merchandise to Australia totaled \n$925 million and Australia is the sixth largest export market for \nIllinois in 2003. Australia is an important market for Illinois goods \nas Illinois exports to Australia have grown significantly during a time \nwhen Illinois exports have fallen. While exports of goods from Illinois \nto Australia grew 12 percent over the 1999-2003 period, exports from \nthe States to the world declined 10 percent over the same time.\n  Illinois exports range from agricultural and construction machinery, \nto engines, turbines and power transmission equipment, to motor vehicle \nparts, to general purpose machinery and to agricultural products. In \nshort, people through nearly every sector of our economy will benefit \nfrom this agreement.\n  Illinois has lost 140,000 manufacturing jobs since January 2001 to \nmany countries who do not have the same labor and environmental \nstandards as the U.S. However, labor and environment have not been a \nsource of controversy in this FTA. The Australian and U.S. economies \nare both modern and industrialized, and are at similar levels of \ndevelopment and environmental standards. In fact, Australia has a \nhigher minimum wage than the U.S.\n  This agreement also extends protections for all forms of intellectual \nproperty rights. Australia agrees to extend the longevity of copyrights \nin order to accord protections to existing U.S. standards. Both \ncountries also agree to ratify two international treaties involving \nrecorded music and copyrights.\n  This agreement also gives our farmers new opportunities. All U.S. \nagricultural exports to Australia totaling more than $400 million will \nreceive immediate duty-free access. Key agricultural products that will \nbenefit from immediate tariff elimination include soybeans and oilseed \nproducts, fresh and processed fruits, vegetables and nuts, and pork \nproducts.\n  In addition, Australia also agreed to resolve outstanding sanitary \nand phytosanitary, SPS, disputes, chiefly affecting U.S. pork, citrus \nand corn. Since conclusion of the negotiations, Australia has taken \nsteps to lift the SPS barrier against U.S. pork. This is good news for \nthe many pork producers in Illinois.\n  While some of the provisions in these FTAs could serve as a model for \nother agreements, a number of provisions clearly cannot be, nor should \nthey be. I believe that each country with whom we negotiate is unique; \nand while the provisions contained in the Australia FTA work for \nAustralia, they may not be appropriate for FTAs with other countries, \nwhere there may exist very different circumstances.\n  Concerns about labor and environmental standards, however, should \nreceive careful scrutiny on a case-by-case basis as different \ncircumstances and situations warrant. Use of the ``enforce your own \nlaw'' standard is invalid as a precedent--indeed is a contradiction to \nthe purpose of promoting enforceable core labor standards--when a \ncountry's laws clearly do not reflect international standards and when \nthere is a history, not only of nonenforcement, but of a hostile \nenvironment towards the rights of workers to organize and bargain \ncollectively. Using a standard in totally different circumstances will \nlead to totally different results. Many of us support the Australia \nFree Trade Agreement not only because they have good labor laws, but \nbecause they have the ability and willingness to enforce them.\n  I also noted that all commodities were not included in this FTA and \nthat sugar was excluded. This exclusion should not be a precedent for \nfuture trade agreements as this could inhibit other export-oriented \nindustries from their opportunity to win market access in future FTAs.\n  Without a doubt, there are parts of this agreement that I feel are \nless than perfect. This agreement has one very troublesome aspect to \nit, which has U.S. pharmaceutical industry fingerprints all over it.\n  This agreement gives the exclusive right of a patent holder to \nprevent the importation of a patented product without the consent of \nthe patent holder.\n  By including this provision in this agreement, the ban on \nreimportation of prescription drugs into the United States becomes more \nthan just a U.S. law, it becomes a matter of trade law.\n  That means that we are giving another country the right to challenge \nus if we pass the important Dorgan-Snowe bill allowing Americans to \nreimport prescription drugs from other countries, many of which have \ncheaper prices than the U.S. for the same drugs.\n  Congress is currently considering several bills to allow Americans to \nsafely reimport prescription drugs from other countries. In fact, there \nwas just a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee about this issue \nand the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee will \nmark up a proposal next week.\n  Why then is the trade negotiator for the Bush administration \nnegotiating an issue that is being actively debated in Congress? \nAllowing this language in this agreement is effectively end-running the \nlegislative branch.\n  On July 23, John Veroneau, general counsel for the Office of the U.S. \nTrade Representative, confirmed that new\n\n[[Page S8202]]\n\nlegislation on drug reimportation ``could give rise to an inconsistency \nbetween U.S. law and a commitment under this trade agreement.''\n  Once again, the Bush administration has chosen big pharmaceutical \ncompanies over the American people. Prescription drug prices are rising \nbetween 14 and 19 percent per year, making already expensive drugs \nunaffordable for some. As Congress searches for solutions, the Bush \nadministration is preserving the protections from international price \ncompetition for the prescription drug industry.\n  Further, this agreement may jeopardize the lower prices the Veterans \nAdministration and Medicaid are currently able to negotiate. Under \nArticle 15.11 of the agreement, ``suppliers'' have the right to \nchallenge VA procurement decisions, including listing and pricing \npharmaceuticals.\n  I do think, because of the positive provisions in this FTA relating \nto manufacturing, agriculture services, that we should approve this \nagreement. However, my vote for the Australia FTA should not be \ninterpreted as support for using this agreement as a model for future \ntrade negotiations. I will evaluate all future trade agreements on \ntheir merits and their applicability to each country. We need to ensure \nthat core international labor rights and environmental standards are \naddressed in a meaningful manner and the rights of American consumers \nare protected.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, the writing appears to be on the wall where \nthe U.S. Australia Free Trade Agreement is concerned. I suspect it will \npass this body by a substantial margin. Still, I want to take a few \nmoments to reflect on this agreement and what it may mean for \nWisconsin.\n  Wisconsin has about 16,000 dairy farms. Altogether, production and \nprocessing activities in the state generate close to $20 billion in \neconomic activity. Dairy accounts for about 200,000 Wisconsin jobs. I \ncould go on at length, but my colleagues already know that I care \ndeeply about Wisconsin agriculture and the families who depend on \ndairy.\n  And that is why I will vote against the U.S.-Australia Free Trade \nAgreement. While the final agreement maintains over-quota tariffs on \ndairy products, I remain very concerned that the overall effect on \ndairy farmers will be negative, particularly as it affects cheese \nmarkets which are of critical importance to Wisconsin dairy.\n  I am also concerned that this agreement sets up roadblocks for us to \npass legislation that would allow Americans to buy less expensive \nprescription drugs from other countries. It includes a provision that \nprotects the current right of drug companies to prevent importation of \nits patented drugs by other parties, in this case, parties in \nAustralia.\n  I understand that his provision will have no practical effect in \nAustralia, since Australian law already prohibits drug exports. \nHowever, I am concerned about the dangerous precedence this sets. A \nbipartisan majority in Congress supports legislation to allow drug \nimportation from other countries, and I believe that at some point, it \nwill be the law of the land.\n  Even though it may not matter for Australia, the United States will \nlikely seek trade agreements with other countries in the future that do \nallow exports. The pharmaceutical industry must be put on notice that \nthis kind of end-run around the will of Congress is not acceptable. And \nthe administration must be put on notice that future trade agreements \nwill have a hard time getting approval if we see these kinds of \nprovisions again.\n  Trade negotiations, simply put, are nothing more than an elaborate \nprocess of setting priorities and making trade offs. Where the U.S.-\nAustralia trade agreement is concerned, it seems clear to me that U.S. \nnegotiators were willing to trade quite a bit away in order to protect \nand promote the interests of pharmaceutical manufacturers.\n  Unfortunately, dairy interests ended up on the wrong side of that \ndeal. And though we avoided disaster after several of us made a final \npush to get our negotiators to focus on the impact their deals could \nhave on our dairy industry, avoiding disaster is not enough to \nrecommend the final agreement. This implementing bill does not \nimprove--and probably harms--the chances for Wisconsin dairy producers \nto enhance their markets. As such, I cannot support it.\n  I believe in free and fair trade. But this bill implements neither of \nthose principles. The massive benefits won by the pharmaceutical \nindustry were not free, they were bought by concessions from other \nindustries, dairy and I am sure others of importance in my colleagues' \nStates. And the economic balance struck by the deal--where some favored \nindustries do well at the expense of others--is not fair. I urge my \ncolleagues to look carefully at the trade-offs this deal represents \nbefore casting your vote.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments by my \ncolleagues on the importance of U.S. beef and the impact upon it by \nthis Agreement. The U.S. cattle industry is a cornerstone of rural \nAmerica. Virtually every rural community in America is supported, in \nsome way, by domestic beef production. This is especially true in \nMontana, where cattle and beef account for 25 percent of our State's \neconomy. Nearly half of our State's economy depends on agriculture, \noverall. Since it's pretty tough to survive on one-half of an economy, \nit's easy to see how important this industry is to Montana. The cattle \nindustry creates thousands of jobs and supports thousands of families.\n  This is why I fought so hard to ensure that this agreement reflected \nthe particular needs and interests of Montana and U.S. cattlemen. When \nthe administration first indicated their intention to negotiate an \nagreement with Australia, I was frankly concerned. Australia is one of \nthe world's largest exporters of beef, offering a relatively small \nconsumer market in exchange for access to ours.\n  I was faced with a choice. I could oppose the agreement from the \nbeginning, or I could engage the process and try to forge as strong an \nagreement as possible. Opposing the agreement from the beginning would \nmean taking myself out of the process. At that point, I would be unable \nto best defend the interests of my constituents who had much at stake \nin the negotiations. Engaging the process would allow me a seat at the \ntable, and an opportunity to insist on provisions that preserve the \ninterests of Montana's cattlemen. Thus, engagement was the better \nchoice.\n  After nearly a year and a half of tough negotiations, including \ncountless meetings and conversations with U.S. negotiators, and \nAustralian officials, as well, I am satisfied that we got as good a \ndeal as we could. The agreement treats beef as a particularly sensitive \nproduct, taking into account the loss of U.S. global exports due to the \ndiscovery last year of BSE. It provides a long transition period for \nduty phase-out, and a slow, gradual increase in beef access to \nAustralia. Most importantly, the agreement creates two safeguards that \nare triggered automatically whenever the volume or price-based \nconditions are met.\n  While the administration is given authority to waive the application \nof a safeguard--if certain, rare conditions are met--I also worked with \nAmbassador Zoellick and his staff to establish procedural requirements \nthat must be met before a safeguard could be waived.\n  All in all, I am confident that the provisions in the agreement are \nstrong and adequate. Still, our efforts illustrate the importance of \nthese issues, not just for this FTA but for future agreements, as well. \nThe United States traditionally exports 10 percent of its beef \nproduction, and this figure was growing until our export markets were \nblocked in the wake of last December's discovery of a single dairy cow \ninfected with BSE.\n  Clearly, expanded trade is important to the U.S. cattle industry. \nYet, extreme distortions in global beef markets pose a serious threat \nto the future of U.S. ranchers. All the hard work in the world won't \namount to a hill of beans if we don't tackle the sources of these \ndistortions--such as massive subsidies, high tariffs, and the like. I \nask that a position paper, describing distortions in the global cattle \nand beef markets, be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S8203]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Grossly Distorted Global Cattle and Beef Markets--Harming U.S. Cattle \n and Beef Producers and Rural America: Immediate Steps Needed To Level \n                           the Playing Field\n\n\n                            i. introduction\n\n       The global market place for cattle and beef trade is \n     amongst the most heavily distorted of any sector of economic \n     activity. The distortions have seriously harmed US cattle \n     producers by reducing prices paid for U.S. product in the \n     U.S. and around the world and by limiting export \n     opportunities other than the United States for other major \n     producing nations. The domestic cattle industry suffered \n     staggering losses since the early 1990s measured in the \n     billions of dollars, with more than 100,000 cattle ranches \n     and farms ceasing operation or ceasing handling cattle in \n     that time. The decline of the cattle industry in America--the \n     largest part of American agriculture, has decimated rural \n     communities across the country which depend on a healthy \n     agricultural sector for survival.\n       While the United States market is very open (we are the \n     largest importing nation despite being the largest producing \n     nation and have very low tariffs on cattle and large volumes \n     of beef that enter duty free under a TRQ system) and is \n     characterized by little government support and science-based \n     sanitary and phytosanitary measures, this is not true of most \n     of the rest of the world. Our trading partners often employ \n     (1) high tariffs, (2) massive subsidies (for some), (3) \n     unscientific SPS measures, (4) misuse of state trading \n     enterprises in grains to artificially lower costs of \n     production in certain major exporting nations and (5) failure \n     to open markets even where FTAs have been negotiated through \n     the exclusion of large segments of agricultural trade \n     (including cattle and beef) in violation of WTO obligations \n     and requirements. Such actions ensure that many markets are \n     closed, US exports are limited and global export prices and \n     prices in the U.S. are lower than they would be in an \n     environment of harmonized tariff levels, elimination of \n     export and domestic subsidies and harmonized SPS standards.\n       While the European Union is the worst offender with \n     combination tariffs well north of 100% ad valorem, more than \n     $9.5 billion in subsidies to the sector and SPS measures that \n     have been found inconsistent with WTO obligations, they are \n     not alone. The U.S. government has estimated that bound \n     tariffs in the sector by our trading partners average 85%. \n     Subsidies are provided to expand exports and build up \n     industries in major producing nations, such as Australia, \n     Brazil, Canada as well as the EU. Two major trading partners, \n     Australia and Canada, have state-trading enterprises for \n     grains which are believed to distort prices for major inputs \n     to domestic cattle production in those countries. Indeed, the \n     Australian Wheat Board has acknowledged publicly that they do \n     so. Fifty-eight countries closed their markets in whole or \n     in part to U.S. exports after a single imported cow from \n     Canada was found in Washington state to have BSE and have \n     maintained restrictions without risk assessments to \n     justify such action and contrary to the international \n     standards established by the OIE. The result is \n     artificially high prices in major consuming markets like \n     Europe and Japan (in 2002 the average slaughter steer \n     price in the EU was $127.42/cwt and in Japan Holstein \n     steers sold at $171.57/cwt while U.S. steer prices never \n     went above $75/cwt in any month of the year) and \n     artificially low prices in open markets like the United \n     States. U.S. producers who are blessed with abundant land \n     and are highly educated and entrepreneurial are being \n     destroyed not because they are not competitive but because \n     the global market place is stacked against them.\n       While tariffs and subsidies are being negotiated as part of \n     the ongoing WTO Doha Development Round, it is critical that \n     the United States obtain parity for U.S. producers with both \n     developed and developing countries on these critical issues \n     through the negotiations. Based on discussions to date, such \n     parity is unlikely without a sectoral approach being adopted \n     for cattle and beef within the Doha Round.\n       Similarly, it is critical that other distortions be \n     eliminated through harmonization of SPS standards actually \n     applied by major consuming nations, that state trading \n     enterprises be eliminated (or forced to end their distortive \n     practices) and that countries not be allowed to maintain FTAs \n     where in fact substantially all trade is not covered.\n       Without such comprehensive actions, current efforts to \n     negotiate FTAs with many countries including most of the \n     major producing nations--but few of the major consuming \n     nations--has the potential perverse consequence of worsening \n     the position of U.S. cattle producers and the rural \n     communities which depend on them by further opening the U.S. \n     market without ensuring that U.S. producers (and other \n     producers) can compete in a non-distorted manner globally.\n       Finally, Congress has recognized that perishable products \n     like live cattle and beef need special rules included in \n     trade agreements to facilitate trade and provide the tools \n     necessary to address pricing or volume problems quickly when \n     they occur. The U.S.-Australia FTA includes such a provision \n     for beef. It is critical that every trade agreement (whether \n     bilateral, plurilateral or multilateral) have such special \n     rules and that they be applicable to cattle and beef and be \n     automatic in operation.\n\n\n                         II. GLOBAL DISTORTIONS\n\n     A. Tariffs\n       The United States allows various categories of beef to be \n     imported duty-free pursuant to free trade agreements (ex. \n     Mexico and Canada under NAFTA) and preferential treatment \n     programs (ex. Peru under Andean Trade Preference Act). Beef \n     from all other countries is subject to a Tariff Rate Quota \n     system and imports within the TRQ (covering 696,621 MT) are \n     subject to a tariff that is nearly zero. Import volume that \n     falls outside the TRQ is subject to a 26.4% duty. In \n     contrast, major consuming and several producing nations \n     maintain high tariffs and/or highly restrictive tariff-rate \n     quotas (TRQs) to limit market access, which limits both \n     export opportunities for U.S. producers, and leads to other \n     producing nations focusing on the same open beef markets like \n     the United States resulting in lower prices in the United \n     States than would otherwise be the case.\n\n                                                        COMPARISON 2003 EFFECTIVE TARIFFS ON BEEF\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   U.S.\n      Code                Description           effective              Japan                China       Jamaica       Korea        EU \\1\\       Turkey\n                                                   rate\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n020130..........

Subsidies\n       Major beef producing nations have lavished billions of \n     dollars in aid to support and expand beef productions in \n     their respective countries. For example, the EU is largest \n     agricultural subsidizer in the world, projected to spend over \n     $9.5 billion for both export and domestic subsidies on their \n     beef and cattle sectors in 2005. Likewise, Brazil has spent \n     hundreds of millions of dollars to expand their beef sector \n     through both domestic and export subsidies and is understood \n     to be more than doubling the amount of subsidies to \n     the sector in 2004 to roughly a half billion dollars. \n     Further, both Australia and Canada are engaged in \n     providing hundreds of millions of dollars in support to \n     their respective cattle and beef sectors in an effort to \n     artificially prop up those industries:\n\n        Country                                   Est. Subsidy per Head\nEU...............................................................$87.94\nCanada.............................................................6.12\nBrazil.............................................................5.38\nAustralia..........................................................2.96\n\n       Conversely, outside of disaster assistance or drought \n     relief, the cattle and beef producer in the United States \n     receives no support from the government.\n     C. State Trading Enterprises\n       State Trading Enterprises maintained in Australia and \n     Canada operate to distort internal prices for key feedstuffs \n     through the use of wheat boards supporting larger herds than \n     would otherwise be the case. The Australian Wheat Board \n     Director has stated that: ``By controlling the export of \n     grains used as feeds--wheat, barley, and sorghum--these \n     entities are able to influence the domestic prices of feed, \n     and thus benefit Australian cattle producers.''\n     D. Unjustified Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures\n       Many of the major consuming countries have imposed \n     restraints on U.S. exports of cattle and beef that are not \n     based on risk assessments or otherwise comply with WTO SPS \n     obligations. While all governments accept the fact that some \n     trade restrictions may be necessary to ensure food safety and \n     animal and plant health protection, the use of sanitary and \n     phytosanitary restrictions to shield domestic producers from \n     competition is unacceptable. For many years, the EU has \n     unjustifiably banned U.S. exports of beef on the grounds of \n     hormones despite adverse WTO panel and Appellate Body \n     reports. Beginning in December of last year U.S. beef has \n     been banned in fifty-eight markets around the world on the \n     basis of BSE without adequate scientific justification or WTO \n     notification. Such restrictive actions have largely \n     eliminated in 2004 the export markets for U.S. beef, markets \n     that have been built up over many years of business.\n       Global BSE Trade Ban in place as of Feb. 1, 2004 \n     (a partially removed as of June 11, 2004; \n     b country joined EU and ban lifted; c \n     banned applies to Washington State only):\n       1.

WTO INCONSISTENT FTAs RESULT IN LARGE VOLUMES OF BEEF COMING TO \n           THE UNITED STATES THAN WOULD OTHERWISE BE THE CASE\n\n       Many countries have entered into free trade agreements \n     (FTAs) where large portions of agricultural trade, including \n     trade in cattle and beef, have been excluded from tariff \n     concessions. Such actions raise serious questions about FTA \n     compliance with obligations of GATT Article XXIV:8(b), which \n     requires that FTAs eliminate duties and other restrictions on \n     ``substantially all'' of the trade between parties to the \n     FTA. Correct implementation of Article XXIV in the FTAs would \n     result in expanded market opportunities for FTA partners and \n     provides alternative markets to traditional export markets \n     such as the U.S. Lack of alternative markets funnels product \n     into the U.S. lowering prices here as well as into other \n     markets not covered by FTAs. An examination of five of the \n     EC's FTAs, as an example, shows the following product \n     exclusions:\n\n                     PERCENTAGE OF PRODUCTS EXCLUDED FROM TARIFF CONCESSIONS IN FIVE EC-FTAs\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                            HS 0201\n                                                                            Meat of      HS 0202     Total % of\n                                                               HS 0102       bovine      Meat of    agricultural\n                          Country                            Live bovine    animals,      bovine      products\n                                                               animals      fresh or     animals,     excluded\n                                                                            chilled       frozen\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMexico.....................................................          100          100          100            35\nSouth Africa...............................................          100          100          100            25\nTunisia....................................................          100          100          100            68\nMorocco....................................................          100          100          100            67\nIsrael.....................................................          100          100          100            87\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  IV. SPECIAL RULES FOR PERISHABLE AND CYCLICAL AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS\n\n       In 2002 Congress recognized that producers of perishable, \n     seasonal, and cyclical agricultural products, like cattle and \n     beef, face unique challenges in the market. Some proposals \n     have been made by the U.S. in the Doha Round in the Rules \n     area but to date nothing has been put forward in the \n     agriculture negotiations. In the United States-Australia Free \n     Trade Agreement (FTA) this requirement was recognized by the \n     Administration as it negotiated an agricultural safeguard for \n     beef. While the terms within the U.S.-Australia FTA are \n     discretionary and limited to beef, it is an important \n     precedent for the type of automatic provisions that should \n     be part of every FTA and part of the WTO.\n\n\n V. THE HIGHLY DESTRUCTIVE EFFECT OF GLOBAL MARKET DISTORTIONS ON THE \n                      U.S. CATTLE AND BEEF SECTOR\n\n       Cattle and beef production comprises the single largest \n     sector of U.S. agriculture. Cattle are raised in all fifty \n     states and half of all U.S. farms have beef cattle as part of \n     their operations.\n       Because cattle prices for U.S. producers are highly \n     sensitive to demand movements, the combination of an open \n     U.S. market, coupled with the global distortions outlined \n     above, has resulted in massive dislocations to U.S. producers \n     and the rural communities which depend on them in the last \n     fifteen years.\n\n                             BEEF CATTLE OPERATIONS, LOSSES AND 2002 CATTLE

For example, during \n     the 1992-2001 decade USDA reports that financial returns for \n     cow/calf producers were a negative $30.40 per bred cow per \n     year, losses aggregating to the billions of dollars. With the \n     massive losses, cattle herds have declined.\n       While the partial closure of the Canadian border in 2003 \n     because of the BSE outbreak in that country has provided a \n     temporary respite for US producers in terms of pricing \n     levels, only correction of the global distortions can restore \n     pricing equilibrium.\n       The unsustainable prices over the last fifteen years have \n     resulted in ranching families going bankrupt by the thousands \n     and being forced off of their land. In 1993, there were \n     nearly 900,000 beef operations in the United States. By 2003, \n     this number declined to 792,100 operations. In the late \n     1990s, auctions of equipment from ranches and farms were a \n     weekly event across rural America as families lost everything \n     they owned and saw the end of what was often generations-old \n     family businesses.\n       The depressed pricing in the marketplace over most of the \n     last fifteen years has meant a hollowing out of the ranching \n     communities across American and with it the destruction of \n     many of the rural communities dependent on ranch and farm \n     economic health for survival.\n\n\n              vi. action to reform distortions is critical\n\n       Eliminating the global distortions in cattle and beef trade \n     is important to every state in the United States, to \n     thousands of rural communities and to some eight hundred \n     thousand ranching and farming families that raise cattle in \n     America. Some distortions can be addressed through the WTO \n     Doha Negotiations but only if the level of ambition at least \n     for cattle and beef is substantially higher than appears to \n     be the direction of negotiations in mid-June 2004.\n       What is needed from the ongoing WTO Doha Development Round:\n       (a) elimination of all export subsidies (developed and \n     developing countries);\n       (b) elimination of all domestic subsidies (developed and \n     developing countries);\n       (c) harmonization of tariffs at a level comparable to that \n     existing in the U.S. for all major consuming and all major \n     producing nations; and\n       (d) maintenance of special safeguards on beef and/or the \n     negotiation of special rules for perishable and cyclical \n     agricultural products.\n       In addition, the U.S. must obtain through negotiation, \n     dispute resolution or otherwise:\n       (a) a harmonization of SPS measures as applied to cattle \n     and beef from all major consuming and producing nations;\n       (b) expansion of trading partners' FTAs to cover \n     substantially all trade in fact, including cattle and beef \n     where not presently covered; and\n       (c) elimination of state trading enterprises involved in \n     grains, cattle or beef to ensure products are traded \n     according to market principles without distortions.\n       Finally, it is critical that the United States include in \n     any future FTAs special rules for perishable and cyclical \n     agricultural products applicable to both cattle and beef that \n     are automatic and both price and volume triggered.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this position paper has been prepared by \nR-CALF USA, an industry association representing ranchers across the \ncountry including Montana.\n  Future trade agreements must seek to eliminate the distortions that \nundermine the prosperity of U.S. producers. That means the U.S. should \nnegotiate agreements that offer real and substantial opportunities. \nThat also means the U.S. must take a hard-nosed approach in the Doha \nRound of WTO negotiations.\n\n[[Page S8205]]\n\n  This matter is crucial to the future of rural America. It is worth \nevery ounce of effort we can pour into it, and I--for one--pledge to \npress this fight.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise to make several important points \nregarding the United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement.\n  As chairman of the Intelligence Committee and member of the Armed \nServices Committee, I am well aware of the valuable friendship that our \ntwo countries share. Australia's commitment to the fight in the Global \nWar on Terror is unwavering. Australia's support in liberating and \nrebuilding Iraq has been crucial there.\n  This agreement provides better opportunities for Kansas \nmanufacturers, especially those in the aviation and transportation \nsectors to increase exports to the Australians. I understand that there \nis strong, bipartisan, interregional support for this agreement across \nindustries and across the country.\n  However, I feel compelled to share with my colleagues several things \nwhich trouble Kansas about the way this agreement was constructed.\n  I must tell our colleagues that in all the years I have had the \nprivilege to serve Kansas and agriculture in the U.S. Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives, there have been few, if any, times when there \nwas as much open hostility to trade as I sense in some areas today.\n  In Dodge City terms, ``The bloom is off the lily, and the lily was \nrun over by a lawn mower.''\n  I have had more than one producer ask me just what we are doing being \ninvolved in all these trade agreements when it seems that agriculture \nis under attack.\n  We have dealt with and continue to deal with the BSE hurdles for our \nbeef products, our farm and export programs are under attack through \nthe Brazilian cotton case and our food aid programs are being attacked \nby others in the Doha round of WTO negotiations.\n  We have now completed, and this body is considering a free trade \nagreement with Australia that exempts a single commodity--sugar--at the \nexpense of others, particularly wheat and beef.\n  Kansas producers, who do pay close attention to trade matters, are \ntaking a look at this list of issues and saying: Hold on a minute, Pat. \nWhat is going on here?\n  I will share with you and the rest of our colleagues what I tell the \nfolks at the coffee klatch in Dodge.\n  In addition to setting a dangerous precedent for future trade \nagreements, exempting sugar from the Australian FTA also sets a \ndangerous precedence for agriculture, especially for sugar itself. In \nthe past, whether in trade agreements or trade disputes, whether it be \nin farm bills or budget reconciliations, the commodity and producer \ngroups have sank or swam together.\n  Sugar's insistence on not participating in this free trade agreement \nmakes it very likely that the rest of US agriculture will opt not to \nparticipate in sugar's defense the next time that program faces a WTO \nchallenge, budget reconciliation measure, or amendment to end sugar's \nsupport program during the next farm bill.\n  Simply put, if sugar falls or jumps off the ag-boat in the future, it \nmay very well find itself treading water while watching the rest of US \nagriculture drift away silently. Our producers will insist that we \nextract real concessions on state-traded enterprises, quotas, tariffs, \netc. in future trade negotiations for their support for concessions on \nimports of agricultural goods here at home.\n  Simply put, you don't bring a knife to a gun-fight and expect our \nproducers to stand with you.\n  I intend to support the United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement. \nI believe that it is in the best interest of our relationship with our \nfriend and ally, Australia. However, singling out individual \ncommodities in future trade agreements is not in the best interest of \nour Nation and threatens agriculture's support and, therefore, my \nsupport for future trade agreements.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I placed in the Record a statement \naddressing the United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement when the \nFinance Committee first passed it. Today, I want to offer some \nadditional thoughts on two issues that have arisen since then.\n  As I have said, I believe the agreement will promote our economic \ninterests and job creation here in America. In addition, Australia is \nan important ally, and we must do all we can to ensure a healthy and \nvibrant relationship between our two nations. Overall, the agreement \ndeserves our support.\n  However, I am disappointed that the administration has included \nprovisions relating to pharmaceuticals in this agreement. It has been \nsuggested that these provisions might block proposals to reimport drugs \nor undermine our Medicare and Medicaid programs. These provisions do \nnot belong in this agreement and should not be considered as precedent \nfor future agreements. The record should reflect that the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative has confirmed to the Congress that these provisions will \nnot harm our domestic health programs or efforts to reimport drugs. And \nif the Trade Representative's claims in this matter should turn out to \nbe wrong, I believe that a future administration and the Congress \nshould act immediately to correct the agreement through whatever \nprocess is needed.\n  Second, I am disappointed that the Bush administration did not do \nmore to ensure a level playing field for our important beef and dairy \nfarmers. Further, the administration ignored the will of the Senate \nFinance Committee on this important issue. I was happy to support an \namendment in the Finance Committee that helps ensure a level playing \nfield for our domestic beef farmers. Unfortunately, the administration \nignored this action and failed to include those enhanced protections in \nits final proposal. It would seem the administration is content with \nlistening only to itself and a few select industries as it negotiates \ntrade pacts for all of America. This is not consistent with our \nexpectations under fast-track procedures.\n  Finally, as I have stated before, I am disappointed that the Bush \nadministration did not build on the model of the United States-Jordan \nagreement by including strong and enforceable labor standards in the \ncore of the agreement. Although Australia already has very strong labor \nrights and an effective enforcement regime, the agreement represents a \nmissed opportunity to set a higher benchmark for future trade \nagreements by cementing the principle that labor and environmental \nstandards are in the core of all new agreements.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Australia Free \nTrade Agreement. On balance, this agreement is overwhelmingly \nbeneficial to the State of Maine, and to the country as a whole. \nCritical to my decision to support this agreement is the fact that it \nwill provide new and expanded opportunities to Maine businesses that \nwant to expand into the Australian market. This agreement will create \nand support good jobs in my State.\n  It is clear that businesses across Maine are interested in initiating \nor expanding trade with Australia. The Maine International Trade Center \nheld a seminar recently on export market opportunities in Australia. \nRepresentatives from more than fifty Maine companies, including many \nsmall businesses and manufacturers, attended.\n  It is no wonder: the United States has a trade surplus with Australia \nof $9.1 billion, the second largest trade surplus of any U.S. trading \npartner. Australia is a net consumer of United States exports and \nparticularly United States manufactured goods. Ninety-three percent of \nUnited States exports to Australia are manufactured goods, and 99 \npercent of these goods will be duty-free if the agreement is \nimplemented. The National Association of Manufacturers predicts that \nthe agreement could result in nearly $2 billion per year in new United \nStates exports of manufactured goods to Australia, a boost to our hard-\npressed manufacturers.\n  In addition, Australia is the 15th largest economy in the world and \nhas been growing over the past few years while the rest of the world is \nin recession. This means more Australian buying power--and many new \nopportunities for Maine and United States companies to export their \nproducts to Australia.\n\n[[Page S8206]]\n\n  Australia has a strong and vibrant trading relationship with Maine. \nAustralia is Maine's 12th largest export market, and in 2003, Maine \nexported nearly $29 million in high-value goods, such as electrical \nequipment, computers, and paper products, to the country. The agreement \nwill make these goods 99.25 percent duty free, on average, in the \nAustralian market.\n  Maine's forest and paper products industry will be stronger and will \nbe able to grow as a result of this agreement. The agreement lifts all \nAustralian tariffs on all U.S. forest products, which currently face \ntariffs up to 5 percent. This is important, because the United States \nis Australia's second largest supplier of paper and paperboard, with \nexports totaling $178 million in paper products in 2003.\n  Expanded access to the Australian market will directly benefit Maine \nmills. For example, International Paper's mill in Jay ME, exports about \n1,200 tons of paper to Australia every year. These exports currently \nface a 5 percent tariff. If the free trade agreement is implemented, \nthe tariff will be eliminated, and International Paper will be able to \nfulfill its plans to increase the amount of paper it exports to \nAustralia from Maine, preserving and even increasing the number of jobs \nsupported by the mill.\n  The agreement will benefit other Maine companies as well. The \nelimination of tariffs will enable FMC Coporation's Rockland plant to \nsignificantly expand its export of carrageenan products to Australia. \nIn Southern Maine, National Semiconductor and Fairchild Semiconductor \nwill benefit from the agreement's elimination of tariffs on all U.S. \nhigh-tech manufactured goods and from expanded opportunities for U.S. \nsuppliers to compete for a broad range of Australian government \ncontracts.\n  The Maine Potato Board has endorsed the agreement because it will \nopen and expand Australian markets for Maine potato products. The MPB \nnotes that the long-term success of the Maine potato industry is \nabsolutely dependent on the growth of new markets.\n\n  Despite the overwhelming benefits of this pact, I do have some \nconcerns with this agreement. While Maine does stand to reap \nsubstantial benefits, I am disappointed that the United States Trade \nRepresentative has included language that conflicts with the goal of \ndrug reimportation.\n  One of the greatest challenges facing American consumers is the high \ncost of prescription drugs. That is why I have long supported \nlegislation to allow Americans to benefit from international price \ncompetition on prescription drugs by permitting FDA-approved medicines \nmade in FDA-approved facilities to be imported into this country.\n  Despite the ongoing debate in Congress and the strong support for \ndrug reimportation on the part of the American public, I am \ndisappointed that our trade representatives have insisted on including \nlanguage in this trade agreement that is contrary to these critically \nimportant efforts.\n  The Australian government already bans the export of drugs subsidized \nunder the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Since 90 percent \nof the drugs prescribed in Australia are subsidized, Australia would \nnot be a significant source of supply of imported drugs into the United \nStates, with or without this agreement. Drugs imported into the United \nStates are far more likely to come from Canada and Western Europe.\n  I am concerned, however, that these provisions set a bad precedent. \nWhile Australia itself is not necessarily a good source for imported \ndrugs, this language could become a template for future agreements.\n  I am also disappointed that this agreement provided some additional \nmarket access for Australian dairy products in the U.S. market. \nHowever, I am pleased the final version of the agreement includes \nmarked improvements over initial drafts. For example, the agreement \ngradually phases in limited increases in dairy imports over an 18-year \nperiod. In addition, the agreement maintains the current U.S. above-\nquota tariffs on dairy products indefinitely. These improvements were \nincluded in the agreement after I joined with my colleagues in sending \na letter to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick asking that the \ninterests of our dairy farmers be taken into account as the agreement \nwas negotiated. The inclusion of these provisions, in addition to my \nconsultations with Maine's agricultural leaders, has led me to conclude \nthat this agreement will not have a significant impact on Maine's dairy \nindustry. Moreover, Australia currently exports only a small amount of \nMPCs to the United States, and this agreement will not change this.\n  Australia is one of our oldest and most reliable partners. The \ncountry is a growing market for high-value U.S. exports from both Maine \nand the country. The free trade agreement we are considering today will \nstrengthen the economic and diplomatic ties between our countries. On \nbalance, it is good for Maine, and for both countries.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on the \nAustralia Free Trade Agreement. Because I believe this agreement offers \ngreater access to Australian markets for U.S. manufacturers as well \nhelp solidify a long-term relationship with Australia, a leading ally \nof the United States on a whole host of international challenges, I \nwill vote in support of this agreement.\n  The Australia Free Trade Agreement will offer new opportunities for \nU.S. manufacturers as well as granting substantial access to U.S. \nservices suppliers, including telecoms, financial services, express \ndelivery, and professional services providers. These sectors are a \ncritical part of New York's economy. Furthermore, Australia has been a \nstalwart ally of the U.S. and this agreement is another step in \ncementing that relationship.\n  I share the concerns raised by some of my colleagues regarding the \ndrug importation language in the agreement. Quite simply, the United \nStates Trade Representative should not be negotiating agreements that \ncould impact on the drug importation debate and I have grave concerns \nabout the inclusion of this language in the agreement. Similarly, in \nthe Chile and Singapore agreements, I raised concerns about the \ninclusion of immigration provisions in those agreements. The continuing \npractice of the United States Trade Representative of including \nprovisions in trade agreements which are rightfully in the jurisdiction \nof Congress is deeply troubling.\n  During my tenure as a Senator, I have voted for every trade agreement \nthat has come before the Senate. However, I will find it difficult to \nsupport future trade agreements which contain language that impedes the \njurisdiction of Congress regarding drug importation or other issues\n  While I wish the agreement had included provisions that provided \ngreater market access for New York agriculture, I believe that a \ngenuine effort was made to address the legitimate concerns of New York \nand other States' farmers and that, on balance, New York's economy will \nbenefit from this agreement.\n  Despite my concerns over the drug importation provisions, I believe \nthat, in the aggregate, New York will benefit more from having this \nagreement pass than if it failed. I also believe it sends a positive \nsignal to Australia about the importance of the United States-Australia \nrelationship. The Trade Representative should not make the mistake of \nconcluding that a vote for the Australia Free Trade Agreement is a vote \nin support of this troubling drug importation provision.\n  When deciding how to vote on trade agreements, I look at each \nagreement in its totality and measure the impact of each agreement on \nthe New Yorkers that I am privileged to represent. Because I believe \nthat passage of the Australia Free Trade agreement will lead to more \njobs and greater economic growth in industries that are an important \npart of New York's economy as well as strengthening the U.S. \nrelationship with Australia, I will vote in support of this agreement.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, article 17.9.4 of the United States-\nAustralia Free Trade Agreement implementing legislation allowing patent \nholders to prevent the import of their patented products is redundant \nand should not have been included in the agreement. Australian law \nalready bans the export of pharmaceuticals if such drugs are purchased \nunder its Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, PBS, and PBS drugs account \nfor over 90 percent of all drugs sold in Australia.\n\n[[Page S8207]]\n\n  This language does not establish a precedent for other free trade \nagreements. According to the Senate Finance Committee, it is \nappropriate to raise objections if this language is included in a free \ntrade agreement negotiated with a country that does not forbid the \nexport of low cost pharmaceuticals. Therefore, I will support this \nagreement.\n\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I firmly believe that free and fair \neconomic relations between nations will accrue to the benefit of all \nparties. Our country was founded on the principle that all States would \nbenefit from the free flow of commerce between equal parties. And our \nnational economy has proved this to be true.\n  These same dynamics now operate on a global scale. Commerce can now \nreach around the globe with ease. Communications are instantaneous, \neven in the most isolated places. Our trading laws must keep pace with \nthe emerging patterns. We must move to shape the emerging global \nmarketplace into a productive and fair system--not sit back and condemn \nits advances and decry the loss of old economic structures. We can \neither be in the lead of this evolution, or we will be sidelined by it. \nI believe that America can and must exert leadership. One way we must \nassert leadership is by the negotiation of trade agreements that will \nlower the barriers to trade and level the playing fields for all \nplayers.\n  Trade agreements come together more naturally with developed nations \nthat share our commitment to rule of law, strong worker protections and \nstrict environmental controls. Australia is such a country. Even so, it \nhas been difficult to resolve the differences in our two economies and \nallow protections for particularly vulnerable elements of each economy. \nNegotiations have taken place over a considerable length of time, and \nno side has gotten everything they want.\n  The provisions in the agreement relating to dairy, for instance, are \nan example of not getting all that we would like. I joined a bipartisan \ngroup of 30 Senators in a letter to the chief US trade negotiator, \nAmbassador Robert Zoellick, expressing our concerns for our Nation's \ndairy farmers and requesting favorable treatment for this struggling \nnational industry. Under this agreement, imports may amount to two-\ntenths of 1 percent of U.S. dairy production. While I would have \npreferred no market penetration by Australian dairy imports, I am \nconfident that our industry is strong enough to meet this competition. \nAdditionally, this agreement will open up new markets for Vermont's \ndairy products. I am confident Vermont farmers will be able to take \nstrong advantage of this opportunity.\n  Some concerns have been raised about provisions relating to \nprescription drugs. Transparency provisions in this agreement related \nto Government procurement decisions are designed to provide equal \nrights of appeal. The US Trade Representative, USTR, has indicated that \nthese provisions will not require any changes in U.S. pharmaceutical \npurchasing programs. There has also been discussion about a provision \nin this agreement related to drug reimportation. As a strong supporter \nof passing drug reimportation legislation, I would not want to endorse \nany curtailment of future drug reimportation opportunities. In this \ncase, however, Australian law prohibits the export of any drugs \npurchased through its government-subsidized program, the majority of \nall drugs sold in Australia. As a central part of the Australian \nGovernment's drug program, there is no reason to think that this \nprohibition would change. But I also warn USTR that it would be \nunacceptable to include language similar to article 17.9.4 in future \ntrade agreements where reimportation might be an option in the event of \na change in U.S. law. I am sure that the intense discussions around \nthese provisions over the last few days have made this point quite \nclearly.\n  As with all significant agreements, we will find flaws and challenges \nwith this agreement as it unfolds. But as international dispute \nmechanisms are perfected, we become better at settling them equitably \nand expeditiously. The future of our economy and the health of the \nglobal economy are dependent upon us improving our ability to devise \nmore equitable and open trading systems.\n  The disparities between the economies of the developed world and the \nless-developed world continue to grow. This agreement comes between \neconomies of equal strength, even though not of equal size. The \nexperience we gain here in how to remove barriers to trade while \nprotecting vital interests will inform us of how to more successfully \ntackle the difficult trade relations between our economy and those \nless-stable economies. Some would argue that the easiest way to relate \nto weaker economies is to put up greater barriers to trade--to prevent \nthe export of any U.S. capital and prevent the entrance of any lower-\npriced goods into our market. I am more of an optimist than that. I \nbelieve that we can do better than lock out whole sectors of the global \neconomy. I believe we must make efforts, learn from our mistakes, and \nmove ahead to strengthen the flow of commerce, the equity of business \nand the opportunity for all people to earn a living.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am pleased to join many of my colleagues in \nsupporting this landmark United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement, \nFTA. I say ``landmark'' because it is both historic in that it \nunderscores the invaluable relationship between the United States and \nAustralia--a relationship that is built on friendship, loyalty, and \nmutual support for economic and political freedoms--but also because it \nbreaks new ground for an FTA.\n  For the first time, a free trade agreement negotiated by the United \nStates has addressed the worldwide problem of prescription drug price \ncontrols. The United States is virtually the only developed nation that \ndoes not regulate pharmaceutical prices. American consumers, who \nfinance the bulk of research and development for the entire world, \nshould be very pleased that the U.S. Government has begun broaching the \nsubject with other developed countries. Because some of my colleagues \nhave raised concerns about the pharmaceutical section, I want to \nbriefly review what the FTA does, and what it does not do, in the area \nof pharmaceuticals.\n  First, it is important to note that Americans will only benefit from \nthe drug provisions and, in truth, so will Australians. The FTA makes \nsuitable progress on addressing Australia's drug price controls; the \nU.S. did not have to make any concessions in exchange. I say suitable \nprogress because, while the agreement makes important progress, \nAustralia does not embrace a free market for drug pricing with the \naccord.\n  I joined a number of my colleagues on a Congressional delegation trip \nto Australia at the beginning of the year. During our meetings with \nAustralian government officials we had the opportunity to debate the \nAustralian drug pricing system. I believe the agreement we will approve \ntoday was possible, in part, because of those discussions.\n  In the FTA, the U.S. and Australia state that they ``recognize'' the \nimportance of innovative pharmaceuticals in delivering high-quality \nhealth care. Incorporated in this, both countries agree to set \npharmaceutical prices based on the ``objectively demonstrated \ntherapeutic significance of the pharmaceutical.'' In practice, the U.S. \nGovernment is already in compliance with this provision because our \nGovernment does not ``mandate'' prices; certain Government agencies may \nnegotiate prices with drug companies, but by and large, we allow the \nfree market, including negotiations between drug companies, and \ninsurance companies, to determine prices. While Australia could not \ntake the next step and price drugs accordingly or adopt market-pricing, \nthis is still an important first step. If the U.S. can convince our \nfriends and trading partners to agree that innovative pharmaceuticals \nbenefit everyone and that R is both costly and necessary to our \nhealth, then we can begin arguing for better burden sharing of R \ncosts.\n  I want to talk for a moment about price controls and the effect they \nhave on research and development. Some of my colleagues argue that the \nU.S. should adopt prescription drug price controls indirectly by \nimporting price-controlled drugs from other countries as a means of \nreducing drug costs for American consumers. I believe this would be a \nterrible mistake for a number of reasons, one of which is the effect it \nwould have on R To date, the\n\n[[Page S8208]]\n\nU.S. has seen private pharmaceutical research move to the U.S. from \nEurope specifically because of price controls. Companies are able to \nrecoup their R costs in the U.S. market and are consequently more \nlikely to develop their new, breakthrough pharmaceuticals in the U.S. \nAmericans like having the R performed in our country--we like the \nquality jobs it brings and we like having first access to new \nproducts--but we do not like the fact that Americans pay for almost all \nof the R for the world. Americans know this is simply not fair. If \nthe U.S. adopts price controls, we will see the development of new, \ninnovative pharmaceuticals drop off because there will be no one left \nto fund R Rather, we must begin persuading other developed, market \neconomies to begin shouldering their share of the burden. That is why \nthe fact that the agreement recognizes the importance of R is so \ncritical.\n  The FTA also commits Australia to make both transparency and \ntimeliness improvements to their Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, PBS, \nthat are intended to make the listing process for new pharmaceuticals \nmore open and fair. The PBS is the system by which the Australian \ngovernment sets price controls and provides subsidies for nearly all \ndrugs sold in Australia. To improve transparency, Australia agrees to \nestablish an independent review board to hear appeals of PBS listing \ndecisions. This will enhance transparency and accountability in the \noperation of the PBS. Companies will gain a better idea of how and why \ndecisions were made regarding their drug submissions. Prior to this \nagreement, U.S. drug companies would submit information on a new drug \nfor listing by the PBS, the PBS would set the price, and the company \nwould be left with a ``take it or leave it'' situation.\n  Some of my colleagues have asked whether the U.S. will have to \nestablish a similar independent review board, but the general counsel \nof the USTR clarified for the Senate Finance Committee, during the July \n14, 2004 consideration of the FTA, that because our processes are \nalready open and transparent, no independent review board is required \nfor any U.S. Government purchases of pharmaceuticals, by the Veterans' \nAdministration, for example).\n  Finally, the FTA establishes a ``medicines working group'' that will \nprovide a forum for continued dialogue between the United States and \nAustralia on pharmaceutical issues. During our meetings in Australia we \nsuggested such a working group as a way to guarantee that, if our \npricing concerns could not be resolved in the FTA, we could continue to \ndiscuss the issue. The subject matters that the group might consider \nare not limited by the agreement, and therefore can be expected to \ninclude the importance of market-based pricing.\n  Now, to address the concerns of my colleagues. First, the FTA does \nnot ban the importation of price-controlled drugs. As my colleagues \nknow, it is already illegal for individuals to import prescription \ndrugs into the United States. Now, Congress may vote to amend U.S. law \nto allow individuals to import prescription drugs from foreign \ncountries. I would strongly oppose this, but we may do it. This \nagreement would in no way prohibit Congress from changing U.S. law to \nallow drug importation. The new U.S. law would supercede the agreement \nand would take effect despite any inconsistencies with the agreement. \nAlso as some of my colleagues know, Australian law prohibits the export \nfrom Australia of drugs that are subsidized by the Australian \ngovernment. This only makes sense, from the perspective of Australian \ntaxpayers. Australian law does allow nonsubsidized drugs to be \nexported; but in reality, most of the drugs marketed and sold in \nAustralia are under the subsidized system. As a consequence, Australia \nis not likely to be a significant exporter of low-priced drugs to U.S. \nconsumers, should Congress allow drug importation, regardless of what \nthis FTA says.\n  Another charge raised by some of my colleagues is that the patent \nprotections in the FTA will in some way prohibit drug importation. The \npatent protections included in the FTA merely state that both nations \nagree to protect the patent owners' rights to determine how, by \ncontract or other means, their patent is used by a licensed third \nparty. It is not specific to pharmaceuticals, nor is it unique to this \nFTA; other U.S. trade agreements include similar language that merely \nreiterates and is consistent with existing U.S. patent laws. That is, \nunder U.S. law patent holders already have the right through contracts \nand by other means to limit the use of their products. If an \nunscrupulous person wanted to steal a U.S. company's drug patent, \nillegally make the drug, and sell it into the United States, it would \nbe a violation of U.S. law, regardless of whether the U.S. entered into \nthis FTA or not.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to review the facts if they have concerns \nwith the drug provisions of this FTA because this agreement will not \nincrease drug prices in the U.S., it will not increase drug prices in \nAustralia, and it will not prevent the U.S. from changing our laws in \nany way. It will, however, begin an important dialogue with our \nAustralian friends about the importance of R and of paying for R \nthis is an important first step. I urge all of my colleagues to support \nthe agreement.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I do not consider myself \na protectionist, nor a free trader, but a balanced trader.\n  Having said that, I have not been a supporter of so-called free trade \nagreements in the past. I have been very skeptical of the free trade \nagreements--FTAs--our country has signed due to the detrimental impact \nthat I believe they've had on our economy, especially the manufacturing \nindustry. Most of the trade agreements we have signed since I have been \ninvolved in politics under both Democrat and Republican leadership have \nput American workers at an unfair disadvantage because they have \nencouraged trade with countries that have no labor standards, lack \nenvironmental and intellectual property laws, and violate agreements \nunder the WTO.\n  Free trade only works when both countries play fairly. That is why I \ncan support the U.S.-Australian Free Trade Agreement--USAFTA. Australia \nis a country that holds true to their word and will live up to their \ncommitments in the agreement. Australia lives by the same rules of law \nthat we as Americans live by. By maintaining an equivalent cost of \nproduction and standard of living to that of the United States, the \nUSAFTA will improve the competitive advantages of both countries \nwithout encouraging the displacement of hard-working Americans.\n  I am extremely concerned about the negative impacts that unfair trade \nagreements have had on the manufacturing industry. South Carolina, \nparticularly the textile industry, has been decimated by unfair trade, \nfirst with NAFTA and now with the People's Republic of China. We have \nlost thousands of jobs at home. In the last six years, nearly 230,000 \nU.S. textile jobs have been lost. Since 1997, the U.S. textile industry \nhas closed more than 250 textile plants in the country. These mass \nlayoffs and plant closings are a direct result of unfairly traded \nimports, especially from China. China's access to the U.S. textile and \napparel market more than doubled in 2002, growing 117 percent and grew \nan additional 114 percent in 2003, according to the American Textile \nManufacturers Institute.\n  During the negotiations on the Australian Free Trade Agreement, the \nBush Administration negotiated a good deal for the textile industry and \nI appreciate their efforts in this regard. The USAFTA contains a strict \nyarn-forward rule of origin with no loopholes, exceptions, or \ncarveouts. Therefore, the benefits of the USAFTA are limited to the \nparticipating countries only, effectively denying China the loophole \nthrough which they annually transship billions of dollars of \nmanufacturing goods into this country. This is the first FTA to contain \nsuch a strict yarn-forward rule of origin and I hope that it is the \nfirst of many.\n  While I recognize the need to examine the problems with our current \ntrade agreements, I support the USAFTA because I feel it has the \nopportunity to serve as a model for future FTAs. Furthermore, the \nimplementation of the USAFTA will further strengthen the U.S. \nrelationship with Australia, one of our most important and reliable \nstrategic partners.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today we are considering the United States-\nAustralia Free Trade Agreement. There is\n\n[[Page S8209]]\n\na lot to commend in the agreement before us. This deal is expected to \nadd over $490 million annually to the U.S. economy. The benefits of \nthis agreement to the manufacturing sector of America are significant. \nTariffs on nearly all U.S. exports of manufactured goods are \nimmediately eliminated. Intellectual property rights protections will \nbe expanded, as will progress towards enhanced trade through e-\ncommerce. I commend Ambassador Zoellick for his hard work on this deal.\n  I have been to Australia many times, and I have met with Prime \nMinister John Howard. The U.S. and Australia share many interests. We \nshare similar values, similar standards of living, and similar goals. \nAustralia is a close friend and important ally in the war on terror, \nand I recognize the value of our relationship. Because of the overall \nbenefit to our economy and the close friendship the U.S. shares with \nAustralia, I will be supporting this agreement today.\n  However, I have some reservations about the impact of this deal on \nMontana farmers, and I want to take a moment to address those.\n  While the beef industry has achieved a generally balanced phase-in of \nchanges, the Australian Wheat Board remains a trade-distorting monopoly \nthat could harm our domestic grain producers. I recognize that \nAustralia has offered to reconsider the role of its Wheat Board in the \ncontext of the Doha negotiations, and I applaud that decision. But the \nAustralia Free Trade Agreement provides no immediate benefit for \nMontana farmers.\n  Provisions relating to cattle are somewhat better than those for \ngrains, but I want to take a moment and address an issue of concern for \nsome in the beef industry. The automatic safeguards provided for in \nthis agreement are subject to waiver, and that is troubling for some of \nour producers. While the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has \nbeen clear that the waiver would be used only in extraordinary \ncircumstances, I want to stress my belief that those safeguards are \nthere for a reason. Should the Senate approve this agreement before us \ntoday, I expect USTR to use caution when considering waiving the \nsafeguards. I appreciate the provisions in the implementing language \nthat require USTR to consult with the Senate Finance Committee, the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee, and private sector advisory groups \nprior to taking action. Consultation requirements like these ensure \nthat the best interests of our cattle producers will be protected. The \ninclusion of price and quantity safeguards represent real progress in \nachieving a balanced phase-in of free trade agreements, and I want to \nmake sure they are properly used.\n  Despite these issues, I do believe that the Australia agreement is, \nin general, beneficial to the United States, and to Montana. It could \ncertainly be improved, but Australia comes closer to a balanced deal \nthan most FTAs have.\n  Again, I will vote for this agreement, but I call on Ambassador \nZoellick to aggressively defend the interests of our agricultural \nsector in the Doha talks so that the future of free trade looks \nbrighter for America's farmers and ranchers. Multi-lateral agreements, \nlike the Doha talks, provide real opportunities for farmers and \nranchers--and in that context, the United States and Australia will \nwork together to liberalize trade for the benefit of all.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, throughout my public service, I have \nbeen a supporter of free but fair trade. Trade is important to the \nArkansas economy because it creates jobs by opening new foreign markets \nto Arkansas' largest exports. In 2003 alone, Arkansas employers and \nfarmers benefitted from over $2.9 billion in manufacturing and \nagricultural exports sold around the world. From 1999 to 2003, Arkansas \nexports to Australia totaled some $246 million, according to data \ncompiled by the International Trade Administration within the \nDepartment of Commerce.\n  With numbers like these, it is easy to recognize the benefits of \nfreer trade. It is also easy to see that as tariffs are reduced and \ntrade barriers are removed, these numbers can grow.\n  The benefits of trade don't stop there. Through trade we can improve \neconomies throughout the world, not only making the world an even \nbetter customer to all the good products Arkansas has to offer, but \nimproving the lives, working conditions, and environmental standards \nfor millions of people around the globe.\n  However, while there are certainly benefits, there are usually other \nimportant factors that must be considered. As a supporter of freer and \nfairer trade, I remain passionate that our trade policies must be \ncrafted to ensure that all U.S. industries remain competitive in a \nworld marketplace that is not always free and, all too often, not \nalways fair.\n  I remain passionate that each step towards freer trade must also be a \nstep towards fairer trade and a more level global playing field. As a \nmember of the Senate Finance Committee, I am pleased to have the \nopportunity to influence our Nation's trade agreements. In fact, \njurisdiction of international trade is a large reason why I sought a \nseat on the committee, because while I certainly recognize the benefits \nthat free trade creates, I also know the concerns we must address.\n  All too often, we are faced with the news of the loss of more \nmanufacturing jobs. For Arkansas, the pictures of plant closings and \nnews articles of job loss are more than just stories in the media, they \nare a harsh reality.\n  Since July 2000, my State has encountered an enormous loss of \nmanufacturing jobs--nearly 35,000 to be exact, according to data \nprovided by the National Association of Manufacturers.\n  I am deeply troubled that so many Arkansans have lost their jobs, not \nbecause they can't compete on a level playing field but because the \ncards have been stacked against them. That's what the jobs bill is all \nabout--keeping jobs where they belong here at home.\n  Does that mean that we should shy away from a pro-trade agenda \ncompletely? The answer is no. Without a progressive agenda we are left \nwith the status quo, which simply doesn't work.\n  With the status quo international labor and environmental standards \nremain low while tariffs and barriers for goods produced here in the \nUnited States remain unacceptably high.\n  Agriculture is a great example of this. When U.S. farmers look out at \nthe world around them, they see an average bound tariff of 62 percent \nagainst their products while foreign farmers see just 12 percent \nimposed against their products coming into the United States. And when \nU.S. farmers look around the world, they see Europeans with subsidies \nas high as $400 per acre while our help to our farmers sit at less than \n$40 per acre. That is why we need a strong domestic farm policy.\n  The bottom line is that under the status quo jobs don't stay here in \nthe United States where they belong. They move overseas. Throughout the \nnegotiation of the Australia Free Trade Agreement, it became clear that \nthis was a very unique agreement that presented both opportunities and \nchallenges. A snapshot of Australia shows a highly developed country \nwith comparable environmental and labor standards. Additionally, \nAustralia is one of the few countries with which the United States \nenjoys a trade surplus--some $6 to 7 billion annually.\n  With the reduction of tariffs and the elimination of other trade \nbarriers we can look forward to sending more U.S. manufactured and \nagriculture products to Australia. And that is exactly what happens in \nportions of this agreement.\n  In the Australia FTA, 99 percent of the tariffs on manufactured goods \ngo to zero on day one. I have heard this agreement called the best \nagreement for manufacturers. With immediate free trade for 99 percent \nof U.S. manufactured goods, I would have to agree, especially when 93 \npercent of what we sell to that country is manufactured goods.\n  In addition, U.S. agricultural exports to Australia, totaling $400 \nmillion annually, would also gain immediate duty free access, \nbenefitting Arkansas soybean farmers, for example.\n  However, given that total U.S. agriculture sales to Australia account \nfor less than 1 percent of our worldwide sales, my message to United \nStates Trade Representative Robert Zoellick has been that the United \nStates' No. 1 responsibility to Arkansas farm families is, first do no \nharm.\n  There is a significant upside for Arkansas manufacturers and the more \nthan 200,000 Arkansas families who make a good living because of this \nindustry. However, there was not as much to be gained under this \nagreement in the area of agriculture, and\n\n[[Page S8210]]\n\nthere could have been some risk, particularly to my cattlemen who are \nvery important to me and my State. Now, Arkansas cattlemen can take on \nany country around the world in a fair global market, but a bilateral \nagreement like this cannot create that kind of fairness. That is why \nthe Doha Round of the WTO is so important.\n  In the meantime, as the Senior Senator from Arkansas, my priority \nthroughout this bilateral agreement was simple--ensure protections to \nsafeguard the interest of Arkansas cattlemen and, second, get \nassurances from Australian trade negotiators that they will assist the \nUnited States in our effort to reform government export programs around \nthe world.\n  While I still have concerns that I intend to continue to work to \naddress with Arkansas cattlemen, my colleagues in the Senate, and \nAmbassador Zoellick in addressing, the Australia FTA does work to \nminimize any adverse impact on U.S. agriculture, and beef in \nparticular.\n  Specifically, Australian access to U.S. markets for beef is opened \nslowly over an 18-year transition period. Increased imports from \nAustralia are estimated to be limited to about 0.17 percent of U.S. \nbeef production and 1.6 percent of beef imports to the U.S.\n  In addition, several important safeguards are included to ensure that \nadditional Australian beef imports will not disrupt the domestic beef \nindustry or depress American beef prices. For example, while the \nproposed FTA would gradually phase up Australia's quota of duty-free \nbeef imports over 18 years, this phase up cannot begin until American \nbeef exports return to levels seen prior to the discovery of bovine \nspongiform encephalopathy, BSE in the U.S. last January.\n  Moreover, the first reduction in the tariff will not occur for 9 \nyears and not reach zero for 19 years after enactment of the FTA. Our \ntrade officials also worked to include two additional safeguards in \nthis agreement that will further protect the domestic beef industry. \nThe first safeguard is ``volume-based'' and would be in effect during \nthe 18-year transition period. This means that Australian beef imports \ncannot exceed 110 percent of total imports coming in ``duty-free'' at \nany point during this time period. If this does occur, the tariff rate \nwill automatically snap back to the higher tariff we currently impose \non imports from other countries with which we do not have free trade \nagreements.\n  The second safeguard--and the most important in my view--is ``price-\nbased'' and goes into effect at the end of the 18-year period. This \nmeans that a tariff is reimposed on Australian beef imports if domestic \nbeef prices drop to a certain level after tariffs have been eliminated. \nBoth of these safeguards are automatically enforced at our borders \nbased on the established import volume or domestic price levels. No \nadditional review by Congress or the Administration is required to \nenforce these protective safeguards.\n  In short, I feel that our trade officials did a fair job of \naccentuating the positives for Arkansas while minimizing any negatives.\n  I am supporting this agreement because on the whole I believe our \ntrade team showed sensitivity to Arkansas farm families. I am \nsupporting this agreement because I am willing to find common ground \nwith our negotiators when I feel they have listened to my concerns and \nacted on them. And I am supporting this agreement with the \nunderstanding that our negotiators will now turn to the WTO and other \nagreements whose benefits to my cattlemen will be substantial and \ncertain.\n  I have been proud to work with my Arkansas cattlemen on a wide range \nof issues over the years. Whether it has been on disaster assistance, \nanimal identification, trade, conservation, food safety, taxes or \nregulations, we have stood shoulder to shoulder. With the passage of \nthis agreement we must now turn our attention to these and other \nimportant issues, starting with the opening of market places around the \nworld that will be truly beneficial to the Arkansas cattlemen.\n  With the passage of this agreement, I am committed to doing exactly \nthat.\n  Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't briefly touch on the \npharmaceutical provisions in this trade agreement and my concern for \nthe precedent that they may set.\n  While I am told, and I trust, that this will have no implication on \nthe reimportation legislation that I and many of my colleagues support; \nwhile I am told, and I trust, that this will have no implication on how \nour Medicare and Medicaid programs operate; while I am told, and I \ntrust, that this agreement will have no implication on the way the \nDepartment of Veteran's Affairs purchases their prescription drugs, I \nmust restate that I am concerned.\n  Nonetheless, I want to reiterate that I am fully committed to \npursuing Federal policies that will make prescription medications in \nthe United States sale and affordable through legislation and future \ntrade agreements.\n  We have a crisis here in America when it comes to the price of \nprescription drugs and I'm looking for solutions. Furthermore, I'm \nputting the Administration on notice that efforts to block access to \ncheaper drugs for my constituents will be met with resistance by this \nSenator until we make some real progress of our own here in this \ncountry.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly \nabout the Australia FTA. On balance, this agreement will benefit the \nUnited States and benefit Florida, and I will vote in favor of it. This \nis consistent with my record of supporting fair trade, opening overseas \nmarkets to Florida exports, creating jobs and economic growth in this \ncountry.\n  This agreement eliminates Australia's manufacturing tariffs, giving \ncompanies access to Australian markets. Florida exports a significant \namount of goods and services, such as fertilizers, high technology \ncomputer simulators and aircraft parts. Florida companies and \nbusinesses support this agreement, because exports to Australia will \ncreate jobs in across many sectors.\n  Now, this agreement has important provisions relating to Florida's \ncitrus industry that merit attention and oversight. The citrus industry \nis Florida's second largest--90,000 jobs depend on it, and the industry \nhas a $9 billion economic impact on the State.\n  First, I would like to take a moment to reiterate the importance of \npreserving the tariff on imported frozen concentrated orange juice in \nthe FTAA and WTO negotiations. I have spoken often in the past about \nthis issue and I am going to continue to fight to preserve the tariff. \nSenator Kerry has already acknowledged how important the tariff is to \nFlorida. I would also like to again urge the President to state \npublicly, in clear language, that we will not negotiate any reduction \nof the tariff.\n  In fact, I am pleased to see that the administration worked with \nAustralia in this agreement to address another sensitive commodity, \nsugar. Sugar was excluded from the agreement, because of the unique \ncircumstance surrounding the trade of sugar. We must reform \ninternational sugar trade not on a regional, or bilateral basis, but \nwith the WTO. I would hope that the unique circumstances surrounding \nBrazil's manipulation of the citrus trade will lend it similar \ntreatment in an FTAA.\n  With respect to the Australia FTA, this agreement presents an \nopportunity to resolve an outstanding issue between the U.S. and \nAustralia that could pave the way for increased exports of Florida \ncitrus. For the past 13 years, Florida's Department of Agriculture has \nworked with Australia to develop a protocol for the export of citrus to \nthat country. Unfortunately, we have achieved only limited progress \nbecause Australia has effectively stonewalled the process at every \nstep. Florida's citrus industry has worked hard to meet the import \nprotocol requirements set by Australia, only to have Australia change \nthem.\n  This administration must work with Australia to resolve issues \ninhibiting exports of Florida grapefruit in a timely fashion. This is \nimportant to the implementation of this agreement.\n  Most recently, after Florida's industry addressed the concern raised \nby the Australians on canker, they raised the issue of ``post-bloom \nfruit drop,'' PFD. This is more a weather condition anomaly, not a \nmajor disease concern that exists in a great deal of citrus production \naround the world, and it very difficult to transmit. And although PFD \ntransmission to Australia is not\n\n[[Page S8211]]\n\n100 percent impossible, it is as close to impossible as anything the \nindustry has seen. Australia must not put excessive protocols on \nFlorida's producers because it could be a disastrous precedent for \nFlorida's grapefruit industry, as other foreign markets could adopt \nthis same non-tariff trade barrier.\n  The Australia FTA calls for the development of protocols to address \nmany standing trade issues that have existed over the last several \nyears--including Florida citrus. The agreement calls for negotiators to \ncomplete this process within a six month timeframe. This administration \nshould seize this opportunity to resolve this issue in order to pave \nthe way for increased Florida citrus exports to Australia.\n  The U.S. Government should remain committed to producing a \nreasonable, scientifically-based protocol that will not jeopardize \nother export markets or opportunities. Moreover, it is important that \nthis process be completed on a timely basis to enable Florida's \nindustry to enter the Australian market next season, which opens this \nNovember.\n  While I am a supporting the Australia trade agreement, I would like \nto take this opportunity to express my concern over other provisions \nincluded in it that could hamper congressional efforts to allow the \nimportation of cheaper drugs from other nations.\n  I am a strong supporter of importation simply because I can no longer \ndefend the exorbitant drug prices paid for by our Nation's citizens. \nThe language in the agreement does not expressly prohibit the \nimportation of drugs from other nations. However, because it is based \non current law, any changes allowing importation would be in conflict \nwith the terms of the agreement.\n  I am confident that the overall benefits of this agreement warrant my \nsupport and that should similar provisions dealing with importation be \nattempted in future trade agreements, enough opposition would rise to \nensure that Americans do not continue to subsidize the cost of drugs \nfor the rest of the world.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support the United States-Australia \nFree Trade Agreement. It has significant benefits to American \nmanufacturers in all our States who have suffered too much in our \ntroubled economy. In the past 4 years this vital sector has shed 2.5 \nmillion good jobs that may well take years to replace.\n  The agreement will immediately remove all Australian tariffs on \nvirtually all goods manufactured in the United States. In doing so, it \nwill provide a modest competitive advantage in the Australian market \nfor U.S. manufacturers over competing firms in Asia.\n  In the past 4 years, the administration has done very little to \ncombat the unfair trade practices of other nations to open their \nmarkets to more U.S. goods, and this agreement will help at least in \npart to redress the balance.\n  Massachusetts companies exported $254 million in goods to Australia \nlast year, much of which were products in modern high-tech fields. If \nthis agreement had been in place then, 98 percent of those products \nwould have been duty free.\n  In addition, the fact that Australia has strong labor and \nenvironmental laws mean that this agreement will not result in a ``race \nto the bottom'' that drives down wages and degrades the environment. \nMany of us are concerned that the administration, in negotiating the \nagreement, was so reluctant, because of its ideology, to try to resolve \nsome of our differences with Australia on specific labor issues, but \nthose differences are not sufficient to cause rejection of the \nagreement. Good-paying jobs in the United States will not be replaced \nby low-wage jobs abroad in harsh and exploitive conditions.\n  In other trade agreements, that problem can be extremely serious, and \nwe must continue to be vigilant that trade agreements respect the need \nfor strong protection for labor conditions and for the environment as \nwell.\n  A more serious problem in this agreement however, is its treatment of \nprescription drugs. These provisions are a blatant attempt by the \nadministration to bypass Congress and set an irresponsible precedent \nfor blocking the reimportation of prescription drugs. They build on \nsimilar provisions in the Singapore trade agreement. They are a \nstatement of the priorities of the Bush administration that put profits \nof drug companies first and affordable drugs for patients last.\n  The current rules on importation or reimportation of FDA-approved \ndrugs manufactured in FDA-approved plants are indefensible. They \nprohibit anyone except a drug manufacturer from importing drugs into \nthe United States. They create a shameful double standard under which \nCanadians, Europeans and other foreign patients can buy American drugs \nat affordable prices, while American drug companies charge exorbitant \nprices to American patients.\n  The central issue is fairness for millions of Americans struggling to \nafford the soaring cost of prescription drugs. Americans understand \nfairness. They know it's wrong that for the same prescription drugs, \nU.S. patients pay 60 percent more than the British or the Swiss, two-\nthirds more than Canadians, 75 percent more than Germans, and twice as \nmuch as Italians.\n\n  Prescription drugs often mean the difference between health and \nsickness--or even life and death--for millions of Americans. Drug \ncompanies are consistently the most profitable industry in the Nation, \nyet they overcharge countless families. It's wrong for patients to go \nwithout the drugs they need because the Bush administration won't stand \nup for patients against the price-gouging of the pharmaceutical \nindustry.\n  Senator Snowe, Senator Dorgan, Senator McCain, Senator Daschle, and I \nand other colleagues have proposed legislation to give American \npatients a fair deal at long last. Our proposal will legalize imports \nof safe U.S.-approved drugs manufactured in U.S.-approved plants. U.S. \nconsumers will be able to buy FDA-approved drugs at the same fair \nprices as they are sold abroad.\n  The drug industry and the Bush administration argue that imported \ndrugs jeopardize the health of American consumers because of the \npossibility of counterfeiting or adulteration. Under our proposal, that \nargument can't pass the laugh test.\n  Our proposal sets up iron-clad safety procedures to guarantee that \nevery drug imported legally into the United States is the same FDA-\napproved drug originally manufactured in an FDA-approved plant--whether \nthe drug is manufactured abroad and shipped to the United States, or \nwhether it is manufactured in the United States, shipped abroad and \nthen imported back into the United States.\n  Compare our rigorous requirements with what happens today. Fraudulent \ndealers throughout the world can establish Web sites or advertise low-\ncost drugs in other ways and claim to be Canadian pharmacies. \nIndividuals have no way of knowing whether they are purchasing safe or \nunsafe drugs or whether the seller is legitimate or not. All such sales \nare illegal. The only rule is let the buyer beware.\n  The FDA has eloquently testified about the Wild West situation that \nAmerican consumers face every day under the current rules. As long as \nit is illegal to buy safe drugs at low prices, the trade in unsafe \ndrugs will flourish. As long as we bury our heads in the sand and fail \nto guarantee the availability of safe and legal imported drugs, \nmillions of American patients will continue to risk their health on \npotentially unsafe, unapproved, and counterfeit drugs. Our bipartisan \nproposal gives patients access to drugs at prices they can afford, and \nit protects them against the danger of the essentially uncontrolled and \nuncontrollable counterfeit drugs they face today.\n  It is because of the rigorous safeguards in our bill that Dr. David \nKessler, who served under both Republican and Democratic Presidents as \nCommissioner of the FDA, has stated that our proposal ``provides a \nsound framework for assuring that imported drugs are safe and \neffective.''\n  Dr. Philip Lee, one of the Nation's leading authorities on \nprescription drugs, a physician who served as the Assistant Secretary \nof Health under two Presidents, and a former Chancellor of the \nUniversity of California at San Francisco, has emphasized that our \nproposal ``will reduce rather than increase the likelihood of \ncounterfeit drugs entering the U.S. supply chain from abroad and that \ndrugs imported under the program will meet FDA standards for safety and \neffectiveness.''\n  On imported drugs, safety is the first responsibility--and it is a \nresponsibility that our bipartisan proposal fulfills. But legalizing \nsafe drug imports is\n\n[[Page S8212]]\n\nonly half the battle to bring fair prices to consumers. Legalization is \nmeaningless unless it is backed by strong measures to prevent drug \nmanufacturers from manipulating the market to subvert the law.\n  Already, American drug companies are retaliating against imports from \nCanada by limiting the amount of drugs they sell to Canada and denying \ndrugs to pharmacies that re-sell them to American patients. A few weeks \nago, a group of senior citizens was forced to cancel a bus trip to \nCanada because the Canadian pharmacies they relied on for affordable \ndrugs were effectively shut down by U.S. drug companies.\n  Our proposal includes strict rules to close the loopholes that drug \ncompanies use to evade the law. Violations will be considered unfair \ntrade practices, and violators will be subject to treble damages. Any \nproposal that does not include comparable protections is a fig leaf, \nnot a solution.\n  The provisions of the Australian Free Trade Agreement, however, opens \na gaping hole in these protections. One way that a drug company can \ncircumvent an importation law is by claiming that an American importer \nwho purchases a drug from a European wholesaler has violated the patent \nheld by the drug company.\n  It has long been a settled feature of patent law that the first sale \nof a product in the domestic market exhausts the patent. If you buy a \ncar and then resell it to a friend, the car manufacturer can't sue you \nfor violating its patent. A recent court decision, however, stated that \nthe rule of exhaustion through first sale does not apply to \ninternational sales. Therefore, a drug company can make a condition of \nits contract that a foreign buyer won't resell a drug to a United \nStates importer. If the foreign buyer does so, the importer could be \nsued for a violation of the patent.\n  Broad application of this rule to drug company sales would nullify \nany reimportation bill that Congress passes. That is why our \nlegislation specifically states that reimportation of a prescription \ndrug is not a patent infringement. The Australia Trade Agreement, \nhowever, states that it is an obligation of the United States to \n``provide that the exclusive right of the patent owner to prevent \nimportation of a patented product . . . without the consent of the \npatent owner shall not be limited by the sale or distribution of the \nproduct outside its territory.'' This obligation does not apply just to \ndrugs imported from Australia, but to drugs imported from anywhere in \nthe world. If this obligation could be enforced, it would nullify any \ndrug importation bill passed by Congress, and guarantee that drug \nmakers could continue gouging American consumers, no matter what the \nCongress does.\n  This prohibition was not added to the agreement because the \nAustralians wanted it. Their domestic drug industry is small, and their \nown laws generally do not allow reimportation to the United States. The \nprohibition was added because the U.S. Trade Representative insisted on \nit.\n  It's there because the pharmaceutical industry wanted it as a model \nfor future agreements. It's there because the Bush administration puts \nthe interests of drug companies higher than the interests of American \npatients.\n  Fortunately, this provision has limited practical significance. The \nonly party with standing to enforce the agreement is the Australian \nGovernment, and it is unlikely to bring any enforcement action. But it \nputs our country in the awkward position of endorsing a principle \nagainst the best interests of our people, and it is an ominous \nindication of what the Bush administration will try to do in future \nagreements.\n  I intend to vote for this agreement, because of the advantages it \noffers to American business and consumers. The attempts to bar drug \nreimportation included in the agreement are not enforceable in any \nmeaningful way. But we must be vigilant against attempts to include any \nsuch provision in future trade agreements.\n  Year in and year out, drug industry profits are the highest of any \nindustry in the United States. Yet year in and year out, patients are \ndenied life-saving drugs because those astronomical profits are \npossible only with astronomical prices--prices that drug companies \ncan't charge anywhere else in the world, because no other country in \nthe world would let them.\n  A broad coalition of groups representing senior citizens and \nconsumers have endorsed our bipartisan proposal. It's time to end the \nshameful price gouging. It's time for basic fairness in drug prices. \nIt's time for this Congress to pass a genuine drug import bill. It's \ntime for the U.S. Trade Representative to start standing up for the \ninterests of the American people, not just the interests of the \npharmaceutical industry.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am of the view that a basic \nprecondition to the U.S. trade agenda operating on the right track is \nhaving a consistent and coherent policy foundation. I have always \nargued that expanded trade can be a powerful tool to promote economic \ngrowth and improved standards of living in the United States and around \nthe world. It can help countries develop, ease poverty, raise standards \nof living, and eliminate instability. It can encourage the high-wage \njob growth and technological innovation in the United States. In \ngeneral, I consider myself to be someone that supports trade. In fact, \nmy record shows that I have.\n  But I also believe that trade policy must shape the rules by which \ntrade and international economic policy is conducted to maximize its \nbenefits and minimize its liabilities, both domestically and \ninternationally. Trade liberalization is not inevitably better for the \nUnited States. But it can be better for the United States, and \nfrequently is better for the United States, and we should pursue it \nunder the right conditions.\n  Based on the results of U.S. trade policy, I am not sure we are doing \nthat right now. In fact, I have to wonder if we are on the wrong track \ncompletely. Here is the bottom line:\n  Over two million U.S. manufacturing jobs lost; record and rising U.S. \ntrade and budget deficits, so large that the IMF has warned that they \ncould destabilize the global economy; moving from a trade surplus to a \ntrade deficit in one of the few areas we still have a competitive \nadvantage--high-technology products; major cuts by the administration \nin the education, workforce, and science and technology programs that \nensure we have a competitive edge in these products in the future; \nmajor increases in outsourcing in the services sector, with no clear \nindication of whether this provides net benefits for the U.S. economy; \ncontinued major barriers to American products in foreign markets--both \nas a result of tariff and nontariff barriers; a distinct lack of effort \non the part of the administration to pursue dispute settlement at the \nWTO for countries in direct violation of trade laws; a one-size-fits-\nall approach to U.S. trade policy, where little consideration is given \nto the actual ability of individual countries to implement agreements \nor whether the agreements will actually provide long-term benefits; a \nknee-jerk subordination of U.S. economic security to U.S. foreign \npolicy concerns; insufficient consultation with Congress by the \nadministration during the fast-track process; insufficient explanation \nby the administration of the potential impacts of trade agreements on \nour own economic system, including the environment, taxation, \nhealthcare, and so on; and insufficient attention to the impact of \ntrade agreements on American workers, in particular the provision of \ntrade adjustment assistance so workers can increase their skill-set and \nsustain U.S. competitiveness.\n  I would argue what we are doing in U.S. trade policy at this point in \ntime is following a policy where trade agreements are assumed to be \ngood, with little regard for the actual implications of the agreement \nfor our country's overall economic security. I would not suggest that \neconomic considerations can be the only rationale for trade agreements, \nbut certainly it must be the primary rationale.\n  In my State of New Mexico, I have seen directly the unintended but \nvery negative consequences of trade agreements in areas typically not \nconsidered to be an important part of them--things like housing, health \ncare, the environment, immigration, and so on. These issues are what \nmany people call the ``externalities'' of trade. We have not paid close \nenough attention to these issues in trade agreements, but from where I \nsit we cannot afford to do\n\n[[Page S8213]]\n\nthis any longer. Small provisions in trade agreements have had \nsubstantial unanticipated consequences over time. Trade agreements must \nlook at the overall implications of trade on countries, not just trade \nflows.\n  As an example, the United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement \ncontains language that could have a potentially negative impact on the \nU.S. health care industry. Although the Finance Committee leadership \nreceived assurances from the Bush administration that this language is \nconsistent with our normal obligations under the Government Procurement \nAgreement, I believe the language is ambiguous at best.\n  To this end, at yesterday's Finance Committee executive session I \nrequested a letter from the Department of Health and Human Services \nstating specifically that this program would not negatively impact our \ncurrent efforts to obtain lower cost prescription drugs for Americans. \nI received the letter this morning, and I will include it for the \nRecord.. I have received assurances from the Secretary that the \nprovisions under Annex 2-C of the agreement related to pharmaceuticals \ndo not require changes in any U.S. Government health care programs.\n  However, I requested assurances from the Secretary that Chapter 15.11 \nrelated to Domestic Review of Supplier Challenges do not require \nchanges in any U.S. Government health care programs, nor does the \nSecretary intend to use the agreement--Annex 2-C or Chapter 15--to \nchange any U.S. Government health care programs. I did not receive this \nassurance, but I want to make it clear that I have an expectation to do \nso. If the administration does not intend to use this free trade \nagreement, there is no real reason that they shouldn't state so \nexplicitly. I request again at this time that they do so, and I believe \nthat request is compatible with the statements made by my colleagues on \nthe floor this afternoon.\n  There is another problem with this agreement. I am extremely \ndisappointed that the Conrad amendment related to beef safeguards that \nwas adopted during the markup in the Finance Committee was not included \nin the final language. I feel very strongly that the vote was \nindicative of the will of the Finance Committee on the FTA and that the \nrevised version would have offered additional protections for American \nranchers and should have been included. The fact it was not included in \nthe final language is a violation of the spirit of the Trade Promotion \nAuthority, or fast-track, legislation passed in 2002. Combined with the \nlack of attention on the pharmaceutical issue, I think this is a \nmistake on the part of the administration in that it makes the \nformation of bipartisan consensus on trade policy problematic in the \nfuture.\n  These specific criticisms aside, after careful consideration, I felt \nthe benefits of this agreement outweighed its liabilities. It is my \nview that the FTA gives a strong boost for trade and investment between \nUnited States and Australia that will ultimately benefit the economic \nsecurity interests of our country. The FTA eliminates 99 percent of \nAustralia's manufacturing tariffs immediately, grants incremental \ntariff-free access to Australia's market for U.S. farmers and ranchers, \nprovides enhanced preferential access for U.S. telecommunications and \nservice companies, and removes existing foreign investment screening \nprocedures that have been a market barrier for U.S. firms. \nSignificantly, labor and environment standards in Australia are \ncompatible with the International Labor Organization and the laws we \nhave in the United States. I believe there is an economic \ncomplementarity between the United States and Australia that is unique, \nand it should be encouraged.\n  So while I have some concerns, I will support the United States-\nAustralia Free Trade Agreement. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues in the future to ensure that the Administration and the \nCongress work together to establish a broad bipartisan effort to ensure \nwe work together more effectively in the future. The goal is to bring \nabout expanded international trade so we have economic growth and jobs \nfor the American people. That is the bottom line.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the letter to which I referred in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                       The Secretary of Health and\n\n\n                                               Human Services,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 15, 2004.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Chairman, Finance Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Grassley: Thank you for your interest in \n     federal and state health care programs, and particularly for \n     your leadership in expanding access to affordable \n     prescription drugs for seniors under the Medicare \n     Modernization Act.\n       I understand that in yesterday's markup on the Australia \n     free trade agreement Senator Bingaman asked whether the \n     commitments in this agreement would affect US government \n     health care programs. It is our belief that the provisions of \n     Annex 2-C do not require any change in how US government \n     health care programs are operated--either the Annex does not \n     apply to them by its terms or the programs are operated \n     consistently with the Annex's provisions.\n       I am providing a copy of this response to Senator Bingaman \n     as well. Thank you again for your efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Tommy G. Thompson.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the United \nStates-Australia Free Trade Agreement, FTA, which is currently pending \nbefore this body. This agreement is the culmination of nearly two years \nof difficult negotiations and hard work by U.S. and Australian \nofficials. Today we have the opportunity to pass the implementing \nlegislation that would pave the way for formal adoption of this FTA, \nand when that vote occurs, I intend to support this agreement.\n  As my colleagues are aware, U.S. exports to Australia totaled over \n$13 billion in 2003. According to the United States Trade \nRepresentative, USTR, Australia is quickly growing as a major \ndestination for U.S. goods. For example, over the past 5 years, the \nrate of growth for U.S. exports to that nation has increased more than \ntwofold over U.S. exports to the rest of the world. And during these \nyears, aerospace products and parts--a sector vital to U.S. \nmanufacturing and our national security--have been the leading growth \ncategory. In 2003, the aerospace sector exported an impressive $2.4 \nbillion in merchandise to Australia.\n  Since 1999, my home State of Connecticut has witnessed a 72.8 percent \nincrease in the value of its exports to Australia. Trade with that \nnation directly supports more than 1,800 jobs in Connecticut. Other \nStates have benefited similarly. Indeed, during this same time period, \nU.S. exports as measured by dollar increases have grown faster in only \nseven other nations.\n  But these figures and the potential impact of this agreement are even \nmore striking when one examines the types of items that we export to \nAustralia. I point out to my colleagues that a full 92 percent of U.S. \nexports to that nation are manufactured goods. I know that I don't need \nto remind my colleagues that over the past several years, more than two \nmillion manufacturing jobs have been lost here in the U.S. More than \n30,000 people in my home State of Connecticut have lost jobs in the \nmanufacturing sector.\n  In a variety of ways, we here in Congress have sought to address the \ndomestic loss of manufacturing jobs and infrastructure. I have worked \nhard to affect a turnaround in the conditions of this sector--long the \nlynchpin of the U.S. economy. It doesn't take an economist to realize \nthat this agreement will likely help to strengthen U.S. manufacturing.\n  That is not to say that a United States-Australia FTA will be a \npanacea for our manufacturing woes here at home. It will not. But in my \nview, the steady growth and large manufacturing component of United \nStates-Australia bilateral trade suggest that it will help. For this \nSenator, that fact is one of the most compelling reasons to support a \nUnited States-Australia FTA.\n  Moreover, it should not go without mention that in 2001, 86 percent \nof U.S. exports to Australia were from small and medium-sized \nbusinesses. That figure--86 percent--amounted to more than 16,000 U.S. \nfirms. If this trend continues, with the passage of this agreement, \ntens of thousands of small and medium-sized businesses here in the U.S. \nalso stand to benefit.\n  Nearly 2 years ago, I voted against final passage of fast track \nauthority\n\n[[Page S8214]]\n\nfor the President. I did so because I didn't believe that legislation \nincluded adequate language making it crystal clear that a primary \nnegotiating objective of future trade agreements must be to ensure that \nour trading partners live up to internationally accepted labor and \nenvironmental standards.\n  In that context, I believe that Australia is a model of what we \nshould expect from other governments with whom we craft trade \nagreements. Australia is more than just a staunch ally--it is also a \nnation that has substantial labor and environmental protections. These \nprotections will help to safeguard the lives of workers globally and \nthe natural resources on which we all depend. Equally as important, \nthey will help to ensure that American workers are given a level \nplaying field on which to compete.\n  Despite my overall support for this agreement, I feel that it is \nimportant to mention one item of concern. As my colleagues are aware, \nthe United States-Australia FTA includes language that would allow \nprescription drug manufacturers to prevent the reimportation of their \nproducts.\n  We do not currently import drugs from Australia, and that is unlikely \nto change given that Australian law prohibits the exportation of \nprescription drugs. So as a practical matter, this provision of the FTA \nwill not affect drug prices in this country. But I want to make it \nperfectly clear that this should not set a precedent, nor prevent us \nfrom adopting a law that would allow drug reimportation in the future. \nWhile I will live with this provision in the context of a bilateral \nagreement with Australia, I do not believe that it should have broader \nglobal implications.\n  This concern aside, I look forward to voting on the implementing \nlegislation for the United States-Australia FTA. I intend to cast my \nvote in favor of this agreement, and I encourage my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, in my home State of South Dakota and \nacross America, hardworking producers tirelessly contribute to the \nproduction of our Nation's food supply. Our Nation's producers \nconsistently preserve the safety and wholesomeness of the commodities \nthey produce, ensuring America's food security and contributing to our \noverall well-being. It is because of our producers and ranchers that we \nenjoy the safest food supply in the world, and we owe them our thanks.\n  It is the well-being of the agricultural community which I am \nconcerned for, and it is the well-being of our rural communities that \nis threatened with the possible implementation of the Australian-United \nStates Free Trade Agreement.\n  It is evident that while Australia could stand to benefit \nsubstantially from a free trade agreement with the United States, \nlimited opportunities exist for the U.S. livestock industry and \nagricultural sector. For example, in 2003, agricultural and food \nexports to Australia accounted for only $611 million. This figure \naccounts for only one percent of U.S. worldwide sales. The overall \nvalue of U.S. agricultural imports from Australia equaled an astounding \n$2.1 billion. These numbers speak loudly for the type of economic \nopportunity this agreement poses for Australia, at the detriment of our \ndomestic producers.\n  Our South Dakotan beef producers are dedicated to producing a \nquality, wholesome, and nutritious product. They are successful even in \nthe face of market concentration, packer ownership issues, and an ever-\nchanging agricultural landscape. The FTA with Australia poses yet \nanother burden for our agriculture producers. Phasing out U.S. above-\nquota duties on beef over an 18-year period and gradually increasing \nand lifting quota levels by the end of that period will not encourage \ngrowth in our own agriculture economy, and instead, provide a valuable \nmarket for the Australian agricultural sector.\n  The quota increases will take effect when U.S. beef exports return to \ntheir 2003 level, the level before the discovery of ``mad cow'' disease \nlevels, or three years after the effective date of the agreement, \nwhichever is earlier. After the transition period, a price-based \nsafeguard should be available. Such action, even with supposed \nsafeguards after the transition period for market disruptions, will be \nharmful to U.S. beef producers. I have several concerns about how these \nsafeguards would be utilized, and the actual effect on our producers.\n  Along with my colleagues, I have written to President Bush, as well \nas United States Trade Representative Robert Zoellick, to convey my \nconcern about this agreement. While sugar was excluded from the \nagreement, I, and a number of my Senate colleagues, had requested that \nbeef and cattle be excluded from negotiations of the Australia FTA as \nwell. This request was not heeded. Additionally, a letter was sent \nconcerning Australian imports of dairy, yet another sensitive \nagriculture commodity that was included in the FTA, and the potentially \nsignificant impacts on our pricing system it will have and the \ninconsistencies it presents with respect to our Federal efforts to \nfinancially assist producers.\n  Our beef industry is a crucial component of the agricultural sector \nin South Dakota, and we should not enter into trade agreements with \nAustralia, or any other country, that would further damage our \nagriculture industry. Given our weak economy, we cannot afford to lose \nmore jobs, and we must guard against economic hardships in our rural \ncommunities.\n  Another disturbing component to the FTA with Australia is the \nprescription drug language. United States citizens continue to pay the \nhighest prices in the world for prescription drugs. A study by Families \nUSA found that for the 50 drugs most frequently used by seniors that \nyear, prices rose 3.4 times the rate of inflation in 2002. Such \nstatistics are staggering, and meaningful solutions are needed now.\n  That is why I am a cosponsor of S. 2328, the Pharmaceutical Market \nAccess and Fair Trade Act, legislation that will provide American \nconsumers access to affordable, life-saving medications through \nprescription drug reimportation.\n  This legislation would provide South Dakotans with access to \nreimported drugs through personal importation of up to a 90-day supply \nof a drug from Canada, and eventually, once the Food and Drug \nAdministration puts safety protocols in place, individuals would be \nable to purchase drugs directly from Canadian and U.S. wholesalers and \npharmacies would be able to import drugs from facilities in several \ncountries that are registered, fully inspected and approved by FDA.\n  Unfortunately, the trade agreement before us today threatens to \ndismantle the efforts we are now taking to provide more affordable \ndrugs in our country. The agreement includes provisions which require \nthat the two governments ensure that brand-name drug companies have the \nright to prevent the importation of their products.\n  While supporters of the trade agreement claim that we should not be \nconcerned about this provision because Australian law already bans the \nexport of subsidized prescription drugs, this sets a dangerous \nprecedent for future trade agreements, which we cannot ignore.\n  This seems to be yet another attempt by the Bush administration to \nprevent reimportation. Two-thirds of Americans support reimportation as \nan effective strategy to reduce the cost of prescription drugs. The \nPresident is clearly sending a signal that he cares more about the \npharmaceutical industry's profits, than access to life-saving medicines \nfor U.S. citizens.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to support the United States-\nAustralia Free Trade Agreement. I have opposed some trade agreements in \nthe past because I am not willing to put American jobs on a slow boat \nto China or a fast track to Mexico. However, I am ready to support free \ntrade when it is fair trade, and that is what we are talking about \ntoday.\n  This agreement ensures fair trade with one of our closest allies. It \nwill also bring an expansion of opportunities for American workers and \nAmerican businesses.\n  America's relationship with Australia is about our shared history and \nshared values. Australia has been one of America's staunchest allies in \ntimes of war, sending troops to fight beside our own in both World War \nI and II, the Korean war, the Vietnam war, Afghanistan and now Iraq. In \nsending troops to fight alongside our own in Iraq, Australia was one of \nonly three countries to fight along with America from the outset of \nwar.\n\n[[Page S8215]]\n\n  America and Australia share a common terrorist threat. Al-Qaida \nattacked America on September 11, and 10 Australian citizens died that \nday. A group linked to al-Qaida also killed almost 100 Australians in \nthe Bali bombings. Our security relationship is strengthened by the \nANZUS treaty, through which we work together for our mutual security. \nNow is the time to strengthen our economic partnership with a free-\ntrade agreement.\n  I stand in support of this free-trade agreement because it is good \nfor America and good for Maryland. It will protect and even create \nAmerican jobs, and my first priority is fighting for jobs today and \njobs tomorrow. This free-trade agreement will boost trade, increase \nefficiency and competitiveness, and result in additional foreign \ninvestment.\n  By eliminating Australian tariffs on our manufactured goods, American \ncompanies will be able to sell goods without penalty to our Australian \nallies. In my own State of Maryland, this means semiconductors, medical \nequipment, and fiber optic cable and switching equipment. This could \nmean as much as $2 billion for the U.S. economy in just the first year \nof agreement.\n  This free-trade agreement will also provide new opportunities for \nAmerican farmers. The United States is now the second largest exporter \nof food to Australia, an exchange with a value of almost $400 million a \nyear.\n  However, I do have concerns about the United States-Australia Free \nTrade Agreement. I am concerned about what this agreement might mean \nfor America's families trying to buy prescription drugs. Instead of \nmaking America's families a priority, this agreement protects drug \ncompanies and prioritizes the rights of prescription drug patent \nholders.\n  We cannot use this as an excuse for Congress not to pass prescription \ndrug reimportation legislation. We need a regulated framework for drug \nreimportation so drug reimportation can take place out in the sunshine, \nrather than underground. Congress must act this year to control the \nspiraling cost of prescription drugs for our families.\n  With regard to labor rights, I think free-trade agreements should \nalways include enforceable and high labor and environmental standards. \nThis will ensure that the workers don't miss out and the environment \ndoesn't suffer when businesses boom.\n  The Australian and American systems have much in common. We share \ndemocratic processes and labor rights such as freedom of association, \nthe right to collective bargain, and the right to strike. We could have \nset the bar higher for workers around the world. Instead the United \nStates-Australia Free Trade Agreement is a missed opportunity. It \ncontains no enforceable standards to protect labor rights or the \nenvironment.\n  The free-trade agreement with Jordan included a minimum standard of \nlabor rights and environmental protection. People now talk about the \n``Jordan standard.'' We finally had an opportunity to create an even \nhigher standard, an ``Australia standard'' of labor rights. We could \nhave used this standard if we renegotiated CAFTA and for future trade \nagreements. While we ensured our intellectual property rights are \nenforceable, we did nothing about our labor rights in this trade \nagreement.\n  I am willing to support the Australia Free Trade Agreement only \nbecause Australia's own laws are so strong. When I visited Australia, I \nsaw that Australia stands up for its families, its workers and its \nenvironment. Almost 25 percent of Australian employees are union \nmembers. That's nearly double the level of union representation here. \nAustralian workers are paid a livable minimum wage, receive 4 weeks of \nannual leave and are guaranteed high standards of workplace safety. \nAustralia's world-class health-care system offers first-rate maternity \ncare to its new mothers, with extra time in the hospital and a public \nhealth nurse to teach first time moms how to care for their newborns.\n  The United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement isn't perfect. Yet I \nsupport it because it will mean jobs for America.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, before we conclude today's debate, \nI just take a minute to thank some of the staff who have worked very \nhard on this agreement.\n  I first thank Ambassador Zoellick's team, particularly Ralph Ives, \nMatt Niemeyer, Lisa Coen, and Ted Posner. We worked closely with them \nfor nearly 2 years, and I have appreciated their dedication to getting \na good agreement.\n  I also thank the staff of the Senate Finance Committee. On the \nRepublican side, Everett Eissenstat, Stephen Schaefer, and David \nJohanson.\n  And finally I thank my own staff on the Finance Committee, Russ \nSullivan and Bill Dauster, who head up our Committee staff. Our trade \nteam: Tim Punke, Shara Aranoff, Brian Pomper, and Sara Andrews. Liz \nFowler, who worked on the pharmaceutical provisions. And I especially \nthank John Gilliland, one of our International Trade Counsels who has \ndone a tremendous job, particularly on the difficult and sensitive \nagriculture issues.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Australia is a very important ally and \ntrading partner. As we all know, Australia joined the U.S. in our \nmilitary efforts in both Iraq and Afghanistan. This support is vital, \nand it is appreciated.\n  While it is important to continue our cooperative relations, I am \nextremely concerned about the negative impact the free trade agreement \ncould have on my State of South Dakota and the rest of rural America, \nparticularly on the agricultural sector of our economy.\n  For many months, I urged our negotiators to exclude beef and cattle \nfrom the agreement. I am disappointed that they have not only rejected \nthis suggestion, but have proposed that we allow the Australians \nadditional access to our beef markets.\n  The FTA would establish an 18-year phase-in of increased Australian \naccess to American markets. While 18 years may seem like a long time to \nsome people, I know many ranchers in South Dakota to whom it will not \nseem so long when the phase-in starts and depresses our beef and cattle \nmarkets.\n  Both beef and cattle are very sensitive sectors, and they have become \neven more so with the recent mad cow disease scare. Beef and cattle are \nmore sensitively traded items because they are both perishable and have \ncyclical market dynamics--leaving beef and cattle off the table seemed \nto make a lot of sense.\n  The administration refused and included beef provisions in the \nagreement. To add insult to injury to ranchers in South Dakota and \nacross the country, the administration ignored an amendment on the beef \nsafeguards in the agreement that Senator Conrad offered in the Finance \nCommittee.\n  The administration's actions were wrong on process and wrong on \nsubstance, in my view.\n  The Congress delegates substantial constitutional authority through \nthe fast-track procedures. It retains, however, an informal ability to \nrecommend changes to the implementing legislation of trade agreements.\n  Senator Conrad had a very simple amendment. He said if the \nadministration was going to waive critical safeguards for ranchers, \nthen the Senate Finance and the Ways and Means Committee must concur. \nThis was well in the bounds of the agreement and supported by a \nmajority of the members of the Finance Committee.\n  The committee then went through the contorted exercise of voting the \nagreement down to make it easier for the administration to ignore the \nConrad amendment, which they did.\n  This action makes it more clear that this agreement is not good for \nthe ranchers in South Dakota, and that is the main reason why I oppose \nit.\n  Additionally, the U.S. dairy industry should not be faced with added \nunfair competition by allowing the Australians increased access to our \ndairy markets. Dairy producers from around the Nation have expressed \nthis concern to me.\n  The increased access to our U.S. dairy markets is particularly \ntroubling for South Dakota, as we have been working aggressively to \nexpand our dairy operations.\n  I am also concerned about the current U.S. tariffs on wool that our \nnegotiators have agreed should be gradually eliminated over 4 years. We \nhave a small, but important, wool industry in\n\n[[Page S8216]]\n\nSouth Dakota, and anyone familiar with lamb and wool knows that it is a \nvery import-sensitive industry. Most producers have struggled over the \nlast decade to simply stay in business.\n  While it is only indirectly related to the FTA, I also want the \nrecord to reflect my continuing concern about the treatment of some \ncontracts awarded to Australia under the Iraq Oil-for-Food Program. I \nknow that several of my colleagues, including Senator Graham of South \nCarolina, are reviewing contracts under the Oil-for-Food Program, and I \nhope that their inquiry will include a review of the wheat contracts \nawarded under that program.\n  To that end, my recent exchange of letters with Agriculture Secretary \nVeneman specifically reference contracts awarded to Australian \nproducers since the liberation of Iraq, and press reports indicate that \nthe specifics of these contracts--in particular the price of wheat--\nwere the same as those negotiated under the Oil-for-Food Program during \nSaddam's regime.\n  According to her letter to me, Secretary Veneman has had USDA \npersonnel review these contracts and has assured me that she is certain \nthat no preferential treatment was granted to Australian producers at \nthe risk of American producers. I hope that is the case, but to ensure \nthat it is the case, I am urging Secretary Veneman to provide all the \nresearch and analysis her staff did to Senator Graham for his Oil-for-\nFood investigation and to Paul Voelker who is undertaking an \ninvestigation on behalf of UN Secretary General Annan.\n  In addition, the patent provisions in this agreement raise troubling \nimplications. Many of us in Congress--on both sides of the aisle--have \nbeen working to legalize the safe importation of lower-cost \nprescription drugs from Canada and other industrialized countries.\n  It is no secret that the administration has opposed our efforts. And \nwhat I see in this agreement relating to patents may be of concern in \nhow it affects drug importation.\n  Simply put, the administration should not use trade agreements as a \nback-door way to impede the safe importation of FDA-approved drugs at \nlower prices. The administration needs to make clear that this \nagreement does not do just that.\n  I am also concerned about other provisions in this agreement relating \nto pharmaceuticals and how they may impact other program, such as \nMedicaid, and whether the agreement may impede our ability to alter or \nimprove the deeply flawed Medicare drug benefit enacted last year.\n  Finally, let me reiterate that, in my judgment, the Australia FTA \ngoes too far and treats our farmers and ranchers unfairly.\n  Not only am I dissatisfied with both the treatment of our agriculture \nsector in the agreement, but I also have concerns about the process \nexecuted to implement our negotiated terms.\n  It is extremely important that we have a level playing field on which \nAmerican producers can compete. Given a fair chance, American producers \nare among the world's finest. But the deck must not be stacked against \nthem.\n  I have concluded that this FTA is not in the interests of South \nDakota. Regrettably, I must oppose it.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the H.R. \n4759, legislation to implement the United States-Australian Free Trade \nAgreement.\n  I am excited by the new opportunities for both the United States and \nAustralia that will be created under this important agreement. I \nstrongly support its passage.\n  I thank all my colleagues in the Senate and the other body for their \nhard work. In particular, I thank Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus \nand their staff for working together in a bipartisan way to get us to \nthis moment.\n  I also thank the U.S. Trade Representative and his team and the \nAustralian Embassy for bringing us to this moment.\n  Our two economies are closely linked. Australia is one of our most \nimportant trade partners. The facts speak for themselves.\n  Two-way trade between our nations in goods and services totals $28 \nbillion annually. We have a $9 billion trade surplus with Australia, \nour greatest with any nation. More than 99 percent of our exports to \nAustralia will enter duty-free once the agreement goes into effect.\n  According to the National Association of Manufacturers, more than \n19,000 U.S. firms are already selling into the Australian market. \nNinety-three percent of U.S. exports to Australia are manufactured \ngoods. As many have pointed out, this is indeed a ``Manufacturer's Free \nTrade Agreement.''\n  This agreement is expected to produce an increase in $2 billion \nannually in trade for both nations by 2010. That means the creation of \nas many as 40,000 new jobs directly related to this agreement.\n  In my home State of Tennessee, Australia is an important market for \nour goods. Tennesseans export more to Australia than to France. Last \nyear, Tennessean companies exported $225 million to Australia, a 10-\npercent increase from 1999.\n  In turn, The United States is already Australia's largest source of \nimports and second-largest export destination. So this agreement will \nbenefit both our countries.\n  U.S. farmers benefit from this agreement, too. The United States \nexports $400 million annually in agricultural goods to Australia. These \nexports will receive immediate duty-free access.\n  This agreement will offer substantial new markets for U.S. services \nas well. The agreement will provide new openings for \ntelecommunications, express delivery, energy, construction, \nengineering, financial services, and many other sectors. And this \nagreement lifts restrictions on U.S. investment in Australia.\n  In addition to opening new markets, there are other benefits to U.S. \nand Australian businesses. Australia is the gateway for U.S. businesses \nto Asia. The Australians have close ties to their Asian neighbors.\n  This agreement will pave the way for new, dynamic partnerships \nbetween United States and Australian firms. And with the elimination of \ntariffs and lowering of trade barriers for most industrial products \nunder the agreement, U.S. firms, partnering with Australian firms, will \nbe able to better compete in the growing Asian markets.\n  But this agreement is about more than increasing business \nopportunities. Australia is one of our most steadfast allies and a key \npartner in the war on terror. Australians have fought beside Americans \nin every major conflict in the last 100 years. This agreement \nstrengthens an already close bond forged between two old friends.\n  This agreement is strongly supported by the business community. The \nU.S. Chamber, the world's largest business federation, representing \nmore than three million businesses, strongly supports this agreement. \nThe National Association of Manufacturers, the leading voice on \nmanufacturing in the United States, has called for its immediate \npassage. I am pleased that we are ready to do that today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Under the previous order, the question now \noccurs on the DeWine-Kennedy amendment. There is 4 minutes per side \nprior to the vote.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I understand we have 4 minutes on each \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 4 minutes on each side.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I yield to my colleague from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, very briefly, I want to make sure \npeople understand the tobacco buyout portion of the amendment upon \nwhich we are about to vote. No. 1, to make sure there are no \nmisunderstandings or misconceptions, this amendment will end a tobacco \nprice support program. That will be over. Second, there were several \nhearings on this proposal, both in the House and a field hearing in \nNorth Carolina chaired by Senator Dole.\n  I also want to make it clear how this amendment would pay for the \nbuyout. It would be paid for by a manufacturer's fee, not by the \ntaxpayers.\n  It was suggested that 85 percent of the recipients of the buyout are \nnot farmers. In fact, every single quotaholder owns at least part of a \nfarm. They may have leased it out, but they own at least part of a \nfarm. So these do go to farmers.\n  I hope our colleagues will support the buyout. I think it is a \nreasonable proposal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I yield to my colleague from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the heart of this amendment is the FDA \nprovision which will lead to fewer children starting to smoke and fewer \nadults suffering tobacco-induced disease. If parents want their \nchildren to grow up and grow up smoke-free, if they want to shield them \nfrom a $9 billion campaign designed to entice children into smoking, if \nthey want to help millions of smokers kick the habit before it kills \nthem, they will support the DeWine-McConnell-Kennedy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am going to urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst this amendment for two or three reasons. One, the bill we are \nvoting on has never been marked up out of the Agriculture Committee. It \nhas never been marked up in the HELP Committee. We are going to spend \nbillions of dollars. We are rewriting the farm bill. We have a $12 \nbillion buyout for tobacco farmers.\n  I heard my colleague from Kentucky say it ends the tobacco program. \nIt does not end the tobacco program. This amendment was offered late \nlast night, but under the bill of the Senator from Kentucky it did not \neliminate the program. The House bill spends $9.6 billion and it does \neliminate the program. It eliminates this quota. This bill eliminates \nquotas, but it does not eliminate the Secretary from having the \nauthority to be able to restrict acreage on who grows tobacco. So we \nare going to spend $12 billion and not even eliminate the program, and \nnot have any limitation on how much it is going to cost?\n\n  It is estimated the House bill would have almost 500 people make $1 \nmillion. This bill is much more generous than the House bill. There are \ngoing to be a few people who are going to become multimillionaires as a \nresult of this bill, but yet we were not given the chance to offer any \namendments. We could not say there should be a limit of $250,000 per \nperson who is not a farmer. Incidentally, 85 percent of the people who \nreceive money from the buyout are not farmers, are not living on a \nfarm. So this is a buyout for a few people.\n  The FDA section is the biggest grant of power to the FDA, which not \nonly gives them the power to regulate tobacco, but frankly I believe \nthey can ban tobacco. It is a blank check to do almost anything they \nwant--the most sweeping power they have ever been given. I think the \nHouse was wrong to add the $9.6 billion tobacco buyout in their tax \nbill, and two wrongs do not make a right. Now we are adding totally \nunrelated things, not considered by committee. It is going to cost \nbillions of dollars, and we are going to add it to the Senate bill.\n  It is going to come back from conference in all likelihood with some \nprovision. I think it jeopardizes the entire FSC bill. I do not think \nit should become law. Certainly, this is not the way it should become \nlaw. If it should become law, let us take it up freestanding and give \nSenators the right to amend and discuss it before spending billions of \ndollars.\n  The cost of this buyout is multiples of the so-called quota buyout we \ndid for peanuts. It is going to cost billions of dollars. I urge our \ncolleagues to vote no on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, we regulate every product that is consumed \nin this country today. We put the contents of that product on the \nlabel--every product except tobacco. It makes absolutely no sense. This \nis a very modest bill, a very modest proposal, that gives the FDA the \nauthority to regulate tobacco. I point out to my colleague, it does not \ngive the FDA the authority to ban tobacco. It does not give the FDA the \nauthority to do that at all. It is a modest compromise, but it will \nsave lives. It makes sense.\n  One of the biggest health problems we have in this country today is \nunderage smoking. We know if we can get a child at 19 or 20 and he or \nshe does not start smoking by then, they probably will never start \nsmoking. This bill allows us to get at advertising targeted at young \npeople, which is a major problem today.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to my colleague from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am prepared to vote.\n  Mr. DeWINE. We yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Pursuant to rule XII, paragraph 3, I ask unanimous \nconsent to be excused from voting on this question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute 17 seconds.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, on page 45 of the bill, it says:\n\n       The Secretary may by regulation require restrictions on the \n     sale and distribution of a tobacco product, including \n     restrictions on the access to, and the advertising and \n     promotion of, the tobacco product, if the Secretary \n     determines that such regulation would be appropriate for the \n     protection of the public health.\n\n  If the Secretary determines something is appropriate for the \nprotection of the public health, they can do whatever they want, I \nbelieve, including banning tobacco. That is very broad discretion for \nthe Secretary of Health, to do whatever they want.\n  Also, the program does not end the tobacco program. At least it \ndidn't in Senator McConnell's bill. We have not had a chance to really \nreview it, but it didn't in his bill. It did in the House bill. I \ncompliment the House. If you are going to spend $10 billion, you ought \nto\n\n[[Page S8218]]\n\neliminate the program. We are going to spend $12 billion and not \neliminate the tobacco program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The substitute amendment, as amended, is \nagreed to.\n  The question is on the engrossment of the amendments and the third \nreading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it has taken us too long to reach \nthis point. Frankly, we are doing today what should have been done last \nfall. We are finally moving forward with the Jumpstart Our Business \nStrength--the JOBS bill.\n  I commend the Majority Leader and the Democratic Leader for reaching \nthe agreement that allows this bill to move forward. I commend, as \nwell, the Chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Grassley, who has \nbeen so instrumental in bringing us to this point.\n  There is a reason why we call this bill the JOBS bill. This bill will \nhelp create and keep good, high-paying manufacturing jobs right here in \nAmerica. And this bill will help remove crippling European tariffs that \nrob American firms of business. Every month that goes by without \nenactment of the JOBS bill results in more tariffs on our American \ncompanies. We need to enact this bill.\n  So, as we go forward to conference, it is critical that we adhere to \nthe following 5 principles.\n  First, we should preserve our bipartisan support for this bill. The \nSenate-passed JOBS Bill had strong bipartisan support. It passed by a \nvote of 92 to 5 on May 11. To preserve this bipartisan support we need \nto ensure that any significant change from the Senate-passed bill be \nlimited, germane, and agreed to on a broadly supported bipartisan \nbasis.\n  Second, any conference agreement should be budget neutral. The \ngovernment is running record budget deficits. Gone are the surpluses of \njust a few years ago. We should show fiscal discipline and \nresponsibility. The conference agreement should be budget neutral. And \nthe conference agreement should not employ budget gimmicks.\n  Third, we should protect our Nation's manufacturing jobs. Since \nJanuary 2001, America has lost more than 2.7 million manufacturing \njobs. In my home state of Montana, we have lost 2,700 jobs in that \ntime, over 12 percent of our manufacturing jobs. Therefore, savings \nfrom repeal of the Foreign Sales Corporation/Extraterritorial Income, \nFSC/ETI, regime should go to domestic manufacturing. The conference \nagreement should devote the preponderance of its total cost to the \ncenterpiece of this bill: a domestic manufacturing tax benefit.\n  Fourth, the conference agreement should incorporate the important tax \nshelter reforms that the Senate has repeatedly passed. It has been \nnearly 3 years since Enron and other corporate scandals. Yet Congress \nstill has not enacted any meaningful tax legislation to close the \ncorporate abuses of the tax code. The Congress should retain the \npackage of the Senate-passed tax shelter provisions, including the \nprovisions ensuring that business transactions are undertaken for \neconomic, and not tax avoidance purposes, and requiring CEO signatures.\n  Finally, an important part of the Senate bill is its coverage of all \ntypes of businesses. The conference agreement should provide a domestic \nmanufacturing tax benefit to all domestic manufacturers, regardless of \nchoice of business entity. It should cover not just C corporations, but \nalso S corporations, partnerships, and sole proprietorships.\n  Mr. President, I will fight to ensure the conference agreement \nadheres to these principles. I will fight for the Senate's position \nacross the board, including on overtime rules and on energy tax \nprovisions.\n  Here is the bottom line: The Senate passed the JOBS bill with a wide, \nbipartisan majority. The conferees have to work together, across \npolitical differences, to move this important bill forward. We need to \ncontinue our fight for good jobs, here in America.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have been very outspoken in my \nopposition to this bill, and was one of only five Senators to vote \nagainst its passage in May. I voted against it because it was loaded \nwith wasteful spending and tax breaks for special interests and the \nsuper rich. With the Nation facing a half-trillion dollar deficit, now \nis not the time for Congress to be enacting wasteful tax credits.\n  The proponents of this bill are fond of pointing out that it is \n``revenue neutral'' and that all of the tax cuts in the bill are paid \nfor with offsets. I firmly believe that, due to our current fiscal \ncrisis, any proposed offsets would better be used to reduce the \ndeficit. It is incomprehensible to me, at this time of record deficits \nand debt, coupled with our war against terrorism and the need to secure \nour homeland, that we would consider risking the future of our \nmanufacturing base and our standing in the international community by \nwasting time and jeopardizing corrective action while carving out sweet \ndeals for special interests.\n  We missed a golden opportunity with this issue. We could have passed \na good, clean bill months ago that would have brought us back into \ncompliance with World Trade Organization, WTO, agreements and stop the \nburdensome tariffs now imposed on our manufactures. Unfortunately, the \ngoal of achieving the legislation's underlying worthy purpose has been \nlost to a host of special interest add-ons.\n\n       In a June 19th editorial, The Washington Times, not known \n     for liberal propaganda, stated: The ideal solution would have \n     been a quick, simple repeal of FSC/ETI, which is bad economic \n     policy in any case. Unfortunately, both the House and the \n     Senate versions of the bill became magnets for the special \n     interests. A steady train of lobbyists tacked on $167 billion \n     in tax breaks over the next 10 years to the Senate bill, \n     while the House bill expanded by $143 billion in similar \n     additions. The Senate bill, for example, includes breaks for \n     NASCAR racetracks and foreign dog-race gamblers, while the \n     House version lavishes its attention upon tobacco\n\n[[Page S8219]]\n\n     growers, timber owners and alcohol distillers. The imminent \n     House-Senate conference, predictably, promises to be a de \n     facto food fight between congressman, lobbyists and tax \n     watchdogs. And so while the lobbyists duke it out, EU \n     sanctions will continue to rise and American manufacturers \n     and the U.S. economy will deal with the consequences.\n\n  Let me quote from some other newspapers who have editorialized about \nthis terrible bill.\n\n       From The New York Times: What started out as Congress's \n     urgent obligation to resolve a trade battle with the European \n     Union has degenerated into an embarrassment as lawmakers and \n     business lobbyists vie in a costly frenzy of corporate \n     handouts.\n       From The Dallas Morning News: The United States' \n     credibility also is at stake. As a WTO member, the United \n     States has an obligation to follow the trade body's rulings \n     or risk undermining the WTO's authority over global trade. . \n     . . The simple solution would be to end the tax break. But \n     election-year politics threaten common sense.\n       From The St. Petersburg Times: Tax cut fever has gripped \n     lawmakers, and they're beginning to act delusional. . . . The \n     bill is so irresponsible it deserves to fail.\n       From The Los Angeles Times: Further driving up the federal \n     budget deficit with tax breaks will probably worsen U.S. \n     sales abroad. The more money the Treasury has to borrow to \n     cover the deficit, the more pressure there is on the Federal \n     Reserve to raise interest rates to attract those funds, \n     eventually driving inflation.\n\n  An article in the April 19th edition of The Washington Post exposed \nthe Senate-passed bill for what it is and how it became such a \nmonstrosity. The article stated the following:\n\n       Congress's task seemed simple enough: Repeal an illegal $5 \n     billion-a-year export subsidy and replace it with some modest \n     tax breaks to ease the pain on U.S. exporters. But out of \n     that imperative has emerged one of the most complex, special-\n     interest-riddled corporate tax bills in years . . . The 930-\n     page epic is packed with $170 billion in tax cuts aimed at \n     cruise-ship operators, foreign dog-race gamblers, NASCAR \n     track owners, bow and arrow makers and Oldsmobile dealers, to \n     name a few.\n\n  The article also quoted a tax lobbyist involved in drafting the bill \nas saying that it ``has risen to a new level of sleaze. I said a few \nmonths ago, any lobbyist worth his salt has something in this bill.''\n  This is not the way we should be doing the people's business. \nIncredible deals for the special interests, big tax breaks for oil and \ngas companies, and other big corporations have already stalled WTO \ncompliance for too long. The manufacturing base of our country will \nsuffer, the economy will suffer, and jobs will suffer. Is that what we \nwant? Is that what the American people want? The answer is no. They \ndeserve better than this, Mr. President. We work for them--not for the \nbig money special interests and their fat cat lobbyists.\n  As I have said before, we need to start making some tough decisions \naround here Mr. President. With little legislative time remaining this \nelection year, the Senate would serve the American public far better if \nit stayed focused on accomplishing the intended purpose of legislating. \nUnfortunately, this FSC/ETI bill, which is a much needed bill, is being \ndragged down with the unnecessary weight of billions of dollars in \nwasteful subsidies, tax breaks, and special exemptions for the special \ninterests.\n  We have got to restore some sanity to the way we do things here in \nWashington. The facts are clear, we simply cannot continue to spend and \nspend and spend while continuing to cut taxes and fund the war against \nterrorism. It's high time we face up to the challenge and do what's \nright. Passing this bill, and the others like it of which this body has \nbecome so fond, is tantamount to placing a millstone of debt around the \nnecks of our children, grandchildren, and who knows how many future \ngenerations of Americans. It has to stop, and I hope this body can find \nthe courage to stop it.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I have a few words to say about the \nimportance of protecting overtime pay for hard-working Americans. This \nbill that we're about to vote on is nicknamed the JOBS bill. But the \nmost important thing we did for American workers in this bill was to \npass Senator Harkin's amendment to protect overtime pay. I was proud to \nstand with Senator Harkin and stand up for American workers. I urge the \nconferees on this bill to make sure the Harkin amendment stays in the \nfinal version.\n  Millions of Americans depend on overtime pay to pay their bills and \nmake ends meet. Yet the Bush administration wants to strip overtime \nprotections for hard-working men and women. I thought in this country, \nthe best social program was a job. Yet 6 million workers would lose \novertime protection under the Bush proposal. Who are these workers? \nThey are registered nurses, police sergeants, nursery school teachers, \nand others. These men and women work hard to serve our communities. \nThey protect us and they help us when we are in need. They deserve \nextra pay for their extra efforts.\n  What does the Bush proposal mean for workers? It means workers will \nhave to work long hours for less money because they will no longer be \neligible for overtime pay. They might have to find a second job because \nthey won't be able to count on overtime pay to make ends meet. They \nwill spend less time with their families, but they won't get \ncompensated. I think that's outrageous.\n  Let me give an example. America is facing a crisis in nursing. In \nMaryland hospitals, 12.6 percent of nursing jobs are vacant. They \ndesperately need over 2,000 nurses. Nationwide, we will need about 2.8 \nmillion registered nurses by the year 2020, but only about 2 million \nwill be available. Nurses work an average of 8.5 weeks of overtime each \nyear. Eighty-seven percent of Maryland nurses work overtime just to \nmake up for the shortage. If the Bush proposal becomes law, it will be \neasier for employers to deny overtime pay to registered nurses. RNs \nwill have to work the same long hours for no extra pay, or hospitals \nwill have to get by without enough nurses to take care of patients. \nLack of overtime pay will discourage young nurses from entering the \nprofession and experienced nurses from staying. I worked hard to pass \nlegislation to help eliminate the nursing shortage. Changing the \novertime rules would be a huge step backwards.\n  The Bush plan would also deny overtime pay for police sergeants. The \nBush Labor Department got a lot of criticism when the American public \nrealized that first responders would lose overtime pay. So they revised \ntheir proposal; and now they claim that first responders won't lose \novertime protections. Yet the National Association of Police \nOrganizations, the International Union of Police Associations, and the \nInternational Brotherhood of Police Organizations say that police \nsergeants and other managers could still lose their overtime pay.\n  What a thing to say to police officers and their families. These men \nand women put their lives on the line to keep us safe no matter what \ntime it is or how many hours they've worked already. Every time a \npolice officer leaves their home, they don't know when they'll be home. \nThey don't even know if they'll be home. And now the Bush \nadministration is asking them to donate their overtime. That's no way \nto show our appreciation. We need to protect the protectors so that \nthey can protect us. That means protecting their overtime pay.\n  Nurses and police sergeants are just a few examples. The Bush \nproposal would deny overtime pay for workers in many industries, from \nnursery school teachers to insurance claims adjusters. It would take \nmoney out of the pockets of hard working Americans and their families. \nI think the Bush administration ought to be ashamed of itself.\n  Families in my State of Maryland are worried. They're worried about \ntheir jobs. They're terrified of losing their healthcare, when costs \nkeep ballooning. They don't know how they can afford to send their kids \nto college. Tuition at University of Maryland increased by 30 percent \nover the last 2 years. Our middle class families are stressed and \nstretched. Many are holding down more than one job or working overtime \nto make ends meet. They're racing from carpools to work and back again. \nThey want to know what we in the United States Senate are doing to help \nthem. We need to protect their jobs and protect their overtime pay.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in favor of the Jumpstart Our \nBusiness Strength, JOBS, Act.\n  I supported this bill when first passed out of the Senate on May 11 \nof this year and I will support it again today. In fact, the DeWine-\nKennedy amendment on FDA oversight of tobacco improved the bill.\n\n[[Page S8220]]\n\n  Without this legislation, U.S. companies will face increasing tariffs \nas a result of a World Trade Organization ruling that determined that \nsignificant portions of our Federal Tax Code ran counter to \ninternational trade laws.\n  The DeWine-Kennedy amendment that we adopted will strengthen the bill \nby restricting advertising and promotions that appeal to children; \nstopping illegal sales of tobacco products to children; requiring \nchanges in tobacco products, such as the reduction or elimination of \nharmful chemicals, to make them less harmful or less addictive; \nprohibiting unsubstantiated health claims about so-called ``reduced \nrisk'' tobacco products that would have the effect of discouraging \ncurrent tobacco users from quitting or encouraging new users to start; \nand requiring the disclosure of the contents of tobacco products and \ntobacco industry research about the health effects of their products.\n  This amendment is absolutely essential to me should a tobacco buyout \nbe included in the conference report.\n  But this legislation is still far from perfect and I have growing \nconcerns about what we may see when this bill returns to the Senate \nfollowing conference. This concern has been heightened by what I see \ncontained in the House bill.\n  First, the House bill contains the $9.6 billion tobacco buyout \nproposal that contains no provision for FDA oversight of tobacco \nproducts.\n  Second, the House bill is not offset by revenue raisers and would \ncost $35 billion through 2014, according to the official Joint \nCommittee on Taxation estimate. Alarmingly, this cost estimate does not \nprovide a true sense of the bill's fiscal impact because the bill \nemploys two budget gimmicks.\n  The first gimmick involves phasing in tax cuts slowly over the 10-\nyear period covered by the legislation. This ``backloading'' of tax \ncuts shaves tens of billions of dollars off the 10-year cost of the \nHouse package.\n  The second gimmick involves having tax cuts expire before the end of \nthe 10-year period, even though the intention is, in many cases, for \nthe tax cuts to be extended and to remain in effect on an ongoing \nbasis.\n  The Joint Tax Committee has estimated that making permanent most of \nthe temporary tax cuts in the House bill would add $190 billion to the \ncost of the bill through 2014.\n  In contrast, the Senate bill is fully offset and will effectively \nprovide a 3-percent tax cut for manufacturers; give manufacturers a 50-\npercent tax credit for the cost of adding jobs; extend the research tax \ncredit through 2005; protect hundreds of thousands of workers from cuts \nin Federal overtime protections; prevent the Federal Government from \nspending taxpayer dollars on contracts with companies that use foreign \nlabor when there are domestic alternatives; provide a tax credit for \ncompanies which produce energy by using underbrush and other \npotentially hazardous fuels found in our forests; provide a tax credit \nfor consumers who buy hybrid vehicles; protect the California film \nindustry and the jobs it creates; and provide for FDA oversight of \ntobacco products.\n\n  I will be looking for very specific items to be included in the \nconference report. The final bill should be fully offset and not \nincrease the deficit; contain strong and effective FDA oversight of \ntobacco products if the bill contains a tobacco buyout provision; and \nrequire that any tobacco buyout provision be funded by tobacco \nmanufacturers, not taxpayers; contain a tax credit for the open-loop \nbiomass industry that works to reduce fire hazards in California; and \nprotect companies, such as the film industry, that did nothing wrong \nunder the old law and yet face the possibility of having their tax \nbenefits cut.\n  And, to the conferees, I want to stress the importance of these \nprovisions to me. These are not ordinary times and we must protect the \nintegrity of our tax system from those who would twist it at the cost \nof fiscal responsibility.\n  The long-term budget outlook remains grim. Although the deficit may \nrecede somewhat over the next few years from its current historically \nhigh level, it will swell as the baby boomers retire in large numbers \nin the coming years and eventually reach unsustainable levels. One of \nthe most prudent steps that we as policymakers can take in preparation \nfor this impending challenge is to reduce the deficit today.\n  Moreover, corporate tax revenues are at all time low levels as a \nshare of the economy. The Congressional Budget Office projected in \nMarch that corporate tax revenues will equal 1.4 percent of GDP in \n2004--lower than the average levels seen in each decade since the \n1940s.\n  Furthermore, CBO projects that corporate tax receipts will remain at \nabout 1.8 percent of GDP through the end of the decade. This is lower \nthan the average level of corporate tax receipts in each of these \ndecades except for the 1980s, when corporate receipts plummeted from \nthe effects of tax cuts and economic conditions.\n  Given the historically low corporate revenues, it does not represent \nsound policy to use the revenues gained from closing corporate \nloopholes to fund new targeted corporate tax breaks. The goal should be \nto restore the corporate revenue base, at least in part, in order to \nhelp reduce the deficit, not to diminish the corporate revenue base \nfurther.\n  So while I support the Senate version of the JOBS bill because on \nbalance it provides important protections for California workers and \nbusinesses, I do so warily and will reserve final judgment until I see \nthe conference report.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, a new study by the Economic Policy \nInstitute makes clear that 6 million Americans, including teachers, \nnurses, cooks, clerical workers, and pharmacists, will lose their \novertime protections under the Bush overtime rule. President Bush is \nonce again putting corporate profits ahead of workers and their \nfamilies. Profits are already up more than 60 percent since President \nBush took office, yet workers' wages have actually declined. The last \nthing America's struggling workers need today is a pay cut.\n  The Bush overtime rule puts special interests above worker interests. \nAn independent analysis by three former high ranking Department of \nLabor employees concluded: `` we believe that (with the exception of \nthe change in the salary level test) the interests of U.S. workers and \ntheir families will not be advanced--indeed will be harmed--by the \nimplementation of these new regulations.''\n  It is clear that the Bush administration is putting business's bottom \nlines first. The National Association of Manufacturing, NAM, the \nChamber of Commerce, the National Restaurant Association, the funeral \nindustry and many other groups lobbied hard for more relaxed overtime \nrequirements. The final rule includes a broad exemption for workers in \nthe financial service industry that helps the insurance and banking \nindustries and for the retail and restaurant industries.\n  With more than 8 million Americans out of work, and with so many \nother families struggling to make ends meet, cutbacks on overtime are \nan unfair burden that America's workers should not have to bear. \nOvertime pay accounts for about 25 percent of the income of workers who \nwork overtime. Workers stripped of their overtime protection would end \nup working longer hours for less pay.\n  The Fair Labor Standards Act was enacted in the 1930s to create a 40-\nhour workweek and requires workers to be paid fairly for any extra \nhours. Especially in times like these, it is an incentive for job \ncreation, because it encourages employers to hire more workers, instead \nof forcing current employees to work longer hours.\n  The overtime protection is vital to the 40-hour workweek. If \nemployers no longer have to pay extra for overtime, they will have an \nincentive to demand longer hours, and workers will have less time to \nspend with their families.\n  In 70 percent of American families all parents are working, either \nboth parents, or the single parent, as compared to 1960 when 70 percent \nof all families had at least one parent at home full time. Workers are \nalready struggling to balance their families' needs with their work \nresponsibilities. Requiring workers to work more hours for less pay \nwill add a greater burden to this struggle.\n  In May, 99 Senators voted for the Gregg amendment that said it was \nwrong for the Bush administration to deny overtime to millions of \nworkers, including police sergeants, nursery\n\n[[Page S8221]]\n\nschool teachers, nurses, computer programmers and others in 55 \ndifferent job categories. And a bipartisan majority of 52 Senators \nvoted against taking away overtime from any worker currently entitled \nto it. It would be unconscionable if this bill comes out of conference \nwithout those protections.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The bill (H.R. 4520), as amended, was passed.\n  (The bill will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote and I move to lay that motion \non the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

CHEN\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, later this month, our country will bid \nfarewell to a good friend. Chen Chien-jen--known to all of us as C.J. \nChen--first came to Washington 33 years ago and has spent over 20 years \nhere working to promote a better relationship between the United States \nand Taiwan. As he retires and returns home, C.J. will leave the people \nof Taiwan a legacy of a strong relationship with the United States and \ndeep support from the American people.\n  C.J. has strived to represent the people of Taiwan in the foreign \nservice for 37 years, 20 of which have been spent here in Washington. \nHe began his exemplary service in the United States in 1971 as Third \nSecretary in the Embassy of the Republic of China, and remained in \nWashington after 1979, working with Congress to draft the critical \nTaiwan Relations Act of 1979. From 1983 to 1989, he served as deputy \nrepresentative of the Coordination Council for North American Affairs, \nTaiwan's diplomatic mission to the United States. And for the last 4 \nyears, he has admirably headed the current mission, the Taipei Economic \nand Cultural Representative Office.\n  C.J.'s leadership as Taiwan's chief diplomat to the United States has \nbeen remarkable. During his 4 years as representative, he has helped \nelevate the United States-Taiwan relationship to unprecedented \nstrength. He has championed the passage of critical legislation by \nCongress, and he has worked with Congress and the White House to cement \nthe United States commitment to strengthen Taiwan's self-defense. At \nthe same time, he has educated his own leadership and people about the \nUnited States, our people, and our policies.\n  But for me, and for many of us in Washington, C.J. Chen will be \nmissed not only as an outstanding diplomat, but as a close personal \nfriend. During his time in Washington, I have had the opportunity to \nget to know C.J. and his wife, Yolanda Ho, very well, and I will miss \nthem.\n  While C.J. will no longer serve his people in an official capacity, I \nknow that he will continue to contribute to building United States-\nTaiwan relations. I wish C.J. and Yolanda a long and happy retirement, \nand hope they will often return to visit their friends here in the \nUnited States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/15/senate-section/article/S8221-3", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Mr. President, I bring to my colleagues' attention a \nthoughtful op-ed article published in the July 13 Washington Post by \nMona Eltahawy, a London-based Arab journalist.\n  The article raises an important question about a double standard on \nhuman rights between Libya and Iraq. The United States overthrew Saddam \nHussein's regime because he was a brutal dictator, but we embrace \nLibya's Qadhafi despite the fact that he is a brutal dictator.\n  About the double standard Ms. Eltahawy wrote: ``In the absence of \nweapons of mass destruction, and with images of Hussein on trial for \nwar crimes, they have been pushing the ``removal of a brutal dictator'' \nexcuse for the invasion. How do they square this with their astonishing \nrush to embrace another ruthless dictator? Qadhafi's behavior of late \nhas been uncomfortably close to brutal.''\n  Libya remains, according to the CIA World Factbook, ``in fact, a \nmilitary dictatorship'' under Colonel Qadhafi. His government \n``continued to commit numerous, serious abuses,'' including arbitrary \narrest and detention, and restrictions of ``freedom of speech, press, \nassembly, association, and religion,'' according to the February 2004 \nState Department Human Rights Report. Violence and discrimination \nagainst women are serious problems as well.\n  A recent visit by Amnesty International to Libya found that ``a \npattern of human rights violations continues, often justified under the \nnew rhetoric of the `war on terror.' '' Amnesty International's \nfindings include ``laws which criminalize the peaceful exercise of \nfreedom of expression and association, leading to the imprisonment of \nprisoners of conscience; prolonged detention without access to the \noutside world, which facilitates torture; and unfair trials, in \nparticular before the people's court which tries political cases. \nTorture and ill-treatment continues to be widely reported, its main use \nbeing to extract `confessions.' ''\n  The Qadhafi regime also continues to intrude in the affairs of other \nAfrican nations, despite Secretary Powell's call in February 2004 that \nLibya ``cease to be destabilizing, cease to fund despotic regimes, and \ncease to cause trouble.'' According to Assistant Secretary of State for \nNear Eastern Affairs Bill Burns, Libya was involved as recently as \nFebruary in sowing instability throughout Africa. ``There have been \nproblems . . . in Zimbabwe. There have been problems . . . in Liberia \nand elsewhere,'' he said. ``We continue to have concerns'' in the \nCentral African Republic, he also said.\n\n  In the Central African Republic, Libyan troops were reportedly \ndirectly involved in 2001 in halting an army revolt against the \npresident. A year later, Libya and the Republic agreed on a 99-\n\n[[Page S8222]]\n\nyear treaty giving Libya the right to exploit the oil, uranium and \nother resources of the republic.\n  In Zimbabwe, Libya has often assisted President Robert Mugabe, \nincluding supplies of urgently needed oil. In Liberia, Libya has been a \nmajor provider of arms and supplies to Charles Taylor.\n  The Libyan Government is responsible for the terrorist bombing of Pan \nAm flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. Some 270 innocent people lost \ntheir lives in the bombing, including 189 Americans. Until September \n11, the Pan Am bombing killed more American civilians than any other \nterrorist atrocity in our history. Officially, the Libyan government \nhas accepted responsibility for the actions of its officials in the \natrocity, but Qadhafi denied his nation's involvement in the bombing, \naccording to a CNN report on December 23, 2004 summarizing an interview \nby its State Department correspondent Andrea Koppel with him.\n  In taking steps to resume relations, the administration presumably \nbelieves that Libya has made a firm decision to abandon terrorism and \nbecome a responsible member of the international community. However, \nQadhafi persists in the type of rhetoric he has displayed in the past. \nIn Brussels, he recently threatened to return to the ``days of \nexplosive belts'' if provoked by Western ``evil.'' We've recently seen \nallegations of a purported assassination plot hatched by Qadhafi \nagainst the crown prince of Saudi Arabia following a dispute at the \nArab League summit in March.\n  President Bush has spoken frequently about democracy and human \nrights. In November 2003, at the National Endowment for Democracy's \n20th anniversary celebration, he said that ``sixty years of Western \nnations excusing and accommodating the lack of freedom in the Middle \nEast did nothing to make us safe--because in the long run, stability \ncannot be purchased at the expense of liberty. As long as the Middle \nEast remains a place where freedom does not flourish, it will remain a \nplace of stagnation, resentment, and violence ready for export.''\n  It is surprising that the administration would so quickly strengthen \nrelations with a dictator who is responsible for the mass murder of \ninnocent Americans, opposes democracy, persecutes his own people, and \ncontinues to cause instability in Africa.\n  Mona Eltahawy's important op-ed article raises many of these \nquestions, and I ask unanimous consent that it may be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Warming Up to a Dictator\n\n                           (By Mona Eltahawy)\n\n       When the United States ended a 24-year chill and restored \n     diplomatic relations with Libya on June 28, the first person \n     I thought of was Baha Omary Kikhia. I interviewed her in \n     Cairo more than 10 years ago during one of her many trips to \n     the region to find out what happened to her husband, former \n     Libyan foreign minister turned dissident Mansour Kikhia.\n       His case has too easily been lost in the lexicon of \n     bloodier and larger crimes committed by the Libyans, such as \n     the 1988 Pan Am bombing, which killed 270 people. But Moammar \n     Gaddafi has been brutal to Libyans, too, and his various \n     eccentricities should not blind us to the police state he has \n     presided over since he assumed power in a September 1969 \n     coup.\n       He may travel with Kalashnikov-armed female bodyguards, he \n     may pitch tents at home and abroad for talks with officials, \n     and he may pen such ``classics'' as the short story \n     collection ``The Village, the Village, the Earth, the Earth \n     and the Suicide of the Astronaut,'' but none of these quirks \n     should distract us from his abysmal human rights record. \n     Arbitrary arrests, a muzzled press, a ban on political \n     parties and the squandering of Libya's oil wealth have never \n     been laughing matters for Libyans.\n       And we should not forget Mansour Kikhia, who disappeared in \n     Cairo in December 1993 while attending a meeting of an Arab \n     human rights organization he had helped found. Kikhia had \n     defected to the United States in 1980 and was a U.S. resident \n     who was four months away from receiving citizenship when he \n     went to Egypt. A four-year CIA investigation found in 1997 \n     that Egyptian agents turned over Kikhia--who had asked for \n     Egyptian security protection while in Cairo--to agents of \n     Gaddafi's regime, who spirited the dissident to Libya, where \n     he was executed and buried in the Libyan desert.\n       My interview with his wife, a U.S. citizen, left me \n     painfully saddened for her and her family and particularly \n     distressed that someone could just disappear in the city that \n     I called home. I could not forget her during an assignment in \n     Tripoli in 1996, when a Libyan government minder shadowed me \n     at every turn and an official with the ministry of \n     information asked me why we were so critical of Libya in the \n     copy we filed at the Reuters news agency. And I will not \n     forget her now, or the many others who have suffered from \n     Gaddafi's regime, just because he is able to say the things \n     he knows the Americans and British want to hear.\n       Gaddafi, claiming he had seen the light, accepted \n     responsibility last year for the Pan Am bombing, agreeing to \n     pay compensation to the victims' families (I wonder whether \n     he has paid compensation to Baha Omary Kikhia) and to \n     dismantle his chemical, biological and nuclear weapons \n     programs. If that last bit sounds familiar, it should. \n     President Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair want us \n     to think that Gaddafi's conversion on the road to Washington \n     and London was due to the fear that he would end up in the \n     same jail cell as Saddam Hussein. (Gaddafi's daughter Aicha, \n     a law professor, has joined Hussein's defense team.)\n       With no weapons on mass destruction to justify a war \n     against a country that never threatened them, Bush and Blair \n     are determined to hold on to their theory that the ``war on \n     terrorism'' and the invasion of Iraq would bring rogue states \n     in line. But it's an old argument they're making. In the \n     absence of weapons of mass destruction, and with images of \n     Hussein on trial for war crimes, they have been pushing the \n     ``removal of a brutal dictator'' excuse for the invasion of \n     Iraq. How do they square this with their astonishing rush to \n     embrace another ruthless dictator?\n       Gaddafi's behavior of late has been uncomfortably close to \n     brutal. In May--a mere two months after a historical visit to \n     Tripoli by Blair, who was accompanied by executives of \n     British businesses eager to cash in--a Libyan court sentenced \n     five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor to death by \n     firing squad for deliberately infecting some 400 children \n     with HIV. The medics had always protested their innocence and \n     said they had been tortured by the police, with daily \n     beatings, sexual assault and electric shocks.\n       Expert witnesses called in for their defense included one \n     of the team that discovered the AIDS virus, who said this was \n     an epidemic caused by poor hygiene at the hospital, not by \n     any international conspiracy. Isn't Bulgaria a member of the \n     ``Coalition of the Willing''?\n       Here's the topper. As Libya was engaged in secret \n     negotiations to resume relations with the United States and \n     Britain, Gaddafi tore into Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah at an \n     emergency Arab League summit in March 2003, assailing the \n     kingdom's close relationship with the United States. When the \n     Saudi de facto leader insulted Gaddafi back and walked out, \n     the Libyan leader apparently hatched a plot to assassinate \n     him. Isn't that dangerously close to state-sponsored \n     terrorism?\n       Speaking at Whitehall Palace in London last year, President \n     Bush acknowledged that the United States and Britain had not \n     always been on the right side of democracy when it came to \n     the Middle East. ``Your nation and mine in the past have been \n     willing to make a bargain to tolerate oppression for the sake \n     of stability,'' Bush said, addressing Blair.\n       It's not difficult to imagine that just such a bargain, \n     along with some good old-fashioned military and oil contracts \n     thrown in, is the driving force behind the resumption of ties \n     with Libya.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/15/senate-section/article/S8222-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8222-S8223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             PATIENT SAFETY\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about patient safety.\n  There is bipartisan legislation pending in the Senate that is \nabsolutely critical to reducing healthcare errors and increasing \nhealthcare quality. It is S. 720, the Patient Safety and Quality \nImprovement Act.\n   The Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee reported this \nbill to the floor in November of last year. It was approved in the \ncommittee by a unanimous voice vote, and it is past time for the Senate \nto vote on and pass this important legislation.\n   This patient safety legislation is an important step toward building \na culture of safety and quality in health care.\n   The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act would create a \nframework through which hospitals, doctors, and other health care \nproviders can work to improve health care quality in a protected legal \nenvironment. The bill would grant privilege and confidentiality \nprotections to health care providers to allow them to report health \ncare errors and ``near misses'' to patient safety organizations. The \nbill also would allow these patient safety organizations to collect and \nanalyze the data confidentially.\n   After analyzing the data, patient safety organizations would report \non trends in healthcare errors and offer guidance to providers on how \nto eliminate or minimize these errors. Some of this takes place today, \nbut much more\n\n[[Page S8223]]\n\ninformation could be collected and analyzed if providers felt confident \nthat reporting these errors did not increase the likelihood that they \nor their colleagues would be sued for honest mistakes.\n   This legislation would not permit anyone to hide information about a \nmedical mistake. Under the bill, lawyers could still access medical \nrecords and other information that would normally be discoverable in a \nlegal proceeding. However, the bill would ensure that the analysis of \nthat information by patient safety organizations would take place on a \nseparate track in a protected legal environment.\n   Healthcare providers will be much more likely to share information \nabout honest mistakes and how to prevent them if they have some \nassurance that the analysis of their information won't result in a tidy \npackage of information that a personal injury lawyer could use against \nthem in court.\n   Errors in medical treatment take place far too often today. \nUnfortunately, providers live in fear of our unpredictable and unfair \nmedical litigation system, and this legal fear inhibits efforts to \naddress the root causes of health care errors. Without appropriate \nprotections for the collection and analysis of patient safety data, \nproviders are unwilling to report mistakes and errors, which is one of \nthe reasons that health care quality today is not what it could be.\n   Litigation does nothing to improve quality or safety. The constant \nthreat of litigation instead stifles honest analysis of why health \nerrors happen. This is just one more reason why we need wholesale \nreform of our medical litigation system. We need to foster alternatives \nthat restore trust between patients and providers and result in fair \nand reliable outcomes for both parties. We need to scrap the current \nsystem, not just cap it.\n   But until we do so, we should take whatever steps we can to create \nan environment that protects the collection and analysis of patient \nsafety data so that providers can learn from their mistakes and prevent \nthem from happening in the future.\n   The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act is one of these \nsteps. Yesterday, our committee chairman, Senator Gregg, asked for \nunanimous consent that we move to consideration of this legislation on \nthe Senate floor. This is the third time he has done so. Each time, he \nhas been blocked by our colleagues in the minority, even though the \ncommittee of jurisdiction was unanimous in its support for the bill.\n   My colleagues in the minority keep talking about problems with \nhealthcare quality--just like they keep talking about the loss of \nAmerican jobs. However, talk is cheap when their actions don't match up \nto their words. If they are really so concerned about improving \nhealthcare in our Nation, why would they object to a bill that would \nreduce errors and improve patient safety, particularly a bipartisan \nbill with unanimous committee support? If they are really so concerned \nabout American workers and jobs, why won't they let a bill improving \nthe Nation's job-training system go to conference?\n   This is another example of what is happening--or not happening here \nin the Senate. We have a bill--a bipartisan bill--that will help \nworkers get back to work or find better jobs. This bill will equip our \nworkforce with the skills necessary for America to compete--and \nsucceed--in the global economy. It reauthorizes and improves the \nNation's job training and employment system created under the Workforce \nInvestment Act.\n\n  The Workforce Investment Act provides job training and employment \nservices to more than 900,000 unemployed workers each year. Just like \nthe patient safety legislation, this bipartisan bill passed out of the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee unanimously. We passed \nit on the Senate floor by unanimous consent last November. That is as \nbipartisan as you can possibly get.\n  Where is the bill now? We can't get a conference committee appointed \nto resolve differences with the House. If we really want to take care \nof jobs and workers in this country, we should appoint conferees for \nthe Workforce Investment Act legislation. I can only conclude that my \nColleagues on the other side of the aisle are more concerned with \nelection year politics than helping American workers, or improving \npatient safety.\n  There are differences between Republicans and Democrats on most of \nthe big issues facing our Nation. If my colleagues in the minority want \nto bottle up legislation with which they disagree, that is their \nprerogative. But that is not what I am talking about.\n  What we have here are a few members of the minority party holding up \nbipartisan bills that receive unanimous approval in committee, and \nholding up conferences on bills that receive unanimous support on the \nSenate floor.\n  The only logical conclusion I can make is that these roadblocks are \nbased on politics, not policy, and that is a shame.\n  Right now, the Senate floor reminds me of the airspace above a busy \nairport. We have got a number of bipartisan bills lined up for their \nfinal approach, but our colleagues in the minority are holding these \nbills up and won't allow them to land. The tactics of my colleagues in \nthe minority give new meaning to the term ``holding pattern.''\n  It is time for our Democrat colleagues to break this holding pattern \nso that we can pass these bipartisan bills like the Patient Safety Act \nand the reauthorization of the Workforce Investment Act. These are not \nonly bipartisan bills, but they received unanimous committee support.\n  Let us set election politics aside for a moment. These are bipartisan \nbills, so no one party can claim credit for their passage. The Patient \nSafety Act was introduced by the distinguished Senator from Vermont, \nMr. Jeffords, who is the lone independent in the Senate. So this bill \nis more than bipartisan.\n  My distinguished colleague from Nevada, Senator Reid, suggested \nyesterday that we should just approve the House-passed patient safety \nbill. He suggested that he should just take up the House bill, rather \nthan pass the Senate bill, because the Members of the House are the \ntrue experts on complex legislation like this.\n  I wonder if my colleague's opinion would be the same on medical \nliability reform. After all, the expert legislators in the House have \nsent us some excellent legislation to reform our medical litigation \nsystem. Perhaps we should stop working on this in the Senate and just \napprove the House-passed bill.\n  Or perhaps we could take up the House-passed bill on the Workforce \nInvestment Act. I know my Democrat colleagues with whom I have worked \nto craft a Senate version are confident that our version is the \nsuperior one, but if Senator Reid believes that the Members of the \nHouse are superior legislators, perhaps he could convince my Democrat \ncoauthors that we ought to just take up the House bill and pass it. Or, \nas I have suggested, why don't we just agree to go to conference with \nthe House and come up with the best possible bill we can, one that \nreflects the expertise of Members of both the Senate and the House?\n  I hope our colleagues in the minority will agree to take 2 hours of \ntheir time to debate and vote on the bipartisan Patient Safety Act. Two \nhours is not a lot of time, and it is the least we can do on such an \nimportant piece of legislation. We have spent hours upon hours working \non this bill in committee and crafting a bill that received unanimous \nbipartisan support. Let us spend 2 more hours on the Patient Safety Act \nso that we improve the quality and safety of healthcare in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/15/senate-section/article/S8223-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8223-S8224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ENERGY CRISIS\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to set the record \nstraight regarding the Western energy crisis. Ken Lay, the former CEO \nof Enron, appeared on CNN's Larry King Live on Monday, July 12. Larry \nKing asked him:\n\n       Did Enron's problems or fortunes or misfortunes have \n     anything to do with hurting California and its energy \n     problem? Because a lot of politicians in California blamed \n     Enron.\n\n  Lay responded:\n\n       Well, they do, and I still think to this day falsely, \n     Larry. I mean, California, for the most part--I mean, \n     California, California regulators, politicians, et cetera, \n     caused the problem in California.\n\n  Let me set the record straight. During consideration of California's \nlegislation that deregulated the energy\n\n[[Page S8224]]\n\nmarket, Enron was at the center of the lobbying effort that crafted the \nbill.\n  Once the legislation was passed, Enron took full advantage of the \nloopholes it helped to create to manipulate and game the Western energy \nmarket. I would not argue that the system was perfect, but I would \nassert that Enron had a huge hand in creating such a flawed system, \nwhich it used to its benefit.\n  Enron, and other energy companies, created a business environment in \nwhich the bottom line mattered more than the public good.\n  As I have stated on this floor before, energy traders were completely \nunconcerned with customers having electricity as long as it meant that \nthey got an extra bonus that day.\n  And the fault does not lie solely with Enron. Other companies were \nalso involved with gaming the Western energy markets, including, but \nnot limited to: Dynegy, Reliant, Williams, El Paso, Duke, BP Energy, \nPortland General, AES, Mirant, CMS Energy, American Electric Power \nCompany, and Sempra Energy Trading.\n  The recently-released Enron tapes demonstrate the callousness of \nthese companies:\n  One trader complained: ``They're [expletive] taking all the money \nback from you guys? All the money you guys stole from those poor \ngrandmothers in California?''\n  A second responded: ``Yeah, grandma Millie, man.''\n  The first responded: ``Yeah, now she wants her [expletive] money back \nfor all the power you've charged right up, [expletive phrase], for \n[expletive] $250 a megawatt hour.''\n  The good news is that the figures responsible for running Enron are \nbeginning to be brought to justice. For instance, Ken Lay, along with \nformer Enron CEO Jeffrey K. Skilling and former Enron Chief Accounting \nOfficer Richard Causey, were indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice \non charges of conspiracy, securities fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud and \nmaking false statements.\n  The indictment alleges that at various times between at least 1999 \nand 2001, Lay, Skilling, Causey and other Enron executives engaged in a \nwide-ranging scheme to deceive the investing public, the U.S. \nSecurities and Exchange Commission and others about the true \nperformance of Enron's businesses.\n  The alleged scheme was designed to make it appear that: Enron was \ngrowing at a healthy and predictable rate, consistent with analysts' \npublished expectations; Enron did not have significant write-offs or \ndebt and was worthy of investment-grade credit rating; and, Enron was \ncomprised of a number of successful business units, and that the \ncompany had an appropriate cash flow.\n  These actions had the effect of inflating artificially Enron's stock \nprice, which increased from approximately $30 per share in early 1998 \nto over $80 per share in January 2001, and artificially stemming the \ndecline of the stock during the first three quarters of 2001.\n  The indictment also alleges that Lay had a significant profit motive \nfor participating in the scheme.\n  As stated in the indictment, Lay received approximately $300 million \nfrom the sale of Enron stock options and restricted stock between 1998 \nand 2001, netting over $217 million in profit, and was paid more than \n$19 million in salary and bonuses.\n  Lay received a salary of over $1 million, a bonus of $7 million and \n$3.6 million in long term incentive payments during 2001 alone.\n  Additionally, Lay sold 918,104 shares of Enron stock during the \nperiod of August 21 through Oct. 26, 2001, to repay advances totaling \n$26,025,000 he had received from a line of credit extended to Lay by \nEnron.\n  At that same time, California was overcharged by at least $9 billion. \nNow we at least know where some of that money went.\n  Yet even if Enron is forced to pay back the almost $2 billion it \novercharged California, bankruptcy will protect the company from paying \nback much more than 20 cents on the dollar.\n  It is my hope that as the evidence mounts against Ken Lay that the \ntruth about his, and Enron's, role in the Western energy crisis will \nleave no doubt in anyone's mind that the crisis was manufactured by \nunethical, greedy corporations.\n  California has suffered enough as a result of the crisis--it does not \nneed to suffer further from Ken Lay's mistruths.\n  Mr. President, thank you for letting me set the record straight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/15/senate-section/article/S8224-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON LIBRARY AND \n                          INFORMATION SERVICES\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 25th \nanniversary of both the first White House Conference on Library and \nInformation Services and the White House Conference on Library and \nInformation Services Taskforce, WHCLIST, as well as to applaud a \nbooklet, ``Libraries, Citizens & Advocacy: The Lasting Effects of Two \nWhite House Conferences on Library and Information Services,'' \npublished by WHCLIST in honor of this occasion.\n  As a result of the WHCLIST conferences and efforts--which have \nbrought together hundreds of thousands of citizen representatives and \nlibrary professionals--many Americans have discovered their community \nlibraries for the first time, hundreds of Friends of the Library groups \nhave formed, and a cadre of committed library supporters has emerged. \nThe conferences renewed our Nation's emphasis on libraries and have \nhelped spur my efforts to improve libraries.\n  The ``Libraries, Citizens & Advocacy'' report, which assesses the \noutcomes of the 1979 and 1991 White House Conferences on Library and \nInformation Services, concludes that the WHCLIST has effectively \nfocused the attention of the profession, trustees and advocates, and \nelected local, State, and national officials on the conferences' \nresolutions and recommendations. In the past quarter of a century, many \nof these resolutions and recommendations have been realized.\n  For example, resolutions from the 1979 conference included urging \nlibraries to play a greater role in literacy development; provide \nimproved access for minority groups, individuals with disabilities, and \nother underserved populations; and serve as a community center that \noffers recreation, social interaction, and an independent learning \ncenter. Delegates to the 1991 conference voted the Omnibus Children and \nYouth Initiative as the recommendation of greatest priority, including \nrecommendations for school libraries and children's services in public \nlibraries, intergenerational programming, and family literacy \npartnerships between library and Head Start personnel.\n  We have made significant progress toward improving the quality of \nschool libraries. Notably, the 1996 passage of the Library Services and \nTechnology Act made school libraries eligible to receive Federal funds \nfor training, networks, and statewide consortium activities, and the \nImproving Literacy through School Libraries program, which I authored \nand was included as part of the No Child Left Behind Act, restored \ncategorical funding for school libraries.\n  I have been proud to lead the way on these pieces of legislation, \nwhich ensure access to library and information services for library \npatrons of all ages, support the training and recruitment of \nlibrarians, and help provide the resources libraries need to improve \nliteracy skills and academic achievement. I am honored to continue in \nthe spirit of Senator Claiborne Pell's strong leadership on library \nissues.\n  I also wish to acknowledge the immense contributions and passionate \nadvocacy of two other leaders from my home State: Rose Ellen A. \nReynolds, current WHCLIST chair, and Joan Ress Reeves, delegate to the \n1979 and 1991 conferences and former WHCLIST chair.\n  Let us recognize the White House Conference on Library and \nInformation Taskforce on this 25th anniversary and celebrate the role \nit has played in improving our communities' libraries and our Nation's \nliteracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/15/senate-section/article/S8224-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8224-S8225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DO THE WRITE THING 2004\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Do the Write Thing Challenge, sponsored \nby the National Campaign to Stop Violence, is a national writing \ncontest in which students express their concerns\n\n[[Page S8225]]\n\nabout subjects such as domestic violence, easy access to guns, and gang \nactivity.\n  Do the Write Thing currently operates in 14 cities, including \nDetroit, MI. Over the past 9 years, more than 285,000 students from \nmiddle schools from around the country have participated in this \ncontest. During this past school year, over 85,000 middle school \nstudents participated in youth violence discussions and roundtables \nsponsored by the Do the Write Thing Challenge. Some 28,000 students \nchose to submit contributions to their local Do the Write Thing \nChallenge committee.\n  Over 2,500 school finalists were honored at local recognition \nceremonies and had their writings published and distributed locally. \nNext week, two national finalists from each participating jurisdiction \nwill be honored at a national recognition ceremony in Washington, DC. \nAlso during next week's National Recognition Week, the finalists will \npresent their views on youth violence to such national leaders as the \nSecretary of Education, the Attorney General, the Administrator of the \nOffice of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention and Members of \nthe House and Senate. In addition, their writings will be published and \nplaced in the Library of Congress.\n  The works, ranging from poems to essays to stories, all describe the \nimpact of violence in the lives of children. I am pleased that the \nNational Campaign to Stop Violence will honor two students from \nMichigan, Michael Williams and Starlyn Robinson, for their poems on \nyouth violence. I commend these two young people for their hard work \nand I know my colleagues join me in celebrating the efforts of middle \nschool students from around the country.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Michael and Starlyn's poems be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Starlyn Robinson, Bates

  A piece of paper,\n     An invitation,\n     For a seemingly fun\n     Celebration.\n\n     The party was Friday\n     Shadina had a week to prepare,\n     But she started that second\n     Choosing what to wear.\n     Invitations were infrequent,\n     The people carefully selected.\n     Lots were left out\n     Feeling painfully neglected.\n     Not one of her friends\n     Was cool enough to get invited.\n     That made Shadina feel special,\n     And even more delighted.\n     Her friend reminded her\n     She'd need permission to go.\n     Sick of her bragging,\n     She hoped Mrs. Moss said, No.\n\n     The party was late,\n     After midnight\n     So of course her mother refused\n     Causing a fight.\n     Shadina was defiant,\n     Decided to rebel\n     Unaware of the fact\n     The party wouldn't end well.\n     Not owning a car\n     Shadina was stuck,\n     A boy offered her a ride\n     She thought it was good luck.\n     She knew the boy\n     Jason, from school.\n     He was nice, and invited\n     So evidently he was cool.\n     They talked a lot,\n     For a good long while.\n     She knew everything about him.\n     Even the length of his smile.\n     She knew his favorite color,\n     And that he liked to use slang,\n     But what she didn't know\n     Was that he was in a gang.\n\n     They arrived at the party\n     And started to have fun.\n     They laughed and said hi\n     To almost everyone.\n     Except for that boy\n     With bad intentions.\n     An enemy of the gang, Jason\n     Supposedly forgot to mention.\n     He wasn't invited,\n     And shouldn't have been there,\n     But be had a gun and some bullets\n     And didn't seem to care.\n     He locked and loaded,\n     Aimed straight for Jason's head\n     But Shadina was the one\n     That wound up dead.\n     With a BANG and a gasp,\n     Shadina took her last breath\n     And all those surrounding\n     Witnessed her death.\n     This story has a few morals,\n     Be nice to everyone;\n     If the boy was invited\n     He might not have brought a gun.\n\n     Had Jason not been in a gang\n     Shadina would still be alive,\n     But the deed is done\n     And she can never be revived.\n     Why do we need guns?\n     Do we have to kill each other?\n     My grandfather was shot\n     By my step-grandmother.\n     I'll miss the grandfather\n     I never got to meet.\n     I wish my step-grandma\n     Wasn't packing heat.\n     But like Shadina\n     He's gone to a better place,\n     Leaving this world\n     Witbout a trace.\n     Why would we make gun,\n     Then wonder about the death rate?\n     These are things we made\n     We decided to create.\n     When you sense hostility\n     On a persons face\n     Leave them alone,\n     Let them have their

 \n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. J. DEOTHA MALONE\n\n Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to an \neducator who has not only been an exemplary teacher, administrator, and \ncommunity servant, but also has the distinguished honor of being the \nlongest serving educator in the region we call Middle Tennessee. Dr. J. \nDeotha Malone will retire from the Sumner County Board of Education \ntoday. She has been dedicated to educating the students in Middle \nTennessee for more than 55 years.\n\n[[Page S8226]]\n\n  Dr. Malone's career in education has been filled with many \nachievements. She has taught students from pre-school through the \ncollege levels. This Tennessean began her teaching career at Union High \nSchool in Gallatin, TN, in 1949 where she taught English and civics and \nwas the class sponsor.\n  Dr. Malone did not limit her role as an educator to the classroom. \nShe opened her home as well, holding remedial classes in reading and \nteaching beginners French, all free of charge. She held classes for \nyoung pregnant women in the basement of the local health department \nbefore they were enrolled in the homebound programs. She taught the \nfourth and sixth grades, directed the ESL programs for 12 years, was a \nHead Start teacher and later became the supervisor of that program.\n  In 1969, Dr. Malone was appointed supervisor of elementary education \nfor Sumner County and in the same year became supervisor of adult \neducation. In 1981, she was appointed supervisor of secondary education \nand she continues in that capacity today. She also remains the \ncoordinator of district policy for Titles VI and IX.\n  Dr. Malone has dedicated her life to public service--and not only as \nan educator. In 1958, she became the first African-American female \nnotary public in Sumner County. She was subsequently trained by H & R \nBlock to prepare income taxes--a service she rendered free of charge to \nthose not able to afford the fees. Dr. Malone was elected to the \nGallatin City Council in 1969.

The town was named for John Shaw \nGregory, a councilman and representative in the Dakota Territory \nLegislature from 1862 until 1868. Gregory also served in the United \nStates Navy for 12 years and was appointed ``Special Agent to the \nPoncas'' in 1859 and worked on the Ponca Indian Reservation.\n  Soon after the town's founding in 1908, the North Western Line \nRailroad brought 15 trains daily to Gregory. Today Gregory boasts more \nthan 50 businesses and over 1,200 residents. The annual pheasant season \nin October attracts sportsmen from across the Nation.\n  To celebrate its 100th anniversary, the residents of Gregory will \nhold the Oscar Micheaux Film Festival, a celebration featuring the \nLewis and Clark Journey and Discovery, and a Crazy Day Fire Department \nFilm Festival and Appreciation Day. Celebrations have already begun and \nwill continue throughout the year.

Mr. President, today I honor and publicly \nrecognize the 125th anniversary of the founding of the town of \nWatertown, SD. The town of Watertown has a proud past and a promising \nfuture. In 1878, the Winona and St. Peter Railroad settled the area \nthat became known as Watertown.\n  Previously, in 1873, the railroad company had established a \nsettlement called Kampeska. Eventually, due to a lack of railroad \nconstruction beyond Kampeska, many of the town's residents moved to \nWatertown. By the end of 1878, Watertown had become the county seat of \nCodington County. In that same year, the town's first railroad station \nand post office were built. By February, the population of the town was \n509.\n  In 1880, the U.S. Land Office opened in Watertown and subsequently \nopened ``surplus'' land on the Sisseton-Wahpeton Reservation to \nsettlement. In that same year, the town's first bank opened.\n  From 1898 to 1915, Watertown grew rapidly and became the wholesale \nand retail trade center for much of Northeast South Dakota. By the end \nof World War I, four major railroad companies operated eight routes \ninto and out of town, making the town a transportation center and \nfacilitating its growth.\n  Watertown and Codington County veterans have served in all major wars \nand conflicts of the 20th century, with 18 dying in WWI, 57 in World \nWar II, 2 in Korea, and 11 in Vietnam. A World War II U.S. Navy \ndestroyer-escort was named USS Gustafson in honor of a young naval \nofficer, Lt. Arthur Gustafson, a resident of Watertown who was killed \nwhen the Japanese attacked his ship in early 1942.\n  The loss of a large meatpacking plant and other agricultural-related \nconcerns by the 1960s and 1970s alerted city and county officials to \nthe necessity of diversifying the local economy. Watertown embarked on \na program of industrial and economic diversification. What is today \nLake Area Technical Institute began in the 1960s and has provided \ntechnical education to thousands of students since that time. Watertown \nbecame a regional medical center with the consolidation of hospital \nfacilities into the Prairie Lakes Healthcare System in the 1980s.\n  In the 1990s, nationally and internationally known artist Terry \nRedlin, a Watertown native, came back to his home town to establish the \nRedlin Art Center, a gallery of more than 140 of his original oil \npaintings. The Center opened in 1997 and, by 2004, over 1.5 million \nvisitors had been through its doors. A tremendous asset for Watertown, \nit has attracted visitors from all 50 States and over 30 foreign \ncountries.\n  To celebrate the town's anniversary, Watertown hosted a Mayor's \nBreakfast, including recognition of the town's 125th anniversary in the \n4th of July parade and hosted a ``crazy days'' celebration. \nCelebrations will continue throughout the year and include a dinner and \ndance on New Year's Eve. It is with great honor that I advise my \ncolleagues of the achievements made by this great community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/15/senate-section/article/S8226-3", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8226-S8227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  LEGISLATION AND SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS TO IMPLEMENT THE UNITED STATES-\n               MOROCCO FREE TRADE AGREEMENT (FTA)--PM 91\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit legislation and supporting documents \nprepared by my Administration to implement the United States-Morocco \nFree Trade Agreement (the ``Agreement'' or the ``FTA''). This Agreement \nenhances our bilateral relationship with a longstanding partner in the \nNorth Africa and Middle East region. The Agreement will benefit the \npeople of the United States and Morocco, illustrating to other \ndeveloping countries the advantages of open markets.\n  This Agreement is a strong demonstration of my Administration's \ncommitment to opening markets, leveling the playing field, and \nexpanding opportunities for American workers, manufacturers, \nbusinesses, farmers, and consumers. In negotiating this Agreement, my \nAdministration was guided by the negotiating objectives set out in the \nTrade Act of 2002. The Agreement will expand Morocco's market for U.S. \nmanufactured goods, agricultural products, services, and investment. As \nsoon as this Agreement enters into force, tariffs will be eliminated on \nvirtually all manufactured goods traded between our countries.\n  The Agreement provides U.S. producers of beef, poultry, wheat, corn, \nsoybeans, and other agriculture products with increased access to \nMorocco's market, while complementing Morocco's agriculture reform \nprogram. In addition, the Agreement provides the opportunity for U.S. \nproducers to adjust to increased imports from Morocco, if necessary.\n\n[[Page S8227]]\n\n  New opportunities for U.S. services firms will be opened, U.S. \ninvestment will be protected, and U.S. companies will be able to \nparticipate in government procurement opportunities on the same basis \nas Moroccan firms. This Agreement has some of the strongest \nintellectual property protections ever contained in a U.S. trade \nagreement with a developing country.\n  The United States and Morocco have agreed to cooperate on environment \nand labor issues and to establish mechanisms supporting those efforts. \nNegotiation of this Agreement has promoted adoption of a new labor law \nin Morocco. This Agreement has also helped lead to improved domestic \nenvironmental laws in Morocco, and a number of additional cooperative \nprojects have been identified for future work.\n  The approval of this Agreement will be another important step in \nimplementing our plan for a broader Middle East Free Trade Area. \nIndeed, this Agreement offers the United States an opportunity to \nencourage economic reform in a moderate Muslim nation, as we have done \nwith the Jordan FTA and the recently concluded Bahrain FTA. Leaders in \nMorocco support a reformist and tolerant vision that includes free \nparliamentary elections, the sale of state-owned businesses, the \nencouragement of foreign investment that can be connected to broad-\nbased development, and better protection of the rights of women and \nworkers. It is strongly in the interests of the United States to \nembrace these reforms and do what we can to encourage them. Passing \nthis Agreement is a critical step in that direction.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to extend the temporary increase in payments under \nthe medicare program for home health services furnished in a rural \narea; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Medicare \nRural Home Health Payment Fairness Act. This legislation would extend \nthe additional payment for home health services delivered in rural \nareas. This additional 5 percent reimbursement is currently scheduled \nto sunset on April 1, 2005. This legislation would make the additional \nreimbursement permanent.\n  I note the presence of one of the strongest advocates of home health \ncare, and that is my colleague from Missouri, Senator Bond. He has \nworked tirelessly to make certain that our seniors and disabled \ncitizens are able to receive the home health care they need. I am very \npleased to have him as one of the key supporters of this legislation.\n  Home health care has become an increasingly important part of our \nhealth care system. The kinds of highly skilled and often technically \ncomplex services that our home health caregivers provide have enabled \nmillions of our most frail and vulnerable older and disabled citizens \nto avoid hospitals and nursing homes and to receive health care just \nwhere they want to be--in the comfort, privacy, and security of their \nown homes.\n  I have had the great honor of accompanying several of Maine's caring \nhome health nurses on their visits to serve their patients. I have seen \nfirsthand the difference that they are making for Maine's elderly. I \nremember visiting one elderly couple who told me that it was home \nhealth care that allowed them to stay together in their very own home, \nrather than being separated with one of them being forced to go into a \nnursing home in the remaining years of their life. Another woman told \nme that her late husband received home health care in the months \nleading up to his death. That had allowed him to be treated at home and \nto be with his family, which is where he very much wanted to be.\n\n  Nevertheless, surveys have shown that the delivery of home health \nservices in rural areas can be as much as 12 to 15 percent more costly \nbecause of the extra travel time required to cover long distances \nbetween patients, the higher transportation expenses, and other \nfactors. Because of the longer travel times, rural caregivers are \nunable to make as many visits in a day as their urban counterparts. The \nexecutive director of Visiting Nurses of Aroostook in northern Maine \nwhere I am from tells me that her agency covers 6,600 square miles with \na population of only 73,000 people. Her costs are understandably much \nhigher than other agencies due to the long distances her staff must \ndrive to see their clients. Moreover, her staff is obviously not able \nto see as many patients in a day.\n  Agencies in rural areas are also frequently smaller than their urban \ncounterparts, which means that their relative costs are higher. Smaller \nagencies with fewer patients and fewer visits mean that fixed costs, \nparticularly those associated with meeting regulatory requirements, are \nspread over a much smaller number of patients and visits, thus \nincreasing overall the per-patient and per-visit costs. Moreover, in \nmany rural areas, home health agencies are the primary caregivers for \nhomebound beneficiaries with limited access to transportation. These \nrural patients often require more time and care than urban patients and \nare understandably more expensive for home health agencies to serve. If \nthe rural extra payment is not extended, agencies may be forced to make \ndecisions\n\n[[Page S8231]]\n\nnot to accept patients living in remote areas who have greater care \nneeds. That would translate into less access to health care for ill \nhomebound seniors.\n  Failure to extend the rural add-on payment will only put more \npressure on rural home health agencies that are already operating on \nvery narrow margins. It could force some of these agencies to close \ntheir doors altogether. Many home health agencies operating in rural \nareas are the only home health providers in large geographic areas. If \nany of these agencies is forced to close, the Medicare patients in that \nregion could lose all their access to home health care.\n  The bipartisan legislation I am introducing today, with Senators \nLincoln, Bond, Feingold, Thomas, Conrad, and Burns, will help to ensure \nthat Medicare patients in rural areas continue to have access to the \nhome health services they very much need. I urge all of our colleagues \nto join us as cosponsors. We must act to ensure that this extra payment \ndoes not expire next April 1.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I compliment my colleague from Maine for \nbeing a true champion and leader for assuring good home health care \naccess to our seniors, disabled, and others who need specialized care. \nAs she has done in Maine, I have done in Missouri and found that access \nto home health care is critically important. It is, No. 1, convenient, \neasier, more friendly, and more compassionate for the patients. No. 2, \nall of the statistics we have seen show home health care is more \neffective to treat people. They get well better.\n  Finally, it makes sense economically. When cuts in Medicare shut down \na home health care agency in one rural county in northwest Missouri, 40 \npatients who had been treated for an average of $400,000 a year were \nforced to go to institutionalized care. Only 30 of them showed up. I \nhate to guess what happened to the other 10. Their cost for 1 year--it \nwas $400,000--became $1.4 million. It was a terrible tragedy in human. \nterms, in health terms, and in economic terms.\n  I am proud to join my colleague from Maine.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 2660. A bill to provide for the monitoring of the long-term \nmedical health of firefighters who responded to emergencies in certain \ndisaster areas; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as we are entering the fire season in \nCalifornia, I am today introducing the Healthy Firefighters Act.\n  Last year, I offered this bill as an amendment to the Healthy Forests \nRestoration Act, and it passed the Senate by a vote of 94-3. \nUnfortunately, House Republicans insisted on dropping this important \nproposal in conference.\n  Last year my State experienced devastating wildfires. Those fires \nkilled 24 people, including one firefighter. Over 750,000 acres burned. \nMore than 3,700 homes were destroyed in five Southern California \ncounties. Thousands of firefighters from local, State and Federal \nagencies responded to these fires.\n  Those firefighters--and in fact most firefighters who respond to \nFederal disasters--are at higher risk of long-term health problems \nbecause of exposure to several toxins, including fine particulates, \ncarbon monoxide, sulfur, formaldehyde, mercury, heavy metals, and \nbenzene. As a result, their long-term health should be monitored so \nthat any consequences can be identified, leading to early detection and \nbetter treatment.\n  The Healthy Firefighters Act does just that. It requires long-term \nhealth monitoring of firefighters who respond to a crisis in any \nfederally-declared disaster area. This long-term monitoring will be \ncarried out by the U.S. Fire Administration (USFA) in consultation with \nthe National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). The \nUSFA will work with a locally based medical research university so that \nlocal experts are involved in this important effort.\n  This legislation is supported by the International Association of \nFirefighters, the National Volunteer Fire Council, and the California \nState Firefighters' Association. I ask unanimous consent that support \nletters from these organizations be placed in the Record.\n  We owe it to our Nation's firefighters. Our Nation's firefighters put \ntheir lives on the line to protect us. The least we can do is to help \nthem remain healthy by providing long-term health monitoring. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in this effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that several letters of support be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                         International Association\n\n\n                                             of Fire Fighters,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 2, 2004.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: On behalf of the Nation's more than \n     260,000 professional fire fighters and emergency medical \n     personnel, I wish to express our enthusiastic support for \n     your proposal to provide medical monitoring for fire fighters \n     who respond to nationally declared disasters.\n       In recent years, we have become increasingly aware that the \n     greatest dangers fire fighters face are often not the ones \n     that take lives on the fireground, but those that kill and \n     disable years later. Fire fighters who respond to disasters \n     often face prolonged exposure to unknown toxins. Medical \n     monitoring of these fire fighters will enable early detection \n     and treatment for the job-related illnesses that result.\n       Equally important, the information, gleaned from this \n     project will enable us to develop better protective clothing \n     and equipment in the future. Thus, this program has the \n     potential to both save the lives of fire fighters who have \n     been exposed to dangerous substances and prevent harmful \n     exposures in the future.\n       The Nation's fire fighters thank you for your extraordinary \n     efforts championing this legislation, and we stand ready to \n     assist you in moving this important initiative forward\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Harold A. Schaitberger,\n     General President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              National Volunteer Fire Council,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 30, 2004.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: The National Volunteer Fire Council \n     (NVFC) is a nonprofit membership association representing the \n     more than 800,000 members of America's volunteer fire, EMS, \n     and rescue services. Organized in 1976, the NVFC serves as \n     the voice of America's volunteer fire personnel in over \n     28,000 departments across the country. On behalf of our \n     membership, I would like to express our support for your \n     proposed legislation, the Healthy Firefighters Act, which \n     would provide for the monitoring of the long-term medical \n     health of firefighters who respond to emergencies in any area \n     which is declared a disaster area by the Federal Government.\n       As you know, firefighters, 75 percent of which are \n     volunteers, respond to a wide array of emergencies--including \n     structure and wildland fires, medical calls, motor vehicle \n     accidents, natural disasters and acts of terrorism. Very \n     often, the severe toll that is taken on their health is \n     traceable to these events; though not always quickly \n     recognizable.\n       More specifically, your legislation would direct the U.S. \n     Fire Administration, in conjunction with the National \n     Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, to contract \n     with appropriate medical research universities to conduct \n     long-term medical health monitoring of those firefighters who \n     responded to Federally-declared emergencies. This monitoring \n     includes pulmonary illness, neurological damage, and \n     cardiovascular damage.\n       Once again, the NVFC commends your efforts to ensure that \n     firefighters are properly monitored to guarantee that they \n     don't encounter long-term health problems due to responding \n     to national emergencies. If you or your staff have any \n     questions or comments feel free to contact Craig Sharman, \n     NVFC Director of Government Relations at (202) 887-5700 ext. \n     12.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Philip C. Stittleburg\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  California State\n\n\n                               Firefighters' Association, Inc.\n\n                                Sacramento, CA, February 20, 2004.\n     Re Support Healthy Firefighters Act.\n\n     Senator Barbara Boxer,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer, the California State Firefighters' \n     Association (CSFA), the oldest and largest firefighter \n     association in the state of California, representing over \n     29,000 firefighters and EMS personnel strongly supports your \n     legislation to provide for the monitoring of the long-term \n     medical health of firefighters who responded to emergencies \n     recently in certain disaster areas.\n       This important legislation will require that the United \n     States Fire Administration, in conjunction with the National \n     Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, shall contract \n     with an appropriate, locally based medical research \n     university to conduct long-term medical health monitoring of \n     those\n\n[[Page S8232]]\n\n     firefighters who responded to emergencies in any areas \n     referred to in subsection (b).\n       (b) Affected Firefighters.--An area referred to in this \n     subsection is any area which is declared a disaster area by \n     the Federal Government.\n       (c) Health Monitoring.--The long-term health monitoring \n     referred to in subsection (a) shall include pulmonary \n     illness, neurological damage, and cardiovascular damage.\n       (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this section, an as-yet-to-be \n     announced sum of money for each of fiscal years 2005 through \n     2009.\n       Thank you for authoring this important piece of \n     legislation. Please feel free to forward and use our \n     endorsement of your bill in any way. We look forward to \n     working with you to ensure passage of this measure.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                    Afrack Vargas,\n                                             Legislative Advocate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Chambliss):\n  S. 2661. A bill to clarify the effects of revocation of a visa, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nfix a loophole in our visa policies that has and could continue to have \ndetrimental consequences on our national security. I have been pressing \nthe Departments of State and Homeland Security for the last year to \nmake changes to visa revocation certificates so that we can question, \ndetain, or deport foreigners who were not supposed to be granted a \nvisa. It was one year ago today that the Senate Judiciary Committee \nheld a hearing on this problem.\n  For example, it is extremely difficult to detain and deport suspected \nterrorists whose visas have been revoked on terrorism grounds after \nthose persons have set foot on U.S. soil. The difficulty stems from the \nwording on the revocation certificates, which are issued by the State \nDepartment. However, by law, the Department of Homeland Security has \npolicy authority over visa issuance.\n  On June 17, 2003, a GAO report revealed that suspected terrorists can \nstay in the country after their visas have been revoked on terrorism \ngrounds because of a legal loophole in the wording of revocation \npapers. This loophole came to light after the GAO found that more than \n100 persons were granted visas that were later revoked because there \nwas evidence the persons had terrorism links and associations. I wrote \na letter to the Department of State on June 23, 2003, and both the \nHouse and Senate Judiciary Committees held hearings on the matter last \nyear.\n  Some of us in Congress expected the government to fix this problem \nimmediately, especially after GAO brought it to the attention of your \ndepartment and other agencies. Perhaps this expectation was naive. More \nthan a month after the GAO report and the hearings on the matter, I \npressed the issue further with Under Secretary Hutchinson during a July \n23, 2003 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.\n  We all recognized that a simple administrative fix, such as re-\nwriting the revocation certificate, would solve the problem. In fact, \nAssistant Secretary Hutchinson personally pledged to me in July of last \nyear that the Department of Homeland Security would issue regulations \nto fix it as soon as the Memo of Understanding with the Department of \nState was finalized. The Memo was signed on September 29, 2003.\n  On May 20 of this year, a member of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity confirmed that a regulation was written and being circulated \ninternally.\n  But, here we are--more than a year after the GAO first revealed the \nloophole--and it appears that the problem still has not been solved.\n  This week, the GAO issued a report that said ``additional actions are \nneeded to eliminate weaknesses in the visa revocation process.'' The \nGAO recommends that the Secretaries of Homeland Security and State \njointly develop a written governmentwide policy that clearly defines \nroles and responsibilities and sets performance standards for the \nagencies involved in the visa revocation process.\n  Frankly, I think these Departments have had enough time to consult \nwith each other. Today, I offer a legislative fix.\n  It is amazing to me that such a simple and straightforward solution \nto such a dangerous and well-known problem continues to languish in the \nslow-moving bureaucracy. Promises were made, but the promises have not \nbeen kept. The visa revocation loophole needs to be fixed.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise in support of legislation that \nSenator Grassley and I are introducing that will finally close a \nloophole in our Nation's homeland security. Exactly one year ago today, \nI held a hearing in the Immigration and Border Security Subcommittee to \nquestion why visa revocation is not effective to remove a suspected \nterrorist from the United States. This issue was highlighted in a June \n2003 General Accounting Office report titled, ``New Policies and \nProcedures Needed to Fill Gaps in the Visa Revocation Process.'' \nSubsequently, I held another hearing in the Subcommittee last fall in \nwhich the Departments of State and Homeland Security assured me and my \ncolleagues that the problem would be sufficiently addressed through a \ncooperative agreement.\n  Now a year later, we still don't have this problem fully fixed, and \nearlier this month the GAO issued a second report titled, ``Additional \nActions Needed to Eliminate Weaknesses in the Visa Revocation \nProcess.'' The legislation we introduce today will make the needed, \ncommon sense change to empower the visa revocation process as an anti-\nterrorism tool.\n  One problem we have realized after September 11 was the lack of \ninformation sharing across Federal agencies. It is not just keeping bad \nguys out of the United States that is important, but if someone comes \ninto this country who has a suspicious background, everyone needs to be \non the same wavelength with respect to sharing of information on \nindividuals in an effective manner. Information sharing and \ncoordination between the State Department and the Department of \nHomeland Security is crucial today more than ever. We must continue to \nreshape the government culture, away from old bureaucratic habits, \ntoward strong interagency cooperation in order to safeguard our Nation.\n  The GAO report exposes how suspected terrorists may remain at large \neven after their visas have been revoked. Last summer, the GAO found 30 \npersons whose visas were revoked on terrorism grounds; however, \nrevocation gives no legal authority for law enforcement officials to \nremove them. In hearings before Congress, the State Department and \nHomeland Security Department maintained that they were implementing \nmethods to resolve the problem by tracking visa revocations more \nprecisely, sharing information more efficiently, and hopefully removing \nsuch suspected terrorists.\n  In a report released this month, the GAO found that, although the two \nDepartments made some changes, the visa revocation process still lacks \na timely transmission of information between agencies--not to mention \nthe absence of legal authority to remove these suspected terrorists. \nAfter two GAO reports and two Senate hearings, the Departments still \ndon't have their act together.\n  Our bill empowers visa revocation as an anti-terrorism tool. First, \nit makes revocation a ground of inadmissibility for a person's \nimmigration status. This will give the Department of Homeland Security \nthe authority to remove a suspected terrorist from the U.S. Second, the \nlegislation forecloses the judicial review process on inadmissibility \nbased on a revoked visa, which is consistent with how the U.S. handles \nother visa-related matters.\n  With visa revocation, it is difficult to understand why, after a year \nnow, State Department action to nullify the visa of a suspected \nterrorist does not translate into the authority for the Homeland \nSecurity to remove that person. The point is that in a post- 9-11 \nworld, visa issuance--and revocation--is a homeland security job and we \nmust get it right. I encourage the Departments to move forward on this \nissue as we've addressed it in the bill we introduce today.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 2663. A bill to amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate \na segment to the Farmington River and Salmon Brook in the State of \nConnecticut for study for potential addition to the National Wild and \nScenic Rivers System, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n[[Page S8233]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I join with my colleague Senator \nLieberman in introducing the Lower Farmington River and Salmon Brook \nWild and Scenic River Study Act of 2004. I am pleased that \nRepresentative Johnson of Connecticut introduced companion legislation \nin the House of Representatives.\n  The Lower Farmington River is a 40-mile stretch between the \nCollinsville Dam in Burlington and the Rainbow Dam in Windsor. The \nflood plains on either side of the river support large amphibian, bird, \ninsect, and reptile populations, with many species that are on the \nState of Connecticut's list of endangered, threatened and special \nconcern species. Biologists have stated that sections of this stretch \nof river have regionally and possibly globally significant plant \ncommunities, making the river one of the most thriving and diverse \necosystems in Connecticut.\n  The river is also significant for its cultural heritage. Numerous \nTunxis and River Indian tribe archaeological sites are located \nthroughout the flood plain. During the 18th and 19th centuries the \nriver was used extensively as a conduit for commerce and many towns \nalong the river flourished due to complex mill and canal systems \nassociated with the river.\n  Besides environmental and historical benefits, the Lower Farmington \nRiver provides excellent opportunities for recreation including \ncanoeing, kayaking, and rowing. The river also passes through the \nTariffville Gorge, which is unique in Southern New England, in that it \nsupports Class II-IV whitewater kayaking twelve months a year and has \nhosted the Olympic trials.\n  However, the Farmington River is beginning to show evidence of \ndeclining water quality. Designation as a Wild and Scenic River would \nensure that the river and surrounding watershed are protected under a \nlocally controlled river management plan, which works to preserve a \nriver's natural and significant resources.\n  I am confident of the Lower Farmington River and Salmon Brook's \nsignificance and community support. The Connecticut towns of \nFarmington, Simsbury, Bloomfield, Burlington, Canton, Avon, East \nGranby, and Windsor have joined with the Farmington River Watershed \nAssociation in requesting designation as a Wild and Scenic River. \nProperty owners along the river support designation in order to \npreserve this natural resource that flows by and near their property. \nConnecticut is a small state, at just over 5,500 square miles, and is \ndensely populated. Our citizens are committed to balancing conservation \nand growth. That is why this designation is so important. While the \nstate and local groups have done exceptional work so far, this \ndesignation would bring in Federal technical assistance and foster \ncoordination among the many concerned groups.\n  In 1994, a 14-mile stretch of the Upper Farmington River was \ndesignated as a Wild and Scenic River and it has been a remarkable \nsuccess story. Representatives of the five affected towns meet \nregularly with Federal, State and local organizations to implement a \nriver management plan that all parties adopted. Our legislation \nproposes to study the feasibility of designating the lower section of \nthe Farmington River and the Salmon Brook as part of the Act. The Wild \nand Scenic River Program has been a successful public and private \npartnership to preserve certain select rivers in a free flowing state \nand the Lower Farmington River and the Salmon Brook are significant \nnatural resources.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this worthy legislation and I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2663\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Lower Farmington River and \n     Salmon Brook Wild and Scenic River Study Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DESIGNATION OF ADDITIONAL SEGMENT OF FARMINGTON RIVER \n                   AND SALMON BROOK IN CONNECTICUT FOR STUDY FOR \n                   POTENTIAL ADDITION TO NATIONAL WILD AND SCENIC \n                   RIVERS SYSTEM.\n\n       (a) Designation.--Section 5(a) of the Wild and Scenic \n     Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. 1276(a)) is amended by adding at the \n     end the following:\n       ``(__) Lower Farmington River and Salmon Brook, \n     Connecticut.--The segment of the Farmington River downstream \n     from the segment designated as a recreational river by \n     section 3(a)(156) to its confluence with the Connecticut \n     River, and the segment of the Salmon Brook including its \n     mainstream and east and west branches.''.\n       (b) Time for Submission.--Not later than 3 years after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior \n     shall submit to Congress a report containing the results of \n     the study required by the amendment made by subsection (a).\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out \n     this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself and Mr. Smith):\n  S. 2671. A bill to extend temporary State fiscal relief, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and \ncolleague from Oregon, Mr. Smith, to introduce the State Fiscal Relief \nAct of 2004. This legislation will extend the Federal fiscal relief \nenacted last year in order to give states a much needed boost as they \ncontinue to struggle to recover from the persisting economic downturn.\n  Over the last three years, states have experienced the worst fiscal \ncrisis since World War II. The loss of state tax revenue has caused \nsubstantial state budget deficits, which totaled over $250 billion in \nfiscal years 2002, 2003 and 2004. These shortfalls forced states to \nconsider raising taxes or making substantial cuts to critical programs \nsuch as public education, health care, and public safety. As my \ncolleagues know, Federal efforts to stimulate economic growth can be \nfutile if states are forced to cut spending and increase taxes. We \nrecognized this last year, and we did something about it. We enacted \nlegislation that provided $20 billion in federal assistance to the \nstates--$10 billion for Medicaid and $10 billion for general revenue \ngrants.\n  Some of my colleagues have since questioned the benefit of this type \nof federal assistance to the States. They have charged that the relief \nwas not stimulative and that states did not use the additional \nresources appropriately. Well, I encourage my colleagues to take a very \ncareful look at the facts. When you analyze all the available data on \nthe $20 billion fiscal relief package enacted last year, only one \nlogical conclusion can be reached--during the worst stages of the \neconomic downturn, when many Americans lost their jobs, states were \nable to step up and fill major gaps in programs and services because \nthey had the benefit of federal fiscal relief. My home state of West \nVirginia used the $125 million it received in federal assistance to \nresolve budget shortfalls and prevent cuts in Medicaid. That was the \ngoal of our efforts all along--to reduce state budget deficits and \nprevent cuts to critical programs and services--and states used this \ntemporary assistance as it was intended.\n  In West Virginia and States across the country, fiscal relief \nstrengthened state economies and protected our most vulnerable citizens \nby helping to reduce the massive spending cuts and tax increases states \nwould otherwise have had to make. The Medicaid portion of fiscal relief \nwas particularly important in helping to stabilize State budgets. As \nmany of my colleagues are aware, Medicaid spending provides a critical \nform of economic stimulus in addition to delivering essential health \nservices to our most vulnerable citizens. The Medicaid program supports \njobs in every state. It helps keep hospitals and nursing homes \noperating in our communities. Every dollar invested in Medicaid results \nin an almost three-fold return in state economic benefit.\n  In January, the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured \nreleased a study which confirms that, because of the timeliness of the \nMedicaid assistance, all fifty states were able to maintain their \nMedicaid eligibility levels. This means that access to critical health \nservices and programs for pregnant women, children, the elderly, and \nworkers who lost their jobs and employer-sponsored health coverage was \npreserved. Without these increased Medicaid payments to States, the \nnumber of uninsured Americans would have been far greater over the past \nseveral years.\n  Unfortunately, when we passed fiscal relief last year, we did not \ninclude appropriate safeguards to make sure this\n\n[[Page S8234]]\n\nFederal assistance would remain available to States if the economic \ndownturn lasted longer than anticipated. Many who supported the $20 \nbillion fiscal relief package hoped the economy would rebound quickly \nand that federal assistance to the States would not be necessary beyond \nfiscal year 2004. Well, the fact of the matter is that the economy \nremains weak, and fiscal relief is still necessary.\n  While states are beginning to report stronger revenue growth, it is \nclear they are not out of the woods yet. State revenues are still far \nbelow pre-recession levels and are growing at a sluggish pace. In \nApril, the National Conference of State Legislatures reported that \nstates are struggling with an aggregate budget deficit of $36 billion \ngoing into fiscal year 2005. Eliminating fiscal relief now will deal a \nserious blow to the states as they struggle to climb out of the \neconomic downturn.\n  To remedy this problem, the bill we are introducing today provides \n$4.8 billion over 15 months to help states maintain the coverage they \nare currently providing through Medicaid. This additional funding, \nwhich is still temporary, will finish the job we started last year. It \nwill help states weather the entirety of the economic downturn without \nhaving to cut vital programs and services for low-income women, \nchildren, and seniors. While I would have liked to have incorporated \neven more money for enhanced Medicaid payments to states, I recognize \nthe federal budget realities currently before us. The $4.8 billion \nincluded in our bill represents a workable phase-down transition from \nthe $10 billion states received last year, and I know it will go a long \nway to preserve health care coverage for Medicaid beneficiaries during \nthis ongoing recession.\n  In addition to providing $4.8 billion for Medicaid, our bill also \nreimburses states for the $1.2 billion in net costs they will incur in \nfiscal years 2004, 2005, and 2006 as a result of the Medicare \nPrescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act. As I stated when \nI voted against this bill, the Medicare Modernization Act has several \nmajor flaws that must be addressed. One such flaw is the fact that the \nnew law undermines state revenues in the midst of their efforts to \nrebuild their economies. The State Fiscal Relief Act will correct that \nmistake.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation and to \nstand up for the millions of Americans who are working at low-wage \njobs, who benefit from the numerous public programs and services that \nfiscal relief has helped to maintain, and who are in the process of \nreinvigorating our economy.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from West \nVirginia, Senator Rockefeller, in offering such an essential piece of \nlegislative. This bill will extend a portion of the short-term \nassistance package that Congress provided to States and territories \nlast May, because as most of our constituents realize, our economy may \nhave rebounded, but prosperity has not reached all Americans. This \nproposal will continue to help States fund Medicaid, one of their most \ncritical and also most expensive programs. The bill also provides \nfunding necessary to ensure that Congress meets its commitment to help \nstates transition seniors into the new Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit program.\n  I am quite certain this proposal will be controversial. On the one \nhand, many people who represent seniors and other vulnerable \npopulations that receive their health care through the Medicaid and \nMedicare programs will argue that this bill does not provide enough \nhelp to states to prevent programs and benefit cuts. On the other hand, \nmany of my colleagues will complain that the federal government already \nprovided $20 billion in fiscal assistance last year through the \neconomic stimulus package. In developing this bill, I tried to take an \napproach that balanced the concerns expressed by both sides.\n  I agree that state economies are recovering and that they do not need \nan additional $20 billion in federal assistance. In my home State of \nOregon, unemployment is dropping and State income tax receipts are \nhigher than projected a few short months ago. However, that doesn't \nmean Oregon's economy is out of the woods yet. Oregon's 6.8 percent \nunemployment rate continues to be significantly higher than that of the \nnational average of 5.6 percent. And that gets to the heart of why I \nhave introduced this bill providing a second, though significantly \nreduced, round of State fiscal relief.\n  It is clear to me that States still need help. They need help meeting \nthe increased obligations that come during economic downturns and \nrecoveries. And while our nation's economy is improving, which is due \nin large part to the President's leadership last year when he \nchallenged Congress to pass an economic stimulus package, it has not \nyet fully recovered. So more must be done to protect the programs that \npeople turn to when they are in need, programs like Medicaid.\n  Now I know some will argue that last year's money was wasted, that it \ndidn't do anything to boost the nation's economy. They might even cite \na recent report released by the General Accounting Office that said as \nmuch. Well, I have to question how $10 billion in funding that went to \nthe nation's largest health care program didn't result in a positive \noutcome. Health care is approximately a $1.6 trillion industry in the \nUnited States and in 2003 it was the second largest employment sector \nin the country--the fourth largest in Oregon. When you consider the \nsignificance of this industry on our nation's economy it seems unlikely \nthat the government's effort to forestall program cuts in Medicaid, the \nlargest health care program, would not have a positive effect on our \neconomy.\n  Certainly, if you think about large corporations that have millions, \neven billions, of dollars in revenue each year this money may not mean \nmuch. But I can tell you, to the beneficiaries and small providers in \nOregon, like the Community Health Centers, this infusion of federal \nfunding prevented significant cuts to their Medicaid benefits and \nreimbursement rates.\n  Now States, just as they are starting to see their economies recover \nand are realizing increased income tax revenue, are faced with the \nprospect of losing all of this Federal assistance. That is why I have \nintroduced this bill, because I understand the benefit to state \neconomies that results from an extension of this temporary financial \nassistance. We are almost there, but I believe more assistance is \nneeded and I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this \nbill and help our states weather this economic storm.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Graham of Florida, and \n        Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 2672. A bill to establish an Independent National Security \nClassification Board in the executive branch, and for other purposes; \nto the Select Committee on Intelligence.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by Senators \nLott, Graham of Florida, and Snowe in introducing legislation to create \nan independent National Security Classification Board. We believe it is \ntime to clear the fog of secrecy by creating an independent board to \nreview current and make recommendations for new standards and \nprocedures for the classification of information for national security \npurposes.\n  Our Founding Fathers believed in the idea that democracy works best \nwith the full disclosure of accurate information. Today, some might \nfind that notion quaint. But it is one that bears consideration--\nbecause the principle of open government so dear to America's founders \nis being tested today as never before. The culture of secrecy that grew \nout of the Cold War has now become woven into the very fabric of our \ndaily lives.\n  Information that the American people have a right to know--indeed, \ninformation that the American people need to know to make informed \ndecisions about the kind of government they want and the kind of \ncountry this should be--is being withheld by the Federal government. It \nis being buried in a virtual bunker marked ``do not enter,'' sealed off \nfrom public view with a big red stamp--marked ``Classified.'' And too \noften that big red stamp is used not to hide state secrets, but to \nprotect political backsides at great cost to our open and democratic \nsociety.\n  A very revealing speech was delivered three weeks ago by the head of \nthe Information Security Office, which oversees classification and \ndeclassification policies, Mr. William Leonard. Known\n\n[[Page S8235]]\n\nsometimes as the ``secrecy czar,'' he complained that the \nclassification system for national security has lost touch with the \nbasics; that some agencies don't know how much information they \nclassify, or whether they are classifying more or less than they once \ndid; whether they are classifying too much or too little. He called \ntoday's classification system ``a patchwork quilt'' that is the result \nof a hodgepodge of laws, regulations and directives. ``In reality,'' he \nsaid ``the Federal Government has so many varieties of classification \nthat it can make Heinz look modest . . .''\n  Two important reports confirm Mr. Leonard's argument that the \nclassification system is out of control. The reports, the forthcoming \n9-11 Commission report and last week's Senate Intelligence Committee on \nIraq, show the Administration's determination to blanket the Federal \ngovernment in secrecy. Even more important than the information that is \npublished in these reports is the information withheld from the public \nand redacted from the reports.\n  These reports demonstrate a serious imbalance of power between the \npublic and the officials who wield the ``top secret'' stamp. They raise \ntroubling questions about whether those who control the classification \nof information for national security purposes have misused this \nauthority to shield officials from the glare of public accountability \nand to stifle public debate about politically sensitive parts of the \nwar on terrorism.\n  This is not the first time our country has grappled with the trade-\noffs between the need to protect the public and the public's need to \nknow. But the automatic default to secrecy rather than public \naccountability is not part of our history. Scholarly studies about \nwhich material should be classified and at what level fill libraries. \nAccording to the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, an expert on \nsecrecy in government, the first real Congressional debate about \nprotecting national secrets occurred during consideration of the Alien \nand Sedition Acts of 1798, passed to silence opposition to war with \nFrance. ``It was,'' as Senator Moynihan wrote in Secrecy, ``our \nnation's first experience with how war or the threat of war changed the \nbalance between private liberty versus public order, an instability \nthat was eerily reenacted 119 years later.'' ``Indeed, much of the \nstructure of secrecy now in place in the U.S. government took shape in \njust under eleven weeks in the spring of 1917, while the Espionage Act \nwas debated and signed into law.'' Eighty years later, Senator Moynihan \nwould note that 6,610,154 million secrets were created in one year \nalone. In fact, only a small portion, or 1.4 percent, were created \npursuant to statutory authority, the Atomic Energy Act; Senator \nMoynihan labeled the other 98.6 percent ``pure creatures of \nbureaucracy,'' created via Executive Orders.\n\n  One of the ``creatures'' in the classification menagerie was set free \nto roam through the work of the 9-11 Commission and the Senate \nIntelligence Committee's report. The American people should not be \nfooled--pure bureaucracy refused to allow full public disclosure of the \ndecisions and materials used by the 9-11 Commission to prepare its \nreport. Pure bureaucracy also redacted nearly half of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee's review of Intelligence on Iraq. The \n``creature'' has overreached.\n  Since President Roosevelt issued the first national security \nclassification directive in 1940, the American people have often \ndemonstrated a high tolerance for secrecy in military and foreign \naffairs, even in some cases where it has been abused. However, the \nrising tide of secrecy has reached the point where it threatens to \ndrown our system of checks and balances, and calls out for a complete \nrethinking of the system used to classify information for national \nsecurity purposes.\n  Today the Executive Branch exerts almost total control over what \nshould or should not be classified. Congress has no ability to \ndeclassify material. There is no self-correcting mechanism in the \nsystem. Even if Members of Congress wanted to share information with \ntheir constituents, it's so complicated for Congress to release \ninformation to the public that nobody's ever tried to use the \nconvoluted processes. The Executive Branch has a little known group \nthat can review classification issues, but it is seldom used and open \nonly to Executive Branch employees, not to Members of Congress or the \npublic.\n  What does all of this mean in practice? It means that with the thump \nof a stamp marked ``secret,'' some bureaucrat in the belly of a federal \nbuilding has prevented the families of the victims of 9-11 from knowing \nexactly what happened to their loved ones. It means the American people \nmay never know who gave the orders dictating how prisoners at Abu \nGhraib could be treated. It means these decisions cannot be appealed, \neven by Congress. It means there is no independent review of the \nclassification decisions by the Executive Branch.\n  With no chance of unbiased review, classification decisions are ready \nand ripe for abuse. Agencies wishing to hide their flaws and \npoliticians of both parties wishing to make political points can abuse \nthe existing classification guidelines to their advantage. I want to \nchange that.\n  President Kennedy said the time to repair the roof is when the sun is \nshining. In the realm of secrecy, storm clouds are approaching. The \nbureaucracies in our government that deal with secrets are by nature \ncautious when it comes to protecting information pertinent to our \nnation's security. They err on the side of caution and they are very \nterritorial about it, treating secrets as if they are assets to be \ntraded. This is an understandable impulse. But erring too far and too \noften on the side of caution keeps a lot of information hidden that \ncould safely enlighten public debate. Even worse, overclassification of \ninformation is dangerous. If agencies and bureaucracies aren't sharing \ninformation among themselves, important clues can be missed. Their \nmission to keep citizens safe can be jeopardized by classification \nitself.\n\n  The tragedy of 9-11, the war on terrorism and the United States' \ninvasion of Iraq have offered ample opportunity to argue for \nclassification of just about any document on the grounds of national \nsecurity. Additionally, there are those who feel that the current \nAdministration took office with an unhealthy penchant for secrecy \nalready firmly in place. In its first two years, Bush Administration \nofficials made 44.5 million decisions to classify records and related \ndocuments, according to the Information Security Oversight office, part \nof the National Archives and Records Administration. This is about the \nsame number of classification decisions made during the last four years \nof the Clinton Administration.\n  The Atlanta Journal reported recently that ``federal, state and local \ngovernments are shutting down access to public records in what some \nexperts say is the most expansive assault on open government in the \nnation's history.'' The Bush Administration has even expanded the \nnumber of officials with the power to classify documents for purposes \nof national security beyond the 13 agencies that operated under the \nnational security classification system to include the secretaries of \nagriculture, health and human services and the EPA Administrator.\n  I for one do not subscribe to the view that there is an inherent \nconflict between the Executive Branch's accountability to Congress and \nthe American people on the one hand, and the Constitutional role of the \nPresident as Commander in Chief on the other.\n  I believe a balance can and must be struck between the public's need \nfor sound, cleareyed analysis and the Executive's desire to protect the \nnation's legitimate security interests. I believe we can fight \nterrorism ferociously without sacrificing personal privacy. There is no \nroom in this equation for the use of classification to insulate \nofficials and agencies from political pressure. As a member of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee I have had lengthy discussions with my \ncolleagues about how to achieve such a balance.\n  In my view this balance can be achieved only through a broad overhaul \nof the national security classification system. Legislation that I will \nbe introducing shortly will accomplish this through the establishment \nof an Independent National Security Classification Board. The Board \nwould be made up of three individuals, knowledgeable in national \nsecurity classification, appointed by the President\n\n[[Page S8236]]\n\nwith the advice and consent of the Senate.\n  The task of the Independent Board would be to review and make \nrecommendations on overhauling the standards and process used in the \nclassification system for national security information. The Board \nwould submit proposed new standards and processes to both Congress and \nthe Executive Branch for comment and revision, and then implement the \nnew standards and process once they have had the opportunity to \ncomment. The Board would then begin to implement the new system, \nreviewing and making recommendations on current and new national \nsecurity classifications, subject to Executive Branch veto that must be \naccompanied by a public, written explanation.\n\n  The balance in this proposal assures that the public and Congress \nhave access to an independent Board for national security \nclassification matters while leaving undisturbed the Commander in \nChief's constitutional prerogative in military and foreign policy \nmatters through the power to appoint the Board and to veto the Board's \nclassification decisions.\n  The Founding Fathers conceived of the Federal government to serve the \nAmerican people. Sometimes that is done by keeping secrets, by securing \ninformation that could put Americans in harm's way if it became public. \nInformation should be classified to protect the homeland. But when \ninformation is withheld to protect political careers and entrenched \nbureaucracies, that's not a service to the American people. It's a \nperversion of a policy intended to save lives, a perversion that \nweakens our democracy and could even endanger our people. It's time to \nthrow open the curtains and let the sun shine in on American democracy \nand on the governmental process much brighter than it does today. \nThat's what I intend to do with my legislation. The American people \ndeserve no less.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2672\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 1001 Williams Street, Ignacio, Colorado, as the \n``Leonard C. Burch Post Office Building''; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I send to the desk legislation to \ndesignate the U.S. Post Office located at 1001 Williams Street in \nIgnacio, CO, as the Leonard C. Burch Post Office Building.\n  Anyone who ever met the man knew they were in the presence of someone \nspecial. Leonard Burch had a vision. He had the imagination to look \nbeyond a destitute tribe with little hope, and see a people with \nresources, and determination, and a real opportunity to build a better \nfuture if they would only grasp it. Many people have dreams, but \nLeonard had that rare ability to make other people catch his vision, \nbelieve in it, and work just as hard for it as he did.\n  Leonard C. Burch died August 1, 2003. He was 69 years old. Leonard \nwas chairman of the Tribal Council for more than 32 years. Under his \nleadership, the Southern Utes became an economic force in and beyond \nthe Four Corners and the largest employer in La Plata County. Those \nthirty-seven years have seen the transformation of a people, the \ntransformation of a region, and all of it largely due to his \nextraordinary leadership.\n  Burch was credited with bringing his tribe out of poverty. Through \nhis efforts, the tribe became a major player in the energy development \nmarket with assets of $1.5 billion. As part of the Council for Energy \nResource Tribes, Burch was instrumental in improving energy development \nthroughout Indian Country. He advocated for greater tribal control over \ntribal resources.\n  Burch's leadership went beyond the tribe. He set an example for young \npeople. Burch was invited by five separate U.S. Presidents to \nconferences on American Indian policies at the White House and received \nnumerous awards for his commitment to regional water resource \ndevelopment.\n  We will all miss Leonard's wisdom and inspiration. It is a fitting \ntribute that the postal facility in Ignacio be named after a true \nwarrior. I invite anyone who believes that one man can't make a \ndifference, to take a drive southeast of Durango, and witness what one \nLeonard Burch can do.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2673\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. LEONARD C. BURCH POST OFFICE BUILDING.\n\n       (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal \n     Service located at 1001 Williams Street, Ignacio, Colorado, \n     shall be known and designated as the ``Leonard C. Burch Post \n     Office Building''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be \n     a reference to the ``Leonard C. Burch Post Office Building''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 2675. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe availability of the cash method of accounting for small business, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill I hope \nwill be the first in a series of proposals to simplify the tax code for \nsmall business owners. Once enacted, these provisions will reduce not \nonly the amount of taxes that small businesses pay, but that they also \nwill reduce the administrative burden that saddles small companies in \ntrying to meet this obligation.\n  The proposal that I am introducing today, will simplify the tax code \nby permitting small business owners to use the cash method of \naccounting for reporting their income if they generally earn less than \n$10 million during the tax year. Currently, only those taxpayers that \nearn less than $5 million per year are able to use the cash method. By \nincreasing this threshold to $10 million, more small businesses will be \nrelieved of the burdensome record keeping requirements that currently \nrequire them to use a different accounting method to report their \nincome.\n  Before I talk about the specifics of this particular provision, let \nme first explain why it is so critical to begin considering ways to \nsimplify the tax code. As you know, small businesses are the backbone \nof our Nation's economy. According to the Small Business \nAdministration, small businesses represent 99 percent of all employers, \nemploy 51 percent of the private-sector workforce, and contribute 51 \npercent of the private-sector output.\n  Yet, the despite the fact that small businesses are the real job-\ncreators for our Nation's economy, the current tax system imposes an \nunreasonable burden on small businesses attempting to comply with the \ncurrent tax code. This code imposes a large, and expensive, burden on \nall taxpayers in terms of satisfying reporting and record-keeping \nobligations, but small businesses are disadvantaged most, even more \nthan large companies, in terms of money and time spent satisfying their \ntax obligations.\n  For example, according to the Small Business Administration's Office \nof Advocacy, small businesses spend more than 8 billion hours each year \nfiling-out government reports, and they spend more than 80 percent of \nthis time on completing tax forms. What's even more troubling is that \ncompanies that employ fewer than 20 employees spend nearly $6,975 per \nemployee in tax compliance costs--nearly 60 percent more than companies \nwith more than 500 employees spend.\n\n[[Page S8238]]\n\n  These statistics are disconcerting for several reasons. First, the \nfact that small businesses are required to spend so much money on \ncompliance costs means they have less earnings to reinvest into their \nbusiness. This, in turn, means that they have less money to spend on \nnew equipment or on worker training, which, unfortunately, has an \nadverse effect on their overall production and the economy as a whole.\n  Second, the inordinate amount of time small business owners are \nforced to devote to the completion of paperwork means they have less \ntime to spend doing what they do best-namely running their business and \ncreating jobs.\n  I do not mean to suggest that the challenges small business confront \nin regard to tax reporting and compliance are unique to this group, or \nthat these companies should receive a free pass. In order to benefit \nfrom the freedoms and protections that our great country provides, \nindividuals and businesses alike are required to pay taxes, and this \nduty carries with it certain administrative and opportunity costs. What \nI am asking for is a fairer, simpler tax code that allows small \ncompanies to satisfy their obligation without having to expend the \namount of resources that they do currently, resources that might be \ninvested in more productive ways.\n  For that reason, the package of proposals that I will be introducing \nwill provide not only targeted, affordable tax relief to small business \nowners, it will also seek to simplify existing rules under the tax \ncode. By simplifying the tax code, small business owners will be able \nto satisfy their tax obligation in a less costly, more efficient \nmanner, allowing them to devote more time and resources to their \nprimary business goals.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the provision that I am introducing today \nwill permit more taxpayers to use the cash method of accounting, as \nopposed to depending on accrual or other hybrid method. The same law I \nreferenced earlier which currently permits only those taxpayers earning \nless than $5 million in gross receipts during the tax year to use the \ncash method in reporting their income also precludes taxpayers in \npossession of inventory from using the simpler cash method. As a \nresult, thousands of small businesses which possess inventories, but \nwhich might otherwise be entitled to report their income and expenses \nunder the cash method of accounting are also required to follow the \naccrual or some sort of hybrid accounting method. The result, once \nmore, is the imposition of undue financial hardship and unreasonable \nadministrative burdens.\n  My bill changes these existing rules, increasing the gross receipts \ntest under current law to $10 million for small businesses and indexing \nthis higher threshold to account for inflation. Given that the current \n$5 million threshold, it makes little sense to preserve an outdated \nbenchmark in this most important provision when the sensible adjustment \nthat I propose will allow thousands of small businesses presently \nhobbled by unnecessary paperwork to use the cash method of accounting.\n  My bill also changes current law to permit even those taxpayers with \ninventory to qualify for the cash method of accounting. It is important \nto note, however, that my bill will not simply give these taxpayers an \nopportunity to recover costs associated with these otherwise \ninventoriable assets in the year of purchase, but that the bill will \nrequire these taxpayers to account for such costs as if they were a \nmaterial or supply that is not incidental. This standard already exists \nunder current law, and it is one with which most small businesses are \nalready familiar. As such, this less-burdensome standard should ease \nthe existing compliance burden for eligible taxpayers and allow them to \ndevote more time and resources to their business.\n  Very importantly, these changes will not reduce the amount of taxes a \nsmall business pays by even one dollar. Indeed, the overall amount of \ntaxes a qualifying small business pays will remain the same. Rather, \nthis bill simply permits more taxpayers to report income and account \nfor costs in the year of the receipt or expenditure. Clearly, this \nmethod makes compliance easier and simpler for small taxpayers, and it \nwill reduce both the time and monetary expenditures spent today to \ncomply with the current tax code.\n  Finally, this proposal is revenue neutral. In addition to the \nprovision that modifies the income tax rules, my bill would enact \nFederal legislation to stop an abusive tax shelter that exists \ncurrently whereby taxpayers avoid State unemployment taxes. \nSpecifically, States would be required to enact laws that prevent the \navoidance of State unemployment tax and that also impose penalties on \ntaxpayers and their advisors who engage in these scams. Consequently, \nmy bill provides a revenue-neutral proposal that simplifies the tax \ncode for small business owners by cracking down on taxpayers who \notherwise try to avoid their State unemployment tax obligations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2675\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend chapter 4 of title 39, United States Code, \nto provide for the issuance of a semipostal stamp in order to provide \nfunding for childhood drinking prevention and education, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation creating the childhood drinking prevention semi-postal \nstamp.\n  Alcohol is the number one substance used and abused by America's \nchildren. Nearly a third of children begin drinking before the age of \n13, and forty percent of children who begin drinking by age 15 will \ndevelop alcohol abuse or dependence later in life.\n  I do not believe most parents or adults intentionally ignore this \nissue, however many Americans do not realize the prevalence and \nseriousness of childhood drinking. Several national surveys, including \nthose conducted by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and \nthe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, \ndemonstrate the serious consequences associated with early alcohol use.\n  For example, in 2002, 1.5 million youths between the ages of 12 to 17 \nneeded treatment for alcohol abuse. Early alcohol use is more likely to \nkill or injure young people than all illegal drugs combined.\n  If the onset of drinking is delayed, a child's risk of serious \nalcohol problems could be decreased or even prevented. That is why I am \npleased to propose the passage of a semi-postal stamp on childhood \ndrinking prevention. A semi-postal stamp will publicize this important \nchildren's health issue in every home, school, and community across the \nnation.\n  Profits from the childhood drinking prevention stamp would be \ndedicated to support education and prevention efforts. I would also \nprovide a further platform for millions of Americans to raise awareness \nabout the importance of keeping children alcohol free.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in enacting this important \nlegislation. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthis bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2676\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 406\n\n       Whereas the aerospace sector of the United States economy \n     generates economic activity equal to 15 percent of the \n     Nation's Gross Domestic Product and supports approximately \n     11,000,000 American jobs;\n       Whereas the United States aerospace industry directly \n     employs 574,600 people of the United States, the lowest \n     employment level of United States workers since World War II;\n       Whereas employment in the United States aerospace industry \n     is down 57 percent, as more than 750,000 jobs have been lost \n     since 1989;\n       Whereas the United States share of the global aerospace \n     market fell from 72 percent in 1985 to less than 52 percent \n     today;\n       Whereas according to the Commission on the Future of the \n     United States Aerospace Industry, ``Foreign government \n     subsidies directly affect the competitiveness of our \n     companies. Subsidized prime manufacturers as well as \n     suppliers are able to undercut prices offered by their U.S. \n     competitors, and are better able to weather market downturns. \n     Subsidized companies are able to secure cheaper commercial \n     financing since their governments share the risk associated \n     with bringing new products to market. Subsidized production \n     skews the market itself by flooding it with products that are \n     not commercially viable. Governments providing the subsidies \n     also apply political pressure on customers in an effort to \n     facilitate a positive return on the governments' investments. \n     In many cases, these government subsidies stifle competition \n     and often slow the introduction of new technology into the \n     market. European funding has had the most dramatic impact on \n     U.S. competitiveness because European products directly \n     compete with United States products in most sectors....if we \n     maintain the status quo, U.S. industry will be left to \n     compete against companies that don't play by the same \n     rules.'';\n       Whereas the aerospace industry is globally competitive with \n     established nations like the United States and the members of \n     the European Union and faces growing competition from \n     numerous nations, including China, Russia, Brazil, Canada, \n     Japan, and others; and\n       Whereas numerous public policy issues important to the \n     future of aerospace are now before Congress, including the \n     United States air traffic control system, export controls, \n     the aerospace workforce, homeland security, national \n     security, foreign competition, research and development, \n     mathematics and science education, corporate tax and export \n     promotion, and others: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 407\n\n       Whereas according to the American Cancer Society, in 2004, \n     215,990 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 40,110 \n     women will die from this disease;\n       Whereas it is estimated that about 2,000,000 women were \n     diagnosed with breast cancer in the 1990s, and that in nearly \n     500,000 of those cases, the cancer resulted in death;\n       Whereas African-American women suffer a 30 percent greater \n     mortality from breast cancer than White women and more than a \n     100 percent greater mortality from breast cancer than women \n     from Hispanic, Asian, and American Indian populations;\n       Whereas the risk of breast cancer increases with age, with \n     a woman at age 70 having twice as much of a chance of \n     developing the disease as a woman at age 50;\n       Whereas at least 80 percent of the women who get breast \n     cancer have no family history of the disease;\n       Whereas mammograms, when operated professionally at a \n     certified facility, can provide safe screening and early \n     detection of breast cancer in many women;\n       Whereas mammography is an excellent method for early \n     detection of localized breast cancer, which has a 5-year \n     survival rate of more than 97 percent;\n       Whereas the National Cancer Institute and the American \n     Cancer Society continue to recommend periodic mammograms; and\n       Whereas the National Breast Cancer Coalition recommends \n     that each woman and her health care provider make an \n     individual decision about mammography: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 15, 2004, as ``National Mammography \n     Day''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe the \n     day with appropriate programs and activities.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution \ndesignating October 15, 2004, as ``National Mammography Day.'' I am \npleased that 51 of my colleagues have endorsed this proposal by \nagreeing to be original cosponsors. I might note that I have submitted \na similar resolution each year since 1993, and on each occasion the \nSenate has shown its support for the fight against breast cancer by \napproving the resolution.\n  Each year, as I prepare to submit this resolution, I review the \nlatest information from the American Cancer Society about breast \ncancer. For the year 2004, it is estimated that nearly 216,000 women \nwill be diagnosed with breast cancer and slightly more than 40,000 \nwomen will die of this disease.\n  In past years, I have often commented on how gloomy these statistics \nwere. But as I review how these numbers are changing over time, I have \ncome to the realization that it is really more appropriate to be \noptimistic. The number of deaths from breast cancer is actually stable \nor falling from year to year. Early detection of breast cancer \ncontinues to result in extremely favorable outcomes: 97 percent of \nwomen with localized breast cancer will survive 5 years or longer. New \ndigital techniques make the process of mammography much more rapid and \nprecise than before. Government programs will provide free mammograms \nto those who can't afford them, as well as Medicaid eligibility for \ntreatment if breast cancer is diagnosed. Information about treatment of \nbreast cancer with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy has \nexploded, reflecting enormous research advances in this disease. So I \nam feeling quite positive about our battle against breast cancer. A \ndiagnosis of breast cancer is not a death sentence, and I encounter \nlong-term survivors of breast cancer nearly daily.\n  In recent times, the newspapers have been filled with discussion over \nwhether the scientific evidence actually supports the conclusion that \nperiodic screening mammography saves lives. It seems that much of this \ncontroversy relates to new interpretations of old studies, and the \nrelatively few recent studies of this matter have not clarified this \nissue. Most sources seem to agree that all of the existing scientific \nstudies have some weaknesses, but it is far from clear whether the very \nlarge and truly unambiguous study needed to settle this matter \ndefinitively can ever be done.\n  So what is a woman to do? I do not claim any expertise in this highly \ntechnical area, so I rely on the experts. The American Cancer Society, \nthe National Cancer Institute, and the U.S. Preventive Services Task \nForce all continue to recommend periodic screening mammography, and I \nendorse the statements of these distinguished bodies.\n  On the other hand, I recognize that some women who examine these \nresearch studies are unconvinced of the need for periodic screening \nmammography. However, even those scientists who do not support periodic \nmammography for all women believe that it is appropriate for some \ngroups of women with particular risk factors. In agreement with these \nexperts, I encourage all women who have doubts about the usefulness of \nscreening mammography in general to discuss with their individual \nphysicians whether this test is appropriate in their specific \nsituations.\n  So my message to women is: have a periodic mammogram, or at the very \nleast discuss this option with your own physician.\n  I know that some women don't have annual mammograms because of either \nfear or forgetfulness. It is only human nature for some women to avoid \nmammograms because they are afraid of what they will find. To those who \nare fearful, I would say that if you have periodic routine mammograms, \nand the latest one comes out positive, even before you have any \nsymptoms or have found a lump on self-examination, you have reason to \nbe optimistic, not pessimistic. Such early-detected breast cancers are \nhighly treatable.\n  Then there is forgetfulness. I certainly understand how difficult it \nis to remember to do something that only\n\n[[Page S8242]]\n\ncomes around once each year. I would suggest that this is where \n``National Mammography Day'' comes in. On that day, let's make sure \nthat each woman we know picks a specific date on which to get a \nmammogram each year, a date that she won't forget: a child's birthday, \nan anniversary, perhaps even the day her taxes are due. On National \nMammography Day, let's ask our loved ones: pick one of these dates, fix \nit in your mind along with a picture of your child, your wedding, or \nanother symbol of that date, and promise yourself to get a mammogram on \nthat date every year. Do it for yourself and for the others that love \nyou and want you to be part of their lives for as long as possible.\n  And to those women who are reluctant to have a mammogram, I say let \nNational Mammography Day serve as a reminder to discuss this question \neach year with your physician. New scientific studies that are \npublished and new mammography techniques that are developed may affect \nyour decision on this matter from one year to the next. I encourage you \nto keep an open mind and not to feel that a decision at one point in \ntime commits you irrevocably to a particular course of action for the \nindefinite future.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in the ongoing fight against breast \ncancer by cosponsoring and voting for this resolution to designate \nOctober 15, 2004, as ``National Mammography Day.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 125--RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF \n                THE WARSAW UPRISING DURING WORLD WAR II\n\n  Mr. SMITH (for himself and Ms. Mikulski) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 125\n\n       Whereas August 1, 2004, marks the 60th anniversary of the \n     Warsaw Uprising, when against seemingly insurmountable odds \n     and extreme hardships, Polish citizens revolted against the \n     Nazi occupiers in Warsaw, Poland, in one of the most heroic \n     battles during World War II;\n       Whereas the Warsaw Uprising was a part of a nationwide \n     resistance against the Nazi occupation, was started by the \n     underground Home Army, and lasted 63 days;\n       Whereas the Polish resistance, many of them teenagers, \n     while heavily outnumbered and armed with mostly homemade \n     weapons, fought bravely against the German soldiers and lost \n     approximately 250,000 civilians and troops;\n       Whereas, to punish Poland for the uprising, the Nazis \n     systematically razed 70 percent of Warsaw, including \n     monuments, cultural treasures, and historical buildings;\n       Whereas the heroism and spirit of the Polish resistance are \n     an inspiration to all peoples in their pursuit of liberty and \n     democracy and are evident today in Polish contributions to \n     the global war against terrorism and the more than 2,300 \n     Polish troops currently deployed in Operation Iraqi Freedom; \n     and\n       Whereas the heroic undertaking of the Polish underground \n     represents one of the most important contributions to the \n     Allied war effort during World War II and remains venerated \n     in the Polish consciousness, even for the generations born \n     after it ended: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress recognizes the 60th anniversary of \n     the Warsaw Uprising during World War II which will forever \n     serve as a symbol of heroism in the face of great adversity \n     and the pursuit of freedom.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution to \ncommemorate the 60th anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising. For those who \nare not familiar with the details of this remarkable event, this \nanniversary provides an opportunity to recognize the bravery and \nheroism of those Polish citizens who revolted against their brutal Nazi \noccupiers.\n  The Warsaw uprising began on August 1, 1944, when the Polish Home \nArmy launched an attack on the German forces occupying Poland. At the \ntime, the German army was retreating from the Soviets after its defeat \non the eastern front, and the Poles recognized that the presence of the \nSoviet army on the outskirts of Warsaw represented a grave threat to \nthe country's future. If they could liberate the city from the Germans \nand establish an independent government before the Red Army's entry, \nthey felt their freedom might be preserved.\n  Although the Home Army took control of most of the city within a few \ndays, the Germans were determined to defend Warsaw and sent in massive \nreinforcements to crush the uprising. The fighting raged for 63 days, \ndespite the fact that the Polish contingent had limited weapons and \nwere facing German tanks, planes, and artillery.\n  Additionally, the Soviet Union refused to allow American or British \nplanes access to the airfields it controlled. Thus, ammunition and \nrelief supplies could not be flown to the Polish resistance. In \nStalin's view, allowing the Germans to suppress the uprising would \nresult in the destruction of the anti-Soviet leadership of Poland, \ntherefore paving the way for eventual Soviet control.\n  Germany's superior firepower eventually prevailed, as we all know. \nThe Germans crushed the Polish forces and leveled the city as an \nexample to the rest of Europe. Eighty-five percent of the city was \nrazed, the Polish Home Army was annihilated and approximately 250,000 \npeople, including tens of thousands of civilians, were summarily \nexecuted.\n  Had events turned the other way, Warsaw would have been the first \nEuropean capital liberated from the Nazi regime. Instead, Poland \nsuffered under nearly fifty years of communist domination.\n  Senator Mikulski joins me in submitting this resolution today in an \neffort to honor those brave Polish citizens who fought so valiantly for \ntheir freedom. Considering the conflict between the United States and \nthe Soviets over assisting the Polish resistance, the Warsaw Uprising \ncan fairly be considered as one of the first battles of the Cold War.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to join with Senator Smith in \nsubmitting this resolution to commemorate the 1944 Warsaw Uprising \nagainst the Nazi German occupation.\n  The Polish and American people have stood up against oppression and \nfought for liberty through the centuries. During our Revolutionary War, \nPolish patriots fought alongside American patriots to help secure our \nindependence. During the Second World War, Polish mathematicians helped \nus break the enigma codes and American troops and the Polish Army in \nexile fought side by side to liberate Europe.\n  Within Poland, the Polish people fought for their own freedom against \nthe occupying armies of Nazi Germany. Two of the most dramatic battles \ntook place in Poland's capital: the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising by Jews in \n1943, and the Warsaw Uprising in 1944.\n  In the summer of 1944, the German army was in retreat and the Red \nArmy of the Soviet Union was approaching Warsaw. The Poles knew from \nthe Katyn Forest Massacre what brutal treatment they could expect under \nSoviet occupation. So they took charge of their own liberation, hoping \nto allow the Polish government in exile to return to Warsaw.\n  On August 1, 1944, the Polish home army rose up against the Nazi \nGermany occupation. They took control of most of Warsaw within days. \nBut the Germany army was determined to crush the resistance, and the \nSoviet Union hampered U.S. and British efforts to support the Warsaw \nUprising from the air. The Poles fought bravely to liberate and protect \ntheir capitol and their nation. But after 63 days of bitter fighting, \nGermany tanks, planes and artillery overcame the valiant but poorly-\narmed Polish resistance.\n  Nazi Germany was not satisfied with mere victory. Heinrich Himmler \nordered the people of Warsaw killed and the city razed to the ground as \nan example for all of Europe. Eighty-five percent of Warsaw was leveled \nby German forces and hundreds of thousands of Poles were killed.\n  The Poles were right to fight for their freedom in 1944, because \nSoviet domination lasted for nearly half a Century. The Solidarity \nMovement later took up the banner of Polish freedom, and we are now \nproud to have Poland as a friend and NATO ally.\n  This year, as we mark the 60th anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising, we \nshould remember and honor the Poles who fought so bravely, against such \nheavy odds, for freedom. This is what the resolution Senator Smith and \nI are offering today, and a companion resolution introduced in the \nHouse by Representatives Emanuel and Hyde, will do. I urge my \ncolleagues to join us in commemorating the Warsaw Uprising.\n\n[[Page S8243]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 126--CONDEMNING THE ATTACK ON THE AMIA \n JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER IN BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA, IN JULY 1994, AND \n EXPRESSING THE CONCERN OF THE UNITED STATES REGARDING THE CONTINUING, \n            DECADE-LONG DELAY IN THE RESOLUTION OF THIS CASE\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN (for himself, Mr. Levin, and Mr. Dodd) submitted the \nfollowing concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 126\n\n       Whereas on July 18, 1994, 85 innocent people were killed \n     and 300 were wounded when the Argentine Jewish Mutual \n     Association (referred to in this resolution as the ``AMIA'') \n     was bombed in Buenos Aires, Argentina;\n       Whereas that attack showed the same cowardice and utter \n     disregard for human life as the attacks on the United States \n     on September 11, 2001;\n       Whereas the United States welcomes Argentine President \n     Nestor Kirchner's political will to pursue the investigation \n     of the AMIA bombing, as demonstrated by his Executive order \n     opening the archives of Argentina's Secretariat for State \n     Intelligence (referred to in this resolution as ``SIDE'') and \n     by his decisions to raise the AMIA cause to national status, \n     and to emphasize that there is no statute of limitations for \n     those responsible for this attack;\n       Whereas it is reported that considerable evidence links the \n     attack to the terrorist group Hizballah, which is based in \n     Lebanon, supported by the Government of the Syrian Arab \n     Republic, and sponsored by the Government of the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran;\n       Whereas the decade since the bombing has been marked by \n     efforts to minimize the international connection to this \n     terrorist attack;\n       Whereas in March 2003, an Argentine judge issued arrest \n     warrants for 4 officials of the Government of the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran who are believed to have been involved in \n     planning or carrying out the attack against AMIA and \n     requested that the International Criminal Police Organization \n     apprehend them;\n       Whereas the 4 indicted Iranians are Ali Fallahian, a former \n     minister of security and intelligence; Mohsen Rabbani, a \n     former cultural attache at the Iranian Embassy in Buenos \n     Aires; Ali Balesh-Abadi, an Iranian diplomat; and Ali Akbar \n     Parvaresh, a former minister of education;\n       Whereas Hadi Soleimanpour, Iran's Ambassador to Argentina \n     in the 1990s, also has an international arrest warrant \n     pending against him by Argentine authorities for his \n     suspected primary role in the AMIA bombing;\n       Whereas it is reported that suicide bomber Ibrahim Hussein \n     Berro, a Lebanese citizen, carried out the attack on AMIA;\n       Whereas it has been reported that contact was made by the \n     Iranian embassy in Buenos Aires to Ibrahim Hussein Berro, who \n     lived in a mosque in Canuelas, Argentina, in the days before \n     the AMIA bombing;\n       Whereas Argentine officials have acknowledged that there \n     was negligence in the initial phases of the investigation \n     into the 1994 bombing, including the destruction or \n     disappearance of material evidence;\n       Whereas the first major criminal trial regarding the \n     bombing did not begin until September 2001, and those who are \n     currently on trial are former policemen and civilians who are \n     accused of playing roles only in the procurement and delivery \n     of the vehicle that was used in the bombing;\n       Whereas the judge who had presided since 2001 over the \n     investigation and trial related to the AMIA bombing was \n     removed in December 2003 due to charges that he bribed a key \n     witness in the AMIA case;\n       Whereas the new trial judge, Rodolfo Canicoba Corral, deals \n     with many other important cases and has few supporting staff;\n       Whereas on March 17, 1992, terrorists bombed the Embassy of \n     Israel in Buenos Aires, Argentina, killing 29 people and \n     injuring more than 200, and the perpetrators of the attack \n     also remain at large;\n       Whereas an inability to extradite suspected Islamic \n     militants and Iranian officials has debilitated the efforts \n     of the Government of Argentina to prosecute masterminds and \n     planners of the 1994 AMIA bombing;\n       Whereas evidence indicates that the tri-border area where \n     the borders of Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil meet is \n     suspected of harboring organizations that support terrorism \n     and engage in drug and arms smuggling and an assorted array \n     of other illicit, revenue-raising activities;\n       Whereas the Government of Argentina supports the 1996 \n     Declaration of Lima to Prevent, Combat and Eliminate \n     Terrorism, which refers to terrorism as a ``serious form of \n     organized and systematic violence that is intended to \n     generate chaos and fear among the population, results in \n     death and destruction, and is a reprehensible criminal \n     activity'';\n       Whereas the Government of Argentina supports the 1998 \n     Commitment of Mar del Plata, which calls terrorist acts \n     ``serious common crimes that erode peaceful and civilized \n     coexistence, affect the rule of law and the exercise of \n     democracy, and endanger the stability of democratically \n     elected constitutional governments and their socioeconomic \n     development of our countries'';\n       Whereas the Government of Argentina actively supports the \n     development of the Three Plus One Counterterrorism Dialogue \n     with Brazil, Paraguay, and the United States;\n       Whereas the Government of Argentina was successful in \n     enacting a law on cooperation from defendants in terrorist \n     matters, a law that will be helpful in pursuing full \n     prosecution in the 1994 AMIA bombing and other terrorist \n     cases; and\n       Whereas the Second Specialized Conference on Terrorism held \n     in Mar del Plata, Argentina on November 23 and November 24, \n     1998, concluded with the adoption of the Commitment of Mar \n     del Plata, calling for the establishment within the \n     Organization of American States (referred to in this \n     resolution as ``OAS'') of an Inter-American Committee Against \n     Terrorism (referred to in this resolution as ``CICTE''): Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) reiterates its strongest condemnation of the 1994 \n     attack on the AMIA Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires, \n     Argentina, and honors the victims of this heinous act;\n       (2) expresses its sympathy to the relatives of the victims, \n     who have waited 10 years without justice for the loss of \n     their loved ones, and may have to wait even longer for \n     justice to be served;\n       (3) underscores the concern of the United States regarding \n     the continuing, decade-long delay in the proper resolution of \n     this case;\n       (4) strongly urges the Government of Argentina to continue \n     to dedicate and provide the resources necessary for its \n     judicial system and intelligence agencies to investigate all \n     areas of the AMIA case, including by implementing Argentine \n     President Nestor Kirchner's Executive order mandating the \n     opening of the archives of the SIDE of Argentina, and to \n     prosecute with due haste those who are responsible for the \n     bombing;\n       (5) calls upon the international community to cooperate \n     fully with the investigation, including by making \n     information, witnesses, and suspects available for review and \n     questioning by the appropriate Argentine authorities;\n       (6) encourages the President to direct United States law \n     enforcement agencies to provide support and cooperation, if \n     requested, to the Government of Argentina, for the purposes \n     of deepening and expanding the investigation into this \n     bombing and suspected activities in support of terrorism in \n     the tri-border area where the borders of Argentina, Paraguay, \n     and Brazil meet;\n       (7) encourages the President to direct the United States \n     Representative to the OAS to--\n       (A) seek support from OAS member countries for the creation \n     of a special task force of the CICTE to assist, as requested \n     by the Government of Argentina, in the investigation of all \n     aspects of the 1994 AMIA terrorist attack; and\n       (B) urge OAS member countries to designate Hizballah as a \n     terrorist organization if they have not already done so;\n       (8) stresses the need for international pressure on the \n     Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Government \n     of the Syrian Arab Republic to extradite for trial \n     individuals and government officials who are accused of \n     planning or perpetrating the AMIA attack, and to immediately, \n     unconditionally, and permanently cease any and all assistance \n     to terrorists; and\n       (9) desires a lasting, warm relationship between the United \n     States and Argentina that is built, in part, on mutual \n     abhorrence of terrorism and commitments to peace, stability, \n     and democracy in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/15/senate-section/article/S8243-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3562.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Family Smoking \n     Prevention and Tobacco Control Act''.\n\n     SEC. __02. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The use of tobacco products by the Nation's children is \n     a pediatric disease of considerable proportions that results \n     in new generations of tobacco-dependent children and adults.\n       (2) A consensus exists within the scientific and medical \n     communities that tobacco products are inherently dangerous \n     and cause cancer, heart disease, and other serious adverse \n     health effects.\n       (3) Nicotine is an addictive drug.\n       (4) Virtually all new users of tobacco products are under \n     the minimum legal age to purchase such products.\n       (5) Tobacco advertising and marketing contribute \n     significantly to the use of nicotine-containing tobacco \n     products by adolescents.\n       (6) Because past efforts to restrict advertising and \n     marketing of tobacco products have failed adequately to curb \n     tobacco use by adolescents, comprehensive restrictions on the \n     sale, promotion, and distribution of such products are \n     needed.\n       (7) Federal and State governments have lacked the legal and \n     regulatory authority and resources they need to address \n     comprehensively the public health and societal problems \n     caused by the use of tobacco products.\n       (8) Federal and State public health officials, the public \n     health community, and the public at large recognize that the \n     tobacco industry should be subject to ongoing oversight.\n       (9) Under article I, section 8 of the Constitution, the \n     Congress is vested with the responsibility for regulating \n     interstate commerce and commerce with Indian tribes.\n       (10) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and \n     use of tobacco products are activities in and substantially \n     affecting interstate commerce because they are sold, \n     marketed, advertised, and distributed in interstate commerce \n     on a nationwide basis, and have a substantial effect on the \n     Nation's economy.\n       (11) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and \n     use of such products substantially affect interstate commerce \n     through the health care and other costs attributable to the \n     use of tobacco products.\n       (12) It is in the public interest for Congress to enact \n     legislation that provides the Food and Drug Administration \n     with the authority to regulate tobacco products and the \n     advertising and promotion of such products. The benefits to \n     the American people from enacting such legislation would be \n     significant in human and economic terms.\n       (13) Tobacco use is the foremost preventable cause of \n     premature death in America. It causes over 400,000 deaths in \n     the United States each year and approximately 8,600,000 \n     Americans have chronic illnesses related to smoking.\n       (14) Reducing the use of tobacco by minors by 50 percent \n     would prevent well over 6,500,000 of today's children from \n     becoming regular, daily smokers, saving over 2,000,000 of \n     them from premature death due to tobacco induced disease. \n     Such a reduction in youth smoking would also result in \n     approximately $75,000,000,000 in savings attributable to \n     reduced health care costs.\n       (15) Advertising, marketing, and promotion of tobacco \n     products have been especially directed to attract young \n     persons to use tobacco products and these efforts have \n     resulted in increased use of such products by youth. Past \n     efforts to oversee these activities have not been successful \n     in adequately preventing such increased use.\n       (16) In 2001, the tobacco industry spent more than \n     $11,000,000,000 to attract new users, retain current users, \n     increase current consumption, and generate favorable long-\n     term attitudes toward smoking and tobacco use.\n       (17) Tobacco product advertising often misleadingly \n     portrays the use of tobacco as socially acceptable and \n     healthful to minors.\n       (18) Tobacco product advertising is regularly seen by \n     persons under the age of 18, and persons under the age of 18 \n     are regularly exposed to tobacco product promotional efforts.\n       (19) Through advertisements during and sponsorship of \n     sporting events, tobacco has become strongly associated with \n     sports and has become portrayed as an integral part of sports \n     and the healthy lifestyle associated with rigorous sporting \n     activity.\n       (20) Children are exposed to substantial and unavoidable \n     tobacco advertising that leads to favorable beliefs about \n     tobacco use, plays a role in leading young people to \n     overestimate the prevalence of tobacco use, and increases the \n     number of young people who begin to use tobacco.\n       (21) The use of tobacco products in motion pictures and \n     other mass media glamorizes its use for young people and \n     encourages them to use tobacco products.\n       (22) Tobacco advertising expands the size of the tobacco \n     market by increasing consumption of tobacco products \n     including tobacco use by young people.\n       (23) Children are more influenced by tobacco advertising \n     than adults, they smoke the most advertised brands.\n       (24) Tobacco company documents indicate that young people \n     are an important and often crucial segment of the tobacco \n     market. Children, who tend to be more price-sensitive than \n     adults, are influenced by advertising and promotion practices \n     that result in drastically reduced cigarette prices.\n       (25) Comprehensive advertising restrictions will have a \n     positive effect on the smoking rates of young people.\n       (26) Restrictions on advertising are necessary to prevent \n     unrestricted tobacco advertising from undermining legislation \n     prohibiting access to young people and providing for \n     education about tobacco use.\n       (27) International experience shows that advertising \n     regulations that are stringent and comprehensive have a \n     greater impact on overall tobacco use and young people's use \n     than weaker or less comprehensive ones.\n       (28) Text only requirements, although not as stringent as a \n     ban, will help reduce underage use of tobacco products while \n     preserving the informational function of advertising.\n       (29) It is in the public interest for Congress to adopt \n     legislation to address the public health crisis created by \n     actions of the tobacco industry.\n       (30) The final regulations promulgated by the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services in the August 28, 1996, issue of \n     the Federal Register (61 Fed. Reg. 44615-44618) for inclusion \n     as part 897 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, are \n     consistent with the First Amendment to the United States \n     Constitution and with the standards set forth in the \n     amendments made by this subtitle for the regulation of \n     tobacco products by the Food and Drug Administration and the \n     restriction on the sale and distribution, including access to \n     and the advertising and promotion of, tobacco products \n     contained in such regulations are substantially related to \n     accomplishing the public health goals of this subtitle.\n       (31) The regulations described in paragraph (30) will \n     directly and materially advance the Federal Government's \n     substantial interest in reducing the number of children and \n     adolescents who use cigarettes and smokeless tobacco and in \n     preventing the life-threatening health consequences \n     associated with tobacco use. An overwhelming majority of \n     Americans who use tobacco products begin using such products \n     while they are minors and become addicted to the nicotine in \n     those products before reaching the age of 18. Tobacco \n     advertising and promotion plays a crucial role in the \n     decision of these minors to begin using tobacco products. \n     Less restrictive and less comprehensive approaches have not \n     and will not be effective in reducing the problems addressed \n     by such regulations. The reasonable restrictions on the \n     advertising and promotion of tobacco products contained in \n     such regulations will lead to a significant decrease in the \n     number of minors using and becoming addicted to those \n     products.\n       (32) The regulations described in paragraph (30) impose no \n     more extensive restrictions on communication by tobacco \n     manufacturers and sellers than are necessary to reduce the \n     number of children and adolescents who use cigarettes and \n     smokeless tobacco and to prevent the life-threatening health \n     consequences associated with tobacco use. Such regulations \n     are narrowly tailored to restrict those advertising and \n     promotional practices which are most likely to be seen or \n     heard by youth and most likely to entice them into tobacco \n     use, while affording tobacco manufacturers and sellers ample \n     opportunity to convey information about their products to \n     adult consumers.\n       (33) Tobacco dependence is a chronic disease, one that \n     typically requires repeated interventions to achieve long-\n     term or permanent abstinence.\n       (34) Because the only known safe alternative to smoking is \n     cessation, interventions should target all smokers to help \n     them quit completely.\n       (35) Tobacco products have been used to facilitate and \n     finance criminal activities both\n\n[[Page S8245]]\n\n     domestically and internationally. Illicit trade of tobacco \n     products has been linked to organized crime and terrorist \n     groups.\n       (36) It is essential that the Food and Drug Administration \n     review products sold or distributed for use to reduce risks \n     or exposures associated with tobacco products and that it be \n     empowered to review any advertising and labeling for such \n     products. It is also essential that manufacturers, prior to \n     marketing such products, be required to demonstrate that such \n     products will meet a series of rigorous criteria, and will \n     benefit the health of the population as a whole, taking into \n     account both users of tobacco products and persons who do not \n     currently use tobacco products.\n       (37) Unless tobacco products that purport to reduce the \n     risks to the public of tobacco use actually reduce such \n     risks, those products can cause substantial harm to the \n     public health to the extent that the individuals, who would \n     otherwise not consume tobacco products or would consume such \n     products less, use tobacco products purporting to reduce \n     risk. Those who use products sold or distributed as modified \n     risk products that do not in fact reduce risk, rather than \n     quitting or reducing their use of tobacco products, have a \n     substantially increased likelihood of suffering disability \n     and premature death. The costs to society of the widespread \n     use of products sold or distributed as modified risk products \n     that do not in fact reduce risk or that increase risk include \n     thousands of unnecessary deaths and injuries and huge costs \n     to our health care system.\n       (38) As the National Cancer Institute has found, many \n     smokers mistakenly believe that ``low tar'' and ``light'' \n     cigarettes cause fewer health problems than other cigarettes. \n     As the National Cancer Institute has also found, mistaken \n     beliefs about the health consequences of smoking ``low tar'' \n     and ``light'' cigarettes can reduce the motivation to quit \n     smoking entirely and thereby lead to disease and death.\n       (39) Recent studies have demonstrated that there has been \n     no reduction in risk on a population-wide basis from ``low \n     tar'' and ``light'' cigarettes and such products may actually \n     increase the risk of tobacco use.\n       (40) The dangers of products sold or distributed as \n     modified risk tobacco products that do not in fact reduce \n     risk are so high that there is a compelling governmental \n     interest in insuring that statements about modified risk \n     tobacco products are complete, accurate, and relate to the \n     overall disease risk of the product.\n       (41) As the Federal Trade Commission has found, consumers \n     have misinterpreted advertisements in which one product is \n     claimed to be less harmful than a comparable product, even in \n     the presence of disclosures and advisories intended to \n     provide clarification.\n       (42) Permitting manufacturers to make unsubstantiated \n     statements concerning modified risk tobacco products, whether \n     express or implied, even if accompanied by disclaimers would \n     be detrimental to the public health.\n       (43) The only way to effectively protect the public health \n     from the dangers of unsubstantiated modified risk tobacco \n     products is to empower the Food and Drug Administration to \n     require that products that tobacco manufacturers sold or \n     distributed for risk reduction be approved in advance of \n     marketing, and to require that the evidence relied on to \n     support approval of these products is rigorous.\n\n     SEC. __03. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purposes of this subtitle are--\n       (1) to provide authority to the Food and Drug \n     Administration to regulate tobacco products under the Federal \n     Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), by \n     recognizing it as the primary Federal regulatory authority \n     with respect to the manufacture, marketing, and distribution \n     of tobacco products;\n       (2) to ensure that the Food and Drug Administration has the \n     authority to address issues of particular concern to public \n     health officials, especially the use of tobacco by young \n     people and dependence on tobacco;\n       (3) to authorize the Food and Drug Administration to set \n     national standards controlling the manufacture of tobacco \n     products and the identity, public disclosure, and amount of \n     ingredients used in such products;\n       (4) to provide new and flexible enforcement authority to \n     ensure that there is effective oversight of the tobacco \n     industry's efforts to develop, introduce, and promote less \n     harmful tobacco products;\n       (5) to vest the Food and Drug Administration with the \n     authority to regulate the levels of tar, nicotine, and other \n     harmful components of tobacco products;\n       (6) in order to ensure that consumers are better informed, \n     to require tobacco product manufacturers to disclose research \n     which has not previously been made available, as well as \n     research generated in the future, relating to the health and \n     dependency effects or safety of tobacco products;\n       (7) to continue to permit the sale of tobacco products to \n     adults in conjunction with measures to ensure that they are \n     not sold or accessible to underage purchasers;\n       (8) to impose appropriate regulatory controls on the \n     tobacco industry;\n       (9) to promote cessation to reduce disease risk and the \n     social costs associated with tobacco related diseases; and\n       (10) to strengthen legislation against illicit trade in \n     tobacco products.\n\n     SEC. __04. SCOPE AND EFFECT.\n\n       (a) Intended Effect.--Nothing in this subtitle (or an \n     amendment made by this subtitle) shall be construed to--\n       (1) establish a precedent with regard to any other \n     industry, situation, circumstance, or legal action; or\n       (2) affect any action pending in Federal, State, or Tribal \n     court, or any agreement, consent decree, or contract of any \n     kind.\n       (b) Agricultural Activities.--The provisions of this \n     subtitle (or an amendment made by this subtitle) which \n     authorize the Secretary to take certain actions with regard \n     to tobacco and tobacco products shall not be construed to \n     affect any authority of the Secretary of Agriculture under \n     existing law regarding the growing, cultivation, or curing of \n     raw tobacco.\n\n     SEC. __05. SEVERABILITY.\n\n       If any provision of this subtitle, the amendments made by \n     this subtitle, or the application of any provision of this \n     subtitle to any person or circumstance is held to be invalid, \n     the remainder of this subtitle, the amendments made by this \n     subtitle, and the application of the provisions of this \n     subtitle to any other person or circumstance shall not be \n     affected and shall continue to be enforced to the fullest \n     extent possible.\n\n         CHAPTER 1--AUTHORITY OF THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION\n\n     SEC. __11.

During tomorrow's session, I will have more \nto say about next week's schedule. However, there will be no votes \nduring Monday's session as well. Senators can expect the next vote at \napproximately 2:15 on Tuesday.\n  We had a productive day today. We will be closing in just a few \nmoments. I just had the opportunity a few moments ago to talk to the \nPrime Minister of Australia, who expressed his gratitude to the \nAmerican people and to this body for the vote we took about an hour ago \nwith regard to the Australia trade bill. We expedited consideration of \nthat bill, brought it to the floor in a very quick fashion, but had a \nvery good debate over the course of the day. There was broad support \nfor that bill as reflected in the vote, with 80 people voting for that \npiece of legislation.\n  In addition, we made real progress considering an amendment with \nregard to tobacco and the FDA. Unusual in the fact that those two bills \nwere put together in one bill, but by considering that bill with an \noverwhelming vote, we are able to go to conference on the FSC/ETI bill, \nan important bill to jobs and manufacturing in this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/15/senate-section/article/S8268-7", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10:00 A.M.
