Mr. President, I come this morning to again review the \nlay of the land. As I said a couple of days ago, many of my colleagues, \nmost of our caucus, expressed deep concern--alarm, really--at the \nhijacking of the process that went on during the deliberations on the \nOmnibus appropriations bill. I said at the time, and I believe it ought \nto be repeated, that I believe the process in the Senate was fair. I \nhave immense respect for the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee. He worked with Members on both sides to \naccommodate consensus and to reach agreement and the process worked. \nThat process was destroyed at the eleventh hour by some in the \nadministration and by leadership on the Republican side in the House. \nChanges were demanded. Ultimatums were set. The House and Senate were \nactually forced to take positions in conference diametrically in \nopposition to the very positions we took on the Senate floor after a \nvery deliberative debate; positions that I think have great merit.\n  On an overwhelming vote, the Senate supported the notion that we \nought to have country-of-origin labeling. They did it because they \nbelieved it is an opportunity for us to enhance our ability to add \nconfidence to consumers' choice, knowing if they buy 100 percent U.S. \nbeef they are not going to buy meat with downer cattle from foreign \ncountries. We are going to be able to say with confidence to countries \nwho are purchasing our products that they are 100 percent U.S. product. \nToday, they say they are not prepared to take our products unless we \ncan give that assurance. For those and other reasons--patriotism, \npatriotism--the Senate voted in support, not once but twice, of \ncountry-of-origin labeling.\n\n  With the crisis involving mad cow, it became even more imperative \nthat that position be taken. Yet some in the White House insisted that \nthere be a 2-year delay. That 2-year delay is tantamount to killing \ncountry-of-origin labeling. That is what is now in this bill, in direct \nopposition, in direct conflict, diametrically in opposition to the \nposition taken by the Senate during the debate on the Agriculture \nappropriations bill and, I might add, diametrically in opposition to \nthe views of the vast majority of the American people. Eighty percent \nof the American people support country-of-origin labeling. Over 80 \npercent say they would be prepared to pay more if we had country-of-\norigin labeling.\n  So it is with great chagrin that we find ourselves in this \ncircumstance. The same could be said for overtime. I don't believe that \nmost of our colleagues can fully appreciate the depth of feeling, the \nmagnitude of anger and frustration that is out there on this particular \nissue. I have talked to firemen and policemen and nurses and first \nresponders. I must say they cannot believe that their Government is \ndevising ways with which to reduce and in some cases actually eliminate \novertime. They can't believe that they may be among the 8 million \nAmericans whose overtime will be lost when this bill passes. They can't \nbelieve it. They always thought if you work hard and play by the rules, \nespecially working overtime, you are going to get paid. Now they have \ntheir own Government saying, in a memo produced by the Department of \nLabor, if you want to reduce wages, we will give you a way to reduce \novertime.\n  What kind of progress in society is that? For all these years we have \nmarched forward, recognizing we are going to reward work. What does \nthis memo and what does the provision in this legislation say? We are \nnot going to reward work anymore. In fact, we are going to find ways to \nget out from under the reward for work. How can anybody sustain that \nposition here in this body? How can anybody with pride or with any \nconviction say that is the right policy now, after all these years? But \nthat is what we are doing.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Do I understand that the Senate and the House, on both \novertime and mad cow, or country of origin, voted by large majorities \nto have there be a continuation of overtime and to have country-of-\norigin labeling on all beef that comes into the United States? Did both \nbodies, by an overwhelming vote, sustain country of origin and \nelimination of the President's effort to wipe out overtime?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The assistant Democratic leader is correct. That is a \nsuccinct summary of what we did. We voted to ensure there be country-\nof-origin labeling, like 43 other countries have in the world today, \nknowing we will not be able to export our product to Japan unless it is \nlabeled. We did that.\n  When we found out the administration actually wanted to eliminate \novertime, we said we are going to prohibit that.\n  As the distinguished assistant Democratic leader's question suggests, \nthe administration--over the objections, I would say, of the Presiding \nOfficer and others on both sides of the aisle from the Senate--insisted \nthat be part of the appropriations process and this omnibus bill.\n  There is a third issue, and that is media concentration. Many of us \nare deeply concerned about concentration of media ownership, and for \ngood reason. We have seen far too many examples already of what \npressure is brought to bear at the local and even at the national level \nas a result of the power of ownership in media today. I must say, it \ngets worse and worse with each passing year. What we said is there \nought to be a threshold on ownership of no more than 35 percent. That \nwas a position taken on a rollcall vote here in the Senate. Incredibly, \nit was a position taken on a rollcall vote in the House of \nRepresentatives. Yet what does this omnibus bill do? This bill \noverrides both the vote taken in the House and the vote taken in the \nSenate. It is not representative whatsoever of the positions of either \nbody, but it is in this bill.\n  How did it happen? Where was the rollcall vote in the conference to \noverturn this incredible decision? It happened in the dead of night. It \nhappened because of an ultimatum. It happened because of pressure from \nthe White House and people who did not hold those views in the House \nwho lost the first time.\n  I worry about this precedent from the point of view of the \ninstitution. What does it mean in a democracy when 100 Senators vote, \ntake a position, and when 435 Members of the House vote and take a \nposition, and a cabal in the dark of night with no rollcall vote can \noverrule that position willy-nilly, with absolutely no record, with no \nfingerprints, and nullify the actions taken by the bodies themselves? \nWhat precedent does that set in our democracy today? Where will this \ntake us in the future? How many more of these incredible overturning of \nposition events will occur before all of us rise up in indignation and \nsay what is a democracy if that is the result, that we can actually go \nto a conference and have a small group of people overturn the majority \nof Republicans and Democrats on important issues like this?\n  I must say, regardless of philosophy, regardless of politics, \nregardless of the issue, if you care about this institution, 100 people \nought to be on this floor to talk about this today. So I am worried \nabout that and I am worried about the policy itself.\n  But I know why we will probably get cloture today. Nobody here wants \nto be accused of shutting the Government down. Everybody understands \nthe commitment that this legislation reflects in its support for \nveterans and for so many other things that we care deeply about. \nSenators are put in a very difficult position. I understand that. Do \nyou support veterans or do you support an effort to deal with mad cow? \nDo you support highways and transportation or do you support an effort \nto confront this onerous provision eliminating overtime? Do you support \nhousing or do you support an effort to retain the Senate position with \nregard to media concentration? That is a tough position for anybody to \nbe in, especially people in politics. So we may lose this cloture vote \ntoday. I suspect we will. And I understand why.\n  But I must say, first we ought to be concerned. I don't care whether \nyou are\n\n[[Page S129]]\n\nin the majority or minority, Democrat or Republican, liberal or \nconservative, we ought to be concerned when some small group of people, \nin the dark of night, overturn legitimate public rollcall decisions \nmade by this body. We ought to be concerned about that because I think \nit is an erosion of democracy in our Republic that is deplorable, \ndeplorable. How many more times is it going to happen? How does it \nrender the Senate, this so-called deliberative body, when we can \ndeliberate, make tough decisions here on the Senate floor, only to be \noverturned? What does it say?\n\n  With regard to the issues themselves I will say this: I said a couple \nof days ago this is the beginning. It was not our desire to shut the \nGovernment down, to block this bill ultimately. We wanted to give our \nRepublican colleagues a chance to fix it. They have chosen not to fix \nany of these issues. But we will be back. We must be back. We will \ncontinue to offer amendments on whatever vehicle is presented to us. We \nare now preparing Congressional Review Act resolutions. The legislative \nveto is available to us on some of these matters and we will use it.\n  So we will be back again and again. These issues will not go away. We \nwill continue to fight and we will continue to work, first, because we \ncare about the institution but, second, because we care about these \npolicies.\n  So, Mr. President, it is with great concern--chagrin, that we find \nourselves in a position today that I wish had never presented itself to \nthis body.\n  We will have a vote on cloture. We may have a vote on final passage. \nBut it will not be the last vote on these issues.\n  I hope in the interest of this institution we will learn the hard \nlessons that these specific problems have created for each of us.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/22/senate-section/article/S129-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 2673, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A conference report to accompany H.R. 2673, making \n     appropriations for Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and \n     Drug Administration, and related agencies for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2004, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there will be \n4\\1/2\\ hours equally divided between the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Appropriations Committee or their designee for debate only.\n  Who seeks recognition? The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I yield myself about 10 minutes, if that \nis appropriate.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I thank the Chair.\n  First of all, I want to speak today about this appropriations bill \nthat is now on the floor. I have serious ambivalence about how we \nshould deal with the specifics of this measure. I know members of the \nAppropriations Committee, led by the Presiding Officer, have worked \nlong and hard. They have worked in a fair way to try to make sure they \nput together the best final product they can, have been sensitive to \nthe needs of their colleagues, and have worked to try to be balanced \nabout how they brought forth this final product. Unfortunately, through \nthe conference process, a product has emerged that differs from that \nsought by our leaders here in the Senate.\n  It is with some ambivalence that I feel the need to express some of \nthe reasons why I will not be supporting the Omnibus appropriations \nbill for 2004. It contains what I believe are serious policy flaws \nthat, furthermore, don't deal actually with the appropriations process. \nThey go far beyond what should be addressed, debated and concluded in \nthe democratic forum of this Senate, and in the House.\n  It seems to me that the most serious problem here is not even those \npolicies, although they are very important in and of themselves, but \nthis process that has somehow overturned the policies supported by wide \nmajorities in both houses, policies we worked so long and hard to deal \nwith--I think this process is out of kilter.\n  But I also believe that, at a policy level, they are important, \nthings such as overtime. It is just hard to believe when we can pass a \ndividend and capital gains tax cut to help those who are already doing \nwell to improve wealth, and, to put it in economic terms, to reward \ncapital, we are turning our backs on labor and on work.\n  I don't mean labor in an organized sense. I mean our workforce, the \npeople who work. It seems to me that people who work should have at \nleast the same value attested to their efforts as people who invest. \nHere we are talking about 8 million people who will come off these \nrolls of potential overtime benefits. For what reason? For what reason \nare we doing this when we want to reinforce the work ethic in this \ncountry? And these are the people who have modest to middle-income \npositions in our society.\n  It is extraordinarily difficult to understand this decision when you \nconsider the context that both this Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives have opposed changes to our overtime rules. This bill \nis a turnaround from the will of both bodies on this matter. It is \nincredibly difficult for me to understand why we are moving forward \nwith this bill when we have something that strikes at the heart of what \nit is we value in this country. Work ought to be something that is \nrewarded. It ought to be recognized. It has been a part of the \nconsensus we have in this country. Obviously, it is broadly conceived \nas being the right thing by the majority of folks in both houses and on \nboth sides of the aisle. I have grave difficulty understanding this. It \ngoes to the fundamental essence of how our economy works. Work ought to \nbe valued at least the same as capital in this society.\n\n  Here we are turning our backs on it. We are sending the wrong signal \nto our kids, and to society in general. It is a big mistake, in my \nview--so big that I think it actually compromises the value of the \noverall piece of legislation.\n  Second, I have serious concerns about media concentration. Of course, \na lot of us do not often like things that are said in the media. We \ndon't like that to-and-fro which impacts us individually. But society \nis better by it. It is a lot better when we have a healthy debate of \nideas and different viewpoints come out. That is what democracy is \nabout.\n  The last time I checked, both sides of this body supported the media \nconcentration rule at 35 percent. And somehow we have a different rule \nthan what was agreed to by both houses. I heard the distinguished \nminority leader speak to the essence of the institution, and the \ninstitution is broader--not just the Senate but the Senate and the \nHouse. How can we reach agreements on things and then come out with a \ndifferent result on something as important as how we communicate with \nthe public in this country? How do we change the dynamics of political \ndebate and news coverage on which the people rely to fulfill their \ncivic duty and gather information to make decisions, such as who they \nare going to support? How will they make informed decisions when we \nhave this concentration? It is an incredibly difficult concept for me \nto understand.\n  We don't raise a lot of cows in New Jersey, but we eat a lot of meat. \nI don't understand the country-of-origin labeling issue. Why would we \nnot take the steps that are necessary to protect the American people \nand to protect the country's economic interests so we can keep the \nexport markets open? This is not fundamentally sound on either the \nsafety of the public or our own economic security. Why are we trying to \ncut jobs in this country? It is bad enough that we are cutting \novertime. Now we are undermining our ability to actually be effective \nin the global market because we are making policy that reflects a \nnarrow interest as opposed to the public's interests and the broader \neconomic interests of the country.\n  It is hard to understand at a period in time when we are down 2.3 \nmillion jobs\n\n[[Page S130]]\n\nin less than 3 years, where there hasn't been the kind of growth in \neconomic reality of people's lives--that is, going to work: jobs. Here \nwe have something that endangers the public and strikes at the heart of \neconomic growth. Economic growth makes a difference in families' lives \nin America: jobs. I have trouble understanding this.\n  I heard my distinguished colleague from New Jersey yesterday come \ndown and talk about the destruction of records on the purchase of \nfirearms after 24 hours.\n  Where are we coming from in a world where we have a war on terror \nwith people who like to buy guns and go and use them for purposes that \nare antagonistic to the security of the American people? We are passing \na law that is going to make that activity much more available. We can't \ncheck out records of air flights into the United States in a week, and \nnow we are willing to say that we are going to take records on the \npurchase of a gun and have them destroyed within 24 hours? Please, \nsomebody tell me the rationality of that in the midst of a war on \nterrorism.\n  Our President spent three-quarters of the State of the Union address \ntalking about how we need to protect Americans both at home and abroad, \nand we turn around and embed in this legislation--by the way, not pass \nin this body--we turn around and change a fundamental issue with regard \nto gun safety in this country. It is very hard for me to understand \nthat. We are turning our backs on protecting the American people.\n\n  I heard my colleague from New Jersey say this is a real deal where he \ncomes from, a real deal. Seven hundred people in my State--10 people in \nmy hometown--died on 9/11. I don't understand why we are changing the \nelements of safety and security of the American people in an \nappropriations bill. Why are we doing that? What special interest is \narguing for that? What interest makes that so important we do that here \nand now? I find it incredible we think this is the right way to move \nforward on gun safety.\n  Overtime and the value of work, free expression of political opinion \nin our country as reflected in our media rules, and the gun law changes \nin this climate of heightened concern about homeland security, I don't \nunderstand why these major policy moves are embedded in an \nappropriations bill, particularly when both Houses--at least on parts \nof these issues--have already said this is not the direction we want to \ntake.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield for a question, will the Senator \nalso agree--to complicate matters with what we are doing here today on \nthe overtime issue, which is so important to so many millions, not \nhundreds, not thousands but so many millions of Americans--the Senator \nis aware that no matter what happens on this piece of legislation, the \nPresident now can do whatever he wants? Whether this passes or not, the \nPresident can do whatever he wants; is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. CORZINE. To be honest, I believe I have a sense that the \nPresident can do whatever he wants to do with regard to this issue. I \nthink they have already done that. This authorization is embedded in \nthis bill. But I know they can stand back and stop this with the same \nregulations they proposed to start.\n  Mr. REID. Again, I ask my friend the question, we have in one of \nthese appropriations bills a prohibition, a piece of legislation that \nwould prevent the President from exercising his authority to take away \novertime rights for people all over America; is the Senator aware of \nthat?\n  Mr. CORZINE. The distinguished Senator from Nevada, our assistant \nminority leader, is exactly right. I have read those exact words and \nknow the President can use his authority for good or he can turn his \nback on Americans.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is aware that some time, for lack of a better \ndescription, in the dead of night, where there was no one from the \npublic present, even though the House and the Senate passed provisions \ndealing with overtime, the Senate is aware it was stripped from the \nbill?\n  Mr. CORZINE. I understand this is not part of the legislative process \nthat we have all been a part of in the Senate and that in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. MurkowskiI). The time of the Senator is \nexpired.\n  Mr. CORZINE. If the Chair will yield 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, I repeat, the policies of this bill on \novertime, media concentration, and certainly gun safety records are \njust incredibly out of connection with the reality of the world in \nwhich we live today. Work should be valued, open debate should be \nvalued, and the safety of our citizens, our homeland security, should \nbe valued.\n  Again, I compliment the leadership on its work on this appropriations \nbill. I just do not understand why we have had to mix it up and put it \ninto a bowl of seriously flawed policies. There is a whole series of \nother policies, including vouchers in the school system, that have \noccurred without real debate--and I could go on--but overtime in this \ncountry is a value of work. Media concentration was designed so that \nAmerica could have a free press and a free debate. We ought to be \nmaking sure we protect these fundamental rights. It ought to be done in \na democratic way. I hope my colleagues will stand with us on principle \non the Omnibus appropriations bill to fix it and come back to the \nfundamental underlying appropriations process.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I call attention to the Senators, as the leader's \nopening statement indicated, it is entirely possible a vote on the \ncloture motion will occur before 2 p.m. There are 4\\1/2\\ hours of \ndebate equally divided prior to this second cloture vote, but those \nMembers who want to speak should indicate to their respective floor \nleaders if they want to speak so we are not going to have anyone \ndisturbed over relying on the concept that there are 4\\1/2\\ hours when \nthere probably will not be 4\\1/2\\ hours of debate.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate very much the Senator making this statement. \nIf there are Members desiring to speak and use the full 4\\1/2\\ hours, \nthey have a right to do that. However, there have been requests on our \nside and on the majority side from Senators who would like to vote \nearlier. We would have to vote by 12 o'clock. So it would cut off 2 \nhours. We cannot vote at 12:30 because we have a policy luncheon \nstarting at 12:30 and we have two votes.\n  If Members wish to speak, if they would notify the floor staff on \nboth sides, we will divide up the time. If someone cannot come until \nthis afternoon, that is the way it will be; we will have a vote at 2 \no'clock.\n  I repeat what the distinguished President pro tempore has said: Some \nSenators wish to move forward more quickly, and we will do whatever the \nwill of the body is, but we need to notify Senators as soon as \npossible.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, we are prepared to work with the \nminority in that regard and have the vote earlier if that is desired. I \njust want to call attention to the fact that Senators ought to take \nthat into consideration in terms of whether or not they want to come to \nthe floor and make a statement. If there is no indication anyone wants \nto speak, obviously we will go to a vote earlier.\n  At this time, I yield to the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, the \nright to designate the time allocated under the time agreement on this \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Will the Senator from Alaska yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am happy to yield for a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of the concurrent resolution \nwhich I will send to the desk correcting the enrollment of the omnibus \nconference report. The resolution restores the Senate language barring \nthe implementation of the regulations which will deny overtime pay to \nmillions of workers; that the concurrent resolution be agreed to and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid on the table.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reluctantly, I must object to that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Parliamentary inquiry to the distinguished minority\n\n[[Page S131]]\n\nwhip: Is it premature to ask for unanimous consent to change the time \nof the vote?\n  Mr. REID. It is. I say to the distinguished Senator from Texas that \nwe are now waiting to hear from a number of Senators who have indicated \nthey want to speak. It is a question of whether they can do it before \nlunch or if they have to do it after lunch. We are trying to work on \nthat as quickly as possible.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, it would be in everyone's interest, \nonce our Senators are notified, if we could set that time so our time \ncould be roughly equally divided before then.\n  With that, Madam President, I will speak on our time and talk about \nthe importance of passing the omnibus bill. This is a bill that \nencompasses many departments in our processes in the Senate. Normally, \nwe try to pass each department separately so we can deal with those \nissues separately. Because of various circumstances, we now have a bill \nthat takes in several major departments. Therefore, there are things \nthat have not been debated separately. I know there are concerns that \nhave been raised. However, we must pass this bill if we are going to \nhave the will of today's Congress take effect for the appropriations \nbetween now and October 1 of this year.\n\n  If we do not pass this bill--the alternative is a continuing \nresolution--it means that last year's priorities would prevail, and \nthere would be some major losses in funding for the next 9 months of \nthis year.\n  Let's take, for instance, the veterans. Today we would lose, by not \npassing this bill, the ability to fully serve our veterans in their \nhealth care. Continued operations under a continuing resolution would \nforce the Veterans' Administration to curtail the hiring of new \nphysicians and nurses, pharmacy costs would continue to rise, and we \nwould not have the money to pay for the added expenses that we are \nseeing in the medicine benefits to veterans. The waiting list for \nveterans medical care would start to rise, and it would mean the VA \nwould not be able to expand its long-term care services under the old \npriorities.\n  Part of our bill this year that is before us today expands veterans \nmedical benefits. If we pass a continuing resolution, we would not be \nable to increase that medical service. We have new veterans with \nmedical needs coming home now from Iraq and Afghanistan. The idea that \nwe would not fully fund the needs of veterans today is unthinkable. \nThat is what would go by the wayside if we do not pass the omnibus \nbill.\n  Let's talk about education. In the bill, Pell grants maintain their \nhistorically high maximum award of $4,050 to help disadvantaged \nstudents achieve the dream of a college education. Afterschool centers \nare increased in funding to $1 billion.\n  Impact Aid--now, Impact Aid is for school districts that have a high \nnumber of bases, military personnel in that school district. Impact Aid \nhelps the school district overcome the fact that you cannot tax Federal \nproperty. If a base is a major part of a school district, that is \nnontaxable property. Yet military personnel send their children to \nthese schools. So the Federal Government has always made up the amount \nthat would be lost in property taxes by giving Impact Aid. It is \nincreased $49 million over last year. That will be lost for the next 9 \nmonths if we do not pass this bill, thereby further strapping the \nschool districts in the places that have a high volume of military \npersonnel.\n  Wouldn't that be an incredible thing to say to our active duty \nmilitary: Oh, we are putting more responsibility on you. We are putting \nmore burden on you. Many of you are overseas, but you have to worry \nabout the school districts not having the money to fully educate your \nchildren while you are serving our country. Is that really a message we \nwant to send today to our military personnel?\n  Head Start funding, to help prepare our disadvantaged young children \nto learn and succeed in school, it is boosted by $148 million in the \nomnibus. That would be lost for the next 9 months if we do not pass \nthis bill, so we would not be able to get those programs geared up with \nthe reforms that we are trying to put in place that make Head Start \nmore of an educational experience rather than just a play experience \nthat is day care. We are trying to give these young children the \nopportunity to proceed, before they get to kindergarten, with the very \nbest early childhood education possible.\n\n  When I was home over the holidays, I visited one of these target Head \nStart centers, where children in the 3-year-old class and the 4-year-\nold class were learning their ABCs. They were learning their numbers. \nThey were learning the computer. There were 3-year-olds and 4-year-olds \nworking on the computer. This is the kind of Head Start Program we want \nto fund. That would be possible if we pass the omnibus bill. That would \ncertainly be curtailed if we do not pass the bill.\n  The National Cancer Institute would have $148 million more over the \nnext year if we pass the omnibus bill. But if we stick with last year's \npriorities, the National Cancer Institute will have to stop its funding \nincreases. Many people know, with the increase in health care research \nin the National Cancer Institute, we have been able to make great \nheadway in fighting cancer, in finding the cause of cancer, and then \nfinding something that will fight that particular cause of cancer.\n  The Geraldine Ferraro Cancer Education Program would be funded in \nfiscal year 2004 $5 million. It would help educate the public on issues \nsurrounding blood cancers. None of this funding would be provided under \na continuing resolution. So that is $5 million that would go to the \neducation of cancers such as lymphoma, leukemia, multiple myeloma, \nwhich is very important because these are the cancers that have \nhistorically been underfunded. Many people now are getting these \ncancers when they are not really aware that they need to have their \nblood checked but because they are losing energy. It is a terrible \ndisease. The Geraldine Ferraro Cancer Education Program funding would \nlapse if we do not pass this bill.\n  Election reform. We made major steps in the right direction on \nelection reform this year. The Help America Vote Act would be providing \nfunding to States to make sure they follow through on Congress's \ncommitment to strengthen the electoral process. None of this funding \nwould be available under the continuing resolution.\n  In a very important Presidential election year, when we are going to \nelect every Member of the House and when we are going to elect one-\nthird of the Senate, do we really not want to fully fund the reforms to \nassure our electoral process is fair, that it is a system where people \ncan count on their vote counting? I hope not. That is $1.5 billion in \nthe omnibus bill that would not be funded for the next 9 months, until \nOctober 1, if we do not pass the bill.\n  So we obviously would not have any of these reforms in place if we do \nnot fully fund and pass the omnibus bill that is before us today.\n  The Millennium Challenge. This is a program that would be both \nauthorized and funded at $1 billion this year to help developing \ncountries achieve economic growth, to lay out alternatives to poverty, \nviolence, and terrorism. This is very important in our war on \nterrorism. If we keep terrorists from being able to lock into a country \nthat is very poor, we will give the people of that country hope, hope \nthat there is something else besides just violence and continued \npoverty. Economic possibilities, economic opportunities are what will \nmake a difference in many of these countries.\n  The FBI is a very important part of homeland security. We now have \nput the FBI into the same grid that works in homeland security, with \nintelligence sources to try to pick up the signals that maybe there \nwould be another terrorist attack.\n  Under the omnibus bill, the FBI will be able to hire 229 new agents, \nreceiving $138 million in program improvements to help in the fight \nagainst terrorism. If we do not pass this omnibus bill, we will go 9 \nmonths without allowing the FBI to gear up for what we are asking them \nto do; and that is, to hire the agents to be a part of our homeland \nsecurity.\n  The International Trade Administration is funded at $28 million more \nthis year. What would we lose if that funding goes by the wayside? This \nis what is focusing on many countries' compliance with trade standards, \nChina's compliance with trade standards. We\n\n[[Page S132]]\n\nhave heard many concerns raised in our country about China complying \nwith fair trade standards. We need to make sure China and every country \nmeets the standards they have signed on that they would meet, standards \nthat require intellectual property to be protected.\n  We don't want to allow people to copy the videotapes or the movies or \nthe books that are being written by other people and not pay the \nintellectual property requirement to do so. But we need the enforcement \ncapability. That will be lost.\n  We are targeting countries for cultural exchanges and education \nprograms. One of the long-term goals in the war on terrorism is to try \nto bring people from countries that do not have democracy, that do not \nknow freedom, to our country for cultural exchanges, for education, to \nshow public education, giving our children the opportunity to learn, to \nread and write and learn math, to be able to function in a world that \nwill create an economic base for a country. Many of the countries that \nare the home bed of terrorism do not have these freedoms.\n  Cultural exchanges are one of the long-term goals that we have in the \nwar on terrorism to have people come from these countries to see what \nhappens when you have a strong system of public education, to see what \nhappens when you have freedom, to see how people can live when there is \nthe right to free speech, when there is the right to a free public \neducation that would give our young people the economic opportunities \nthat education will give them.\n  A long-term continuing resolution that would not give any of these \npriorities that we have put in place in the bills that have come out of \nthese committees would cause a $5.5 million budget shortfall for the \nSmall Business Administration. That would be almost a 20-percent \nreduction in their budget. Programs that help small businesses compete, \nsuch as the 7A program, would eventually be shut down if we have a \ncontinuing resolution rather than this omnibus bill.\n  As I have gone through my State during the past 2 months, I have \nfound many small business people complaining that the Small Business \nAdministration offices are being shut down, the services are not there, \nthe opportunity to have Small Business Administration loans and \ncounseling is not as it used to be. If we pass a continuing resolution \ninstead of this omnibus bill, we will lose almost 20 percent of the \nSmall Business Administration budget.\n  It is very important we pass this bill, if we are going to fully fund \nour veterans health care, if we are going to fully fund the schools in \nour home district military bases so that people on active duty serving \nour country will not have to worry that their children in school are \nnot getting their full educational opportunities this year.\n  The National Cancer Institute, with a $148 million cut over the next \n9 months will have to stop the progress they are making in many arenas \nfor finding the cure and the cause of cancer.\n  We are in a major election year. We would not fund the reforms that \nCongress has passed to assure every vote is counted, that we have good \nvoting machines so that we won't have an issue such as what happened in \nFlorida in the last Presidential election. We are helping States to \nhave the integrity of the ballot in this very important election year \nfor our Congress and for the President.\n  The International Trade Administration must be able to make sure that \nour intellectual property rights are met by countries such as China and \nother places that copy movies, copy books that don't pay the \nintellectual property requirements; the long-term exchange programs \nthat will help us fight terrorism by giving the young people from a \ncountry that does not know freedom the opportunity to see what freedom \nand public education can bring; cutting back on the FBI--all of these \nare the things that would happen if we don't pass this omnibus bill.\n  It is my hope that we will have the opportunity to pass this bill \ntoday so we can put the imprimatur of Congress today on the next 9 \nmonths of funding in this fiscal year rather than rely on a bill that \npassed 2 years ago which doesn't take into account some of the reforms \nthat have been made in Congress. It is my hope that Members will see \nthat our veterans' needs and the needs of our active-duty military \nchildren in education and in cancer research will prevail. We will pass \nthis bill and give our children a chance, and our country a chance, to \nhave the increases we need for our homeland security, and the education \nof our children, and the research into cancer to find the cause and the \ncure. We must pass the omnibus bill to go forward in all of these \naspects.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we have run a hotline. We have notified \nwhat Senators we thought would be interested in coming. Senator Kennedy \nand Senator Clinton have indicated they wish to speak. We have asked \nSenator Kennedy to come now. He will be here momentarily. Senator \nClinton will be here at around 11. What we propose--and hopefully the \nmajority will be here momentarily--is that the vote occur at noon \nrather than 2 o'clock, with the time evenly divided. If Senator Kennedy \nis ready to proceed, I ask that we would look at the unanimous consent \nagreement and consider Senator Kennedy's time in light of that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will contact the leader's office.\n  Mr. REID. He is supposedly on his way down here now.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I look forward to working with the distinguished \nDemocratic whip to see if that can be put forward and locked in. I hope \nwe would then start from a point to have equally divided time up until \nthe vote at noon.\n  Mr. REID. So everyone should be aware that the vote will likely occur \nat 12 noon today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, there are a number of provisions in \nthis legislation, the omnibus bill, that have been talked about. But I \nhope my colleagues will give consideration to the fact that the \nappropriators and the Republican leadership stuck into this omnibus \nbill a number of different provisions that never passed the Senate or \nthe light of day or the smell test. And took out provisions to help \nmillions of Americans. One of the provisions that they took out of the \nomnibus bill was a provision that was supported by the Senate and \nsupported by the House in a bipartisan fashion. That was the amendment \nto tell the Bush administration that they could not deny workers \novertime. His proposal would affect 8 million workers. Yes, this is an \nenormously important omnibus bill. Yes, it is important that we deal \nwith the problems in education and health. I yield to no one in my \nconcern in those areas.\n\n  All we are asking is that we take the omnibus bill and put back in \nthe protection for workers. Or we could have the Bush administration \nrescind its proposal to deny workers overtime protections.\n  We have challenges in our economy, but one of the great challenges in \nour economy is not that firefighters, nurses, and police officers are \nbeing overpaid. That is not the problem we are facing in our economy. \nBut that is going to be the effect if this particular omnibus bill goes \nthrough. The administration will implement its overtime provisions. As \nI mentioned yesterday, it is not just those individuals I mentioned--\nfirefighters, nurses, and police officers--it is also the veterans.\n  Listen to this, America. Since the time of the passage of the Fair \nLabor Standards Act, the United States has accepted the concept of a \n40-hour week. Then workers who worked more than 40 hours would get time \nand a half. That has been an accepted part of the American workplace \nsince the 1930s, when the Fair Labor Standards Act was passed. But now \nthis administration has made a proposal to effectively eliminate the \nrequirement to pay overtime to 8 million Americans, which includes \nfirefighters, police officers, and\n\n[[Page S133]]\n\nnurses. But they also put into this provision those who will be \nexcluded. Listen to this. Those who will also be excluded will be those \nwho receive the standard requirement and equivalent training in the \nArmed Forces. Do you hear that? Training in the Armed Forces. Over in \nIraq, American service men and women have been trained. We have the \nbest trained military in the world. The challenge of having a good \nmilitary is to have the best in training, the best technology, the best \nleadership, and the best support for the families at home. Those are \nthe elements of an effective military force. Now what we are saying to \nthose who are in the military, the service men and women who have taken \nthat training, which makes our military so superior--and being superior \nresults in the saving of lives of service men and women--we are saying \nthat kind of training in the Armed Forces will mean when you get back \nhome, you fall into that category of the 8 million who will be \nprecluded from getting overtime.\n  Can you imagine that? We have 200 training programs in the military. \nGreat numbers of them fall within this particular provision of training \nin the Armed Forces. For the life of me, I cannot believe why this \nadministration would write into their proposal that the training in the \nArmed Forces will mean you are going to be excluded from overtime pay. \nI just do not understand that. I just do not understand it. I wish \nthose on the other side of the aisle who support that particular \nprovision would come out here and explain that.\n  I want to mention another important provision in this overtime pay, \nthe effect of which hits a particular group in our society, and they \nare the women who are working in the American workforce. Two factors \nhave made life for middle-income and working families at least \nplausible and livable. One is the fact that women have entered the \nworkforce and, secondly, many of these families have mortgaged their \nhomes to deal with the problems of tuition escalation and other things, \nsuch as emergency health needs. The fact is there is no what they call \nin economics ``elasticity'' left in this. They don't have other members \nof the families who can work once the husband and wife are working. You \ndon't have another husband and wife to go out there and you only have \none home and if you mortgage that to educate your kids you just can't \ndo very much more. You are depending, to a significant extent, on \novertime pay. I want to remind the Senate about what has been happening \nin the workforce. The middle-income mothers work 55 percent more hours \ntoday than 20 years ago. Here it is: It was 895 hours in 1979, and in \n2000 it was 1388 hours--almost double what they were working in 1979, \nover a 20-year period. Why are they working? To provide for their \nfamilies. What are we saying to these mothers who are working hard and \nmaking some overtime? We are saying to the mothers and to the women in \nthe families you are not going to be able to get that benefit either. \nYou are not going to be able to get the benefit either. This falls \nparticularly hard on the 8 million Americans who will be outside of the \novertime definition, for the veterans who came back from Iraq in the \nmilitary forces, because it will be said you are a professional now, \nyou have had training in the Army. We have read in your record that you \nhave had some training, so even though you are doing this job, we don't \nhave to pay you overtime. It says that in the Armed Forces training \nregulation.\n\n  This provision falls unduly harsh on the women. As women have \nincreased their time in the paid labor market, their contributions to \nfamily income have also increased. These contributions have been \nparticularly important to lower and middle-income families. An increase \nin time spent at work creates childcare and other family challenges. \nThese added hours have had a negative effect on a parent's ability to \nbe at home after school, help with homework, or care for an ill or \naging family member.\n  The Bush proposal would take away overtime protections for millions \nof American women, ensuring that they work longer hours for less pay. \nWomen who are working today are going to work longer hours for less \npay. That is the result of the overtime provision. Make no mistake \nabout it. Our amendment protecting overtime--saying to the President \nthat he can't take away overtime pay--was taken out of the omnibus bill \nafter it was passed on the floor of the Senate and in the House of \nRepresentatives. But the Republican leadership knew they could not win \non the Bush proposal on the floor and they took it out of this bill--\nchallenging this body to take it or leave it.\n  This is one Senator who is going to leave it because of what it is \ngoing to do to working families, for the women and veterans in this \ncountry. Women tend to dominate retail services and sales promotions \nthat would be particularly affected by the Bush proposal. The increase \nin overtime, often with little advance notice, would take away from the \nfamilies, disrupt the schedule of working parents, as well as impose \nadditional childcare and other expenses. Women's groups like Nine-to-\nFive, the American Association of University Women, National \nOrganization for Women, National Partnership for Women and Families, \nand the YWCA express their strong support for the Harkin-Kennedy \namendment to preserve the overtime protections. Those are the leading \nwomen's groups--National Organization for Women, National Partnership \nfor Women and Families, YWCA. Effectively, every group that represents \nwomen in our society strongly opposes these provisions which are \nwritten in by the Republican leadership denying overtime.\n  These organizations representing women--Nine to Five, the American \nAssociation of University Women, the National Organization for Women, \nthe National Partnership for Women and Families, and the YWCA--have all \nindicated their strong opposition to the overtime provisions. They know \nthe adverse impact on women.\n  I wish to point out that of the millions of Americans who will lose \ntheir overtime, not only do we have police officers, nurses, and \nfirefighters, but if we look at other categories, we see cooks, \nclerical workers, a large percent of which are women, physical \ntherapists, dental hygienists, bookkeepers, lab technicians, graphic \nartists. These are major professional groups where, in a number of \nthose areas, women are the majority of workers, so they would be \nadversely affected. This provision adversely affects veterans and \nadversely affects women.\n  Today's New York Times points out what my colleague, my friend, John \nKerry, mentioned as a veteran himself in Exeter, NH.\n  This is the New York Times story:\n\n       An omnibus spending bill has been stalled in Congress in \n     partisan dispute over provisions to which Democrats object. \n     One would allow the Bush administration to press ahead with \n     rules that Democrats say could strip millions of their right \n     to overtime pay. Hitting that theme, Mr. Kerry said the \n     president would treat those who trained for some skilled jobs \n     in the military as professionals ineligible for overtime pay, \n     adding this ``made my blood boil.''\n       ``We need a president who understands that the first \n     definition of patriotism is keeping faith with those who wore \n     the uniform of the country,'' Mr. Kerry, a Vietnam veteran, \n     said. . . .\n\n  It could not be said any better than that.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire New York \nTimes article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 22, 2004]\n\n          Ignoring Other Candidates, Kerry Turns Focus on Bush\n\n            (By David M. Halbfinger and Randal C. Archibold)\n\n       Exeter, NH, January 21.--Surging in the New Hampshire \n     polls, Senator John Kerry ignored his rivals on Wednesday and \n     blasted President Bush on health care and charged that new \n     rules on overtime supported by the administration would bar \n     many veterans from overtime pay.\n       Mr. Kerry said the president had rightly praised American \n     troops and veterans in his State of the Union address. ``But \n     once again it's an example of a say-one-thing-and-do-another \n     administration,'' he said, pointing to the overtime dispute.\n       An omnibus spending bill has been stalled in Congress in a \n     partisan dispute over provisions to which Democrats object. \n     One would allow the Bush administration to press ahead with \n     rules that Democrats say could strip millions of their right \n     to overtime pay. Hitting that theme, Mr. Kerry said the \n     president would treat those who trained for some skilled jobs \n     in the military as professionals ineligible for overtime pay, \n     add in that this ``made my blood boil.''\n       ``We need a president who understands that the first \n     definition of patriotism is keeping\n\n[[Page S134]]\n\n     faith with those who wore the uniform of the country,'' Mr. \n     Kerry, a Vietnam veteran, said at Daniel Webster College in \n     Nashua.\n       He spoke as two new polls showed him taking the lead in New \n     Hampshire. The separate polls, in the Boston Herald and the \n     Boston Globe, each put Mr. Kerry 10 points ahead of his \n     closest rival, Howard Dean, although surveys in primaries are \n     notoriously unreliable because of the difficulty in \n     identifying likely voters.\n       Mr. Kerry also began commercials showing people praising \n     his ``leadership and experience'' and emphasizing his \n     endorsement by the Concord and Nashua newspapers.\n       Wednesday night at Phillips Exeter Academy, he drew about \n     1,000 people, easily his largest crowd for a stump speech in \n     New Hampshire.\n       In his noon speech in Nashua, he rolled out a few new \n     phrases to depict the president as out of touch with everyday \n     Americans and in the thrall of the ``special interests.''\n       ``You can tell from his State of the Union address that the \n     President is facing re-election,'' Mr. Kerry said. ``I wish \n     he'd face reality. Watching President Bush's speech last \n     night, one thing kept coming back to me: He just doesn't get \n     it.''\n       He invoked ``the unheard majority in the health care \n     debate,'' saying, ``We need a president who's going to make \n     sure their voice is finally heard, that they have access to \n     the White House, not just those who contribute significantly \n     to campaigns.''\n       Mr. Kerry said he would reverse rules barring Medicare and \n     states from negotiating for discounts on bulk purchases of \n     prescription drugs and repeal a ban on re-importing American-\n     made drugs from Canada. He called on Mr. Bush to work with \n     states like New Hampshire that have tried to start re-\n     importation.\n       Deriding the Medicare bill enacted last year as a benefit \n     only for pharmaceutical companies, Mr. Kerry said, ``If I'm \n     president, I pledge to you, we will repeal that phony bill.''\n       As Mr. Kerry aimed his fire at the White House, the second-\n     place finisher in the Iowa caucuses, Senator John Edwards of \n     North Carolina, briefly detoured to his native South \n     Carolina, where the Democratic primary will be held Feb. 3.\n       At a packed sandwich shop in Greenville, Mr. Edwards \n     sounded his themes of spreading optimism and hope in a \n     country he sees dispited by job loss, financial insecurity \n     and shrinking education opportunities. And naturally he \n     emphasized his roots in a state whose primary he says he must \n     win to remain in contention. ``I was born here, I still have \n     a lot of family here,'' Mr. Edwards said to raucous applause, \n     adding, ``This is part of who I am and I intend to compete \n     every way I know how.''\n       Later, back in New Hampshire, Mr. Edwards reprised a line \n     comparing his electoral potential in the South to that of his \n     northeastern rivals. Answering a question at Roland's diner \n     in Nashua on how he would get his agenda through a Republican \n     Congress, he said: ``The question is, who on the top of the \n     Democratic ticket can go everyplace in America and campaign \n     with the candidates and strengthen their ability to get \n     elected?''\n       He added, ``In Georgia, do you want John Edwards \n     campaigning with you? Do you want Howard Dean campaigning \n     with you? Do you want John Kerry campaigning with you?''\n       Later Wednesday evening, Mr. Edwards drew one of his \n     largest crowds yet in New Hampshire, some 400 people who \n     filled a V.F.W. hall in Portsmouth to overflowing. He drew \n     strong applause for his vow to diminish the influence of \n     special interests in Washington who he said block legislation \n     favorable to low-income and middle-class Americans.\n       ``Let me tell you what we should do with these Washington \n     lobbyists,'' he said. ``We ought to cut them off at the \n     knees. The truth is these people are stealing your \n     democracy.''\n       Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, who moved to Manchester rather \n     than compete in Iowa, called the New Hampshire primary race \n     wide open and talked up his ability to beat Mr. Bush as he \n     spoke to high school students and business leaders. He urged \n     voters to weigh his experience, consistency and \n     predictability.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, finally, I would have thought that \nsince Tuesday--it is now Thursday--we would have heard someone on the \nother side come down and defend stripping these provisions out of the \nomnibus bill. The silence has been deafening. One would think if they \nwere going to take these out, at least they would have the guts to come \ndown here and explain to the American people why. Why did they take \nthem out? Who took them out? Who asked that they be pulled out? What \nwas the reason, after it had been supported by the Senate and House of \nRepresentatives? But all there is is silence--silence--from the \nRepublican side.\n  That says something, does it not, when we are talking about something \nwhich has already been addressed in both Houses, passed in the Senate, \npassed in the House, and stripped out in the dead of night and there is \nsilence on the other side.\n  American workers deserve better. We deserve to understand what the \nprocess was in taking out this provision that has been passed by the \nSenate, and the leadership refuses to give us an opportunity to have \nanother vote to put it back in. Why are we not having a vote to be able \nto restore it? It doesn't take any time. We would agree to half an \nhour, with time evenly divided. Let's hear them defend the Labor \nDepartment's regulation, a regulation that will affect women, a \nprovision that works unfairly against veterans, a regulation that is \nunfair to firefighters, police, and nurses. Where is the justification? \nThere is silence on the other side.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. REID. What the Senator is saying--I say in the form of a \nquestion--there may be silence on the other side but it is a little \nhard, with mad cow disease floating across the world and occurring in \nour country, for me to comprehend how anyone could defend not having \ncountry-of-origin labeling in this bill.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts has been in the Senate for an extended \nperiod of time. Madam President, with all of his experience, can he \nthink of any reasonable rationale, logical argument that can be entered \nto defend their having taken something that passed the House and Senate \ndealing with country-of-origin labeling, namely, that if you buy a hunk \nof meat, you should know from where it comes?\n  In all of the Senator's experience, his ability to articulate as well \nas anybody in the country today, could he in his mind figure out a way \nto defend that position?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, the logic of the Senator's argument is so \noverwhelming and the common sense of it is so compelling.\n  Mr. REID. Could I ask another question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Let me complete this. As the Senator remembers, at the \ntime we heard about the mad cow disease, there was not a family in \nAmerica that was not asking what is the safety in terms of the food we \nare eating, the meat product our children and our families eat. All \nAmerica was concerned about it. We have an opportunity to do something \nabout it. We know what can be done about it.\n  As I hear the Senator from Nevada, it would not take an awful lot of \ntime. I know the Senator's amendment. I do not think it would take more \nthan half an hour to be able to include those provisions that would \ngive the kind of additional health safety protections for the American \npeople. It is not an absolute guarantee for every situation, but it \nwould make a major difference. How long does the Senator think it would \ntake to include those provisions that would provide the country-of-\norigin protection?\n  Mr. REID. I disagree strenuously with the Senator about needing half \nan hour. It could be done in 5 minutes, 2\\1/2\\ minutes on each side. \nThis is so clear cut. The Republicans en masse would vote in favor of \nthis.\n  This is something that has been directed from 16th and Pennsylvania \nAvenue. It was done in the dead of night. The Republican leaders did \nnot follow the legislative prerogatives within the Constitution and \ncaved to the President and corporate America.\n  This would take 5 minutes. We are going to have a chance to vote on \nthis, and when we do, it will overwhelmingly pass.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We could do it now, am I correct, or do it if there was \nagreement?\n  Mr. REID. We could do it now in 5 minutes. Nobody will oppose it. I \ndare anybody to come to this floor and oppose what is going on in this \ncountry on mad cow. My 13-year-old granddaughter at dinner Monday night \nasked her little 8-year-old brother, Aiden: Would you like a piece of \nmad cow? Even children are afraid of this.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, there you are.\n  Mr. REID. Could I ask the Senator another question? I apologize. I \nhope I am not imposing too much.\n  Relying upon the experience of the Senator from Massachusetts, whom \nwe have all heard on many occasions explain as well as anybody who \ncould on an issue, we have a situation where the President of the \nUnited States has indicated for a while now that he wants\n\n[[Page S135]]\n\nto take away overtime for millions and millions of Americans, and we, \nthe Congress assembled, the House and the Senate, said we do not want \nhim to do that, and we passed provisions and laws saying he cannot do \nthat.\n  Again, in the dead of night, the Republican leadership in the House \nand the Senate caved in to 16th and Pennsylvania Avenue. Now, I ask the \nSenator from Massachusetts, can he come up with any logical argument as \nto why the American people should be faced with police officers, \nfiremen, nurses, cooks, paralegals, dental hygienists, social workers \nnot being able to get overtime?\n  Overtime went into effect during the Depression, 70 years ago. Can \nthe Senator come up with any way anyone could articulate a defense of \nhaving this overtime provision in this legislation?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The answer is special privilege, special interest. Just \nto add to what my good friend from Nevada pointed out, the Department \nof Labor then had the gall to publish suggestions to show American \nbusiness how to make sure these 8 million were not going to receive the \novertime. This is just special interest politics: Mad cow, overtime, \npower of special interests. These are the similar kinds of interests \nthat denied this institution the opportunity to permit negotiation of \ndrug prices under Medicare. What is in the public interest there? \nAmerica is finally going to find out the Bush administration is \nprimarily interested in protecting the special interests, not the \npublic interest.\n  That is what I heard across the various small towns, communities, and \nfarms in Iowa. The American people are beginning to get it and nothing \nillustrates it more clearly than the proposed overtime change in \nregulations which so adversely affects not only these 8 million \nAmericans but particularly members of the Armed Forces, returning \nveterans, and the women in our society.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I will be very brief. I want to address a \nchange in the time we will be voting today and move that ahead. I want \nSenators to know just as soon as possible. I will propound a unanimous \nconsent request and then comment on it for 1 minute.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote on the \nconference report now occur at 12 noon; provided further, that the time \nprior to the vote on cloture be for debate only, and that the time be \nequally divided between the chairman or ranking member or their \ndesignees, with the final 10 minutes equally divided between the two \nleaders or their designees; provided further, that all of the \nprovisions of the previous order remain.\n  Mr. REID. Twelve noon today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Twelve noon today.\n  Mr. FRIST. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve noon today. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Parliamentary inquiry: The time would be equally \ndivided from now or from the beginning of the session?\n  Mr. REID. If there is a problem with time and more time is needed for \nthe majority, we will include Senator Kennedy's time. We only have \nSenator Kennedy and Senator Clinton. If somebody else comes, I am sure \nwe will not have trouble dividing up the time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That is fine. I didn't know how it would come up. I \nwanted to make sure, if we have some people before 12, that there is \nsome way to accommodate them.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, we have been working with both sides of \nthe aisle to make sure people have had adequate time to address this \nissue over the last day and a half. These are very important issues and \nwhy we have brought this bill to cloture votes and another vote. So the \nvote will be at 12 noon, with the understanding that this will give \npeople adequate time to speak. We will stick with the time being \nequally divided.\n  To clarify, the vote will be at noon, an hour and 20 minutes from \nnow. If we are successful with that cloture vote, there will be another \nvote right after the first vote. So we would have both of those votes \nbetween noon and 1 o'clock.\n  At that point, if we are successful, the plan is to go to the pension \nrate reform bill. We would begin debate on that bill today, as well as \namendments today and tomorrow.\n  The reason I am making this announcement now is because I want to put \neverybody who is interested in that pension reform legislation on \nnotice that they need to be around today, tomorrow, and Monday, during \nwhich we will debate and offer amendments.\n  If we are successful with these two votes and we get on the pension \nbill, I will be able to say no more votes today or tomorrow if we can \nstack those votes for Monday afternoon. We will have no votes after the \nomnibus bill today if we can make progress on the pension bill and come \nto an agreement that we will stack those votes for late Monday \nafternoon.\n  Mr. REID. Will the majority leader yield? The ranking member of the \nHELP Committee, Senator Kennedy, has indicated he is ready to begin \nsome debate on this bill on our side this afternoon. Senator Baucus, as \nyou know, is recovering from that accident where he fell. He will not \nbe here. The Finance Committee is aware Senator Kennedy will be \nmanaging the bill on our side. So we are ready to proceed on this \nmatter as soon as the omnibus work is completed.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I very much appreciate that \nparticipation. Coming back on January 20, there were a lot of things \ngoing on. This weekend people are going back to their States to have \ncertain meetings. It is important we continue the business. I \nappreciate the work on both sides this week. It has been a productive \nweek on many important issues, and we will continue to make progress \nover the course of the day.\n  If it goes as outlined--I would like to be able after the second vote \ntoday to begin the pension debate, with both sides having people \navailable--we would have no more votes Thursday or Friday--I am not \nmaking that announcement now, but hopefully later this afternoon--and \nthen we will stack votes for Monday afternoon. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the Senator from New York is on the \nfloor and Senator Bennett is on his way, but I want to take a moment \nand say I understand some of the concerns that have been raised, but \nthis is a bill that puts Congress's imprimatur on spending for the next \n9 months. It does not take last year's priorities. It takes this year's \npriorities.\n  We have had a chance to talk about it. We have had a chance to \ndebate. We have had amendments earlier in the process. There has been a \nfull vetting of the differences on this bill. My bottom line is, are we \ngoing to let this bill fail and have a continuing resolution that will \ngo from January to October 1 and fail to enact the reforms in election \nlaw that will ensure the integrity of the ballot in our country during \na Presidential election year? Are we going to keep $148 million from \ngoing into the National Cancer Institute when we are doing great \nresearch on the causes of cancer and the potential cures? Are we going \nto fail to meet the needs of our veterans by not allowing the hiring of \nphysicians and nurses, not fully funding the pharmacy costs which are \ngoing through the roof, which we must fund for the veterans who are \nneeding drugs as so many people in our country do? Are we not going to \nfully fund the impact aid schools where our military children go to \nschool while their parents are in Iraq and Afghanistan? Are we going to \nlet those schools' budgets be cut back? I ask, what is the alternative \nto passing this bill? The alternative is using last year's budget, last \nyear's priorities, and not putting the stamp of this Congress on these \npriorities in place.\n  I think we have to look at our choices. The choices are increasing \nthe FBI, increasing impact aid for our schools, increasing National \nCancer Institute funding, increasing the ability to make sure China and \nother countries are complying with intellectual property laws. We will \nlose a lot if we do not pass this omnibus bill today and go forward \nwith the funding programs for next year on an orderly basis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n[[Page S136]]\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I listened to the debate with respect \nto the fiscal year 2004 Omnibus appropriations bill that is before us. \nI agree with many of the points my friend from Texas was making about \nthe important appropriations in this bill and the necessity for \nproviding the funds needed to run the significant, critical programs of \nour Government. It is regrettable, therefore, that we are confronted \nwith this particular choice. It was an unnecessary choice. It is a \nfalse choice.\n  The appropriators worked very hard. I have the highest respect for \nmembers of the Appropriations Committee. In their hard work, they \nproduced recommendations about what funding was needed for the critical \nfunctions of our Government. If that is what we were voting on today, I \ndo not know that there would be a debate. I am confident there would be \noverwhelming support for that part of the bill. But we all know what \nhappened was not the bill that came out of the Appropriations Committee \nor the bills that came out of the Senate. Instead, in a conference \ncommittee, legislation was inserted into this appropriations bill that \nhas far-reaching consequences.\n\n  So here we are being asked to support the ongoing funding of the \nfunctions of our Government, which all of us agree is important, at the \ncost of supporting some very serious changes in our laws that will have \nfar-reaching consequences for the people who live in our States and our \ncountry.\n  As Members of the legislative body, the legislative branch of \nGovernment--because we have three branches, three coequal branches \nunder our Constitution--we have two primary responsibilities. First, we \nare the voices of the people who elect us. That doesn't mean we always \nagree with every constituent. That would be impossible. I have 19 \nmillion constituents. But it does mean that we listen and we pay \nattention and we try to make the very best judgments we can about what \nis in the interests of the people we represent.\n  Then, second, we are part of the system of checks and balances among \nthe branches of Government our Founders so brilliantly invented.\n  I believe this omnibus bill and the process through which it was \nconstructed violates both of those primary duties. This bill is laden \nwith provisions that were rejected by a vote in this body, and some by \nvotes in the other body. We took a vote. We said, representing the \npeople of New York or Nevada or Utah or America, we are for it or \nagainst it but here is where we stand. Apparently the majority vote is \nno longer the rule in Congress, much to my amazement and distress. That \nis because this bill has many provisions which were rejected, which \nwere turned away, yet here they are in the bill. We are asked that we \neither vote for everything or risk the loss of funding for critical \nGovernment functions. To me, it just defies our constitutional system.\n  There is a phrase, ``under cover of darkness.'' I think this bill \nrepresents, ``under cover of conference.'' This is one of those \nprocesses that may sound a little arcane and even boring to people \nwatching at home or sitting in the gallery, but this is the way our \nGovernment in this body, the Congress, works. The Senate passes \nsomething. The House passes something. Then, in order to work out any \ndifferences between the two Houses, they go to what is called a \nconference committee where they say: Here is what you passed, and here \nis what you passed. How do we compromise? Compromise is the very \nessence of a legislative body.\n  But that is not what happened this time. What happened is that the \nconference committee became a separate, equal, powerful, independent \nlegislative body run by the administration. It was under cover of \nconference that the White House unilaterally added provisions to this \nbill which reflect their political ideology and agenda, whether or not \nthe duly elected Members of the House and the Senate agreed.\n  Nowhere is the antidemocratic nature of this process more apparent \nthan in the denial of overtime pay protections for 8 million Americans, \nincluding 450,000 New Yorkers. This is a significant overhaul of our \nNation's worker protection laws. It was proposed under a cloak of \nsecrecy without a single congressional hearing, without a single public \nhearing.\n  As many of my colleagues remember, when the previous administration, \nthe Clinton administration, issued regulations governing how we work \ntoday with computer terminals and repetitive kinds of procedures which \ncause carpal tunnel syndrome and other sorts of problems, regulations \nwere issued to help redesign the workplace and protect the modern \nworker, particularly office workers but also people on assembly lines \nwho do repetitive work hour after hour. The Clinton administration \nLabor Department issued ergonomics regulations. That is the phrase that \ndescribes how we try to improve the workplace to deal with these kinds \nof stresses.\n\n  The Republicans in Congress attacked the Labor Department for issuing \nthese regulations, claiming they had rushed to judgment because the \nClinton administration held only 27 days of public hearings--27 days. \nHere we are being asked to vote to radically change the overtime \ncompensation rules of our country, and we have never had a public \nhearing from this administration. Nevertheless, the changes, when they \nwere announced, got a huge outpouring of reaction and a lot of scrutiny \nfrom workers and unions and people who know what it means to have to \nwork hard and be told you are going to work hard and you are not going \nto be paid any more money for it. Many tough questions were asked.\n  As Members of the House and Senate learned more about these \nproposals, we became concerned and we said wait a minute, we don't \nthink that is fair. On September 10 of last year, with bipartisan \nsupport, we addressed this proposed rule and we saw, in the House, a \nmotion passed to instruct the conference committee to adopt the Senate \nlanguage, which was on a bipartisan basis, to reject changes under \nthese kinds of circumstances in the overtime compensation laws.\n  Now what has happened? You would have thought that ended it. But, no, \nthe administration has refused to comply with the wishes of the \nmajority of both Houses of Congress, and I believe the majority of \nAmericans. So we are faced with an Omnibus appropriations bill that \nradically changes laws that have been in place since the 1930s. I just \nthink everybody needs to understand this. This is not a partisan \nstatement. This is not a political claim. This will take away overtime \nprotection from American workers, whether you are Democrat or \nRepublican, an Independent or pay no attention to politics.\n  I don't think most experts believe that workers will work less. In \nfact, the productivity gains that have been occurring are largely \nbecause workers in America are actually working longer hours, not fewer \nhours. In fact, the General Accounting Office found that workers who \nalready are not covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act protections are \nmore than twice as likely to work overtime; three times as likely to \nwork 50 to 60 hours per week.\n  This is going to have a particularly disadvantageous impact on \nAmericans who live in high-cost areas such as New York City. When you \nlook at what the new rules are and the way the administration has \nrubbed salt into these wounds by not only changing the rules but \nsending out circulars to employers to tell them how they can avoid even \ngetting into a position where they might have to pay overtime, it is \nnot a far reach to conclude, as have many experts who have looked at \nthis, that we are seeing with this bill a direct cut in the take-home \npay and the yearly income of people who work really hard and who will \ncontinue to work hard for less money.\n  Three of the groups that will be most impacted are police officers, \nnurses, and veterans. The International Union of Police Associations \nand its general counsel, who is widely recognized as one of the \nNation's leading experts on the Fair Labor Standards Act, estimates \nthat 50 percent of our police officers will lose their overtime \nprovision if this regulation is implemented.\n  I don't look forward to the next orange alert in any community in our \ncountry where police officers are put on 12-hour shifts, maybe 16-hour \nshifts, where they are asked to work double- and triple-time shifts to \nprotect us, and all of a sudden, no more overtime.\n  The same with nurses. I have an extraordinary admiration for nursing.\n  I know from many of the nurses with whom I work and speak on a \nregular\n\n[[Page S137]]\n\nbasis that they are already being forced to do a lot of overtime \nbecause of cost pressures on hospitals. They are being asked to do an \nextra shift. They come to the end of the week, and they are being asked \nto work weekends. Many nurses are concerned about the quality of their \nwork, being under pressure when they have already put in a 40-hour, 50-\nhour, or 60-hour workweek. But now we are going to ask them to keep \nworking and not pay them. I am sorry, I don't understand what reality \nour friends on the other side and on the other end of Pennsylvania \nAvenue live in. We are losing nurses at a rapid rate because the \nworking conditions with mandatory overtime are already so difficult. \nThe average age of the American nurse is 45. These are mostly women. \nBut they are women and men with lots of responsibility, training, \ncommitment, and devotion. They don't mind working hard, but they have \nfamilies. They have their own health to worry about. All of a sudden \nthey are going to be told their job depends on them putting in that \nextra time. But we are sorry, we changed the overtime rule.\n  Right now, nurses who do not have a 4-year degree could be denied \novertime under these proposed rules if they have ``experience in \nnursing.'' How absurd is that? Of course, they have experience in \nnursing. They are nurses.\n  It used to be if you had a professional degree above a certain level \nyou were considered a professional, you worked for a salary, and you \nweren't going to get overtime. But a lot of LPNs and others, after they \nhave worked a year or 2 years, all of a sudden have experience even \nthough they don't have a 4-year degree. So now this administration is \ntelling their employers to work them because they are now experienced. \nThat is their equivalent.\n  The cynicism of this is breathtaking. It bothers me greatly to see \nthis great body be part of such a fraud.\n  Look at the estimates. Two hundred and thirty-four thousand LPNs will \nlose overtime. You know that a lot of nurses are going to continue to \nwalk away from nursing. It is hard enough if you are paid for these \nlong, difficult hours. But not to be paid for them? I just think we are \ngoing to be exacerbating the nurse shortage and undermine the quality \nof care available to patients.\n  The final category I will mention is our veterans. We have heard a \nlot of rhetoric about veterans in the last couple of days, haven't we? \nI am very proud to represent hundreds of thousands of veterans. I am \nvery proud of the men and women serving us in uniform today. Yet this \nbill takes away the overtime protections to which many veterans in the \nworkforce are now entitled.\n  Right now, under the law as it is written before this regulation can \ngo into effect, only workers with a 4-year degree in a professional \nfield can be labeled professional, and, therefore, denied overtime. The \nBush administration, under this regulation, would do away with this \nrequirement. They would allow training in the Armed Forces to \nsubstitute for a 4-year degree. I know we have an all-volunteer \nmilitary. I am very proud of the young men and women who sign up to \nserve our country. I know when they are recruited they are told: Here \nis the training you can get and the additional education you can obtain \nin the Armed Forces. This is not only an opportunity to serve your \ncountry but to put you in a good position for the future when you get \nout of the military service if you do not make it a career. You will \nhave tremendous opportunities because of these skills.\n\n  Now we are turning around and breaking faith with our veterans, too. \nWe are basically saying: You know that training we gave you, that \neducation you acquired in the military? Now it is going to count \nagainst you. You take a job where otherwise you would be entitled to \novertime--say you become a police officer and an MP in the Army; you \ndon't have a college degree, but you served as an MP. All of a sudden, \nguess what. You are not eligible for overtime anymore.\n  It is very hard to justify in a jobless recovery like the one we are \nallegedly in that we would make life harder for working Americans; that \nwe would tell the police and firefighters and nurses and veterans and \nothers, guess what. We are going to take money out of your pocket in \norder to satisfy employers who do not want to be fair to you.\n  We wouldn't have needed these laws if everybody lived by the golden \nrule, would we? If everybody got up every morning and said I am going \nto treat people the way I want to be treated, I am going to treat my \nemployees the way I want to be treated, we would not have to have this \nlaw, or probably any other law. But we know, with human nature being \nwhat it is, that we have to have some protections for those people who \nare in less powerful positions. We are just tearing up that social \ncontract right now.\n  There are many other provisions in this omnibus bill that either were \nvoted against by this body and stuck in anyway or never considered. I \nam finding this an amazing experience being in the Senate. Everything \nthat I read in civic books and that I thought was what happened in our \nlegislative body is just being upended and thrown out the window.\n  Another provision slipped into the omnibus which was earlier rejected \nby this body on a bipartisan basis will delay the implementation of \nmandatory labeling of the country from which meat and vegetables are \nimported. I want to know where my food comes from. I would be happy if \nI could buy only food from New York because I would like to support my \nNew York farmers. I would like to know whether that is a New York apple \nor a Chinese apple. Somebody else can go ahead and buy the Chinese \napple. I want to buy the New York apple. I sure want to know where the \nmeat I eat comes from. That is what this body voted for.\n  But in response to pressure from a small group of the meat and food \nindustry executives, the administration did the bidding of the special \ninterests instead of the vast majority of Americans. Once again, why \nare we surprised? And they stuck language into this Omnibus \nappropriations that will prevent consumers like us from knowing where \nthe food we purchase is grown, and they will overturn a law that is \nvery important to the farmers I represent and to American farmers and \nproducers around our country. It is stunning that this would be done at \na time when we were really focused on our flood supply, when we know we \nneed to do whatever we can to protect our food from disease and \npossible terrorism.\n  The mad cow issue that arose a few weeks ago is something that has \ngotten everybody's attention focused on the quality of our food and the \nsafety of our food.\n  The idea of a country-of-origin requirement was passed as part of the \nfarm bill in 2002. Here it is 2004, and this administration wants to \nundo the will of the democratically elected majority of the Houses of \nCongress.\n  There are many more examples of what is wrong in this omnibus, \nwhether it is reimposing the national television ownership cap that was \nalready rejected in both Houses, making our media less diverse, more \nconcentrated, and less responsive to local issues.\n\n  Senators McCain and Hollings held extensive hearings on this issue. \nThey produced a Senate resolution to restore meaningful, cross-\nownership limits on television stations and newspapers. It passed by a \nvote of 55 to 40. That was a bipartisan majority vote. The legislative \nbranch did its job. We held the hearings, we got the evidence, we did \nthe argument and debate, and we had the vote. It doesn't seem to matter \nto the folks on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. If it crosses one \nof their special interests, by George, we don't care about democracy. \nWe don't care about majority votes. We don't care about bipartisanship. \nWe are going to deliver to the people whom we think are on our side \nwhen it comes to special interests.\n  It is distressing and it is something about which I think every \nAmerican should be concerned. We are undermining the checks and \nbalances of our Constitution. We are undermining accountability. We are \nundermining the coequal branches of Government.\n  If all we wanted was a king, we would have put a king into the \nConstitution to do whatever the king wanted to do. What do we need a \ndemocracy for? Why do we need to elect people to come to the Senate to \nexpress their opinion, hold hearings, and have votes? Let us just cede \nall authority to the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. They want\n\n[[Page S138]]\n\ncontrol of the executive branch. They want control of the congressional \nbranch. They want control of the pork. Why don't we just all give up \nand go home? It doesn't seem to matter what we vote on. It doesn't seem \nto matter what the majority says. The administration calls the shots, \nand people in this body let them do it. It is astonishing to me.\n  Another example: We are diverting limited educational resources to an \nuntested, unproven, private school voucher plan which was not included \nin the Senate-passed bill. I think, once again, we are doing something \nthat has no support in this body and we are letting it happen because \nthe administration wants it to happen.\n  We also have an across-the-board cut in this bill, not debated by the \nSenate, stuck into the bill at conference, taking away money from \nagencies of the Government, appropriations already signed into law, \nincluding the Department of Homeland Security.\n  I could go on and on. It is astonishing what happened under cover of \nconference. It is hard to justify a process that is so flawed, so \nantidemocratic--with a small ``D''--so beholden to and in the pocket of \nspecial interests, so willing to buckle under and do the bidding of the \nadministration, whether or not it is in the best interests or the long-\nterm benefit of our Nation.\n  It is our responsibility to do the business of those people who sent \nus here. By ignoring the will of the majority, by turning our backs on \nthe Senate and the House, we are making a mockery of our system.\n  I know very well that during the previous administration the other \nside of the aisle would be up in arms. And they should have been if \nsomething such as this had gone on, no doubt about it.\n  I hope we will continue to stand against this mockery of the \ndemocratic process and the undermining of our legislative \nresponsibility.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I have listened with interest to the Senator from New \nYork and will respond to several of the things she said.\n  I notice the chairman of the Appropriations Committee in the Chamber. \nI do not wish to intrude on his time unduly because he is the real \nexpert on this process and can explain why we are where we are far \nbetter than I can.\n  I do have personal reactions to several of the comments the Senator \nfrom New York has said. She talks about things that have not been \npassed by the Senate and gives two examples--country-of-origin labeling \nand vouchers--and says we are ignoring the will of this body.\n  But what she does not comment on and may not realize is that in both \nthese instances, the House of Representatives took a diametrically \nopposed position to that which was taken by the Senate. The purpose of \nconference is to deal with that kind of a challenge.\n  I will talk about the country-of-origin labeling because I was \npersonally involved in it. The House of Representatives said: \nAbsolutely, we are going to kill this program. The Senate said: \nAbsolutely, we have to keep this program. There is not a lot of room \nfor negotiation between those two positions.\n  For her to say it is terrible, what came back from conference was not \nwhat the Senate passed and somehow we did it because the administration \ntold us to do it ignores the fact that the House of Representatives has \nexactly the same amount of power under the Constitution as the Senate. \nAnd they took a very firm position.\n  What we came up with, in conference, and I was the one who suggested \nit so I have direct knowledge, was a compromise that said we will not \ntake the House position and kill this program, but since the House will \nnot take the Senate position and implement it immediately, let's simply \ndelay the effective date to give us time to figure out a way to make it \nwork, if it is possible to work.\n\n  I don't consider that under cover of darkness. I don't consider that \na violation of what we learned in civics class about the way to resolve \nproblems between the House and the Senate. I think it is a legitimate \nposition that comes to a compromise between the House's firm statement \nand the Senate's firm statement and says we will keep the law, which is \nwhat the Senate wanted, but we will delay the implementation, which is \nnot quite what the House wanted. I view that as a win for the Senate \nposition.\n  I am a little bit troubled to have the Senator from New York say we \nhave violated the spirit of the Constitution with this kind of a \ncompromise and this kind of accommodation between the two.\n  I have said this before and undoubtedly will again. I learned from my \nfather when he served in this body this truth: We legislate at the \nhighest level at which we can obtain a majority. Many times the process \nof getting to a majority is not pretty. Many times things are done \nwhich in civics class people would get very upset about, but in order \nto get a majority to get the thing done, this is where we are.\n  This bill represents the highest accommodation of all the interests \nwe can arrive at for which we could obtain a majority.\n  One other comment that I would like to make with respect to the \nSenator from New York and her constant repetition that all we did in \nthis conference was buckle under to the will of the administration; all \nwe did was accept the administration's position and over and over \nagain; we ignored our responsibilities as the legislative branch and \nsaid whatever the king wants we will give him. This is the rhetoric we \nget.\n  I have not been here as long as many Members and certainly not as \nlong as the chairman of the full committee who will speak next but I \nhave been here long enough to have been in a number of Appropriations \nCommittee conferences, most of them under the previous administration, \nthe Clinton administration to which she referred, and I tell my \nconstituents, in every conference of the Appropriations Committee on \nwhich I have sat--and there are a number of them--when the Clinton \nadministration was in power, the Clinton administration made its wishes \nvery much known. And in every instance the veto threat that came out of \nthe Clinton administration was, if you do not increase spending above \nthe amount you are talking about in this bill, the President will veto \nit.\n  There were times when we gave in to that pressure from the \nadministration. We felt it so necessary to pass the appropriations \nbills and fund the Government that we would grit our teeth and say, all \nright, we will, even though it was not adopted in either House we will, \nin fact, increase spending in order to avoid a veto threat.\n  The veto threats we have heard out of the Bush administration have \nbeen the other way. The veto threats out of the Bush administration \nare, these spending numbers are too high and we have to cut them down \nin the name of fiscal responsibility.\n  I make that point because one of the things being said in this \npolitical season is that the Republicans have given up on fiscal \nresponsibility; the Republicans are responsible for the runaway \nspending. I have been there. I have been at the conference committees. \nI can assure all Members that this administration is no more active in \nthe conference committees than the previous administration, and all of \nthe pressure out of the previous administration was to increase the \nspending whereas the pressure out of this administration has been to \ntry to get the spending under control. I simply want to get that \ninformation clearly on the record as we go into this political season.\n  With that, I yield the floor so we can hear from the other Senators.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss recent progress \nregarding amendment 13 to the Northeast Groundfish fishery management \nplan.\n  The omnibus appropriations bill we are currently deliberating will \npause the implementation of amendment 13 for 5 months. This pause was \nadded at my request because of inequities in this fishery management \nplan that unfairly discriminates against Maine fishermen. Since I \nannounced in November that I would seek to delay implementation of \namendment 13, considerable progress has been made to address the \ninequities in it.\n  Last week, the New England Fishery Management Council's Groundfish \nCommittee held an emergency meeting\n\n[[Page S139]]\n\nto address these problems. The committee made excellent progress. \nSpecifically, it forwarded a recommendation to the council regarding a \nminimum allocation of 10 ``B'' days-at-sea for all permit holders. This \nsignificant change will ensure that no fishermen are shut out of the \nfishery entirely. Further, the committee forwarded a recommendation to \nthe full council advocating a decrease in the conservation tax for \ndays-at-sea transfer. Both of these recommendations will soften the \nimpact of amendment 13 on Maine's fishermen.\n  The groundfish committee also charged their advisors with identifying \n``B'' fisheries in the Gulf of Maine. It is crucial that these \nfisheries are developed to ensure Maine's smaller vessels, which do not \nhave the capacity to reach the grounds currently open, can utilize \ntheir ``B'' days-at-sea. Finally, the committee asked their advisory \npanel to examine the problem of steaming time, which has long worked to \nMaine's detriment.\n  I recently received a letter from David Borden, chairman of the New \nEngland Fishery Management Council, confirming that ``all of the issues \nthat [I] consider important to Maine fisherman are now being actively \nevaluated and considered by the New England Fishery Management \nCouncil.'' Chairman Borden goes on to assure me the language that I \nincluded in the omnibus, ``provided the necessary focus for the fishery \nmanagement process to address these issues on a timely basis, and that \nprocess is well underway.'' I very much appreciate the chairman's \ncandor and his willingness to work with me to address the aspects of \namendment 13 that disproportionately harm Maine fishermen.\n  It is clear that in the months since my provision was added to the \nomnibus, the New England Council has acted in good faith to meet the \nconcerns of Maine fishermen. Given these developments, I am prepared to \nlift my objections to an implementation date of May 1, 2004 for \namendment 13. I will work with my colleagues to examine ways to lift \nthe funding restriction included in the omnibus. I do this in good \nfaith, and ask for good faith in return. My continuing effort to lift \nthis funding restriction is contingent on both the council and the \nconservation community continuing to actively address the concerns I \nand Maine's fishing community have raised.\n  I am pleased that my provision had its intended effect of focusing \nthe council's attention on the legitimate concerns raised by the Maine \nfishing community. I am confident that the council will continue to \nwork to improve amendment 13 for the benefit of all New England \nfishermen.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the sections of the \nconsolidated Appropriations bill, H.R. 2673, that pertain to funding \nfor the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State. I want to \nrecognize the conferees, especially CJS Appropriations Chairman Gregg \nand ranking minority member Hollings for their hard work on this bill.\n  It has been just over 2 years since the horrific September 11 attack \nagainst our country. We must remain vigilant in fighting the threat of \nterrorism. Our priorities should reflect the need to ensure the \nsecurity of our people. The Justice Department leads our Federal law \nenforcement efforts that are so critical to protecting our country.\n  Securing the safety and security of Americans at home and abroad \nshould continue to be the number one priority in the Federal law \nenforcement budget. Such security requires providing Federal law \nenforcement agencies, as well as State and local law enforcement \nagencies, with the tools necessary to combat terrorism. Providing \nadequate funding for these tools is essential to law enforcement's \nability to protect America. I am pleased that the Omnibus \nappropriations bill reflects this priority.\n  While we must continue to safeguard America from future terrorist \nattacks, we should, at the same time, exercise fiscal discipline in \norder to promote our economy. We face difficult budget decisions but I \nam optimistic that with the improving economy we can balance the need \nto fund fully the programs necessary to protect Americans with the \ncontinuing need to exercise the fiscal discipline that our constituents \ndeserve.\n  I am especially pleased that approximately $62 million will be \nappropriated to the Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force FTTTF. This \nindependent agency is responsible for coordinating and sharing \ninformation among agencies which is crucial to preventing terrorist \nattacks. The FTTTF is tasked with an enormous responsibility--gathering \ninformation from and sharing intelligence with--the CIA, the FBI, the \nNational Security Agency and the Departments of Justice, Homeland \nSecurity, Treasury, State and Defense. Breaking down the walls between \nour agencies is critical to our national security, and I applaud the \nincrease in funding for the Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force.\n  While our Federal law enforcement agencies have focused on combating \nterrorism, they also carry the burden of investigating and prosecuting \nother significant crimes. I am pleased to see that the bill includes \nalmost $557 million for Interagency Drug Enforcement which reflects \nfunding for the multiple Departments, including the Department of \nHomeland Security, the Department of Treasury, and the Department of \nJustice, which are responsible for cooperating and bringing together \nthe expertise of each of the Federal agencies with the efforts of state \nand local law enforcement to combat major narcotics traffickers and \nmoney launderers. This represents a significant increase to assist law \nenforcement operations.\n  I am especially pleased that the Conferees accepted the House funding \nlevels for the Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA at approximately \n$2.2 billion rather than the Senate's level which would have severely \nhampered the DEA. At a time when the DEA is shouldering a greater \nburden in fighting drug trafficking, I commend the Senate for \nincreasing the DEA's funding to make sure that our communities receive \nall the help they can to reduce the scourge of drugs.\n\n  I am also pleased to see that the bill funds the Juvenile \nAccountability Block Grant, JABG, program which was recently \nreauthorized as part of the ``21st Century Department of Justice \nAppropriations Authorization Act,'' P.L. 107-273. Congress reformed the \nfederal role in the nation's juvenile justice system by providing \nrelief from burdensome federal mandates and authorizing block grant \nassistance to States and local governments, which includes \naccountability-based juvenile justice programs. The authorization act \nstrengthened the Juvenile Accountability Incentive Block Grant program.\n  With the passage of Trade Promotion Authority in 2002, Congress set, \nas one of its priorities, the successful negotiation of free trade \nagreements. As many of my colleagues are aware, the burden of \nnegotiating these agreements falls on the Office of the United States \nTrade Representative, USTR. I submit that in order for USTR to do its \njob, we must ensure that they have the adequate resources necessary to \nperform the job that we demand of the agency.\n  Let's examine some of the realities at USTR. One year prior to the \npassage of TPA, USTR's workload was comprised of two trade agreements. \nOne year after the passage of TPA, USTR's has taken on more than five \ntimes its prior workload, negotiating nearly a dozen Free Trade \nAgreements and pursuing several dispute settlement talks.\n  And the complexities of the negotiations before and after the passage \nof TPA have changed. Under the mandates of TPA, through the course of \nnegotiating any Free Trade Agreement, U.S. negotiators seek: strong \nIntellectual Property Rights protections; access to telecommunications \nmarkets; access to financial markets; strong biotechnology protections; \nincreased access to the services markets; strong investment \nprotections; reasonable labor protections; common sense environmental \nprotections; access to the e-commerce market; to ensure the safety of \nimported food; and strong dispute settlement mechanisms that help to \nprotect America's economic interests. This is no small feat.\n  I am pleased that the conferees accepted the House level of funding \nto this important agency which provided an additional $5 million--\nbringing USTR's funding to $41,994,000. This additional funding is \nconsistent with the marked increase in the agency's workload and will \nhelp ensure that USTR will be able to adequately fulfill their \nCongressional mandate.\n\n[[Page S140]]\n\n  I was hoping to see language in the bill which would ask the General \nAccounting Office, GAO, to look into several issues that will be \nrelevant in the preparation of the 2010 census. What I would have liked \nto see could have been as simple as the following: the potential cost \nof any 2010 Overseas Census; the use of emerging technologies, \nincluding the internet, in any overseas enumeration; the feasibility of \nusing State or Federal systems for assigning Americans living outside \nof the United States for purposes of appointment of Representatives in \nCongress among the several states; and the different ways of \ndetermining some legal basis for whom should be counted.\n  These are important issues that need to be more fully explored. In my \nState of Utah, where some 14,000 Utah residents are serving an overseas \nmission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Later Day Saints and are not \ncounted in any census--this is an especially critical issue. I submit \nthat these four issues are not only important for Utahns but for the \nnation as a whole. There are many citizens of this great Nation that \nare either temporarily living or working overseas that are not counted \nin the decennial census. The Congress needs to identify the best and \nmost cost effective ways to ensure that every citizen is counted.\n  I would have also liked this bill to correct a provision enacted in \nSection 211 of the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations Act of 1999. That section was challenged before the WTO \nfollowing its application in a U.S. lawsuit addressing the \nenforceability of a trade name confiscated by the Cuban government in \n1960 without compensation to the owner. The court found the trademark \nto be unenforceable by the plaintiff entity, which had acquired the \nalleged rights to the mark from the Cuban government. Congress should \nbring the United States into compliance with the decision of the WTO \nAppellate Body in that case.\n  The WTO found in favor of the United States on the section 211 \nchallenge in all respects but one: it concluded that section 211 was \ndrafted in a manner that transgressed the national treatment and most-\nfavored-nation obligations under the TRIPS agreement. At issue was the \nlanguage of section 211 specifying that the Cuban Government, Cuban \nnationals and their non-U.S. successors are ineligible to own, and \ntherefore enforce, confiscated trademarks. We should clarify that the \nprohibition on owning trademarks confiscated in Cuba applies to all \nnationals, not just Cuban nationals and their successors, thus removing \nthe basis of the WTO's criticism.\n  While I urged the chairman and ranking Democratic member of the \nAppropriations Committee to look seriously at including this language \nin the bill to correct previous appropriations language, I do want to \nmake it clear that it does not constitute a waiver of the Judiciary \nCommittee's jurisdiction over this or any related matter.\n  Again, I want to thank the Conferees for their efforts.\n   Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to remark briefly on a \nmatter of critical importance to me, related to one of the bills \nincluded in this omnibus, VA-HUD. The Senate Committee on \nAppropriations' Report on VA-HUD contains language directing the Agency \nfor Toxic Substances and Disease Registry--ATSDR--to assess the lead \nlevels at the Tar Creek Superfund site in Oklahoma, and to submit a \nreport to Congress on this assessment no later than July 31, 2004. As a \nSenator from Oklahoma, and as the chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, I cannot emphasize enough the importance of \nthis endeavor to more fully understand the elevated lead levels we're \nseeing in this community, particularly in children. As the chairman of \nthe committee with jurisdiction over both Superfund and ATSDR, I would \nlike to take this opportunity to elaborate on my expectations of ATSDR \nin connection with this directive: I am urging ATSDR, in collaboration \nwith the Oklahoma State Health Department, to work to identify \nsignificant sources and pathways of exposure to lead that may be \ncontributing to elevated blood lead levels in children at the Tar Creek \nSuperfund site in Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to express my \ndisappointment with the Omnibus appropriations bill.\n  It is not without some reservation that I rise today to make this \nspeech. As a member of the Appropriations Committee I know how hard it \nis to draft these bills each year. Senators on both sides of the aisle \nhave worked long and hard to produce each of the seven bills that are \nwrapped into this package. Chairman Stevens and Senator Byrd were \ntireless in their efforts to move these bills along and have tried to \nkeep this process on track despite the difficult hand they were dealt.\n  Unfortunately this year, under the influence of the administration \nand the pressures of partisanship, the process broke down. It is now \nthe middle of January, nearly four months into the fiscal year, and 11 \nout of 15 Cabinet-level departments are running on a temporary spending \nmeasure. This stopgap measure has already caused disruptions in \nservices and cuts to many social programs.\n  We should not be in this situation. Had we considered these bills in \nregular order we would have passed most of them long ago. The foreign \noperations title was written in a bipartisan manner and every member of \nthe conference committee--Democrat and Republican--signed the \nconference report.\n  I strongly support this portion of the omnibus, and I want to commend \nmy friend from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, for working with me in such \na bipartisan way to produce what I believe was probably the best, most \nbalanced outcome we could have achieved.\n  Although the amount contained in the foreign operations conference \nreport fell far short of the amount requested by the President--a fact \nwhich I find mystifying since the President's party controls both \nHouses of Congress--it is an improvement over the previous fiscal year. \nIt contains several new initiatives, as well as additional funds for \nsome very important programs.\n  I supported Senator Daschle's effort last December to pass the \nforeign operations bill independent of the omnibus. If we were given \nthe opportunity to vote on the foreign operations portion of the \nomnibus by itself--and frankly I do not understand why we have not been \ngiven that opportunity--I would vote aye.\n  Instead the administration and congressional leadership used the \npressure to pass these bills as a vehicle to move their agenda forward. \nSeveral provisions were added, and in some cases removed, to the \npackage at the last minute and behind closed doors, sometimes in direct \ncontradiction to votes taken on the Senate and House floors. We are now \nin a situation where the omnibus is mired down in debate over \ncontroversial issues unrelated to the underlying bill.\n  These are issues as serious as how much overtime our Nation's workers \nshould be paid. The Bush Labor Department announced plans last March to \noverhaul the Federal rules on overtime pay. The new rules would \nredefine eligibility for overtime, adversely affecting nearly 8 million \nAmerican workers who earn between $22,100 and $65,000 annually. I am \ntroubled that so many working families in this country will no longer \nbe entitled to time-and-a-half pay. And I find it disingenuous that the \nLabor Department is planning to include in the regulations a list of \ncost-cutting suggestions for businesses that will show them precisely \nhow they can avoid paying overtime compensation to their employees.\n  On September 10 of last year I joined a bipartisan group of Senators \nin opposing the administration's overtime compensation changes. By a \nvote of 54 to 45 the Senate approved an amendment to the Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill to overturn the regulations for another year. The \nHouse joined this effort less then a month later when they instructed \ntheir conferees to support the Senate provision. Unfortunately the \nPresident threatened to veto the fiscal year 2004 Omnibus \nappropriations bill if it contained this provision. Late at night, \nwithout the consent of the full conference committee, congressional \nleaders relented and against the will of Congress the provisions were \nremoved from the final bill.\n  The Labor Department now expects to have its regulations finalized by \nthe end of March. And in testimony before\n\n[[Page S141]]\n\nthe Senate Labor Appropriations Committee yesterday the Secretary was \nunwilling to not only delay implementation of the regulations, but even \nto listen to the debate about how many workers will lose overtime pay \nbecause of the regulations.\n  Just 2 nights ago President Bush implored us to do more to help \nstruggling, working families across this country. He said we should \nlower their taxes so they have more money to spend. He said we should \nimplement new savings incentives so they have more money saved up. And \nhe said we should implement new programs to promote family life so they \nwill spend more quality time together. Unfortunately, the actions of \nthis administration to reach into the pocketbooks of hard-working \nfamilies--to take away their overtime pay and keep them apart for even \nlonger hours--speak much louder than the President's words.\n  The will of the Senate was also thwarted when it came to regulating \nthe safety of our Nation's food supply. Consumers have said, in large \nnumbers, that they want basic information about the food they consume. \nA recent nationwide poll indicated that 82 percent of American \nconsumers think food should be labeled with country-of-origin \ninformation. That is why Congress mandated country-of-origin labeling--\notherwise known as COOL--as part of the recently passed farm bill. The \nlanguage of the COOL law states that only beef born, raised, and \nslaughtered in the United States can be labeled a U.S. product. Only \nwith the country-of-origin labeling law will consumers be afforded a \nchoice about the origin of the food they purchase and consume. The \nrecent discovery of a mad cow case in Washington State from a Canadian \ncow has made clear the need to implement COOL immediately.\n  Unfortunately, the Bush administration has stridently opposed COOL. \nLanguage was included in this bill that effectively kills the labeling \nlaw and denies consumers essential information about the meats, fruits \nand vegetables they purchase.\n  The trend of bucking popular sentiment continued when it came to the \nissue of FCC media ownership caps. On June 2 of last year the FCC \nissued a ruling that would have relaxed media ownership restrictions \nfrom the 35 percent cap to 45 percent. After public outrage and much \ndebate, the House and Senate approved legislation reinstating a 35-\npercent limitation on FCC media ownership caps. Despite this the White \nHouse successfully lobbied for last-minute increase of a permanent cap \nat 39 percent.\n  This so-called ``compromise'' would only serve to the advantage of \nmedia conglomerates--several of whom are already in violation of the \n35-percent cap and who would otherwise be required to divest some \nassets in order to comply with the rule. There is no evidence that a 39 \npercent cap will protect the diversity of voices, or foster the \ncompetitive health of the information and entertainment industries. In \nfact, reasoned analysis suggests precisely the opposite. Unfortunately, \nDemocrats were not in the room when this decision was made. The doors \nhad been closed and communication had ceased.\n  I could go on. This mammoth bill includes a provision that will pave \nthe way for contracting out thousands of Federal jobs. Bipartisan \nagreements were reached that would have provided basic protections for \nfederal employees, yet these protections were dropped. Both the Senate \nand House voted on provisions that would have eased the restrictions on \ntravel to Cuba, but this provision mysteriously disappeared in \nconference. Titles of the bill that were closed out during conference \nmeetings were reopened after deals had been struck; compromises that \nwere reached on a bipartisan basis were overturned later without \nconsultation. This is not how we should be doing business. It is \nundemocratic. It is not how the American people expect us to represent \nthem.\n  The omnibus provides over $820 million in long overdue funds that are \ndesperately needed by Federal agencies, including hard fought increases \nfor veterans medical care and the fight against global aids. But it is \npackaged with tainted goods.\n  Today I will vote to invoke cloture on this bill. These provisions \ncould be fixed if the will was there, but the other side of the aisle \nhas made it clear that they will not negotiate. Delaying this bill any \nlonger will only do more harm to our agencies and the people they \nserve. But I will vote no on final passage. I cannot support the \nomnibus as it is written. It is a flawed document in both policy and \nprocess.\n  I hope that over the next few months we can start to restore the \nspirit of compromise, bipartisanship and consultation that used to be \ncommonplace in the appropriations process. Another year like this will \ndo permanent damage to this institution. We deserve and expect better \nin the United States Senate.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, there are many parts of the Omnibus \nappropriations bill that I support.\n  There is $225 million in the bill to help prevent fires and erosion \nin southern California. It provides over $1.5 billion in funding for \nthe COPS program and other local law enforcement assistance. It funds \nall of our education programs, including $1 billion for afterschool \nprograms, and a $710 million increase in funding to help local schools \neducate disadvantaged students. It provides a $1 billion increase in \nfunding for health research. It includes a $4.3 billion increase for \nveterans health care. And it includes many of my requests for funding \nfor California projects.\n  I wish we had a true appropriations bill that contained these things \nand only these things. I could vote for that. But this bill contains \nmuch more than that.\n  Our efforts to increase funding for health research are undermined \nwhen this bill leaves us more vulnerable to mad cow disease. Our \nefforts to fund job programs are undermined when this bill takes away \novertime pay from millions of hard-working Americans. Our efforts to \nfund law enforcement are undermined when this bill makes it harder for \nlaw enforcement to track down criminals who use guns. Our efforts to \nfund election reform measures are undermined when this bill allows \nmedia conglomerates to control more of the information the public \nreceives.\n  If the Republicans had just let well enough alone, we would have had \na good bill that I could have supported. But, I cannot support this \nbill.\n  Let me discuss each of these issues.\n  First, this bill allows the administration to take away the overtime \nrights of millions of workers. Last spring, the administration proposed \nregulations that strip some workers of their right to overtime \nprotection. Both the Senate and House voted to reject this regulation. \nBut, this bill allows it to go forward.\n  The result is that when President Bush signs this bill, millions of \nworkers including police officers, firefighters, emergency workers, and \nnurses will lose their overtime pay. Overtime pay now accounts for 25 \npercent of the income of workers who work overtime. Without that pay--\nwith this new regulation many working families will be poorer.\n  The new rule will also threaten job creation. Requiring employers to \npay a premium for overtime work encourages employers to hire more \nworkers instead of forcing their existing workers to work longer hours. \nAnd the longer hours that America's working parents would have to work \nwithout overtime protections are hours that the new rule would steal \nfrom families. With the stroke of a pen, parents will have to work \nwithout overtime pay, and they will be forced to be away from their \nfamilies.\n  We have to make the economy work for working families. Stripping \nworkers of overtime protections fails that test. This is a travesty \nagainst every American who believes in fair pay for work.\n  Second, this bill makes us more vulnerable to mad cow disease. The \n2002 farm bill includes a provision requiring that food products be \nlabeled by their country of origin. This not only promotes U.S. \nagriculture, it enables consumers to know if the food they are buying \nis safe and healthy. It allows consumers to determine where food is \nfrom and to make purchases for their families based on this \ninformation. It allows consumers to know which beef in the grocery \nstore was from Canadian cattle and which beef was born, raised, and \nprocessed solely in the United States.\n  The Senate passed an amendment to the Agriculture appropriations bill \nendorsing country-of-origin labeling. But\n\n[[Page S142]]\n\nthis omnibus bill delays its implementation for 2 years.\n  The American people should not have to wait 2 years before they have \nthe right to know that the food they are buying is safe and healthy. \nThey should have that right, right now.\n  Third, the Omnibus appropriations bill would gut the Brady law by \nrequiring the FBI to destroy gun buyer records within 24 hours of the \nsale of a weapon.\n  Right now, when someone buys a gun, an instant background check is \nconducted and then the FBI keeps that record for 90 days. Since many \nguns used in the commission of crimes are purchased soon before the \ncrimes are committed, this 90-day database makes it easier for law \nenforcement to trace guns used in crimes and to find criminals.\n  This bill eliminates that database and makes it harder for our hard-\nworking law enforcement officers to do their jobs and make our streets \nsafer.\n  Finally, the omnibus bill allows a single company to own TV stations \nthat reach 39 percent of the country. This comes after both the House \nand Senate voted to leave the limit where it is now at 35 percent.\n  In addition, this bill would permit more mergers between newspapers \nand TV stations in the same local markets.\n  This means that the door is opened to massive consolidation of the \nmost important news outlets in local media markets. And that means few \nvoices instead of many voices. It means that even fewer people--a \nhandful of gigantic media companies--will be in control of the \ninformation the American public receives.\n  Groups as diverse as the National Rifle Association, the National \nOrganization for Women, the National Council of Churches, Parents \nTelevision Council, Consumers Union, and the Leadership Conference on \nCivil Rights oppose changing the rules. In fact, the Senate and House \nvoted not to change the rules. But the Omnibus appropriations bill \ndefies the will of the Senate and House and provides a belated holiday \ngift to big corporations.\n  We can do better. We must do better. Until we do better, we should \ndefeat this bill.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to discuss briefly the fiscal year \n2004 Omnibus appropriations bill passed today by the Senate.\n  When the Senate was debating this measure, there were two motions to \ninvoke cloture on the conference agreement. I opposed both motions. I \ndid so in the hope that the Senate would revisit and revise several \nissues about which I have deep concerns.\n  One issue is that the conference report allows the Labor Department \nto, in effect, deny overtime pay to approximately 8 million workers \nacross our country. While both the House and the Senate opposed this \npolicy by partisan majorities, that opposition was ignored by \nRepublican conferees. Many workers who now qualify for overtime pay \nwould find their jobs reclassified as a managerial or professional \nposition, thus making them ineligible for overtime pay if they work in \nexcess of 40 hours. This change is significant because overtime pay can \nprovide as much as 25 percent of a worker's annual income. Instead of \nworking towards creating new jobs and helping working families and \nindividuals, the legislation creates yet another obstacle for millions \nof Americans to provide for themselves and their families.\n  Second, the conference agreement delays the implementation of a \nmandate that requires country-of-origin labeling of meat. In an age \nwhere justified concerns are growing over the safety of our food \nsupply--particularly beef products--I feel that it is important for our \nagricultural policies to include necessary information and safeguards \nfor consumers. The issue of country of origin labeling on certain food \nitems such as meats and produce is an effective way to address this \nissue providing consumers with a measure of control and choice in their \nfood purchases.\n  Third, the conference agreement excludes Senate-passed and House-\npassed measures to reimpose a 35 percent national television ownership \ncap that the FCC rescinded in June 2003. Instead the conference \nagreement establishes a 39-percent cap. The FCC ruling and the \nconference language, in my view, could clear the way for further \nconsolidation in the broadcast media industry that could potentially \nallow a small number of owners to control a large proportion of our \ncountry's news, information, and entertainment sources, thus \nthreatening to hurt both consumers and our democracy.\n  Fourth, the conference agreement provides for the distribution of \nschool vouchers to students in the District of Columbia public school \nsystem. Federally funded vouchers are bad policy for the District and \nfor our Nation. Vouchers do not have a proven or substantial record of \nsuccess. Students who receive vouchers have no guarantee that they will \nbe accepted into the private school of their choice while parents have \nno means with which to know whether or not the private school is \nraising their child's achievement level. All we know for sure about \nvouchers is that they deprive public schools of vitally needed \nresources.\n  Finally, the conference agreement critically underfunds educational \nactivities in the No Child Left Behind Act by $8 billion and in title I \nby $6 billion. By denying localities adequate federal funds with which \nto raise school standards, student achievement and infrastructure \nstandards, we are denying millions of children and their families \nacross the country the educational resources they need to succeed.\n  Regrettably, these provisions were neither revisited nor revised, and \ncloture was subsequently invoked.\n  When the conference agreement was before the Senate for final \nconsideration, I voted in favor of the bill. Despite the shortcomings \nmentioned above, I felt the legislation contained several important \nprovisions that benefit both the country at large and the people of \nConnecticut. For instance, it contains $1.5 billion for States to make \ntechnological upgrades to their election systems. It also contains $1.2 \nbillion in added resources for special education. In addition, it funds \nvital priorities in health care, law enforcement, and transportation.\n  On balance, I believe this conference agreement, while needlessly \nflawed, is worthy of support. I intend to continue to work to rectify \nits shortcomings.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is difficult to oppose this bill because \nit funds many programs that I support and contains a number of \nprovisions that I worked to have included. However, once again we are \nbeing asked to vote on legislation that does not reflect the will of \nthe House and Senate. This bill cuts funding for important programs, \nwhile at the same time includes provisions not approved in either the \nHouse or Senate, while failing to include provisions passed by both \nchambers.\n  Manufacturing has been hit hard in this country. Of the 3 million \nprivate sector jobs lost during this Administration, the vast majority, \nabout 2.6 million, are in manufacturing. This bill drastically cuts one \nof the few programs we have to spur manufacturing. This is intolerable. \nThe Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and \nManufacturing Extension Partnership, MEP, program, which cofunds a \nnationwide system of manufacturing support centers to assist small and \nmidsized manufacturers to modernize to compete in a demanding \nmarketplace, is cut by 60 percent in this legislation.\n  Although the program was funded at $105.9 million last year, the \nPresident requested an 88 percent cut in the program to only $12.6 \nmillion in his fiscal year 2004 budget. The House approved $39.6 \nmillion and the Senate $106 million in their appropriations bills. This \nconference report adopts the House level of $39.6 million, a 60 percent \ncut to the program. The President and the Republican-controlled House \nof Representatives didn't even compromise with the Senate, despite the \nsupport of 58 Senators pressing for a funding level of $110 million. \nThey are not willing to assist small and medium sized manufacturing \ncompanies who are facing strong import competition and job losses.\n  Further, this bill will deprive over 8 million workers of overtime \npay. The administration proposed a regulation to end overtime pay for \nmillions of working men and women. Although the House and Senate both \nvoted to oppose this regulation, their will was ignored because of \nWhite House pressure and the language was dropped in conference. This \nomission will negatively impact such public servants as police\n\n[[Page S143]]\n\nofficers and firefighters, including our military personnel who return \nhome to become police officers or firefighters.\n  Both the Senate and House versions of the fiscal year 2004 Commerce-\nJustice-State spending bill included language prohibiting the FCC from \nimplementing its decision to allow a single company to own more TV \nstations in the same market. The current cap is 35 percent. Despite the \nexpressed will of both houses, the bill before us allows more media \nconcentration and raises the cap to 39 perecent. Allowing this kind of \nmedia consolidation could be harmful to consumers.\n  Further, language in the bill mandates that the Justice Department \ndestroy background check records for the purchase of guns within 24 \nhours of the gun purchase. Under current regulations, the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms can retain the records from gun \npurchases for up to 90 days. This 90-day period gives law enforcement \nthe opportunity to review and audit gun purchase records for illegal \nactivity and problems with the background check system. The provision \nrequiring the destruction of records within 24 hours was inserted into \nthe bill without a debate or discussion of its potential impact. It is \nincomprehensible that we are in a heightened state of alert to guard \nagainst terrorism yet we are not providing law enforcement with more \nthan 24 hours to examine information on weapons' purchases.\n  Language in this bill will also postpone the country-of-origin \nlabeling, COOL, rule that was previously enacted. The House bill would \nhave delayed that provision for one year. This conference report \ncontains a 2-year delay. Not only did the Senate strongly reject this \nprovision previously, but, more importantly, this delay undermines \nefforts to ensure the safety of our nation's food supply. The recent \nmad cow incident in Washington underscored the importance of being able \nto trace the origin of agricultural products. If the infected cow had \nnot been voluntarily marked as being of Canadian origin, we would not \nhave been able to determine the origin of the disease in such an \nexpeditious fashion. Making COOL mandatory will ensure that such \nincidents can be traced more quickly.\n  The omnibus bill also denies many struggling Americans much-needed \nsupport services. For example, Section 105 of the Labor-HHS portion of \nthe bill will allow the government to rescind unspent, though already \nobligated, welfare-to-work funds. By instructing the Secretary of Labor \nto recapture ``unexpended'' funds rather than ``unobligated'' funds, \nMichigan and several other states could lose a significant amount of \nthis important funding. Michigan is threatened with losing $16 million \nthat it has obligated in welfare-to-work funds for FY04. If Michigan \nloses these funds, Detroit alone will be unable to provide 6,000 \nwelfare recipients with job search services, education and training \nprograms, and other employment-related services.\n  We need to protect our citizens from terrorism and crime, yet this \nbill fails to adequately fund the COPS program, an invaluable tool in \nmaking our streets and schools safer. To date, the COPS program has \nhelped add thousands of police officers and school resource officers in \nMichigan. Unfortunately, this legislation cuts the COPS hiring program \nby $80 million--a 40 percent cut from 2003 levels and a more than 60 \npercent cut from 2002 levels.\n  At a time when we are asking so much of our military, this \nlegislation provides inadequate funding for our nation's veterans. This \nlegislation cuts nearly $2 billion from the budget passed by the Senate \nin the spring allocated $63.77 billion for services at the Veterans \nAdministration including health care, burial services and other \ncommitments. This shortfall shortchanges our nation's veterans after we \nhave made great demands on them and strong commitments to them.\n  This bill also fails our children by mandating a .59 percent across-\nthe-board cut which would reduce funding for No Child Left Behind \nprograms by over $73 million, resulting in 24,000 fewer kids being \nserved by title I. Overall, the Title I Education for the Disadvantaged \nProgram would be $6 billion below the level authorized by the No Child \nLeft Behind Act that the President signed in January of 2002. This cut \nin funding would also reduce Head Start funding by $40 million, \nresulting in 5,500 fewer kids attending Head Start.\n  I am also concerned about the private-school voucher program that \nthis omnibus bill would create in the District of Columbia. This is a \nproposal that was stripped from the Senate's D.C. Appropriations bill, \nbut squeaked through the House by just a couple of votes. I do not \nbelieve we should take our scarce taxpayer dollars away from public \nschools, where over 90 percent of our nation's children are educated, \nand divert them to private schools. Furthermore, in the No Child Left \nBehind Act, Public Law 107-110, Congress included strong accountability \nstandards to demand better results from administrators, teachers, and \nstudents for all public schools. I believe we should concentrate on \nimproving the educational level of all students at all DC public \nschools, rather than take some students out.\n  This bill severely underfunds Great Lakes and other environmental \nprograms, highway construction projects, law enforcement programs and \nfunding to our veterans. I cannot support this legislation as it has \nbeen brought to the floor on a ``take it or leave it'' basis, violating \nprocedures which assure the Senate's input. I hope that we can work out \nsome corrective legislation which will have the broad bipartisan \nsupport many of these important programs deserve.\n Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nconference report to accompany the fiscal year 2004 Omnibus \nAppropriations bill, H.R. 2673. I would first like to thank the \nappropriators on both sides of the aisle, especially Chairman Ted \nStevens and Ranking Member Robert Byrd, for their diligent efforts in \ncrafting this daunting funding package, and particularly for their \nagreement on several provisions significant to the people of Georgia \nthat will meet urgent needs in transportation, education, agriculture, \nand homeland security.\n  This body has an obligation to the American people to ensure the \ncontinuing operations of our government by annually appropriating \nneeded funding. We also have the obligation to spend consistently \nwithin the budget restraints created by the budget resolution--the \ngeneral agreement between Congress and the executive branch in terms of \nspending limits which this body adopted last April for fiscal year \n2004. We have met this obligation since this bill adheres to that \nagreement.\n  The spending package before us funds a majority of the agencies and \nprograms of the U.S. Government. Passing this omnibus appropriations \nbill toady will allow us to increase our efforts in fighting terrorism; \nit will strengthen our state and local first responders with increased \nfunding; it will provide additional medical care and other benefits to \nmillions of veterans and address the needs of our Nation's schools and \nuniversities.\n  For example, the omnibus bill includes $260 million for the Centers \nfor Disease Control located in Atlanta for desperately needed building \nimprovements. The CDC is home to some of the brightest and best \nscientists in the world and this money will contribute to the \nrenovation of many dilapidated buildings in desperate need of repairs \nand modernization. this bill is also a very important to the State of \nGeorgia. There are vital programs across the State that will receive \nnecessary funding once this bill is passed and signed into law by the \nPresident.\n  I support the passage of this conference report to the fiscal year \n2004 Omnibus Bill. Although an unforeseen medical emergency will not \nallow me to actually cast my vote today for cloture or passage of this \nconference report, I encourage my colleagues to support the passage of \nthese measures.\n\n\n                 Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in 1999, I helped enact the Emergency Steel \nLoan Guarantee Program to give American steel companies in difficult \nfinancial circumstances ready access to capital to enable them to \nrestructure their operations, improve their productivity, and ensure a \nfuture for their hard-working employees.\n  For more than 4 years, this program has successfully granted Federal \nloan guarantees to companies like Hannah Steel in Fairfield, AL, and \nWheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corporation in my home State of West \nVirginia. Without the benefit of these Federal loan guarantees, it is \nalmost certain that these\n\n[[Page S144]]\n\ncompanies would have gone out of business. Today, however, they are \nvibrant companies continuing to support thousands of workers, their \nfamilies, and entire communities.\n  The fiscal year 2004 omnibus appropriations bill, has included a 2-\nyear extension of the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program, which \notherwise would have expired on December 31, 2003. The extension was \nincluded, without objection, in the omnibus appropriations bill that \npassed the U.S. House of Representatives; it was strongly supported by \nthe full Senate Appropriations Committee; and it is now awaiting final \naction in the fiscal year 2004 omnibus bill now pending before the \nSenate. A separate provision was included under Division B of the \nfiscal year 2004 omnibus directing the Department of Commerce to \nrescind $100 million in prior year unobligated balances. It is my \nunderstanding that the provision was included in order for the CJS \nSubcommittee to meet their allocation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The full committee ranking member's understanding of \nthe circumstances and provision is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I understand and respect the very tough \ndecisions the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee had to \nmake in order to meet their allocation, but now, I understand that the \nU.S. Commerce Department intends to use that provision to rescind $17.7 \nmillion for the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program even though they \ndo not have the legal authority to do so.\n  Receiving reports that, only a few weeks ago, the U.S. Commerce \nDepartment was pursuing this particular rescission, I wrote to the \nComptroller General of the United States, who heads the General \nAccounting Office and issues decisions in the area of Federal \nappropriations law. I wrote to the Comptroller General, David Walker, \non December 22, 2003. I inquired as to whether the Commerce Department \nwould have the legal authority to rescind funds from the Emergency \nSteel Loan Guarantee Program under the terms of H.R. 2673, the fiscal \nyear 2004 omnibus appropriations bill. On January 15, 2004, I received \na definitive response from the General Counsel of the GAO, which states \nthat the U.S. Commerce Department is without legal authority to rescind \nthe balance of unobligated funds from the Emergency Steel Loan \nGuarantee Program. The GAO stated that the unobligated funds for the \nsteel loan program, by law, are available only to the Board of the \nEmergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program, and those funds are not \navailable to the Commerce Department.\n  The exact words of the legal opinion that I have received from the \nGAO are as follows:\n\n       The Secretary of Commerce may not legally rescind $17.711 \n     million as planned from the unobligated balance of \n     appropriated funds in the Emergency Steel Guarantee Loan \n     Program to satisfy the rescission mandate in the fiscal year \n     2004 omnibus appropriations bill.\n\n  The GAO legal opinion further states:\n\n       Accordingly, we conclude that the unobligated balance of \n     the $140 million appropriation from the 1999 Steel Act is not \n     ``available to the Department of Commerce'' and thus would \n     not be subject to the section 215 rescission. Thus, the \n     Secretary of Commerce may not legally rescind $17.711 million \n     as planned from the unobligated balance of appropriated funds \n     in the Emergency Steel Guarantee Loan Program.\n\n  So, I would ask my friend and colleague, Senator Hollings, the \nranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on \nCommerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary, if he agrees that the \nCommerce Department has no legal authority to rescind the unobligated \nbalance of funds from the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program in \nlight of the legal opinion I have just obtained on this matter?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. My response to my friend and the ranking member of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee is I absolutely agree the Commerce \nDepartment does not have the authority to rescind funds from the \nEmergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program.\n  Mr. President, it is clear. The Commerce Department has no legal \nauthority to rescind these funds and should keep its hands off of the \nmoney in the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program.\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my \nletter to the Comptroller General, David Walker, dated December 22, \n2003, and the GAO legal opinion dated January 15, 2004, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Appropriations,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 22, 2003.\n     Hon. David M. Walker,\n     Comptroller General, U.S. General Accounting Office, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Walker: With this letter, I am seeking the view of \n     the U.S. General Accounting Office on an issue related to the \n     implementation of H.R. 2673, a bill making omnibus \n     appropriations for FY 2004. Section 215 of Division B--\n     Departments of Commerce, Justice and State of the bill, would \n     direct the Department of Commerce to rescind $100,000,000 of \n     unobligated balances available to the Department of Commerce. \n     In anticipation of enactment of H.R. 2673, the Department is \n     preparing to rescind $17,711,000 from unobligated balances \n     from the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program authorized by \n     Public Law 106-51.\n       Public Law 106-51 (Section 101) established the Emergency \n     Steel Loan Guarantee Board for purposes of administering a \n     loan guarantee program. The Board is made up of three \n     members, the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the \n     Federal Reserve System, who serves as Chairman of the \n     Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Board, the Secretary of \n     Commerce and the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission. Section 101(f)(5) of the Act appropriated \n     $140,000,000 for the costs of the loans guaranteed by the \n     Board. In addition, the Act (Section 101(j)) appropriated \n     $5,000,000 to the Department of Commerce to administer the \n     program. However, at issue is the Department's plan to \n     rescind some of the $52,000,000 of unobligated balances of \n     budget authority made available to the Board under Section \n     101(f)(5) for guaranteeing the loans.\n       Section 215 of Division B of H.R. 2679 only would permit \n     the Department of Commerce to rescind obligated balances \n     available to the Department of Commerce. Section 101(f)(5) of \n     P.L. 106-51 clearly appropriates funds to the Board, not to \n     the Department of Commerce. The Secretary of Commerce is a \n     minority member of the Board. The Chairman of the Board is \n     the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \n     System. Pursuant to P.L. 106-51, loan guarantee agreements \n     with affected steel companies are signed by the Executive \n     Director of the Board, not by the Secretary of Commerce.\n       I seek the legal opinion of the U.S. General Accounting \n     Office on whether the Department of Commerce would have the \n     authority under section 215 of Division B of H.R. 2673 to \n     rescind unobligated balances that are available to the \n     Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Board under section 101(f)(5) \n     of P.L. 106-51 for the purpose of guaranteeing loans.\n       With warmest wishes, I am\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Robert C. Byrd.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               U.S. General Accounting Office,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 15, 2004.\n     Subject: Proposed Rescission by Department of Commerce of \n         Unobligated Emergency Steel Guarantee Loan Program \n         Appropriation\n\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. \n         Senate.\n       Dear Senator Byrd: This responds to your request of \n     December 22, 2003, for our opinion on the Department of \n     Commerce's (Department) plan to rescind $17.711 million of \n     the unobligated balance of amounts appropriated for the \n     Emergency Steel Guarantee Loan Program (Program). The \n     Department has indicated that it would draw on the \n     unobligated balance of the Program's appropriation to help \n     satisfy a $100 million rescission that would be required by \n     H.R. 2673, the bill making omnibus appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2004, if enacted. You asked whether the unobligated \n     balance of the Program's appropriation is available to the \n     Department for that purpose. For the reasons provided below, \n     we conclude that the Program's appropriation is not available \n     to the Department for purposes of the $100 million \n     rescission.\n\n                               Background\n\n       In the findings section of the Emergency Steel Loan \n     Guarantee Act of 1999 (Steel Act), Congress noted the loss of \n     jobs and company bankruptcies in the steel industry as a \n     consequence of increases in steel imports. Emergency Steel \n     Loan Guarantee Act of 1999, Pub. L. No. 106-51, 101(b), 113 \n     Stat. 252 (1999). Congress found that ``a strong steel \n     industry is necessary to the adequate defense preparedness of \n     the United States'' and that industry problems were causing a \n     decline in the willingness of private institutions to loan \n     money to U.S. steel companies. Id. Congress passed the Steel \n     Act, which established the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee \n     Program, in order ``to provide loan guarantee to qualified \n     steel companies.'' Id. Sec. 101(d).\n       To administer the program, the Steel Act created a three-\n     member Loan Guarantee Board comprised of the Secretary of \n     Commerce, the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission, and the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the \n     Federal Reserve System. Pub. L. No. 106-51, Sec. 101(d), (e).\n\n[[Page S145]]\n\n     To fund the costs of the loan guarantees, the Steel Act \n     appropriated $140 million. Id Sec. 101(f)(5) (``For the \n     additional cost of the loans guaranteed under this \n     subsection, included the costs of modifying the loans . . ., \n     there is appropriated $140,000,000 to remain available until \n     expended.'') Also, the Steel Act provided the Department of \n     Commerce with an administrative support role and appropriated \n     $5 million to the Department for that purpose. Id. \n     Sec. 101(j) (``For necessary expenses to administer the \n     Program, $5,000,000 is appropriated to the Department of \n     Commerce, to remain available until expended. . . .'')\n       The Commerce Department's fiscal year 2004 appropriation, \n     currently before the Senate, would include a rescission of \n     $100 million. Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, \n     the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2004, \n     H.R. 2673, 108th Cong., Div. B, Sec. 215 (2003) (hereinafter \n     Omnibus Bill) (``Of the unobligated balances available to the \n     Department of Commerce from prior year appropriations with \n     the exception of funds provided for coral reef activities, \n     fisheries enforcement, the Ocean Health Initiative, land \n     acquisition, and lab construction, $100,000,000 are \n     rescinded.''). Subject to the limitation that the rescission \n     come from ``unobligated balances available to the Department \n     of Commerce from prior year appropriations,'' the law would \n     give the Secretary discretion to identify the sources of the \n     rescission. Id. (``Provided, That within 30 days after the \n     date of enactment of this section the Secretary of Commerce \n     shall submit to the Committees on Appropriations of the House \n     of Representatives and the Senate a report specifying the \n     amount of each rescission made pursuant to this \n     section.'').\n\n                               Discussion\n\n       At issue here is whether unobligated Program funds are \n     ``unobligated balances available to the Department of \n     Commerce'' for rescission. The language of the $140 million \n     appropriation itself does not identify to whom the \n     appropriation was made, only the purpose of the \n     appropriation. The Steel Act states, ``there is appropriated \n     $140 million'' for the costs of the loan guarantees that the \n     Board approves. The issue for us is one of statutory \n     construction: Is the Program's $140 million appropriation \n     available to the Board or to the Department? In interpreting \n     statutes, the Federal courts have developed a number of well-\n     recognized conventions, which are also known as canons of \n     statutory construction. One important canon is that words \n     should be considered in the context of the entire statute. \n     See United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co., 532 U.S. \n     200, 217 (2001); United States Ass'n of Texas v. Timbers of \n     Inwood Forest Assocs., 484 U.S. 365, 371 (1988). We apply \n     that canon of statutory construction in this case.\n       The provisions in a statute should not be viewed in \n     isolation but in the context of the entire statute. In 2001 \n     in United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co., the \n     Supreme Court stated that ``it is, of course, true that \n     statutory construction `is a holistic endeavor' and that the \n     meaning of a provision is `clarified by the remainder of the \n     statutory scheme.' '' 532 U.S. 200, 217. See also 2A \n     Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction Sec. 46:05, \n     at 154 (6th ed. 2000) (``A statute is passed as a whole and \n     not in parts or sections and is animated by one general \n     purpose and intent. Consequently, each part or section should \n     be construed in connection with every other part or section \n     so as to produce a harmonious whole.''). In our case law, we \n     apply this canon of construction with equal vigor. See, e.g., \n     Matter of Jacobs COGEMA, LLC, B-290125.2, B-290125.3, at 8, \n     Dec. 18, 2002 (``In ascertaining the plain meaning of the \n     statute, we necessarily look to the particular statutory \n     language at issue, as well as the language and design of the \n     statute as a whole.''). See also B-286661, Jan. 19, 2001.\n       When the 1999 Steel Act created the Program, it specified \n     that the Program was ``to be administered by the Board.'' \n     Pub. L. No. 106-51, Sec. 101(d). The Steel Act gave the Board \n     decision-making powers to ``approve or deny each application \n     for a guarantee.'' Id. Sec. 101(e). At the same time, the \n     Steel Act provided an appropriation to finance the costs of \n     these guarantees; it said that ``there is appropriated \n     $140,000,000 to remain available until expended.'' Id. \n     Sec. 101(f)(5).\n       Congress finances federal programs and activities by \n     providing ``budget authority.'' Budget authority is a general \n     term referring to various forms of authority provided by law \n     to enter into financial obligations that will result in \n     immediate or future outlays of government funds. See \n     Sec. 3(2) of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control \n     Act of 1974, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 622(2) and note, as amended by the \n     Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-\n     508, Sec. Sec. 13201(b) and 13211(a), 104 Stat. 1388, 1388-\n     614, and 1388-620 (Nov. 5, 1990). An appropriation, such as \n     the $140 million one enacted for the Program, is one form of \n     budget authority. Within the context of the 1999 Steel Act, \n     only the Board has authority to incur an obligation against \n     the $140 million appropriation by committing the federal \n     government to a loan guarantee. It is the Board who can \n     approve applications for loan guarantees, and it is the \n     Board's approval of an application that financially obligates \n     the United States. For this reason, we view the $140 million \n     appropriation as available to the Board, not to the \n     Department. While the Secretary of Commerce, as a Board \n     member, has a vote in whether to approve an application for a \n     loan guarantee whose costs are charged to the $140 million \n     appropriation, the Secretary, by himself, cannot approve an \n     application and cannot incur an obligation against the \n     appropriation.\n       The Department asserts that the $140 million is a Commerce \n     Department appropriation because the Steel Act appropriated \n     $5 million to the Department to cover the costs of \n     administrative support to the Program. Specifically, the \n     Steel Act appropriated $5 million to the Department ``for \n     necessary expenses to administer the Program.'' Id. \n     Sec. 101(j). The Department notes that historically Commerce, \n     Treasury, and OMB have always treated the $140 million as a \n     Commerce appropriation. The Department performs all of the \n     Board's bookkeeping and provides other administrative \n     support. The Department carries the Board's staff on the \n     Department's payroll. Treasury, the Department says, has \n     assigned the Program's appropriation a Commerce Department \n     account symbol, and OMB reports the Program's activity as \n     part of the Department's budget.\n       We agree that the Department has an administrative role \n     with regard to the Program's appropriation; however, the \n     Department's argument is not persuasive when considered in \n     the context of the Steel Act. The Department fails to \n     recognize that while the Steel Act appropriated funds to the \n     Department ``for necessary expenses to administer the \n     Program,'' the word ``administer,'' when viewed in the \n     context of the entire Steel Act, has a particular and very \n     different meaning than its use earlier in the Steel Act when \n     the Steel Act specifies that the Program ``is to be \n     administered by the Board.'' In this regard, the Steel Act \n     captioned the Sec. 5 million appropriation, ``Salaries and \n     Administrative Expenses.'' When contrasted with the very \n     clear decision-making authority provided the Board to \n     approve loan guarantee applications, it seems equally \n     clear that the Steel Act intended the Department to \n     perform ministerial administrative tasks, such as \n     recording obligations as a bookkeeper, and provided a \n     specific appropriation to cover these expenses, whereas it \n     intended the Board to perform decision-making \n     ``administrative'' tasks, such as incurring obligations. \n     The Department's Treasury's and OMB's historical treatment \n     of the Program's appropriation that the Department finds \n     relevant is consistent with the Department's \n     administrative support role.\n       Furthermore, the words Congress selected in sections 101(f) \n     and 101(j), especially when viewed in the context of the \n     Steel Act, support the conclusion that Congress made the $140 \n     million appropriation available to the Board and not to the \n     Department of Commerce. In appropriating money for \n     administrative support, Congress expressly appropriated the \n     money to the Department: ``$5,000,00 is appropriated to the \n     Department of Commerce, to remain available until expended.'' \n     Id. at 101(j) (emphasis added). Had the Congress intended the \n     Program's $140 million appropriation, enacted in the same \n     Steel Act, to be available to the Department as well, we \n     would have expected the Congress to use the same phrasing as \n     it did in enacting the $5 million appropriation. The fact \n     that the Congress chose not to use that phrasing for the $140 \n     million appropriation, especially when the Congress clearly \n     said that the Program funded by that appropriation was to be \n     administered by the Board, believes the Department's \n     assertion.\n       The Department makes three other arguments. First, the \n     Department points out that in Division B, Title II of the \n     omnibus bill, section 211 would provide extra funding for \n     administrative support. Omnibus Bill, Div. B, Sec. 211, \n     Section 211 would authorize the Secretary of Commerce to use \n     $2 million of the unobligated balance of the $140 million \n     appropriation to supplement the $5 million previously \n     appropriated for administrative support. The Department \n     argues that Congress would not have made that money available \n     to the Department had Congress not viewed the $140 million as \n     a Commerce Department appropriation. The Department offered \n     no support for its argument, and we found no support for its \n     argument in our review. As we explain in this letter, all \n     indications are that the $140 million is not available to the \n     Department. In fact, regardless, of whether the appropriation \n     is available to the Department, Congress still would need to \n     act to make any amounts available for administrative support. \n     The $140 million appropriation, as enacted, is available only \n     for the costs of the loan guarantees and not for \n     administrative support. There is another appropriation, the \n     $5 million appropriation, that was enacted specifically for \n     administrative support.\n       Second, the Department notes that last year, Congress \n     enacted a rescission in the fiscal year 2003 omnibus \n     appropriations act of the unobligated balance of the \n     appropriation for the Emergency Oil and Gas Guaranteed Loan \n     Program. This program was created at the same time, in the \n     same public law, for similar purposes, and in a similar \n     manner as the Steel Program. When the Oil and Gas Guaranteed \n     Loan Program expired last year, Congress rescinded the \n     remaining $920,000 unobligated balance in that program. \n     Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the \n     Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2003, \n     Pub. L. No. 108-7, Div. B, 117 Stat. 11, 106 (2003) (``Of \n     the unobligated balances available [in the Emergency Oil \n     and Gas Guaranteed Loan Program account] from prior year \n     appropriations, $920,000 are rescinded.''). The Department \n     interpreted the 2003 rescission language as a direction to \n     Commerce to rescind the money. The Department argues that \n     the section 215\n\n[[Page S146]]\n\n     rescission in the Omnibus Bill is like the oil and gas \n     rescission. In our view, the fact that in both instances \n     it is the Department's responsibility to take appropriate \n     action to accomplish the rescissions does not mean that \n     the appropriations are available to the Department. \n     Rather, the Department's responsibility is based on its \n     statutory role to provide administrative support, such as \n     bookkeeping. also, we note that Congress explicitly \n     rescinded the oil and gas unobligated balance. That is not \n     the case before us here.\n       Lastly, the Department finds support in the fact that \n     section 215 in the Omnibus Bill specifically exempts from the \n     $100 million rescission ``funds provided for coral reef \n     activities, fisheries enforcement, the Ocean Health \n     Initiative, land acquisition, and lab construction,'' but \n     does not exempt the Program's appropriation. Omnibus Bill, \n     Div. B, Sec. 215. Commerce asserts that this implies that the \n     Program's noninclusion in this list means that the Program's \n     funds are not exempt from, and thus subject to, the \n     rescission. We are not persuaded. The $140 million is not \n     listed in the bill because it is not a Commerce \n     appropriation, as are funds provided for coral reef \n     activities, fisheries enforcement, the Ocean Health \n     Initiative, land acquisition, and lab construction.\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       Accordingly, we conclude that the unobligated balance of \n     the $140 million appropriation from the 1999 Steel Act is not \n     ``available to the Department of Commerce'' and thus would \n     not be subject to the section 215 rescission. Thus, the \n     Secretary of Commerce may not legally rescind $17.711 million \n     as planned from the unobligated balance of appropriated funds \n     in the Emergency Steel Guarantee Loan Program to satisfy the \n     rescission mandate in the fiscal year 2004 omnibus \n     appropriations bill.\n       If you have any questions, please contact Susan A. Poling, \n     Associate General Counsel, at 202-512-5644.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                Anthony H. Gamboa,\n                                                  General Counsel.\n\n\n                          Organic Agriculture\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the conference \nagreement with regard to the fiscal year 2004 Agriculture \nAppropriations bill includes funding for important programs addressing \norganic agriculture. However, many of the important details regarding \nCongress' intent for the administration of USDA organic programs were \nenumerated in the House and Senate reports, without reiteration by the \nstatement of managers.\n  As stated in the preface of the statement of managers:\n\n       [T]he House and Senate report language that is not changed \n     by the conference is approved by the committee of conference. \n     The statement of the managers, while repeating some report \n     language for emphasis, does not intend to negate the language \n     referred to above unless expressly provided herein.\n\n  Therefore, in keeping with this general rule, it seems appropriate to \nengage in a colloquy to assure that there is no confusion regarding \ncongressional intent on the important USDA programs affecting organic \nagriculture.\n  First, as stated in the Senate report, $1.5 million is provided for \nthe National Organic Program, within the Agricultural Marketing Service \naccount.\n  I would like to reiterate that it is my intent, as ranking member of \nthe Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, that some of the increased \nfunding provided for this important organic program at USDA be used to \nmore fully comply with some of the requirements of the Organic Foods \nProduction Act of 1990, the authorizing statute for this program. \nConsistent with the Senate report on this matter, part of this funding \nshould be used to hire an Executive Director for the National Organic \nStandards Board, NOSB, to create an ongoing peer review panel to \noversee the USDA accreditation process for organic certifiers, and to \nimprove scientific technical support for the NOSB.\n  I would ask my colleague from Vermont, the ranking member of the \nAgriculture Subcommittee on Research, Nutrition, and General \nLegislation if he concurs with my comments on this matter?\n  Mr. LEAHY. As one who has worked a great deal in this area, I say to \nmy friend from Wisconsin that I do agree with his comments and concerns \non this matter, and believe his remarks are in keeping with the Senate \nreport language on this matter, as well as the final conference \nagreement.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  In addition, as specified in the Economic Research Service section of \nthe House report, $500,000 is provided for the analysis and compilation \nof data related to organic production, marketing and trade. The Senate \nreport further elaborates on this matter within the Agricultural \nMarketing Service section, and ``encourages AMS to work with ERS, NASS \nand RMA on the collection of segregated data on the production and \nmarketing of organic agricultural production and marketing, as directed \nin the 2002 Farm Bill. Specifically, data should be collected on \nprices, yields, acreage and production costs in the organic sector.''\n  It is critically important that all USDA collection data agencies \ncoordinate in the effective use of these funds to meet the requirements \nof the Organic Production and Market Data Initiative--Section 7407--of \nthe Food Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002. However, I would \nlike to add that it is my intention that the Senate report language be \nused to provide guidance to USDA in the use of the $500,000 provided \nunder the Economic Research Service account in the House report, and \nthat ERS be the lead agency in coordinating this effort.\n  Again, I would ask my friend from Vermont, if he would concur with my \ncomments regarding the organic data collection provisions of the AMS \nand ERS accounts of the Agriculture portion of this omnibus \nappropriations bill?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I do concur with the Senator from Wisconsin on his \ncomments and concerns about the organic data collection and analysis \nprovisions in the Agriculture portion of this omnibus appropriations \nbill.\n\n\n                        small engines provision\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, some of my constituents are asking \nquestions about the meaning of the small engines provision included in \nthe fiscal year 2004 omnibus appropriations conference report. They \nraise the question about whether subsection (c) applies only to ``new'' \nand ``nonroad'' spark-ignition engines smaller than 50 horsepower. That \nwas my understanding. I ask my colleague from Missouri, Senator Bond, \none of the authors of this provision, whether that was his intent?\n  Mr. BOND. I say to my colleague from California, Senator Feinstein, \nthat I intended this provision to apply only to the adoption or \nenforcement of standards or other requirements relating to ``new'' \nengines, not existing engines or ``in-use'' engines. Also, I have heard \nfrom other colleagues and stakeholders regarding their desire to \naddress in-use engines. I did not intend that this new language to \napply to voluntary State programs aimed at reducing emissions from \nexisting engines such as the Texas Emission Reduction Plan.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank my colleague, and ask whether he intended the \nlanguage to apply only to ``nonroad'' engines?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes, I believe the entire provision, including subsection \n(c), should apply to adoption or enforcement of standards or other \nrequirements relating only to nonroad engines.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank my colleague. I ask him also about his intent \nof the provision to apply only to nondiesel engines.\n  Mr. BOND. Yes, I believe the entire provision, including subsection \n(c), should apply to adoption or enforcement of standards or other \nrequirements relating only to nondiesel engines. I used the term spark-\nignition to have that meaning.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank my colleague again. I ask him also about his \nintent of the provision to apply only to engines smaller than 50 \nhorsepower.\n  Mr. BOND. Yes, I believe the entire provision should apply only to \nengines smaller than 50 horsepower and not engines larger than 50 \nhorsepower. So, in summary, the intent of this provision is to apply to \nadoption or enforcement of standards or other requirements relating to \nthe control of emissions from new nonroad spark-ignition engines \nsmaller than 50 horsepower.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank my colleague for clarifying the intent of \nthis provision here today.\n\n\n                          california wildfires\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I briefly engage the distinguished \nmajority leader in a colloquy about an issue of great importance to me \nState. I am pleased that the legislation before us provides $225 \nmillion in badly needed assistance to help the State of California \nrecover from last autumn's devastating wildfires and to prevent a\n\n[[Page S147]]\n\nsimilar tragedy in the future. Of this total made available, $25 \nmillion is provided to compensate California's farmers who suffered \nlosses in the fires.\n  The package of aid that I drafted contained language that would have \ndeemed losses suffered in those fires to be the result of a natural \ndisaster, raised the cap on payments for those losses under the Tree \nAssistance Program to $200,000, and would have provided upfront \npayments under that program instead of reimbursements for replacement \ncosts.\n  It it my understanding that a portion of the language was \ninadvertently left out of the final conference agreement that I had \ndiscussed with the majority leader and his staff. Is that the majority \nleader's understanding?\n  Mr. FRIST. The Senator is correct. As I am sure the Senator from \nCalifornia can appreciate, Senators and their staff were working under \nsevere time constraints to finalize the conference report. In this \ndifficult environment, the language the Senator refers to was not \nincluded in the final legislation. It is my understanding that under \nthe extreme time constraints imposed on staff to file the legislation \nand the lateness of the hour when this issue was brought to the \nconference, staff were unable to include the language.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the majority leader for that clarification. \nThose elements of the relief package are crucial to the recovery of \nagricultural producers in my state. Some of the disaster programs \nadministered by the Department of Agriculture do not provide relief for \nlosses due to arson. However, it is clear to me that the wildfires in \nCalifornia were a natural disaster. Those losses would not have been \nincurred, if not the drought conditions in high Santa Ana wind \nconditions. Additionally, as many of the losses were of high value \nspecialty crops, an increased payment cap is needed for adequate \nrecovery effort.\n  I would ask that the majority leader work with me to ensure that the \nadministration address the intent of my omitted language, so that USDA \ncan administer the relief as intended and the effected producers can \nrecover their losses.\n  Mr. FRIST. I commend the Senator for her dedication and diligence on \nthis issue. I will work with her to support the intent of her omitted \nlanguage for the $12.5 million funding provided in the legislation for \nthe tree assistance program. I will discuss this issue with officials \nat USDA and it is my hope that the issues she has raised can be \naddressed by administrative action once the regulations are issued \nimplementing this section of the legislation. However, if this is not \npossible due to statutory law, I commit to work with her to enact \nlegislation that will address this unique problem of disaster \nassistance for producers of high value specialty orchards.\n\n\n           rural economic development grant and loan program\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am very concerned that the Department of \nAgriculture has not been allocating funds built up in the account for \nthe Rural Economic Development Grant and Loan Program called the \n``cushion of credit.'' Rather than providing these funds to local rural \nelectric cooperatives and telephone cooperatives where they can be used \nto create jobs and improve the economy of rural America, a considerable \nsum has been built up. There has never been as large a sum unspent as \nwe have seen over the past year. USDA needs to put this money to work \nas the law intends.\n  Mr. KOHL. The Senator from Iowa is correct. These are not \nappropriated funds, but money that has been paid to the Rural Utility \nService by local REC and telephone cooperatives when they retire debt \nat an early stage. And, there has always been a presumption that the \nmoney would be made available on a timely basis for qualified proposals \nfor economic development. The department should allocate these funds to \nqualified applications as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I agree with the Senator from Iowa and my ranking \nmember. There is a long history of the Rural Economic Development Grant \nand Loan Program being a very effective tool to provide capital for \nmany worthy job creating projects. I concur that the Department should \nrelease the funds sitting in the cushion of credit account to qualified \napplications as quickly as possible.\n\n\n                           polio eradication\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the ranking member \nof the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, my distinguished colleague from \nVermont, Senator Leahy, for his support of the ongoing efforts to \neradicate polio by 2005, and especially thank him for working to \ninclude language recommending $30 million in the Senate report \naccompanying the FY 2004 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill.\n  The international effort to eradicate polio has made tremendous \nprogress. Since the global initiative began in 1988, more than 3 \nmillion children in the developing world, who would otherwise have \nbecome paralyzed with polio, are walking because they have been \nimmunized. The number of polio cases has fallen from an estimated \n350,000 in 1988 to approximately 1,500 cases in 2002. The target date \nfor the last case of polio is 2005. When the world is certified polio \nfree, immunizations can cease and the U.S. will save $350 million \nannually while the world will save at least $1.5 billion.\n  The major partners in the global polio eradication effort have joined \nwith national governments around the world in an unprecedented \ndemonstration of commitment to this historic public health goal. As the \ninitiative runs its course, total victory can only be guaranteed \nthrough continued and unwavering commitment to the goal of a polio-free \nworld.\n  It is my further understanding that the House report recommended not \nless than $25 million for USAID's global polio eradication activities \nin FY 2004.\n  This is similar to last year, and the final disposition was $27.5 \nmillion for polio eradication in FY 2003. My question to my friend from \nVermont is how much does he expect USAID to allocate for these \nactivities in FY 2004?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I want to recognize the Senator from Iowa for his \nleadership on this issue. He has been a champion of polio eradication \nand his efforts have paid off in the continuing U.S. support for the \nglobal polio eradication effort. As my friend has said, for FY 2004, \nlike in prior years, the House and Senate Foreign Operations \nsubcommittees recommended $30 million and not less than $25 million, \nrespectively. It is my expectation that USAID will provide $27.5 \nmillion in FY 2004. This is no time to reduce our support for this \neffort as we approach the finish line.\n  These funds will allow for accelerated polio eradication activities, \nimproved surveillance for polio and other diseases, and support for \ncease-fires in conflict zones for National Immunization Days. The \nUnited States is the largest international donor for the Polio \nEradication Initiative, and the success of this program should be a \nsource of pride for all Americans.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend from Vermont for this clarification and \nfor his and the Appropriations Committee's efforts to reach the goal of \na polio-free world.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in favor of the FY04 Omnibus \nAppropriations Conference Report, despite major concerns I have with \nhow this bill was put together and with a number of items in the bill.\n  Nevertheless, we are faced with an up or down vote. On balance, I \nbelieve that the bill is a net positive and I will support it.\n  The best you can say about this bill is that it is a mixed bag. There \nare items in the bill that are good for California and the Nation, but \nthere are a number of harmful legislative provisions attached to the \nbill and on a number of issues the administration was allowed by the \nmajority to override the will of the Senate.\n  For example, among the harmful provisions that I hope we can reverse \nis language which requires next-day destruction of background check \nrecords of sales where a gun buyer successfully clears a Brady \nbackground check and is permitted to purchase a firearm. I also look \nforward to the Senate taking action to prevent implementation of the \nadministration's proposed rules on overtime compensation.\n  Before I talk further about the bill, I want to talk about the \nserious and wholly avoidable problems associated with the process by \nwhich we reached a final agreement on this package.\n  The ranking member of the Appropriations Committee and others are\n\n[[Page S148]]\n\ncorrect in highlighting those issues. If for no other reason then that \nwe should avoid them in the future.\n  Senator Byrd is correct when he says that adopting this conference \nreport or facing a year long continuing resolution at FY03 levels are \nnot the only paths out of this impasse.\n  If the majority leadership in the Senate and the House had chosen, we \ncould have worked out the serious concerns that Senators of both \nparties have with this legislation. We all knew that there are only a \nhandful of major issues.\n  However, the majority did not show any willingness to address \novertime pay, country of origin labeling for meat products, media \nownership rules, or outsourcing of Federal jobs.\n  Senator Byrd also eloquently laid out in his letter to the majority \nleader the instances in which the administration, at the eleventh hour, \nwas permitted by the majority to prevail over the will of the Congress. \nI would like to quote what he wrote:\n\n       Several very controversial legislative riders were added at \n     the last minute by the Bush White House. Disappointingly, the \n     Republican Congressional Leadership, at the insistence of the \n     White House, capitulated to changes that were not even \n     contemplated when the bills were before the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate.\n       Overriding the will of the Senate, the bipartisan overtime \n     regulation prohibition, which passed the Senate by a vote of \n     54-45, was dropped. The resulting Bush administration plan \n     would eliminate overtime pay protections for as many as 8 \n     million American workers who currently are eligible for \n     overtime pay. These hard-earned overtime dollars often make \n     the difference between workers providing a better life for \n     their families or just making ends meet.\n       Overriding the will of the Senate and at the behest of the \n     cattle and food marketing industries, the Bush administration \n     actively and officially supported language in the omnibus \n     conference that would delay implementation of mandatory \n     country-of-origin labeling of meat and meat products. Despite \n     the potential danger to American consumers of any delay, the \n     country-of-origin labeling for meat and meat products, \n     enacted as part of the 2002 Farm Bill and scheduled to take \n     effect this fiscal year, would be delayed by two years.\n       Overriding the will of the House and the Senate, the one-\n     year limitation on the FCC media ownership rule was turned \n     into a permanent cap at 39 percent. The practical effect of \n     changes demanded by the White House is to protect Rupert \n     Murdoch's Fox television network and CBS-Viacom from having \n     to comply with the lower 35 percent ownership caps that \n     conferees had included in the original conference report. The \n     White House is boosting special corporate interests at the \n     expense of the people's interest for balanced news and \n     information.\n       Overriding the will of the House and Senate conferees, and \n     again at the Bush administration's insistence, 400,000 \n     Federal workers will lose job protections. During \n     negotiations, Congressional Democrats and Republicans agreed \n     to provide basic protections for federal employees whose jobs \n     have been targeted by the Bush White House for privatization. \n     Because of White House intransigence, those basic protections \n     were dropped. What remains provides so many loopholes for the \n     Bush administration to privatize Federal jobs that little \n     protection is provided for workers. The administration's \n     policies encourage unfair treatment of dedicated public \n     servants, many of whom are being forced into early retirement \n     or the prospect of reduced benefits and lower pay.\n\n  At this point, the only choice we have is between this omnibus, which \nfunds the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, State, Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, Veterans Affairs, Education, Housing and \nUrban Development, Transportation, and Treasury.\n  Under a year long continuing resolution, these departments would be \nfunded at last year's levels. And as a result, major programs which \nbenefit millions would be severely underfunded, and many needed \nprojects, including hundreds in California, would receive no funding.\n  Indeed, there are a number of items in the bill of particular \nimportance to me and to California that I would like to highlight: $225 \nmillion for California wildfire relief and prevention; $85 million for \nCOPS grants for interoperable communications; A 5-year Pilot Program \nfor school choice in Washington, DC; Increased NIH Funding; and Funding \nfor Election Reform.\n  If the Omnibus were not to pass, then none of these programs would \nreceive necessary funding.\n  As we all know, California suffered devastating wildfires last fall. \nThese fires consumed a total of 738,158 acres, killed 23 people, and \ndestroyed approximately 3,626 residences and 1,184 other structures.\n  And this is just the tip of the iceberg. In California, 8.5 million \nacres of Federal land are at the highest risk of catastrophic fire, so \nit is critical that we protect our forests and nearby communities and \navert a similar catastrophe in the future.\n  That is why I am so pleased that Congressman Jerry Lewis and I were \nable to secure $225 million in emergency funding.\n  This funding will help prevent mudslides, provide relief for farmers \nwhose crops were burned, and eliminate a million trees killed by the \nbark beetles.\n  This funding is critical to helping prevent future fires.\n  As we saw in November, trees killed by the bark beetle become \nkindling in a serious fire, and put homes and lives at risk.\n  Removing them is a necessary first step toward preventing fires like \nthe ones we experienced from happening again.\n  The bill also includes $85 million in grants to help first responders \nbetter communicate with each other in times of crisis.\n  In all too many jurisdictions, police, fire and emergency medical \nservice personnel can't communicate with each other over the radio when \nan emergency occurs. This means slower response times, less \ncoordination between agencies and lives lost.\n  To help remedy this problem, I sponsored an amendment to the \nemergency spending bill passed last year, which provided $109 million \nto improve the compatibility of first responders' communications \nsystems.\n  Half of this funding would go to police departments and half would go \nto fire and emergency departments.\n  And in the Omnibus Appropriations bill there is $85 million in \nadditional COPS grants for interoperable communications for police.\n  There are about 2.5 million public safety first responders who \noperate in the United States today, stationed in some 18,000 law \nenforcement agencies, 26,000 fire departments and 6,000 rescue \ndepartments.\n  When I speak to representatives of these departments, they tell me \nthat obtaining compatible communications systems is their No. 1 \nhomeland security priority.\n  The need is certainly there. The recent Council on Foreign Relations \nIndependent Task Force on Emergency Responders report on homeland \nsecurity funding--entitled ``Drastically Underfunded, Dangerously \nUnprepared''--determined that the minimum interoperable communications \nneed over the next five fiscal years is $6.8 billion.\n  As America continues to confront the threat of terrorism, it will be \nincreasingly important to give our law enforcement, fire and emergency \npersonnel the tools they need to respond to a possible terrorist attack \neffectively and safely.\n  This will allow fire, police and emergency medical services personnel \nto better communicate in times of crisis and will ultimately help save \nlives.\n  I am also pleased that the Omnibus Appropriations bill contains the \n$40 million DC School Choice plan to provide educational scholarships \nfor 2,000 low-income students in troubled public schools in Washington, \nDC.\n  Washington, DC, has the third highest per pupil spending in the \nNation--$10,852 a year goes to the education of each child. Yet, it has \n15 failing schools and some of the lowest test scores in the country.\n  Before supporting Mayor Anthony Williams request for this 5 year \npilot program, I thoroughly scrutinized the legislative language as it \nrelated to the constitutional safeguards, the criteria, the \nmonitoring--and I believe the program which was ultimately agreed to is \nbalanced, fair, and constitutionally sound.\n  To develop the best program we could and one that would stand a \nconstitutional test, we made certain that the bill contained language \nthat closely follows the Supreme Court decision in Zelman v. Simmons-\nHarris to help fortify it against legal challenges.\n  We helped ensure that the District would have a fair method of \nacceptance for students using vouchers in private and parochial schools \nand that there would be full accountability and sufficient oversight by \nMayor Williams.\n  We made sure that the scholarship students would be given the same \ntest\n\n[[Page S149]]\n\nthat their peers in public schools receive and that their test scores \nwould be evaluated by an unbiased researcher.\n  No money is taken from the public schools. As a matter of fact, $13 \nmillion in new money is provided to public schools and $13 million in \nnew funds is added for public charter schools.\n  As a result of this program, some 2,000 students from failing schools \nwill have that opportunity for one of these scholarships over the next \n5 years to go to the private school of their parents' choice.\n  This is a worthy trial.\n  This bill also includes an $835 million increase in funding for the \nNational Institutes of Health.\n  While this is less than the $1.5 billion increase I sought on the \nSenate floor with Chairman Specter and ranking member Harkin, the \nincrease is essential to furthering the advances made by NIH \nparticularly in the field of cancer research.\n\n  Working together, Congress and two Presidents successfully completed \na doubling of the NIH budget over the past 5 years.\n  Although the fiscal year 2004 budget increase for NIH is smaller than \nI had hoped for, every dollar spent will yield health dividends for \npeople.\n  Because of the mapping of the human genome and the advances in \nmolecular biology, it is now possible to develop and target drugs to \nspecific ailments and therefore to break frontiers, to cross barriers \nand make uncharted progress.\n  The NIH is the gold standard for the discovery of these new, targeted \ncancer drugs such as Gleevec which is used to treat patients with \nchronic myeloid leukemia.\n  It is my hope that we can press on even further with the progress \nmade in the fiscal year 2005 so that NIH can move closer to funding the \noptimal percentage of grant applications it receives.\n  I am pleased that the Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report meets \nthe Federal Government's commitments under the Help America Vote Act, \nHAVA, which reformed the way elections are administered.\n  While the President requested only $500 million for HAVA \nimplementation, the conference report provides $1.5 billion for \npayments to States for the purpose of meeting Federal election \nstandards established in the act.\n  Following enactment of this legislation, it is vital that these funds \nbe quickly disbursed to the States and localities so that they may \nimplement changes to voting systems in time for the 2004 Federal \nelections.\n  As I said before, beyond process, I have a number of serious problems \nwith the substance of the bill, and I will work over the next year to \ntry to fix them.\n  One of the most egregious provisions, buried in the bill at the \nbehest of the gun lobby, is a provision which requires next-day \ndestruction of background check records of sales where a gun buyer \nsuccessfully clears a Brady background check and is permitted to \npurchase a firearm.\n  Currently, records of criminal background checks are retained for up \nto 90 days in order to allow the Department of Justice to effectively \nidentify, prevent, or prosecute attempted or completed illegal \ntransactions.\n  The ability to retain a record of these transactions for up to 90 \ndays allows law enforcement to audit the system to ensure its integrity \nand to correct errors that may have occurred--for instance, when a gun \nbuyer is able to purchase a weapon when he should have been prevented \nfrom getting it.\n  If those records are destroyed in 24 hours, the ability to correct \nsuch mistakes is gone.\n  A July 2002 report by the General Accounting Office found that the \n90-day retention of records allowed the FBI to investigate more than \n200 purchases that were initially approved, but later found to have \nbeen sales to prohibited purchasers.\n  The Department of Justice will also lose the ability to adequately \nverify whether someone on the terrorist watch list has attempted to \npurchase a firearm, because the records will no longer exist.\n  According to the Washington Post, at least 12 and as many as 250 \nindividuals on the terrorist watch list have attempted to buy firearms \nin recent months.\n  The bill would also prohibit ATF--now BATFE--from finalizing a \nproposed rule to require licensed gun dealers to conduct regular \ninventories of their firearms.\n  The purpose of the rule is to promote more timely reporting of \nmissing and stolen firearms, in order to help ensure that firearms are \nnot ending up in the wrong hands, as in the case of the rifle used in \nthe DC-area sniper shootings last Fall.\n  Without such a requirement, gun dealers engaged in illegal sales can \neasily claim theft when their illegally-sold guns turn up in crime.\n  That may be what happened to the Bushmaster assault weapon used by \nJohn Muhammad in the DC-area sniper shootings.\n  Although Muhammad, a prohibited purchaser, acquired the weapon from a \nlicensed gun dealer in Takoma, WA, many months earlier, the store \nreported the gun ``stolen'' only after investigators arrested Muhammad, \nrecovered the gun, ran a trace, and contacted the store.\n  This provision should never have been put in this bill, and I will \nwork to reverse it.\n  In addition, I have serious concerns about the impact of delaying \ncountry-of-origin labeling.\n  As we now know, mad cow disease entered the United States via a cow \nborn in Canada. Had we had labeling in place, we could have more \nquickly traced the cow back to Canada.\n  Furthermore, polls show that 80-90 percent of Americans want their \nfood to be labeled. In my home State of California, we have the \n``California Grown'' program that promotes awareness, consumption and \nvalue of California agricultural products, helping the State's \nconsumers enjoy the best of the California harvest.\n  All Americans deserve what Californians currently have: the \nopportunity to know where their food comes from, and to choose \nAmerican-grown products should they wish.\n  Last year the White House proposed redefining the job descriptions of \nmillions of workers and thus eliminate their right to Federal overtime \nprotection. Left alone, these rules will go into effect this year.\n  The proposal could wipe out overtime pay protections and increase \nwork hours for at least 8 million workers nationwide. This would result \nin huge pay cuts for many workers.\n  In my State of California, State law will protect most workers from \nthe deleterious effects of this rule change. Unfortunately, public \nemployees who are not covered by collective bargaining and some in the \nfilm industry could lose overtime protection if the administration's \nrule is implemented. And, although most workers in California will \nmaintain their right to overtime through protections granted by State \nlaw, the rule change represents a movement in the wrong direction when \nit comes to enhancing worker protections.\n  For more than 65 years, we have maintained an appropriate balance \nbetween family life and work life by requiring employers to pay certain \nworkers time-and-a-half when they work more than 40 hours in a single \nweek.\n  This requirement has protected the 40-hour work week, which has been \na hallmark of our economy for more than six decades.\n  Our workers are more productive then ever; yet, these new overtime \nrules will penalize those individuals who have literally built this \nNation.\n  The men and women who will be most hurt by the rules will be the \nhourly workers that maintain our streets, ring up our groceries, and \nrespond to our calls to 911.\n  Given the still high unemployment rate and the uncertainty still \nplaguing our economy, this is not the time to be making it harder for \nour hardest workers.\n  Rather, it is a time when we should be helping all workers achieve \nfairness in the workplace.\n  As I laid out, there are serious deficiencies in both the substance \nof and process by which this conference report was completed. That \nsaid, I believe that on balance the conference report is better for \nCalifornia and the Nation than the alternative and I will support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Alaska.\n\n[[Page S150]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the last 10 \nminutes before the 12 o'clock vote is reserved for the leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have not been on the Appropriations \nCommittee as long as Senator Byrd but I have been there for many years \nand I can state to the Senate that it is not the first time the Senate \nhas been faced with the prospect of voting for a conference report \nwhich had deleted items that had been passed by both the House and the \nSenate.\n  I say, frankly, I have voted for the items that had been deleted. One \nof them was the overtime provision. One was modified and that is the \none concerning ownership limitations under the jurisdiction of the FCC \nof over-the-air media.\n  In each instance, the reason for our yielding was the other \nprovisions of the bill. We had provisions the House is violently \nopposed to which many Members on both sides of the aisle thought were \nabsolutely necessary for their constituencies or for the Nation.\n  I bluntly state I believe the best thing we can do is get a bill that \nwill not be vetoed. We were looking at this in December, hopefully \ntrying to get it passed. We are looking at it today, and I fervently \npray it will pass because I know the harm being done to a lot of people \nall over the country by these bills not having become law when they \nshould have before October 1 of last year.\n  I will speak about one particular area that has been criticized \nsubstantially, and that is the Bering Sea Aleutian Islands crab \nrationalization plan.\n  This plan, which was recommended to us by the regional council, was \ncreated under the Magnuson-Stevens Act and accomplishes two primary \nobjectives of immediate concern: First, conservation and management of \nthe crab resource; and, second, ending the deadly and inefficient race \nfor this fish.\n  All of the press attention and misinformation on processor quota \nshare has effectively twisted a fishery management plan for one fishery \nin the Bering Sea into a national debate on the regional council \nprocess and the U.S. fishery policy.\n  I remind my colleagues that the rationale behind the Magnuson-Stevens \nAct was to allow the various regions to craft their own unique fishery \nmanagement plans to answer the conservation and management goals of \ntheir localities. The crab rationalization plan is no different in this \nregard. The North Pacific Council recognized all components of the crab \nfishery as a balanced, connected system, rather than competing parts. \nThe only difference with the crab plan is a procedural one. Congress \nspecifically directed the North Pacific Council to develop a plan that \nbalanced harvesters, processors, and communities. Now Congress must \nimplement the council's proposal.\n  The North Pacific Council voted unanimously--11 to 0--to recommend \nthis voluntary, what we call, three-pie cooperative that recognizes \ninvestments made by harvesters, processors, and communities. It is a \nproduct of extensive analysis with numerous opportunities for public \ncomment, hundreds of hours of public testimony, and an open and \ntransparent public debate by the council.\n  The Alaska communities that are dependent on the crab resource being \nprocessed in their plants all support the plan. The vast majority of \nopposition has come from a vocal minority that want to receive a better \ndeal and environmental groups that do not want any form of \nrationalization and would like to lock up marine resources. The state \nof the Bering Sea crab fisheries is poor, and the crab plan developed \nthrough this regional council process needs to be implemented now.\n  Opponents of the crab rationalization plan raise concerns about \nanticompetitive effects and potential antitrust violations. The crab \nplan is not exempt from antitrust laws. It is not exempt from antitrust \nlaws. In fact, the provision specifically states the Secretary may \nrevoke any processor quota share held by a person found to have \nviolated antitrust laws. The plan contemplates no private, \nanticompetitive action, and will be ``actively supervised'' by the \ncouncil and the State of Alaska.\n  Despite the fact that the crab plan is not exempt from antitrust laws \nand will be reviewed by the council, which can make changes as needed, \nand there will be a mandatory information collection and review process \ndeveloped by the Secretary of Commerce and the Department of Justice to \ndetermine whether any illegal or anticompetitive acts have occurred, \nopponents still point to an opinion letter by the Department of Justice \nthat theorizes about ``potential'' anticompetitive abuses. Nowhere does \nthe Department of Justice opinion letter state that individual \nprocessor quota shares violate antitrust laws.\n  The Department of Justice letter--it is an opinion letter--recommends \nthat, what we call, IPQs not be used because they are economically \ninefficient. However, the Department of Justice admits it ``did not \nconsider factors outside the purview of antitrust laws such as the \nsocial goal of protecting jobs in historic fishing villages or \nbalancing the regulatory effects evenly among harvesters and \nprocessors.''\n\n  This is where the Department of Justice letter and most opponents of \nthe crab plan miss the point entirely. The Magnuson-Stevens Act \nrequires the regional councils to consider--and I quote again--\n``protecting jobs in historic fishing villages.'' This consideration \nrequired by law will always be economically inefficient.\n  Pursuant to national standard 8 under the Magnuson-Stevens Act:\n\n       Conservation and management measures shall take into \n     account the importance of fishery resources to fishing \n     communities in order to (A) provide for the sustained \n     participation of such communities, and (B) to the extent \n     practicable, minimize adverse economic impacts on such \n     communities.\n\n  That is section 301(A)(8) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.\n  The North Pacific Council's crab plan is completely consistent with \nthe goals of the Magnuson-Stevens Act to provide for the sustained \nparticipation of remote coastal communities in the Bering Sea in the \ncrab fishery and minimize adverse economic impacts on these \ncommunities.\n  I remind the Senate that half the coastline of the United States is \noff my State of Alaska. This council had an enormous problem to deal \nwith, and it dealt with it unanimously.\n  Next, the opponents argue that the crab plan is precedent setting and \nwill spread to other regional councils. This is a fishery management \nplan for only one fishery in the Bering Sea. In fact, the provision of \nthe bill specifically provides that ``a council or the Secretary may \nnot consider or establish any program to allocate or issue an \nindividual processing quota or processor share in any fishery of the \nUnited States other than the crab fisheries of the Bering Sea and \nAleutian Islands.'' It would take another act of Congress to approve a \nsimilar plan.\n  This crab plan is not precedent setting. It is an extension of the \nefficiencies and successes achieved under the American Fisheries Act, \nwhich we call the AFA. However, where the AFA has a closed class of \nprocessors that can participate in the Bering Sea pollock fishery, the \ncrab plan provides for an open class of processors and allows for new \nentrants in the processing sector.\n  Opponents of the crab plan have argued that processor quota share is \nnot needed to make the fishery safer or to provide for protections for \nthe communities. My suggestion is these individuals who make those \ncomments should visit the Pribilof Islands 800 miles west of my home \nnear Anchorage. The Pribilof Islands are located in the middle of the \nBering Sea. Or they should visit Dutch Harbor in the middle of January \nwhen the crab fisheries are in full swing. They can come by my office \nand see a picture of a crab fishing boat in mid-January, with ice 5 or \n6 inches on the deck and on the rigging.\n  The middle of January is a terrible time, but that is the time when \nthis great crab resource must be harvested. These communities are \ndependent on this crab resource and have made substantial investments \nto process rapidly the product during the mad race for fish in the \ncurrent derby-style fishery. That means there was a very short period \nof time in which the crab could be harvested, and all the boats rushed \nin from everywhere trying to see if they could catch a portion of that \nresource. These communities have become dependent upon the crab \nresource crossing their docks.\n\n[[Page S151]]\n\n  Now, the crab fishery is a unique one in that there is a very high \ndollar value for a small amount of resource that can be processed \nquickly. If the crab plan only provided for harvester-only quota share, \nit would ultimately result in a de facto processing quota for the \nexclusive group of boat owners that control the harvesting rights to \nthe resource.\n  Currently, in the Bering Sea crab fishery there is a surplus of \ncatcher-processor vessels and floating crab processors that can be \nleased or bought cheaply. This mobile processing capacity in \ncombination with a harvester-only share would enable fishermen to form \ncooperatives and vertically integrate such that none of the crab \nresource would ever have to come to shore-side processors.\n  Substantial investments made by shore-based processors would be lost \nand communities such as Unalaska, Adak, St. Paul, St. George, Akutan, \nand King Cove would lose out on processing jobs, taxes, and associated \nrevenues. The North Pacific Council understood this and developed a \nplan that recognized the commitments made by all sectors of this \nfishery and tied the resource to the communities that have historically \nprocessed the crab.\n  Safety will also be achieved by this crab plan; this point is \nirrefutable. The reality is, if we do not pass the crab plan in its \nentirety now, it will be many years, possibly even 10 years, before the \ncouncil could develop another rationalization plan and fully implement \nit.\n  The North Pacific Council is developing other comprehensive \nrationalization programs for the Gulf of Alaska groundfish fisheries \nand will likely turn to the Bering Sea nonpollock groundfish fisheries \nafter that. This council cannot simply stop work on these other \nprograms and address crab rationalization again. It would be extremely \nunfair to those other fisheries and would result in those programs \nhaving to be completely redone because data and factors would \ninevitably change causing the council recommendations and \nconsiderations to be vastly different.\n  If the crab plan does not move forward in its entirety the deadly \nrace for fish will continue.\n  I believe some harsh realities about the Bering Sea crab fishery will \nillustrate why we must implement this provision immediately. The Bering \nSea/Aleutian Islands crab fishery is rated the most dangerous \noccupation in the United States. From 1990 to 2001, there were 61 \nfatalities and 25 vessels were lost; and in the recent October 2003 red \nking crab fishery, boats were lost and a person killed. This past \nOctober crab fishery was one of the worst weather-wise ever, with \nnearly constant gale force winds and huge ocean swells. Under the crab \nplan fishermen could have chosen to wait until the weather cleared to \nharvest the crab.\n  That is the main point. Instead of regulating the time within which a \ncrab must be caught, they regulate the catching of the crab and let the \nfishermen decide when it is safe to fish. Lives will be saved if we \napprove this plan.\n  Conditions are even more extreme during the winter crab fishery in \nthe Bering Sea when it is almost always dark, extremely cold, and the \nseas send freezing ocean spray that ice down the crab vessels. I have a \npicture of that in my office. The derby-style fishery requires \ndeckhands to work all day and all night, outside on icy decks, in \nrolling 10- to 20-foot seas, retrieving 700-pound steel pots, sorting \ncrab and then dropping the pots in new places.\n  Obviously, this is very dangerous, but it is also very inefficient \nand damaging to the resource. The boats are racing to harvest the crab \nbefore the guideline harvest levels are reached, which requires them to \npull their pots early not allowing them to ``soak'' longer, permitting \nyounger crabs to escape. The result is the younger crabs are \nunnecessarily killed causing the stocks to suffer. We require the \nreturning to the sea of the younger crabs. This plan will assist in \nimplementing that requirement.\n  If we do not implement this provision lives will continue to be lost \nand the resource and the environment will suffer. The opposition of a \nvocal few that believe they deserve a better deal and environmental \ngroups that want to turn the waters in the North Pacific into vast \nmarine reserves or ``no-take-zones'' are behind the opposition to crab \nrationalization. Their attacks are shameful, self righteous, and \ndisingenuous. We have an obligation to protect the crab resource in the \nBering Sea and prevent any further loss of life in this fishery. This \nis exactly what crab rationalization will achieve and to argue anything \nelse is just not true.\n  Three years ago Congress directed the North Pacific Fishery \nManagement Council to analyze the management of the Bering Sea Crab \nfisheries and determine whether rationalization was necessary. The \nNorth Pacific Council completed its study and recommended a \nrationalization program that recognized the historical participation in \nthe fishery of remote Alaska fishing communities, harvesters, and \nprocessors. The ``Three-pie Voluntary Cooperative Program'' developed \nby the North Pacific Council protects the resource and ends the \ndangerous race for fish. Section 801 of Title VIII-Alaskan Fisheries of \nthe FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations conference report directs the \nSecretary to implement the North Pacific Council's crab rationalization \nprogram in its entirety.\n  Section 801 amends section 313 of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery \nConservation and Management Act by adding a new subsection 313(j). \nParagraph 313 (j)(1) directs the Secretary to approve and implement the \nNorth Pacific Council's rationalization program for the Bering Sea/\nAleutian Islands crab fisheries, including all trailing amendments. It \nalso clarifies that the Secretary may approve and implement additional \ntrailing amendments approved by the North Pacific Council. The \nSecretary must implement all parts of the crab rationalization program \nthat were reported to Congress between June 2002 and April 2003, and \nall trailing amendments including those reported on May 6, 2003, no \nlater than January 1, 2005. Any further amendments approved by the \nCouncil should be corrective in nature or address unforeseen problems \nwith the overall functionality of the crab rationalization program. \nPrimary elements of the Voluntary Three-pie Cooperative crab program \nthat made three separate allocations, one to the harvest sector, one to \nthe processing sector, and one to defined regions, should not change as \nthis was the basis of understanding of how the crab fisheries would be \nrationalized in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands. It is imperative \nthat the deadly and inefficient race for crab in the harsh winter \nmonths in the Bering Sea ends. Congress expects the Secretary to meet \nthe statutory deadline of implementation of the rationalization program \nin time for the 2005 crab fisheries. Congress does not expect the \nCouncil to revisit particulars of the crab rationalization program that \nwere part of the initial report to Congress in June of 2002, such as \nindividual harvest shares, processing shares, the 90/10 split of \n``Class A'' and ``Class B'' shares, regional share designations, \nvoluntary harvester cooperatives, and community development quota \nallocations, to name a few.\n  Paragraph 313(j)(2) directs the Secretary to approve all parts of the \nNorth Pacific Council's crab program, including harvester quota, \nprocessor quota, and community protections. It also includes a non-\nseverability clause that prevents a court from overruling only certain \nparts of the program. If any part of the program is found to violate \nthe law, the entire program fails and the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands \ncrab fisheries will operate under their current open-access management \nscheme. It also prevents processors from improperly seeking crab \ndeliveries harvested under a harvester's open-delivery quota.\n\n  Paragraph 313(j)(3) authorizes the North Pacific Council to recommend \nto the Secretary and necessary changes after implementation of the crab \nprogram to continue to meet conservation and management goals set out \nin the program for the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands crab fisheries.\n  Paragraph 313(j)(4) specifies that the loan program defined under the \ncrab rationalization program for captains and crew be authorized \npursuant to relevant sections of Title XI of the Merchant Marine Act as \namended for fisheries financing and capacity reduction and for direct \nloan obligations for fisheries financing and capacity reduction. The \nloan program for crab fishing vessel captains and crew members is to be \na low interest loan program similar to\n\n[[Page S152]]\n\nthe loan program under the halibut and sablefish IFQ program.\n  Paragraph 313(j)(5) authorizes $1,000,000 each year from funds \navailable in the National Marine Fisheries Service account for Alaska \nfisheries activities to implement the program.\n  Paragraph 313(j)(6) specifies that the antitrust laws of the United \nStates apply to the crab program. It requires the Secretary of Commerce \nto work with Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to \ndevelop and implement a mandatory information collection and review \nprocess to monitor the crab program and ensure no anticompetitive acts \noccur among persons receiving individual processing quota. If any \nperson receiving individual processor quota is found to have violated a \nprovision of the antitrust laws the Secretary may revoke their \nprocessor quota share.\n  Paragraph 313(j)(7) requires individual processor quota share under \nthe crab program to be considered a permit and subject to sections 307 \n(Prohibited Acts) and 308 and 309 (penalties and criminal offenses) of \nthe Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. It \nspecifies that, like individual fishing quota, issuance of individual \nprocessor quota share does not confer any compensation right if it is \nrevoked or limited, and does not create title or other interest in or \nto any fish before purchase from a harvester.\n  Paragraph 313(j)(8) specifies that the restriction on the collection \nof economic data in section 303(d)(7) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act will \nnot apply for any processor that receives individual processing quota \nunder the crab program. In addition, the restriction on the \nconfidentiality of information in section 402(b)(1) will not apply when \nthe information is used to determine eligibility or verify history for \nindividual processing quota. This is consistent with the exception to \nthe confidentiality of information requirement under the Magnuson-\nStevens Act for verifying catch under an individual fishing quota \nprogram.\n\n  Paragraph 313(j)(9) specifies that sections 308 (civil penalties and \npermit sanctions), 310 (civil forfeitures), and 311 (enforcement) of \nthe Magnuson-Stevens Act will apply to the processing facilities and \nfish products of any person holding individual processing quota. In \naddition, to ensure compliance with the crab program it may be \nnecessary for the Secretary to inspect a processor's facilities, \ntherefore facilities owned or controlled by a person holding individual \nprocessing quota will be subject to the prohibited acts of section \n307(1) subparagraphs (D), (E) and (L) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.\n  The North Pacific Council is recognized for developing novel and \ninnovative approaches to conservation and management of the abundant \nfisheries in the North Pacific. The ``Three-pie Voluntary Cooperative \nProgram'' for rationalizing the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands crab \nfisheries is another example of that creativity. It is the product of \nthree years of public meetings and discussion by industry sectors, \ncitizens and affected communities, two years of discussion and \ndevelopment by the North Pacific Council and its Advisory Panel, and \nnearly two years of extensive and thorough analysis by Council staff, \nwith technical assistance from the National Marine Fisheries Service, \nAlaska Department of Fish and Game, and independent economists and \nfisheries consultants.\n  The Council meticulously constructed the crab rationalization program \nto achieve bold conservation and management goals for the resource; but \nalso considered the very unique reality of a high value, capital \nintensive, high risk fishery that is prosecuted entirely in the distant \nwaters of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands. The Council has done a \ngreat job crafting the Three-pie Voluntary Cooperative crab \nrationalization program and it is expected to implement the program in \nits entirety, including all trailing amendments, as reported to \nCongress in June of 2002. The Council should not revisit the \nparticulars of the crab program, but should continue to work with the \nCommerce Department of ensure that the crab program is implemented in \nits entirety in time for the 2005 winter crab fisheries.\n  The Magnuson-Stevens Act requires fishery management plans and \namendments to provide for the sustained participation of communities in \nthe fisheries it had historically depended on for employment and \neconomic opportunity. Small, isolated communities like St. Paul and St. \nGeorge located on the Pribilof Islands, and Adak on the Aleutian chain \nhave become dependent on the crab resource crossing their docks. This \nplan slows down the pace of the fishery, achieves efficiencies in \nharvesting the resource, manages and conserves the resource better, and \nhelps decapitalize the fishery.\n\n  While there will inevitably be a degree of economic dislocation in \nthe communities dependent on the revenues. The crab rationalization \nprogram addresses these concerns by tying the crab resource to the \ncommunities that historically processed the crab. Processor quota share \nis a form of community protection which maintains historical processing \ncapacity in the communities. Processor quota share should remain in \nthose unique, isolated committees like St. Paul, St. George, King Cove \nand Adak; communities completely dependent on the crab fishery, that do \nnot benefit from multispecies processing and other economic \nopportunities. The North Pacific Council determined that for the crab \nfisheries, processor quota share was a necessary safeguard to protect \nthe investments made by the processing sector and more importantly, to \nmaintain the economic benefits in the communities that have \nhistorically depended on the resource.\n  Section 802 of Title VIII-Alaskan Fisheries directs the Secretary in \nconsultation with the North Pacific Fishery Management Council to \nestablish a pilot fisheries management program that recognizes the \nhistoric participation of fishing vessels and fish processors in the \ncentral Gulf of Alaska rockfish fishery. The provision delineates the \nyears and types of rockfish that should be considered for a pilot \nrationalization program to allow for increased use and value in the \nfishery. The pilot rockfish program will expire when the North Pacific \nCouncil authorizes a comprehensive rationalization program for Gulf of \nAlaska Groundfish and implemented by the Secretary, or 2 years from the \ndate of implementation, whichever is earlier. The pilot program \ncontemplates new entrants into this fishery and provides a set-aside of \nup to 5 percent of the total allowable catch of such fishery for \ncatcher vessels not eligible to participate in the program. In \naddition, the five percent that is available for new entrants must come \ninto Kodiak, Alaska for processing and can be processed by processors \nthat have not historically participated in the fishery. The North \nPacific Council will establish catch limits for nonrockfish species and \nnon-target rockfish species currently harvested along with pacific \nocean perch, northern rockfish, and pelagic shelf rockfish, which \nshould be based on historical harvesting of such bycatch species. The \nGulf of Alaska rockfish pilot program should also recognize the \nhistoric fishing and processing participation of catcher-processors \nthat have historically participated in this fishery, and should utilize \nthe same years and species of fish considered under the provision.\n\n  The intent of the pilot program is to consider the historic \nparticipation of all of those that have been involved in the fishery. \nThe Gulf of Alaska rockfish pilot program does not authorize individual \nprocessing quota share for processors in this fishery. The ``historic \nparticipation of fish processors'' under this pilot program should be \nconsidered pursuant to the cooperative model under the American \nFisheries Act, or any other manner the North Pacific Council determines \nis appropriate. This provision in no way authorizes individual \nprocessor quota share for the comprehensive Gulf of Alaska groundfish \nrationalization program that the North Pacific Council is currently \ndeveloping. This pilot program is intended to allow for better \nconservation and management of the central Gulf of Alaska rockfish and \nextend the work year for processing jobs in Kodiak.\n  Section 803 of Title VIII--Alaskan Fisheries directs the Aleutian \nIslands pollock allocation to the Aleut Corporation for economic \ndevelopment in Adak, Alaska. If the North Pacific Council opens the \nAleutian pollock fishery, the allocation of pollock for economic \ndevelopment in Adak will be\n\n[[Page S153]]\n\nrestricted by the prohibited acts contemplated under section 307 of the \nMagnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act and subject to \nthe penalties and sanctions under section 308 of the Act, including the \nforfeiture of any fish harvested or processed. Two classes of vessels \nmay harvest this pollock allocation: vessels that are 60 feet or less \nin length overall and have a valid fishery endorsement can harvest the \nAleutian pollock allocation and deliver it to Adak for processing; and \nvessels eligible to harvest pollock under section 208 of Title II of \nDivision C of Public Law 105-277 are permitted to form partnerships \nwith the Aleut Corporation to harvest the Aleutian Islands pollock \nallocation for economic development in Adak. Section 803 does not waive \nthe requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, Endangered Species Act, \nNational Environmental Policy Act or any other federal laws. The North \nPacific Council and NMFS should be cautious in implementing section \n803(a) to ensure that any reopening of a directed Aleutian Islands \npollock fishery is accomplished in full compliance with all applicable \nlaw, and without disrupting 2004 groundfish fisheries which have \nalready commenced.\n  In an effort to gradually establish a small boat fleet in Adak, \nsubsection (b) of section 803 provides that during the years 2004 \nthrough 2008, up to 25 percent of the Aleutian allocation may be \nharvested by vessels 60 feet or less in length overall. During the \nyears 2009 through 2013, up to 50 percent of such allocation may be \nharvested by vessels 60 feet or less in length overall. After the year \n2012, 50 percent of such allocation shall be harvested by vessels 60 \nfeet or less in length overall, and 50 percent shall be harvested by \nvessels eligible under section 208 of Title II of Division C of Public \nLaw 105-277. Establishing a small boat fleet will be critical for the \neconomic diversification of Adak and the revenues generated from the \nuse of the Aleutian Islands pollock allocation will allow for greater \ninvestment opportunities in this community. For purposes of \nimplementing this section, section 206 of the American Fisheries Act \n(AFA) is redefined so that the allocations in section 206(b) of the AFA \nshould only apply to the Bering Sea portion of the directed pollock \nfishery.\n\n  Subsection (c) of section 803 codifies one of the longest standing \nconservation and management measures of the North Pacific Fishery \nManagement Council, the 2 million metric ton cap for groundfish in the \nBering Sea. The optimum yield for groundfish in the Bering Sea and \nAleutian Islands Management Area shall not exceed 2 million metric \ntons. Upon the recommendation of the North Pacific Council and approval \nof the Secretary of Commerce, and only if consistent with the \nconservation and management goals and requirements of the Magnuson-\nStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the allocation of \nAleutian pollock for economic development in Adak, may be in addition \nto the 2 million metric ton optimum yield. This treatment of the \nAleutian Islands pollock allocation would only be during the 2004 \nthrough the 2008 fishing years, but only if harvests in excess of the \ncap do not result in overfishing and then only to the extent necessary \nto accommodate a directed pollock fishery in the Aleutian Islands and \nshould not adversely affect the current participants in the Bering Sea \npollock fishery in the near term. Eventually this pollock allocation \nwill come under the combined optimum yield for all groundfish in the \nBering Sea and Aleutian Islands 2 million metric ton cap by taking \nproportional reductions in the total allowable catches for each of the \nexisting groundfish fisheries as necessary to accommodate the \nestablishment of the Aleutian Island pollock fishery.\n  Subsection (d) of section 803 allows the North Pacific Fishery \nManagement Council to recommend and the Secretary to approve an \nallocation of Aleutian Islands pollock to the Aleut Corporation for the \npurposes of economic development in Adak pursuant to the requirements \nof the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The \nNorth Pacific Council should consider pollock allocations given to the \nvarious groups that participate in the Community Development Quota \nprogram to recommend a reasonable amount of the Aleutian Islands \npollock to the Aleut Corporation for purposes of economic development \nin Adak and in no case should this amount exceed 40,000 metric tons.\n  Nothing in this section requires the North Pacific Council to open \nthe Aleutian Islands pollock fishery. The Council should not take any \naction in regards to this fishery which would require a new \nconsultation under the current biological opinion or Endangered Species \nAct covering Steller sea lions.\n  Section 804 of Title VIII--Alaskan Fisheries prohibits any Regional \nFishery Management Council or the Secretary from approving any fishery \nmanagement plan or plan amendments to allocate or issue individual \nprocessing quota or processor share in any fishery of the United States \nother than the crab fisheries of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands.\n  In closing, I don't know of any time when we have tried to be \nbipartisan on a greater scale than in these seven bills in the omnibus \nbill. I personally have reviewed requests from Senators from both sides \nof the aisle. We have done our utmost to meet the most urgent needs in \ntheir States. We have talked to chairmen of the various committees and \ntried to work with them. In some instances the chairmen disagreed, but \nwe have taken positions that are consistent with a majority of the \ncommittees in those instances.\n  I believe this is a good bill. The problem we face now in this \ncloture vote--I hope all Senators will consider it--is we are in an \nelection year. We must once again face 13 appropriations bills for \n2005. If we do not approve this bill, this omnibus bill, we will have \nto turn and go back and try to do what we should have done by October 1 \nof last year. That will obviously impede consideration of 2005 bills \nand, in my judgment, would ultimately lead to a post-election session. \nI don't know how many other Senators have lived through post-election \nsessions that were contentious, but I believe one this year would be \nvery contentious. I hope the Senate will set its goal not to be in \nsession after the election this fall.\n  We have Members who are retiring. Some Members may be defeated. The \nobject of getting done before the election is to put to rest the \ndisputes in the Senate and go on to the Presidential election and give \ntime after the Presidential election to get ready for the next two \nCongresses which will come under the term from 2005 to 2009.\n  I thank all members of the committee for their cooperation with me. I \nhave enjoyed working with the minority leader, Senator Daschle, the \nassistant minority leader, Senator Reid, as well as our leaders, \nSenator Frist and Senator McConnell, and with Members of the House.\n  This was a most difficult bill. It has been most difficult because of \nthe fact we are at war. We are not only at war, but we created a new \ndepartment which had to be funded and people had to be taken from the \nexisting departments in order to staff that new department. We had to \nfigure out the allocation of funds to this new department in a fair way \nthat did not disturb the functions of the balance of these entities \nthat were left in the former departments.\n  This Congress ought to congratulate itself for having reacted to the \npost-September 11, 2001 tragedy. We created a department which has made \nthe United States safer, and we have funded the needs of our men and \nwomen in the Armed Forces who have answered the call of our country and \nour Commander in Chief.\n  I pray in this year 2004 we will not have any further disasters of \nthat type, but the war on terrorism continues. A lot of the money that \nis in this bill goes to try to stave off further attacks on our people \nand historic objects in this country. We all are conscious of how much \nmoney that is taking. All you have to do is go through any airport to \nrealize how life has changed since September 11, 2001. The money in \nthis bill has been efficiently allocated. To the maximum extent \npossible, we have tried to deal with the requests of every Senator.\n  I see the minority leader now. He and I have talked at length about \nthe COOL program, the country-of-origin labeling. I opposed that \nprovision. We deleted it here in the Senate. Again, when we got to the \nconference, it was not possible to have the conference\n\n[[Page S154]]\n\ncomplete without that provision in it. It was a judgment that we ought \nto get the bill to the Senate and get it approved and avoid a veto. I \nam not happy about that.\n  There are other provisions in this bill I am not happy about. But I \ncan state to the Senate, in all, this bill is a good consensus. It is \ngood for the country, and it will fund the agencies that need the money \nnow. We could not fund this Government during a period of war that is \ngoing on in Iraq and our war on terrorism under a continuing \nresolution. I thank the minority leader for his statements the other \nday. The worst dream the chairman of the Appropriations Committee can \nhave is the problem of facing up to whether the Deficiency Act will \nrequire shutting down the Government if we don't pass the bills. I hope \nand pray we will pass this bill today and avoid that contingency.\n  Mr. President, there are several provisions in the FY04 Omnibus \nAppropriations bill that merit further explanation.\n  The Transportation measure included $8 million for runway lighting in \nAlaska. Of the funds made available, it is the Committee's expectation \nthat $3 million would be made available for laser technology in \nGirdwood, Alaska and Merrill Field in Anchorage, Alaska upon \ncertification of the technology. I urge the FAA to act as quickly as \npossible to favorably approve the certification petition.\n  The Transportation bill included $2.3 million for ``trail and parking \nimprovements'' for the Seward multi-agency visitor center in Seward, \nAK. Those funds are also available, if necessary, for the acquisition \nand completion of the plaza between Washington Street and the beginning \nof the historic Iditarod Trail in the Park Service/Portico Group plan.\n  Both the VA-HUD bill and the Agriculture appropriations bill include \nfunds for rural water and sewer improvements in rural Alaska. The VA-\nHUD bill directs that beginning in FY05, EPA must set aside 25 percent \nof the funds for hub communities and a priority list must be \nestablished that will remain in effect for three years. The Rural \nDevelopment Administration should follow the same process so the funds \ncan be administered together to reduce administrative overhead.\n  In the Energy-Water appropriations bill adopted earlier, questions \nhave been raised concerning Congress' intention with respect to the \nDouglas Harbor. Congress provided $3 million to the Corps of Engineers \nto construct the causeway and breakwaters at the harbor entrance. The \nCommittee urges the corps to commence construction of that project \nduring this construction season if at all feasible.\n  Funds were included in the Commerce, Justice, State section of the \nbill and earlier in the Interior appropriations bill concerning mass \nmarking of fish that should be implemented to be consistent with one \nanother. Both bills fund mass marking of fish produced in federally \nfunded hatcheries. Marking refers to modifying the appearance of an \nimmature fish in a hatchery so that when it matures there is an \nexternal mark that identifies it as originating from a hatchery. Mass \nmarking refers to marking all or a substantial proportion of the fish \nreleases from a hatchery. By mass marking the hatchery fish, fishery \nmanagement agencies can direct fishery harvests on marked hatchery \nproduction while avoiding unmarked fish that might come from a depleted \nor endangered stock.\n  However, fishery management agencies all along the Pacific coast, in \nboth Canada and the United States rely on one type of marking as a \nbasis for identifying different stocks of salmon and obtaining \ninformation on those stocks that is vital to conservation and \nmanagement programs. To assure that the mass marking program does not \ninterfere with this crucial scientific program, it is the committee's \nintent that mass marking programs supported by Federal funding will \nensure that hatchery Chinook salmon that are marked by removing all or \npart of the adipose fin are also tagged with a microwire tag or \nalternatively mark the fish with some other mark. This will help \npreserve the validity of the existing stock identification data base \nwhile also realizing the objectives of the mass marking programs by \nenabling increased harvests of threatened or depleted stocks.\n  The Justice Department budget within the Commerce, Justice, State \nbill included $12.5 million for internet safety for children. The \ncommittee urges the department to work with I-SAFE consistent with the \nSenate Report.\n  Mr. President, the significant number of Alaskans that are \ndescendants of our original indigenous Indian, Eskimo, and Aleut \ninhabitants are a great source of pride and a unique part of our \nheritage. A majority of those Native Alaskans reside in one of more \nthan 200 small rural villages.\n  Alaska is also unique in that, since the purchase of Alaska in 1867, \nCongress has adopted and implemented an Alaska Native policy that is \ndifferent in a most important respect from the Native American policies \nthat Congress has adopted and implemented in the ``lower 48.''\n  Congress created Native corporations and since statehood has required \nAlaska Natives to comply with the same criminal, civil, and regulatory \nenactments of the Alaska State Legislature to which all other Alaska \nresidents are subject.\n  Like all citizens of my State, Alaska Natives participate in the \ndevelopment of those enactments by electing residents of the \ncommunities in which they live to serve in the Alaska State \nLegislature. In that regard, I am immensely proud that Alaska has a \ntradition of Native American involvement in the State political system \nthat is unrivaled by that of any other State. The first Alaska Native \nwas elected to our territorial legislature in 1924. In 1959 ten Alaska \nNatives served in the first Alaska State Legislature. And today, 10 of \nthe 60 members of the 23rd Alaska State Legislature are Alaska Natives.\n  During the Clinton administration, the Secretary of the Interior, his \nsolicitor and Ada Deer, the Under Secretary of Indian Affairs, argued \nthat there are more than two hundred sovereign tribal governments in \nAlaska. Many believe that policy was wrong, as a matter of law, while \nothers assert that tribes have always existed. The provision in this \nbill creating a rural justice commission does not take sides in that \ndispute. Rather it seeks a practical solution to the issue of rural \njustice and law enforcement.\n  One of the more pressing problems we now face is the issue of \nDepartment of Justice grants that have been issued to Alaska Native \ntribes. These grants have been used to create tribal courts that in \nsome instances may exceed their lawful jurisdiction and to hire tribal \npolice who are not currently authorized to enforce State laws.\n\n  Since the Appropriations Committee reported S. 1585 to the Senate in \nSeptember, I was contacted by a number of Alaska Native leaders who \nhave expressed legitimate concern that the State of Alaska's and the \nFederal Government's criminal justice systems need to be configured in \nnew and innovative ways in order to better meet the unique law \nenforcement challenges that we face throughout rural Alaska. In order \nto facilitate an analysis of, and a constructive dialogue regarding, \nthat very important subject, at my request the conference committee \nthat I co-chaired included section 112(a)(2) in title I of division B \nof the H.R. 2673 conference report. This provision establishes an \nAlaska Rural Justice and Law Enforcement Commission that will study the \ncriminal justice system in rural Alaska and then submit recommendations \nto Congress and the Alaska State Legislature regarding ways in which \nthose systems can be improved.\n  Also at my request, the conference committee include a new section \n112(a)(1) which prohibits the Department of Justice from making grants \nto Alaska Native organizations that are located in communities that \nhave fewer than twenty-five permanent Alaska Native residents, as well \nas communities that are located within the municipality of Anchorage or \none of six designated boroughs. The purpose of section 112(a)(1) is to \nallow rural communities grants to continue during the fiscal year \nduring which the Alaska Rural Justice and Law Enforcement Commission \nwill be developing its recommendations.\n  I want to emphasize that the conference committee does not intend the \nenactment of section 112(a)(1) to express a view as to whether the \n108th\n\n[[Page S155]]\n\nCongress believes that either a prior Congress or the Secretary of the \nInterior, acting lawfully pursuant to authority he has been delegated \nby Congress, has created ``federally recognized tribes'' in Alaska. Nor \ndoes the conference committee intend the enactment of section 112(a)(1) \nto create ``federally recognized tribes'' in Alaska by implication. The \namendment takes no position on the issues which are now pending before \nthe courts.\n  I also note that when this provision was originally drafted, we hoped \nthe bill would become law back in September. The deadlines established \nin the amendment reflected that hope. But now, in January 2004 those \ndeadlines are unrealistic and unachievable. Therefore the Commission \nshould have through this year to complete its work and issue \nrecommendations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as I understand it, each leader has 5 \nminutes prior to the vote. I spoke early this morning. Let me again \nsummarize my concerns.\n  I have heard others express the fact that on the country-of-origin \nlabeling, we had one position in the Senate and the House had another, \nand that this represents a compromise. I will come back to that issue. \nI acknowledge that in the case of country-of-origin labeling, the House \nand Senate had two different positions. I would say, though, that on \nthe issue of overtime, on the issue of media concentration in \nparticular, both had rollcall votes cast in the House and in the Senate \ntaking strong positions in opposition to what has now been presented to \nus in conference.\n  My earlier remarks expressed the deep concern for the institution \nwhen in conference there is an ability on the part of a few people to \noverride the majority in both the House and Senate on issues as \nimportant as these. So I think we have to be concerned about democracy \nand about our Republic as occasions such as this arise. Maybe it is not \nunprecedented, but I don't care how unprecedented or precedented it may \nbe, it is a bad practice. I believe it ought to be stopped.\n  I also expressed this morning my concern about media concentration. I \nwill not elaborate, except to say I am troubled when not only the White \nHouse but those in the House who hold a different position can override \nthe majorities in the House and Senate.\n  I am also concerned about the policy itself. Increased media \nconcentration is not good for this country, and those who advocate and \nsupport the free enterprise system certainly would have to share that \nconcern. We will say a lot more about that also in the future.\n  My two greatest concerns have to do with the overtime provision and \ncountry-of-origin labeling. For the life of me, I cannot understand why \nthis body, this Congress, would ever want to take away the rights to \novertime and make the extraordinary statement today that we are not \ngoing to reward work, that people who work overtime, work hard and play \nby the rules, are actually going to be penalized for working hard and \novertime in a week or a month.\n  I know of a lot of people who desperately need these resources to \nmake ends meet, pay for groceries, for insurance, and the house \npayment. For us, as an official Government policy, to say, no, we are \ngoing to devise ways in which to deny you overtime pay for the first \ntime in 70 years is abhorrent. It is just wrong.\n  I know I only have 5 minutes, so I will leave it at that. Simply \nagain, I will reiterate how deeply concerned many of us are for this \ndramatic change in the way we look at rewarding work.\n  Finally, country-of-origin labeling. We have had an unfortunate set \nof circumstances in the last month right around Christmas; we had the \nfirst case of mad cow disease. The administration has done some things \nright, but, for the life of me, I cannot understand why they would not \nsupport an action already in law and a policy in 43 other countries--an \naction that simply says we have a right to know not only the contents \nof our food, not only the nutritional value of our food, but the origin \nof our food. We know the origin of everything else. Why is it so hard \nfor us that we have to say we need 2 more years to study whether it \nmakes sense for us to know the origin of our food?\n  The Japanese are saying: We are not going to give you 2 years. You \nare not going to export food to our country unless you can tell us \nwhere it came from. We are going to deny American exports so long as \nyou cannot label them.\n  Again, the administration is saying that doesn't matter; we are for \nfree trade; we just don't care whether the Japanese want us to label \nour food.\n  Some have suggested there ought to be a voluntary system. We have \ntried that. Give me a break. That will not work because it has not \nworked for years, decades, generations. We need a mandatory system.\n  I am out of time. I will simply say this, and I will use leader time \nfor the additional time. I know there is a need to vote soon. These \nissues will not go away. We intend to come back with congressional \nreview resolutions, amendments, freestanding bills, to Rule XIV bills \non the calendar. We will come back on these. This is not the end but \nthe beginning. We will not rest until this job is done.\n\n  I have indicated to my colleagues that I intended to make a unanimous \nconsent request, as we have with some of these other provisions. I will \ndo so at this time before I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of a concurrent resolution, which I shall send \nto the desk, correcting the enrollment of the omnibus conference \nreport, striking the language which delays the implementation of \ncountry-of-origin meat labeling regulations; that the concurrent \nresolution be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the time has come to move ahead and \ncomplete the unfinished work of the first session of the 108th \nCongress.\n  We have had good debate over the course of the morning and \nyesterday--in fact, this week. I have made it very clear as to the \nimportance of this vote, the significance of the vote we will take in 4 \nor 5 minutes. If we fail to enact this legislation, we will do very \nclear things. We will curtail our efforts in the fight against \nterrorism; it won't be as effective. We will weaken funding for our \nfood security system if we don't pass this legislation. We will not \nhave as secure and as strong a system inspecting our food. We will \ncreate hardships for millions of veterans, which is unnecessary. That \nis what this vote, in part, is about. We would put at risk millions of \nlives of people who suffer from AIDS and the global effort to fight one \nof the most moral humanitarian and public health challenges of our \ntime. We would be shortchanging the needs of our schools, our \ncommunities, our States, and needy and disadvantaged Americans.\n  There are people who have said this legislation spends too much. I \nwill once again point out and stress what I mentioned 2 days ago. This \nbill abides by the spending limits agreed to by Congress and the \nexecutive branch, excluding those two emergency supple- mentals enacted \nlast year for the conflicts in Iraq.\n  Appropriations spending authority will increase less than 3 percent \nbetween the year 2003 and 2004, with passage of this bill. The \nalterative to passing this bill is stark--a full-blown continuing \nresolution for the seven outstanding appropriations bills.\n  Compared to doing the right thing and passing this legislation, \nSenators do have to be reminded one more time that the alternative \nwould mean title I and special education programs would be reduced by \n$2 billion; the National Institutes of Health would be cut by $1 \nbillion; veterans medical care would be reduced by $3.1 billion; \nhighway funding would be reduced by $2.2 billion; global HIV/AIDS \nfunding would be reduced by nearly $1 billion. That is what is at stake \nin this legislation.\n  The legislation doesn't please everybody. That is what much of the \ndebate has been about over the last 48 hours. I recognize that, and I \nrecognize that part of the legislative process is for us to come \ntogether and express our beliefs and wishes and have that debate and \ncompromise.\n\n[[Page S156]]\n\n  Compromises are never going to please everybody. There are provisions \nin the bill I would have preferred to be different, but I have learned, \nespecially over the course of the last year as majority leader, that \nyou do the best you can. Compromise and negotiation are part of the \nlegislative process.\n  I want to respond, as the Democratic leader made clear in his remarks \nthis morning, the legislative process isn't over with this legislation. \nIt is not over. This is another very important step that we have taken, \nbut issues that have been expressed as issues of concern on the floor \nof the Senate will--and I understand that--be revisited again and again \nin our legislative process. The great thing about our legislative \nprocess is that people will have that opportunity.\n  It is time to move on the country's demand that we complete action on \nthis bill and, thus, in closing, I do ask all my colleagues to vote for \ncloture and move America forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GREGG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I voted against cloture and \nagainst the fiscal year 2004 Omnibus appropriations conference report \nbecause it does not fund West Virginia's priorities--short changing \nveteran's healthcare by about $700 million and education by $6 billion, \nas well as many other essential programs. I was also very concerned \nthat provisions were added to the legislation at the insistence of the \nWhite House and over the will of both Houses of Congress to cut \novertime pay for 8 million workers. Not long ago, the Senate and the \nHouse rejected this administration's Department of Labor regulation \nthat would reduce the overtime pay of workers, and yet this bill \nincludes just such a change.\n  The process that produced this bill was unfair and does not give \nCongress its due opportunity to protect the priorities of the citizens \nof our states. This kind of process means West Virginia loses its right \nto be properly represented.\n  Additionally, the will of Congress to implement stronger food safety \nprovisions to require country-of-origin labeling for meat products has \nbeen ignored. This legislation delays action on such labeling for \nanother two years; a troubling result given the concerns about mad cow \ndisease.\n  In previous action, the House and Senate conferees agreed to provide \nbasic protections for Federal employees targeted for privatization by \nthe administration, yet this legislation guts such protection placing \n400,000 Federal workers in jeopardy without protections.\n\n[[Page S157]]\n\n  What's more, this legislation included an across-the-board cut in all \nprograms, and that is not a responsible budget practice. Such a cut \nmeans that 24,000 fewer children will be served by title I in their \nschools, 26,500 fewer veterans will get health care, and $170 million \nwill be lost for needed highway construction.\n  Under the process imposed in this must pass legislation, Senators \nhave no chance to offer amendments or make changes. This is simply not \nright, and therefore, I vote no in protest. I vote no, to taking away \nthe rights of West Virginians.\n  I understand that the votes are there to pass the underlying \nlegislation to keep the government functioning and provide support to \nWest Virginia projects. I agree that VA healthcare funding needs to be \nincreased, but this bill falls far short. I agree with the $1 billion \nincrease for the Title 1 education program, but I also must point out \nthat we are still $6 billion short of the amount promised for the No \nChild Left Behind Act.\n  Again, my vote is a protest vote against the effort to rob West \nVirginia of its representation in the appropriations process and in \nopposition to the egregious provisions inserted into this legislation \nwithout bipartisan support, or full and fair discussion. I am pleased \nthat after over 4 months, Federal funding is decided, but the process \nmust be changed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/22/senate-section/article/S157-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S157-S168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PENSION FUNDING EQUITY ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, pursuant to the order previously agreed \nto, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to the \nconsideration of H.R. 3108, the pension bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Pursuant to the previous order, the Committee on Finance is \ndischarged from further consideration of the measure and the clerk will \nreport the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3108) to amend the Employee Retirement Income \n     Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \n     temporarily replace the 30-year Treasury rate with a rate \n     based on long-term corporate bonds for certain pension plan \n     funding requirements and other provisions, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise in support of this piece of \nlegislation. I join the Senator from Iowa, the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, along with the senior Senator from the Democratic party on \nmy committee, Mr. Kennedy, and I believe Senator Baucus. We worked long \nand hard to address this issue--and it is a critical issue--of how we \nmake sure the pension system in this country, or especially relating to \ndefined benefit pensions, is maintained in a viable and strong way.\n  The pension system in this country is, regrettably, in trouble. But \nthe amendment being offered today is designed to restore stability to \nthe pension system and give us the time to solve the broad, difficult \nproblems facing the pension system.\n\n  Last week, when the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation released its \nannual report outlining record losses, Labor Secretary Chao put the \nissue in proper perspective when she said:\n\n       While PBGC [Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation] is not in \n     crisis--the agency has sufficient assets to meet its \n     obligations for a number of years into the future--it is \n     clear that the financial integrity of the federal pension \n     insurance system is at risk. It is equally clear that \n     comprehensive reform of the nation's pension funding rules \n     must be enacted to strengthen the financial health of the \n     defined benefit pension system.\n\n  Time is the key thing here. That is why we need to legislate today. \nThe amendment gives critical players the time they need in the area of \nreform to accomplish the changes necessary to get through this period \nin front of us.\n  There is in this bill a temporary interest rate fix which gives \nCongress time to review all of the options and make the right decisions \non funding, reporting, and many other issues facing the troubled \npension system.\n  There is also in this bill something called the deficit reduction \ncontribution relief area which gives airlines and steel companies the \ntime they need to get their affairs in order after a unique and unusual \nperiod of pressure.\n  Further, there is reform in the area of the multiemployer pension \nsystem which will give relief to management and labor to get their \nagreements in order relative to collective bargaining in order to make \nsure those funds are solvent.\n  No one--Congress, employers, nor unions--is absolved of \nresponsibility under this amendment. By granting time, we do not \nreduce--that should be stressed--anyone's debts nor allow anyone to \navoid liability for debts they have voluntarily accepted.\n  What we do is provide the necessary breathing room so reforms and \nrepayments are made in a responsible and manageable fashion and not \nunder the threat of ``the sky is falling'' situations we confront \ntoday.\n  The amendment has essentially four elements, as I have outlined. \nFirst is reform of the 30-year Treasury note as being the vehicle by \nwhich we assess pension funding. Second is temporary relief for \nspecific single-employer pension plans from deficit reduction \ncontributions, such as airlines and steel. Third is a 2-year delay in \nthe amortization of recent investment losses experienced by \nmultiemployer pension plans and the imposition of significant \nimprovements in the disclosure of information requirements of those \nplans to their participants, which is critical.\n  Turning to the interest rate fix issue, this is the key issue for me. \nI have spoken about this a number of times on this floor. In fact, back \nin May I said: Now is the time to address this. I guess ``now'' has \nbecome now. But the fact is, we have today a system where 30-year \nTreasury bond rates are required in the current pension law for funding \npurposes.\n  We will replace that with a conservative rate pegged to the high-\nquality bond corporate basket. The reason for this is that 30-year \nbonds essentially do not exist anymore so we have an artificial rate \nunder which we were requiring companies and pension funds to be funded. \nThe practical effect of that was that the bond rate was artificially \nlow, which meant the return on these funds was artificially low and the \nfunding requirements became, unfortunately, in real terms, \nextraordinarily high and inconsistent with what a realistic rate would \nbe.\n  By shifting to a corporate basket of high yield corporate bonds, we \nwill correct this problem, significantly improve the viability of the \npension system, and allow the corporations, for a period of 2 years, to \nuse this temporary fix. It is a temporary fix.\n  Two years is a risk, I admit. Whether or not we can put in place the \nnecessary law changes and reach agreement between the various players \nthat are involved at the table, including the unions, corporations, and \nthe guaranteed fund is a question.\n  It is a short timeframe to resolve this issue. I would have preferred \nmore time so we could be sure we would reach an accommodation and a \ntimeframe that were realistic, but that is not what others wanted. It \nwas not what we were able to accomplish. As we all know, legislating is \nsometimes the art of compromise, and in this instance that was the \ncase.\n  So we have a 2-year hiatus using a basket of high yield corporate \nbonds as the new benchmark for funding. That will be positive relief, \nand it will mean, in practical terms, that funds which would have been \nartificially flowing into funding pension funds--and unnecessarily \nflowing into those funds as a result of having to use the low Treasury \nrate--will now be flowing into capital investment which translates \ndirectly into jobs. That is what this is about, protecting jobs and \nprotecting pensions.\n  The second area is the deficit reduction contribution relief \nfunction. The amendment grants 2 years of relief to the airline and \nsteel industries from mandatory deficit reduction contributions. Other \ncompanies may also apply to the Treasury Department for similar relief. \nCompanies getting relief must remain current on their pension \nobligations and cannot increase the benefits that they create under \ntheir pension funds during this period.\n  Airlines are the main focus of the deficit reduction contribution \nrelief. Airlines are the main focus because of\n\n[[Page S158]]\n\nthe unique stress these companies have suffered. In recent years, \nprofit pressures within the U.S. airline industry have been amplified \nby severe pricing competition, the recession, and, most importantly, by \nthe effects of terrorism and the war in Iraq. Severe acute respiratory \nsyndrome, SARS, also created pressure on the entire industry, \nespecially those flying overseas.\n  The industry is in transition. The public has been reluctant to \nreturn since September 11 to the level of travel we had before \nSeptember 11. Two airlines have already filed for bankruptcy \nprotection. Others may follow suit. It is our intention with this \namendment to ensure that pension rules are not the determining factor \nin selecting which airlines survive and which fail. We should not be \nkicking airlines over into bankruptcy on the issue of pensions. If that \nhappens, it should be a function of their operating activity in the \narea of competing for passengers.\n  The PBGC is also concerned about the steel industry, especially two \nspecific companies which have filed bankruptcy. Last year the agency \nabsorbed the largest pension plan in its history when it trusteed the \nBethlehem Steel plan. Only a few steel company pension plans still \nexist.\n  The DRC portion of the amendment gives these plans in this troubled \nindustry a chance to get their finances in order without the imminent \nthreat of a takeover by the PBGC. The DRC provisions are important \nsafeguards to the system and especially to the PBGC. Plans taking the \nrelief must pay 20 percent of their obligation in the first year and 40 \npercent of their obligation the second year or the plan's expected \ncurrent liability for the year, whichever is greater. This ensures that \nno plan will lose ground and become worse off than it was when we \nstarted this process. Plans that are funded at only 75 percent or less \nare also prohibited from increasing benefits during this 2-year \nmoratorium. There is strict accountability. Furthermore, there has been \ntalk of freezing the PBGC guarantee for these plans.\n  The multiple employer benefit plan relief is another area that this \nbill addresses. What the amendment does is allow plans to suspend \namortizing their experience losses for 2 years. Multis may amortize \nexperience losses over 15 years under current law. Multiemployer plans \nalso would be required, under the amendment, to send annual notices to \nall participants disclosing the funding status of the plan. This is an \nimportant reform. It will mean that we will have transparency in \nmultiemployer programs--something we don't have today--so employees can \nfind out the status of their plans. This reform will have a very \npositive impact.\n  Without this relief, many companies participating in multiemployer \nplans will face significant taxes and monetary penalties. This is an \nattempt to address that problem over the next 2-year period. It is done \nas a result of pressure which we are seeing within the industry to move \nout of these types of plans and, in fact, abandon the field of pensions \ncompletely in the area of defined benefits plans.\n  We understand that if we do not reform these plans and their funding \nmore substantively over the 2-year hiatus being granted to us, we will \nhave lost a huge opportunity to make available to employees effective \npension benefits.\n  Our goal is to make sure we don't arbitrarily force a number of \nemployers out of the pension area simply because we have an artificial \nrate at which they have to fund their plans; that we don't create an \natmosphere where, in the area of airlines and steel, we are essentially \nforcing these industries into bankruptcy because of their pension \nstructure but, at the same time, not create an atmosphere where we \nunduly undermine their commitment to their pension structure; thirdly, \nnot create an atmosphere where multiemployers basically abandon the \nfield of pension activity and we end up with many employees not having \nthe opportunity to participate in pensions.\n  That is our goal. Our basic goal is to assure that we have a viable \npension system for our employees and the option, as part of that viable \npension system, that we have a strong defined benefit element of the \nsystem. We know, regrettably, that as we came out of the period of the \nbubble of the 1990s, tremendous pressure was put on these different \npension plans because of their investment experience. It was not unique \nto pension plans. Many American citizens who invested in the 1990s \nfound the same problem. At the end of the 1990s, most of these plans \nwere extremely solvent and strong. Today they are weak. They need this \ntype of relief in order to get through this period.\n  We have been through this type of experience before. I point to the \nChrysler bailout process as an example of how the Government, through \nintelligent approaches toward companies that are in stress, could \nmaintain those industries and be sure that they work their way through \nthe process during the hard times and, as we move back into a strong \neconomy, have the opportunity to do the reform necessary to strengthen \nthose plans so they get them back up to speed.\n  This is a much more logical approach than the haphazard, sky-is-\nfalling approach of forcing the plans through reorganizations, through \ndramatic funding events that are artificially created through the \ninterest rates or by making the plans much less attractive because the \npension costs are so high. So I think the bill makes sense. There is \nconsensus on it and we should move forward with it.\n\n  Before I yield the floor, I thank the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee for his commitment to this effort and the strong work of his \nstaff in this area, and the cooperation which the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee has had on this effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in turn, I thank the Senator from New \nHampshire as the chairman of the committee dealing with some pension \nlegislation. I thank him for his cooperation. That cooperation has been \nover a long period of time, going back to at least a year when we \nstarted efforts to work together on pension legislation so we would \nhave a solid approach on the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, the replacement of the so-called ``30-year Treasury'' \ninterest rate has reached an emergency. This is the statutory rate used \nto value pension liabilities.\n  There is an inverse relationship between interest rates and pension \nliabilities: As interest rates go up, pension liabilities go down. \nConversely, as interest rates go down, pension liabilities go up. Small \nchanges in interest rates mean big differences in pension \ncontributions.\n  Current interest rates are at historic lows. Low interest rates have \ncaused pension plan liabilities to skyrocket. To make matters worse, \nthe recession that began in 2000 brought down stock values.\n  The combination of unusually low interest rates and the decline in \nstock values have combined to worsen the pension plan funding problem. \nJust when you think things can't get any worse, they do.\n  In October 2001, the U.S. Department of the Treasury discontinued the \n30-year Treasury bond. The 30-year bond is the statutory rate used by \npension plans to value their liabilities. While the Treasury Department \nstill calculates the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, the number is \nincreasingly ``soft.''\n  To help plans cope with high funding requirements, Congress adjusted \nthe rate to 120 percent of the 30-year Treasury shortly after the \nterrorist attack of September 2001. That adjustment was effective for \n2002 and 2003. Plans were depending on Congress to extend that relief \nbefore December 31, 2003. We missed our deadline.\n  At the end of the last session, we needed unanimous consent to pass \nan interest rate bill, but we did not have UC to proceed. The \nobjections were not over replacing the rate, they were over deficit \nreduction contribution, or ``DRC relief'' and over relief to \nmutliemployer plans.\n  Let me talk about DRC relief for a moment. There is an honest \ndifference of opinion in the Senate over whether or not to grant DRC \nrelief to underfunded pension plans.\n  The real answer to the question of whether underfunded plans should \nbe given DRC relief is: It depends.\n  If a company is otherwise healthy but in a cyclical industry, should \nthe\n\n[[Page S159]]\n\ncombination of the economic downturn and an arbitrary pension rule \nforce them into bankruptcy?\n  I respectfully suggest that DRC payments should not force an \notherwise healthy company into bankruptcy. Remember, the company could \nsurvive if the Government takes its thumb off the pension DRC scale for \na little while.\n  So what should Congress do?\n  The Senate Finance Committee decided that we should provide temporary \nrelief to overburden plans. The HELP Committee did not take action on \nthis issue.\n  Out of respect to the HELP Committee, we agreed to winnow back the \nrelief to qualifying airlines and steel firms, but to allow others to \napply to the Government for relief so long as they meet the \nqualification requirements. The bill provides only 2 years of limited \nDRC relief. Relief for 2004 is limited to 80 percent of the deficit \nreduction contribution.\n  In 2005, the DRC relief is further limited to only 60 percent of the \notherwise payable deficit reduction contribution.\n   Plans that were poorly funded in 2000 are not eligible for this \nrelief. We are concerned that for the healthy companies, the DRC \ncreates an artificial cash demand on companies. The DRC is well-\nintentioned, but it may be a flawed requirement.\n   We wish we had time now to simply reform the DRC. If we had \nanticipated the amount of time it has taken us to get to this point, we \nwould have reformed the DRC. As an alternative to reform, we are \nproviding short-term DRC relief to qualifying companies.\n   Now, let me turn to the multiemployer plans.\n   The same fiscal and financial conditions that have caused the \npension funding crisis among single-employer plans are working against \nthe multiemployer plans.\n   Since we have already given 2 years of relief to single-employer \nplans (in 2002 and 2003), it is only fair that we now provide some \nrelief to the multiemployer plans.\n   This amendment gives multiemployer plans an extra couple of years to \namortize their experience losses. If we don't give them relief, excise \ntaxes will cascade down the employers who contribute to the plan. The \nexcise taxes and penalties will hurt the employers--not the unions. The \nexcise taxes start at 5 percent, but they quickly increase to 100 \npercent.\n   These taxes do not help fund the pension plan. They just enrich the \nFederal Government.\n   The reason that this relief is a little different from the single-\nemployer language is that the multiemployer plans are structured very \ndifferently than a single-employer plan.\n   A multiemployer plan consists of tens, or hundreds, or a thousand \nemployers contributing to the same fund. Each employer may have a \nslightly different arrangement for its work force. With all those \nemployers and all the potential differences in the individual \narrangements, the plan cannot change overnight.\n   The language that we are bringing to the floor gives the \nmultiemployer plans a little extra time to rearrange their \ncontributions and benefits before these excise taxes would take effect. \nIt gives the plans time to go back to the bargaining table and \nrenegotiate.\n   This package has been drafted to give temporary funding relief to \nboth single-employer and multiemployer defined benefit pension plans.\n   Currently these plans are straining to pay their contributions. \nRelief is limited in duration. It will expire at the end of 2005.\n   Our objective is always to balance the requirement that \nparticipants' benefits be funded and guaranteed, but to do so without \ndriving otherwise healthy employers into insolvency.\n   Pension funding rules need to be revised. We know that. While we \nwork toward that goal, however, this proposal will lessen the burden \nthat usually low interest rates place on plan funding.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the members \nof the Finance Committee, and in particular for Senator Max Baucus, and \nfor members of our committee. I think now of our good friend and good \nally to the chairman of the committee and to the other members of the \nFinance Committee who have been working on this legislation for a \nsignificant period of time.\n  Most of us remember the mishap that happened to Senator Baucus some \ntime ago, during an event that very few, if any, of us would \nparticipate in--a 50-mile road race. During that race, he slipped and \nhad a small accident, or so he thought at the time, but still continued \nthe race. Then, because of complications that took place a number of \nweeks after the mishap, additional treatment and care was necessary. So \nhe is not present with us today.\n  Senator Baucus wanted the Senate to move ahead on this legislation, \nwhich is typical of Senator Baucus. He encouraged us to go ahead and he \ntold the leadership on our side and on the other side, that he wants \nthe Senate to work its will on this legislation because it is \nenormously important.\n  All of us are very mindful today that Senator Max Baucus has been \nfacing a challenge in terms of recovery. He is doing well. He is \ngetting better. He will soon be back with all of us.\n  I certainly thank him--and I think I speak for all of us on our \nside--for all the good work he has done in terms of the development of \nthis legislation. His work has been indispensable and extremely \nimportant.\n  I also thank the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Grassley, \nand the chairman of the HELP Committee, Senator Gregg, for their work \non this legislation. This legislation has an enormous impact on workers \nin this country, and it has an incredible impact on small businesses \nand other businesses in this country that are trying to be responsible \nand do the right thing.\n  All of us understand that retirement income is dependent on a three-\nlegged stool comprised of Social Security, personal savings, and a \npension. Those are the three elements which men and women, who have \nworked hard and played by the rules, look to in terms of their future \nand of their golden years. That is why it is so important that we \npreserve Social Security.\n  We are all mindful of what has happened in recent times in terms of \npersonal savings, where savings have been reduced as a result of a lot \nof different factors and forces. The market has been off. And although \nit has come back to some extent in the last few weeks, overall there \nhas been a loss among many of those who had 401(k)s.\n  Then there is the serious challenge to the whole pension system. It \nis indispensable that we find common ground and work to deal with this \nissue which is of such incredible importance. The fact we have been \nable to work on both sides of the aisle on this extremely important \nlegislation is, I think, enormously significant.\n  The chairman of the Finance Committee and I have enjoyed working with \nmy colleague and friend from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg. We haven't \ncosponsored or worked together all that many times, but I always enjoy \nit when we do, and even when we differ, I enjoy that as well.\n  I can't underscore enough the importance of this legislation, and we \nare extremely hopeful that the kind of agreement we have had so far \nwill continue to be the basis of the legislation as it moves forward.\n  Defined benefit pension plans are, as I mentioned, a key part of \nretirement security for millions of Americans. They promise a monthly \nbenefit starting at retirement and continuing for the rest of your \nlife. Defined benefit plans are different from defined contribution \nplans and all the other pension plans. Only a defined benefit plan \nprovides benefits backed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.\n  Americans in every industry benefit from these plans. Nearly 35 \nmillion workers and retirees are covered by single employer plans, and \n9.7 million more are covered by the multiemployer plans. One in every \nfive workers participates in a defined benefit plan.\n  But today the secure retirement of these workers is at risk. As we \nhave heard from many experts, a ``perfect storm'' is overtaking defined \nbenefit plans. The longest downturn in the stock market since the Great \nDepression, combined with a troubled economy, and historically low \ninterest rates have led to the underfunding of many of these pension \nplans, and the storm threatens to wreck the pension dreams of millions \nof Americans.\n\n[[Page S160]]\n\n  This amendment that Senator Baucus, Senator Grassley, Senator Gregg, \nand I are offering will provide immediate short-term measures needed to \ndeal with this temporary crisis.\n  The amendment has the broad support of Democrats and Republicans, \nemployers and unions. Despite our differences, all of us agree that \nemployees deserve to receive the benefits promised by their pension \nplans. To protect the security of their retirement, we need a solution, \nand we need it quickly.\n  Our amendment takes three steps to help defined benefit pension \nplans. First, it temporarily replaces the 30-year Treasury bond rate \nused to calculate employers' contributions to pension plans with a \ncorporate bond rate.\n  As the interest rate on 30-year Treasury bonds has fallen, the \ndecline has created huge uncertainties for pension plans. As many as 20 \npercent of defined benefit pension plans are at risk of being \nterminated or frozen. Temporarily replacing the 30-year Treasury bond \nrate will stabilize these plans and enable them to continue to provide \nthe benefits they have promised.\n  Second, our bill provides for additional deficit reduction \ncontribution relief.\n  Although the Bush administration keeps speaking of an economic \nrecovery, the recent economic growth has not translated into job \nsecurity for Americans--indeed, only 1,000 jobs were created in \nDecember. Many sectors, such as the airline and steel industries, \ncontinue to struggle.\n  The men and women in the airline industry are well aware of the \nthreat to their jobs. Over 100,000 airline workers have lost their jobs \nin the last 2 years, and thousands more are accepting cuts in pay and \nbenefits to preserve their jobs. These workers have done their part to \nkeep the skies safe and keep their companies flying and they need our \nhelp to protect their jobs and pensions.\n  The steel industry is also struggling to find new ways to increase \nefficiency and compete in the world market. But the industry continues \nto face serious challenges, and relief is essential.\n  The deficit reduction contribution relief in our amendment would \nprovide relief from these payments to companies that had well-funded \npension plans in the past and need extra assistance now. These are \ncompanies that have met their responsibility and through the confluence \nof events are today challenged. This helps provide temporary relief.\n  This relief is needed to help protect the pensions and jobs of \nworkers in these industries. These are industries that can come back--\nand must come back--to help drive our economic recovery.\n  Our amendment also includes important relief for the multiemployer \nplans, which fill major needs in our pension system by providing \npensions to many low-wage workers, as well to short-term and seasonal \nworkers who might not otherwise be able to earn a pension.\n  Forty percent of these workers are in construction, building homes \nand offices. They worked around the clock at the World Trade Center \nsite after the tragedy of September 11. Because many construction jobs \nare short term, these workers rely on multiemployer plans to guarantee \ntheir retirement.\n  Thirty percent of these workers are in retail or service industries. \nThey clean hotel rooms and corporate offices. They bag groceries and \nserve food in restaurants. They do not have golden parachutes or \nexecutive stock options. Without a multiemployer plan, many of them \nwould have no pension at all.\n  Ten percent are in the trucking services, traveling across the \ncountry at all hours of the day and night to deliver goods safely to \nstores, factories, and homes. A multiemployer plan helps them reach \ntheir retirement destination safely, too.\n  Multiemployer pension plans also help employees of small businesses. \nOnly 8 percent of companies with fewer than 100 employees offer a \ndefined benefit pension plan. Many small businesses find it most \naffordable to provide such benefits through a multiemployer plan. As \none pension expert testified before the House, multiemployer plans \n``provide literally tens of thousands of small employers with the \nopportunity to provide competitive and comprehensive benefit plans to \ntheir employees . . . which would otherwise be too expensive and \nadministratively complex for them to provide on their own.'' The larger \ncompanies can provide the self-insurance, so to speak, for the pension \nplans. The smaller ones have to be involved in these multiemployer \nplans that include a variety of different companies.\n  Like single-employer plans, the multiemployer plans have been \ndevastated by the stock market. Because of these losses, the plans are \nin trouble. The modest relief in our amendment will provide both \ncompanies and workers with more time to negotiate contracts to meet the \nsoaring funding needs.\n  These three bipartisan steps provide a vital temporary solution to \nthe problems faced by the Nation's pension plans. Once these problems \nhave passed, more must be done to preserve and expand the defined \nbenefit system that means so much to so many employees today. Our \namendment provides 2 years of relief enough to allow us to begin.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to join in providing this much-needed protection \nto the millions of hard-working Americans who have worked for and \nearned a secure retirement.\n  To review the highlights of this legislation one further time, there \nare 35 million Americans who are covered by the single-employer defined \nbenefit pension plans. This gives some idea of the importance. There \nare 9.7 million, effectively 10 million, more who are covered by \nmultiemployer defined benefit pension plans. This is effectively 45 \nmillion employees who are going to be affected, and obviously thousands \nof employers. Only defined benefit plans provide a secure monthly \nbenefit backed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.\n  What are the factors? Why is this legislation necessary? Why is it \nneeded? I mentioned in my other comments about the ``perfect storm,'' \nthe series of events which have taken place. These are the factors \nwhich have impacted these pension programs in an adverse way.\n  First, the prolonged downturn of the stock market during this \nadministration, the longest since the Great Depression; extremely low \n30-year Treasury bond interest rates. Bond interest rates have been \nlow. That has had some positive impact, obviously, in terms of the \nrefinancing of automobiles and homes, which has been extraordinarily \nimportant, but adverse in terms of these pension programs. The weak \neconomic conditions mean the companies cannot afford to make the \nadditional payments and pay excise taxes imposed by our pension laws. \nBecause of the economic pressures, the companies are hard pressed to \nmeet their responsibilities. They have been responsible in trying to \nset up these pension plans. They want to provide for their workers. \nThey want to do the right thing. This helps them, at least in a \ntemporary way, to deal with those issues.\n  Those are basically the reasons why this legislation is necessary. \nThis is a temporary program, but it affects almost 45 million of our \nfellow Americans.\n  I want to mention one other factor, and that is that multiemployer \nplans provide literally tens of thousands of small employers with the \nopportunity to provide competitive, comprehensive benefit plans to \ntheir employees, which otherwise would be too expensive and \nadministratively complex for them to provide on their own.\n  This really helps the small businesses in a very important way. I \nwill give some idea to our colleagues about the people who are affected \nby this action. Multiemployer plans provide pensions to low-wage \nworkers, and workers in seasonal or short-term employment. They provide \npension plans for workers in many industries. 38 percent are in the \nconstruction industry, clearly the largest industry. Truck \ntransportation is 9.8 percent; services, 15 percent; retail trade, 14.5 \npercent; 15.2 percent of all of those workers are in manufacturing. I \nthink all of us understand the challenge this Nation is facing in \nretaining manufacturing jobs in America. This is enormously important \nin helping preserve it. There are a lot of different elements in terms \nof what we are going to have to do to preserve manufacturing jobs, but \nthis is vital.\n\n  This chart gives the idea. It is manufacturing, it is retail and \nservice, it is transportation, again, it is construction. For \nindividuals who are moving\n\n[[Page S161]]\n\nfrom project to project, by the nature and definition of the \nconstruction industry, they absolutely need the multiemployer plans. \nThey work. They have been successful. But they are hard pressed, as I \nmentioned.\n  This is a balanced program. It is a temporary program. It has the \nbroad support of employers, large and small. It has the support of \nworkers from large companies and large unions to small companies and \nindividual workers. It responds to a very important and significant \nissue, which is, I think, at the heart of the American dream, and that \nis how we are going to view retirement. The Greeks used to define a \ngreat civilization by how it cared for its senior citizens. These are \nthe men and women who have sacrificed, the ones who helped bring this \nNation out of recession, who fought in the various wars in which we \nhave been involved and, most important, they have sacrificed for their \nchildren. They have sacrificed for their children's educations or for \nwhatever challenges they had.\n  But they have been working hard, over a lifetime. They have been \nprudent and they have saved. Now, at the time when they are getting \nclose to retirement, because of forces and factors far beyond their \ncontrol--that retirement is threatened in a very significant and \nimportant way.\n  This legislation makes sense. It has broad support. I am hopeful we \ncan pass it. It is necessary and it is important.\n  I commend our leader, Senator Frist, for scheduling this as an early \npriority in this session. I think it is a matter of enormous importance \nand consequence, and it is a great priority. I commend the leaders for \ngiving the Senate the opportunity to take action on it.\n  Mr. President, I yield.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to follow on what Senator Kennedy \nsaid in his opening remarks about this bill being here through a great \ndeal of cooperation between two committees, and Republicans and \nDemocrats within those committees. It also gives me an opportunity to \nthank Senator Baucus because I always have a very close working \nrelationship with him on our Finance Committee. This is a result of \nthat cooperation. But, as I previously said, and it has been alluded to \nby Senator Kennedy and Senator Gregg, this is an issue where two \ncommittees, the Finance Committee and the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee share jurisdiction. So we have had a remarkable \ncooperation between the two committees, and that includes Senator \nKennedy's cooperation to get this bill out and hopefully not only get \nit to the floor but that this sort of cooperation helps us expedite \nthis bill.\n  This is a very important piece of legislation and is needed by a lot \nof segments of the economy in order to keep companies viable.\n  In addition, I hope we will be able to have Senator Baucus back with \nus quickly. Originally when he left the hospital we heard it might be 2 \nweeks' recovery. I hope that is coming along OK and he should be back \nhere with us very shortly.\n  Mr. President, I will suggest the calling of a quorum.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will withhold, we understand the leaders \nhave set this time now for debate. We are here and ready for debate and \ndiscussion. This is enormously important. The leaders wanted us to try \nto consider the concerns of the Members on both sides of the aisle \ntoday. We are going to be at our posts, Senator Grassley and myself, \ntoday and also on Monday.\n  I think it was the leader's desire to stack the votes for Monday \nafternoon. It is now Thursday afternoon, quarter of 2. We are here and \nready for action. We know some Members have spoken with us about their \nconcerns about different provisions. We are ready to deal with those \nissues, or at least be able to debate them and make sure that our \ncolleagues are going to be fully informed about them by the time we \nvote.\n  I certainly hope those who do have amendments would come over here \nand present them so we might be able to consider them, work on them \nthrough the afternoon or through the evening, and make as much progress \nas we can. I hope we are not going to be left for these to come in at a \nlater period. We are prepared to consider these issues at the earliest \npossible time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, the unanimous consent provision does allow for \namendments, an equal number on both sides. We hope the people who are \ninterested in following that rule will come over. I have been told \nthere is at least one Member on my side of the aisle who should be here \nshortly to offer an amendment. I urge that to happen.\n  Obviously, we will be glad to have debate and accommodate everybody \nin any way we can.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation? I wish \nto speak on the pending legislative issue, the pension bill. Is the \nfloor open for comments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise in support of this legislation. I \ncommend the Senators who have been involved in working out most of the \ndisagreements, including Senators Grassley, Baucus, Gregg, Kennedy, \nand, of course, our leaders, Senator Frist and Senator Daschle, who \nhave all been involved in working through the difficulties of this \nlegislation.\n  Quite frankly, this is complicated and difficult legislation to \nunderstand. A lot of times, people start referring to issues by \nacronyms such as COLA or DRC. If you are not really involved in the \nintricacies of pension issues and, particularly, this area of deficit \nreduction contribution, you can get lost in the details. You can even \nbe misled as to what the reason for it is and what the impact will be.\n  I have followed this issue because I am a member of the Finance \nCommittee, which has jurisdiction in the area of pension plan \ncontributions, and also as chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee of the \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. I do believe the \nairline industry is in a difficult situation now, but I think they are \na critical part of America's economy and our transportation system. \nThere is no question that they have been greatly impacted by fuel \ncosts, the events of 9/11, and even, temporarily at least, by the war \nin Iraq. They have been struggling to deal with those issues. They also \nhave had mistakes in their past, in management decisions. Some of the \ncontracts they have with labor put real pressure on them in terms of \nbeing able to make enough money to pay all the costs of delivering this \nservice. Regardless of that, I think it is hugely important for America \nthat we have a viable and available airline industry.\n  We have been doing things to try to help them. Right after 9/11, we \npassed major airline relief, leading up to the war in Iraq. In the \naftermath of 9/11, we provided direct assistance to the airlines. Late \nlast year, we passed the Federal Aviation Administration \nreauthorization, a significant multiyear legislation that was hard to \nget through, but we got it done. It was supported by management and \nlabor and the administration in the end. That gives some certainty \nabout what the administration will be doing, what they can do. We \nopened up some areas that needed some changes. This area is also very \nimportant to the survival of some of our airlines.\n  Some will argue that it gives the major airlines an advantage over \nthe smaller airlines. I certainly am not in a position to want to do \nthat. I want all of our airlines to be able to meet the \nresponsibilities and commitments of their pension plans but also to be \nable to stay in business and provide service. We need the shorter \nroutes, the ones that fly from point to point, and the hub airlines. I \nwant a healthy airline industry. This is one step in that process.\n  Some people will attack this legislation and say the airlines brought \nit on themselves. Sure, they have made mistakes, but a lot of things \nthey are being hit with cannot be put at their doorstep as being their \nfault. They\n\n[[Page S162]]\n\ndidn't cause 9/11. They have not been responsible for the increasing \nand up and down prices of fuel. A number of factors that have played \ninto their economic situation they cannot be blamed for. They have \ncertainly made mistakes, but this is not something they brought on. \nThis is a requirement in the law that we put on them. This is a part of \nthe PBGC legislation, where they have to pay into the pensions, and we \ncapped how much they could pay in.\n  A few years ago, in 2000, the airlines were committed and paying, I \nthink, 100 percent of what was needed. But in the last year or two, \nthey have fallen under severe pressure, and, as a result of the quirks \nin the law, they now would have to pay an accelerated penalty, even \nmore money, because of the 30-year Treasury bond calculation process to \ndetermine how much they paid in. That has come to a conclusion. They \nhave to go to a new system.\n  My point is that I think this DRC relief is the right thing to do. It \nis a temporary 2-year deal. They are not absolved of all of their \nresponsibilities. It is an 80-60 percent--80 percent relief in the \nfirst year, 60 percent in the second year, and only plans that were not \nsubject to the deficit reduction contribution relief in 2000 would be \neligible for this relief.\n  The plans would not be able to increase benefits if they were 75 \npercent funded or less. An application process would allow companies \nthat are not in those industries to request DRC relief if they were not \nsubject to the DRC in 2000.\n  This is a temporary modification to provide relief to allow airlines \nto work through the difficulties they are having now. I believe this \nrelief will enable them to move forward and fulfill their commitments \nin the future.\n  It is not going to bring in all of the plans. It is targeted at \nairlines and steel only, and I understand only a couple of steel \ncompanies would be affected by this.\n  This legislation is bipartisan. Democrats and Republicans have been \nworking to try to address some of the concerns and deal with the \nrecognition that interest rates have contributed to this problem, stock \nmarket declines have contributed to this problem, and what would we do \nto be of assistance to the airlines. But it also makes sure the PBGC is \nnot left holding the bag. I think we have come up with the right \nsolution.\n  Some people will argue the DRC relief will actually worsen the \nfinancial standing of the PBGC. I am concerned about the financial \nstability of the PBGC, but I think this temporary, limited relief will \nactually be in its best interest. If we do not do this, some of these \nairlines will go into bankruptcy and PBGC will have an even more \ndifficult situation on their hands. If these companies wind up taking \nchapter 11, then the pension fund is going to have a problem.\n  The point might be made: Let's wait for the bigger pension reform \nbill. I know Chairman Grassley and others want to have broad pension \nreform. We need to do that. But we are not going to be able to do it in \nthe next month or two, and I don't even think we are going to be able \nto get it done this year. We need to do it. We ought to do it. This \nproblem is imminent. If we don't act by April 1, these airlines and \nsteel companies are going to have to pay at the accelerated rate, which \nthey are not going to be able to do. So it is timely. We have to act \nnow because in a very short period of time, the roof will come falling \nin on these companies.\n  I understand there may be a couple of amendments. I appreciate the \nfact that Members did work with me on a provision I had concerning \nmultiemployer withdrawal liability. We worked on compromise language \nthat is in the legislation which I think is acceptable. Many of the \nquestions that were raised by the chairman of the Budget Committee and \nby Senator Kyl of Arizona have been addressed. I understand they may \nhave an amendment or two. We ought to debate those amendments and have \na vote. But then I hope my colleagues will allow this legislation to \nmove forward, go on to conference, and let's get it done in a timely \nfashion. It is in the best interest of the airline industry and, I \nbelieve, the PBGC, and the American taxpayer.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, is time controlled?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is not.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Is the distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts a manager of \nthe bill?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. We have had a good discussion by \nthose who are the principal sponsors, and we are awaiting, hopefully, \nthose who would like to amend the bill, but they have not indicated \nthey are on their way just yet, so we have some time. If the Senator \nwould like to speak, we obviously would like to accommodate him in any \nway.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator. I always \nlike to be on God's side, and then I like to be on Senator Kennedy's \nside. If there is a choice between the two, why, I think I will pass \nfor the moment.\n  Mr. President, it is not hyperbole to suggest that the sky is falling \nfor too many American workers. You could also say that the ship is \nsinking. You could say that the mine wall is collapsing, that the dam \nis giving way, or use any number of metaphors for a looming disaster to \ndescribe the current state of America's private pension system.\n  The entire system is wobbling under assaults from every direction. On \nthe one side, the stock market plunge has left the pensions for over 44 \nmillion workers underfunded by an estimated $350 billion. Last year, \nthe Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation had to assume the pension \nobligations for scores of bankrupt companies, ranging from airlines to \nsteelmakers, pushing the PBGC's balance sheet into the red by an \nalarming $11.2 billion.\n  On the other side, the assault is coming from historically low \ninterest rates that have triggered painful new funding requirements for \nemployers. Even companies that want to provide for their employees find \nthemselves unable to compete in a global marketplace against \ncompetitors unencumbered by the legacy costs of pension and health care \nbenefits.\n  U.S. employers are warning they will be forced to freeze their \npension plans or terminate them unless the Congress provides them with \nrelief from their pension obligations. Yet, with $350 billion in \nunderfunded pensions and a growing deficit, the Federal pension insurer \nis warning that unless those pension obligations are funded, a massive \ntaxpayer bailout, akin to the 1980s savings and loan crisis, is just \nover the horizon.\n  At a time when working families are looking for assurances that their \npensions will be protected and their retirement will be secure, the \nCongress is offering neither assurances nor security. This legislation \nprovides funding relief to employers, but it does little to ensure that \nthe pension benefits promised to workers will be there when they \nretire.\n  While this short-term patch may be necessary to keep the ship afloat \nfor a while longer, it does not change the fact that the ship is \nsinking, and the Congress has not yet readied the lifeboats.\n  The Congress is telling workers that once the needs of business have \nbeen addressed, then it can act to ensure their pensions are fully \nfunded. The Congress is wagering that the pension system will stay \nafloat that long. It is a theme I have noticed repeatedly during the \ntenure of this administration. While the top of the economic pyramid \nreceives immediate relief, the hard-working middle class is given only \nvague promises, uncertain promises of uncertain relief and delayed \nbenefits. I have seen it over and over and over. The corporate elite \nreceives immediate tax cuts, while America's working-class families, \nthe people who work with their hands, the people who get their hands \ndirty, the people who are soiled in grime when it is time to go home \nand have supper, are told to wait, wait for the economy to survive.\n  The pharmaceutical industry receives billions of dollars in taxpayer \nsubsidies while middle-class families wait endlessly for lower drug \nprices.\n  Corporate profits continue to increase while middle-class families \nwait for those profits to trickle down to them. In asking middle-class \nAmericans to wait for the economy to improve, wait for health care \ncosts to go down, wait for their wages to rise, it confirms that this \nadministration of\n\n[[Page S163]]\n\ncorporate CEOs and Texas oilmen do not have the slightest comprehension \nof the plight of American workers, the people who work with their \nhands, who get their hands dirty, who get their fingernails dirty, \nwhose shirt sleeves are dirty. They are the American worker.\n  It is a grim, bleak time for working Americans. Two and a half \nmillion jobs have disappeared under this administration's economic \nstewardship. Most of them are in our once powerful manufacturing \nsector, which has lost jobs for 41 consecutive months. Just come to \nWest Virginia and see what has happened. The glass plants have gone. \nThe pottery works have gone. The steel mills, to a large degree, have \ngone. The coal industry, which used to employ 125,000 men when I first \ncame to Congress, today employs perhaps 15,000, 16,000, 18,000 workers \nwho mine just as much coal as in the days when there were 125,000 men \nworking in the mines.\n  Yes, 1 million jobs have been lost. Where have they gone? They have \ngone overseas. Eight million workers are unemployed, without hope for \ntomorrow, listening to their children, listening to their spouses, \nsaying: Where will we go? What will we do? What will happen to us?\n  Eight million workers are unemployed. Half a million discouraged \nworkers have dropped out of the labor pool saying there is no hope; \nhope is gone; the hope to which I held for these many days, these many \nweeks, these many months is gone. Three and a half million workers are \ncollecting unemployment benefits, with an average 350,000 workers \nsigning up for benefits each week. At the same time, 80,000 jobless \nworkers are exhausting their unemployment benefits each week, forcing \nthem to cut back on health care, forcing them to cut back on food \npurchases. Workers are losing their health insurance. Two and a half \nmillion more people joined the ranks of the uninsured last year, the \nlargest single increase in a decade. Think of that.\n  Put yourself in the shoes of these who go to bed hungry, who go to \nbed with heavy burdens, the burdens of forlorn hopes. With health care \ncosts spiraling out of control, 44 million people must do without \nhealth insurance. Retired workers are forced to do without lifesaving \ndrugs, without digoxin, without Coumadin, without Singulair. For those \nworkers with health insurance, the out-of-pocket costs are soaring, \nmore than doubling for employees of large companies since 1998. Costs \nare up sharply and going up more, too, for workers who pay monthly \npremiums but rarely see a doctor. Worker pensions are in danger, with \nthe Federal pension insurer taking over 122 plans last year, slashing \nthe pension benefit promised to over 200,000 workers. Two million \nadditional Americans fell into poverty in 2002.\n  Yes, we can afford to rebuild the oil pipeline, the oil wells in \nIraq. Yes, we can afford to rebuild the infrastructure in Iraq. What \nabout our own people? What about our own workers, who with their sweat \nand their toil have built this country and made it the wonder of the \nworld? Not coincidentally, almost 2 million workers earn wages at the \nstatutory minimum, $5.15 per hour. These are real people. It may be \nhard to comprehend that there are people who are working for that \nminimum wage, and that that minimum wage is the only thing that stands \nbetween them and their children and starvation. These are real people. \nThese are real stories about working people in this land of the free, \nthis home of the brave. These people earn their wages at the statutory \nminimum of $5.15 per hour. Think of it. Their wages are eroded every \nyear by inflation, with the real value of the minimum wage dropping. \nWhile the wealthiest taxpayers receive tens of thousands of dollars in \ntax cuts, the administration denies a meager $1.50 per hour raise to \nour most impoverished workers. These administration people who oppose \nan increase in the minimum wage come from the other side of the tracks.\n\n  To quote President Franklin Roosevelt, the test of our progress is \nnot whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much, it is \nwhether we provide enough for those who have too little.\n  After three colossal tax cuts, this administration has denied much to \nthose who have little in order to provide more to those who have much. \nThe American worker--have you ever been a worker? The American worker \nhas once again become the forgotten man. While the administration is \noffering only vague promises of hope, the American workforce is forced \nto endure the most hostile assault in decades. The Bush administration \nhas tried to repeal the 40-hour workweek and strip workers of their \nright to overtime pay. Think of that. It has attacked the civil service \nsystem. It has repealed the safety rules necessary for the protection \nof America's workers. It has neglected their health and safety in the \nworkplace. Now the administration is blocking an increase in the \nFederal minimum wage.\n  It is blocking efforts to provide unemployment benefits to jobless \nworkers. It is trying to push through a rule to strip 8 million workers \nof their hard-earned overtime pay. And it does so always with the \npromise that these benefits for businesses and the corporate elite will \none day trickle down to the middle class. This is not the record of an \nadministration that understands the needs of working families.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator be good enough to yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I commend my friend from West Virginia on speaking of \nthe forgotten man, the worker of this country, because he has just \nlisted the series of actions which threaten the well-being and the \nlivelihood of millions of families. As he says these words, I think it \nis important that our colleagues and the American people understand \ntheir significance.\n  He mentions, for example, the failure to act on the minimum wage. It \nhas been 7 years since we have acted on an increase in the minimum \nwage--7 years. The purchasing power of the minimum wage now is just \nabout as low as it has ever been. The minimum wage, as it is defined, \nis for people who work hard, who play by the rules. This is an issue \nwhich affects women because the majority of recipients of the minimum \nwage are women. It affects their children because many of the women \nhave children. So it is a children's issue. It is a family issue. It is \na civil rights issue because many of those who receive the minimum wage \nare men and women of color. It is a fairness issue because if you work \nhard and play by the rules, 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year, in \nthe country that has the strongest economy in the world, that is the \nUnited States of America, you should not have to live in poverty.\n  We have been blocked, as the Senator remembers, by our friends on the \nother side from even having a vote. We have a majority in this body who \nsupport an increase, but we are blocked.\n  The Senator speaks about unemployment compensation. The Senator well \nknows there are 90,000 workers a week who are losing their unemployment \ncompensation. Our friends on the Republican side, have blocked even a \ntemporary extension on it--90,000 a week.\n  Overtime? Eight million. I discussed this earlier today. I am not \nsure whether the Senator is familiar, I am not sure how many Americans \nare familiar, with the definition of professionalism in the Labor \nDepartment's proposed regulation, which will make American workers \nineligible for overtime. This definition will include training received \nin the Armed Forces of this country. There are 200 different training \nprograms that men and women receive in the Armed Forces. They go for \nthis training, they serve in Iraq with the finest military in the \nworld, and then they come back, and are hired here, and under the Bush \nproposal on overtime, can be denied overtime pay because they have \nreceived training in the military.\n  Can someone possibly tell us why? Why would the administration \ninclude training programs in the military? An important incentive for \nmany young people to join the military is to get the education and \ntraining. I see my friend from Tennessee, who served as a Secretary of \nEducation. He knows the value of education and training. Here we find \nthe training which veterans of our military have received while serving \nour country will make them ineligible for overtime pay. This proposed \nrule would also deny overtime, to firefighters, police officers, and \nnurses.\n\n[[Page S164]]\n\n  The Senator, when he speaks about the forgotten man, speaks wisely \nabout his people in West Virginia, but he speaks for all those workers \nin my State, too, and I daresay for workers around this country. He \nmentions these words, these words that have real meaning: before \neliminating overtime pay, consider the family that is struggling to pay \nthe mortgage, feed their family, clothe their family--people who are \nworking hard.\n  The final point I want to mention to the Senator, although I know he \nknows this already, is that this proposed regulation works against \nwomen. Many of the professions which will be denied overtime pay are \nprofessions dominated by women, wives, mothers, working hard, trying to \nprovide for their families, playing by the rules.\n\n  There are many things wrong with our economy. But maybe the good \nSenator from West Virginia can tell me, of all the things that are \nwrong with our economy, why is it that singling out these working \nfamilies for a reduction in pay is so important? I just cannot \nunderstand it. The Senator was here when we voted in this body against \nthe administration's proposal. The House of Representatives voted \nagainst it. Then in the middle of the night the provision preserving \novertime pay was stripped out of the omnibus bill. I know that is an \nenormous concern to many families.\n  I just want to know whether the Senator doesn't believe we ought to \nbe addressing issues in this Congress that are necessary to protect the \ninterests of the working people. Does he join in the challenge this \npresents? Does he join me in saying to those workers who are listening \nto the Senator from West Virginia, we are not going to let them down, \nwe are going to battle on these issues on the days ahead?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the very able Senator from Massachusetts, \nMr. Kennedy, has led this fight to increase the minimum wage time and \ntime and time again. I admire him for it.\n  Yes, this administration has joined in the maiming and the raping of \nthe Constitution and the rules of the Senate and in doing as it did \nwith respect to the items that were changed in conference, the items \nthat were added in conference, the items that passed each of the two \nHouses and were deleted in conference. What a shame. What a disgrace. I \nhave been a Member of Congress 51 years, going into 52 years, and I \nhave never seen such a disgraceful act as that which was done while \nyou, the American working people out there, were asleep--were asleep. \nThese changes were being made behind closed doors. The minority was not \npresent.\n  What would John Taber, the Republican chairman of the House \nAppropriations Committee when I came to the House--what would he think \nof this underhanded method of operating? What would Joe Martin, Speaker \nof the House of Representatives from Massachusetts in that day--what \nwould he think? The Republicans of that day would not have stood for \nit. They believed in the American system. They believed in the \nConstitution. This is a disgrace. It is a shame, the way this Congress \nhas acted, the way the Republican leadership in both Houses, and the \nWhite House, has acted in dealing with the taxpayers' money, the \nworking people, the common people.\n  You know, I say to the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, I \ncame into this world and was an orphan after 1 year.\n  I grew up in a coal miner's home. I married a coal miner's daughter. \nSome leaders of this administration ought to know what it is to have to \nbuy a stick of pepperoni, a piece of longhorn cheese and a box of \ncrackers, sit down on railroad rails and eat that humble fare, and what \nis left put into a paper bag to eat the next morning for breakfast. \nThis crowd down here in the White House doesn't know what it is. They \ncome from the other side of the tracks. They do not know what it is to \nget their hands dirty working long hours at night, working to scratch \nout a living for their spouses and their children. They do not know \nwhat it is to walk into a coal miner's home and go to the cupboard and \nlook and see what that family has left to eat. No. They grew up in the \ncorporate boardrooms of this country. They do not know what it is.\n  When God turned man out of the Garden of Eden and told him to earn \nhis bread by the sweat of his brow, that has been the lot of the \nworkingman. Then to see that workingman further trampled by the \npolicies and programs of this thoughtless administration is a story in \nitself.\n  This is not the record of an administration that understands the \nneeds of working families. American workers are sinking on the Titanic \nand this administration can only promise workers to send back the \nlifeboats once the first-class passengers have been taken to safety.\n  I recall the great Titanic. It went down I believe on April 15, 1912. \nI believe 1,517 passengers and workers on that great Titanic went to \ntheir deaths in the depths of the deep blue ocean. Now this \nadministration promises workers to send back the lifeboats, but only \nafter the first-class passengers have been taken to safety.\n  Americans would have to look back to the Hoover administration during \nthe nadir of the Great Depression to find an administration that has \ntreated workers more shabbily. I grew up in that Hoover administration. \nThe first 20 years I was in politics, I campaigned against the Hoover \nadministration. It was gone but not forgotten. I have seen those window \nshades, those boarded-up windows on the store buildings and business \nplaces and homes of people in southern West Virginia. They were called \n``Hoover window shades.''\n  In 1932, Presidential candidate Franklin Roosevelt blasted the Hoover \nadministration and blasted the Republican-controlled Congress for \nignoring the plight of American workers, workers who Roosevelt claimed \nhad become the ``forgotten man'' under the Hoover administration's top-\ndown economic policies.\n  I am glad I lived in the Great Depression. I am sorry we had to have \none, but since we had one, I am glad I lived in the Great Depression. I \nam glad that there are a few people still alive in this country who \nremember the Great Depression.\n  The ``present condition of our Nation's affairs is too serious to be \nviewed through partisan eyes for partisan purposes,'' the future \nPresident Franklin Delano Roosevelt charged. ``These unhappy times call \nfor the building of plans that rest upon the forgotten, the unorganized \nbut the indispensable units of economic power, for plans . . . that \nbuild from the bottom up and not from the top down, that put their \nfaith once more in the forgotten man at the bottom of the economic \npyramid.'' The forgotten man.\n  I urge Senators to heed those words and to offer workers more than \njust ideologically based promises that would have us view the plight of \nAmerica's workers from the top down, rather than from the bottom up.\n  This year, the Congress must extend unemployment benefits. It must \nprotect workers' pensions. It must increase the minimum wage. It must \nprotect the overtime pay of our Nation's workforce.\n  The administration has invested its energies, its resources, its \npolitical fortunes in those at the top of the economic pyramid, and \nthis administration has abandoned--abandoned--the workers at the bottom \nof the economic pyramid. The elected representatives of the people in \nthis Chamber must not do the same.\n  I close with Edwin Markham's poem.\n\n                       The Right To Labor in Joy\n\n     Out on the roads they have gathered,\n     A hundred-thousand men,\n     To ask for a hold on life as sure\n     As the wolf's hold in his den.\n\n     Their need lies close to the quick of life\n     As rain to the furrow sown:\n     It is as meat to the slender rib,\n     As marrow to the bone.\n\n     They ask but the leave to labor\n     For a taste of life's delight,\n     For a little salt to savor their bread,\n     For houses water-tight.\n     They ask but the right to labor,\n     And to live by the strength of their hands--\n\n     They who have bodies like knotted oaks,\n     And sinews like iron bands.\n\n     And the right of a man to labor,\n     And his right to labor in joy--\n     Not all your laws can strangle that right,\n     Nor the gates of hell destroy.\n     For it came with the making of man,\n     And was kneaded into his bones,\n     And it will stand at the last of things\n     On the dust of crumbled thrones.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S165]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know we will have more opportunity to \ndebate this legislation in the coming days. I wanted to come to the \nfloor for a few moments to express my gratitude and my admiration to \nthose colleagues who have worked so diligently to bring us to this \npoint. We deal with a lot of divisive issues in the Senate. We just \ndealt with one moments ago, the Omnibus appropriations bill. People \nsometimes ask me, as I travel the country and in my home State: Why \ndon't you all ever get together on something?\n  Here is an illustration where Republicans and Democrats have gotten \ntogether with a work product that I think merits our support, and I say \nour enthusiastic support. Senator Kennedy, of course, one of our key \nsponsors of this legislation, particularly deserves great thanks and \ngreat recognition for the work he has done to get us to this point.\n  We have a pension time bomb in this country. That time bomb is going \nto explode with even greater impact on the lives of millions and \nmillions of Americans unless we begin dealing with the issues of \nretirement security.\n  A couple of nights ago, when I had the pleasure of responding to the \nState of the Union, one of the points that I made and I know is shared \nby my colleagues, especially on this side of the aisle, is on the issue \nof pension security. Retirement security is increasingly becoming an \nissue of great interest and concern to not only our retirees but to so \nmany of our workers who are today concerned about whether they can \nretire at all as a result of the problems with pensions.\n  I have some charts I know have already been used, but in case others \nmissed the opportunity to walk through these charts and to hear the \nexplanation of this legislation, I want to share a couple of \nobservations, first about our circumstances, and then why I believe \nthis bill is as good as it is.\n  This chart talks about the defined benefit plans that are currently \navailable, and we have defined benefit plans that have worked well over \nthe course of the last 50 or 60 years, in particular. Thirty-five \nmillion Americans are covered today by plans that have been \nincorporated and utilized within corporations and businesses to provide \na defined benefit at retirement.\n  Mr. President, 9.7 million Americans are covered by multiemployer \npension plans, only a fraction of what single-employer defined benefit \nplans entail, but both the multiemployer and single-employer plans are \ncurrently the ones that are causing employers, employees, and retirees \nvery serious concern.\n  Only defined benefit plans provide a secure monthly benefit backed by \nthe Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, and that is where we begin to \nrun into some very serious problems.\n  We have 35 million Americans covered by single-employer plans and 9.7 \nmillion Americans covered by multiemployer defined benefit pension \nplans.\n  What has happened, of course, over the last couple of years in \nparticular--but it goes back longer than that--is that a perfect storm \nhas been created that has caused grave concern to those analyzing the \nviability of these pension plans. The perfect storm involves a number \nof factors that threaten the very essence of defined benefits as we \nhave known them now for so long.\n  The first factor in the defined benefit plan was a prolonged downturn \nof the stock market during this administration, the longest downturn we \nhave had since the Great Depression, almost 70 years ago. We have had \nextremely low 30-year Treasury bond interest rates, and that, too, has \ncontributed to the funding problems some defined benefit plans face. \nThen we have had weak economic conditions, which means companies cannot \nafford to make the payments and pay the excise tax imposed in the \npension laws themselves.\n  So we have one of the worst economic circumstances that could \npossibly befall these pension plans as pension designers and pension \nofficials were attempting to struggle with the responsibilities and the \ndirect legal requirements provided of these pensions.\n  That is why this legislation is so important. This legislation \naddresses that perfect storm. It addresses the circumstances we are now \nfacing across the country.\n  What the Grassley-Baucus-Gregg-Kennedy legislation provides is only \ntemporary relief but, nonetheless, important and essential relief if we \nare going to deal with this perfect storm of circumstances.\n  The legislation temporarily replaces the 30-year Treasury bond with a \ncorporate bond rate. That will help stabilize these circumstances and \nbegin putting some greater confidence within the system.\n  It provides targeted additional deficit reduction contribution relief \nto the hardest hit industries. We can walk through those, but there are \nsome, such as the airline industry, that are really suffering very \nserious consequences as a result of this perfect storm. Some industries \nhave been hurt worse than others. Airlines, perhaps, have been hurt the \nhardest of all.\n  The legislation also provides temporary relief to the multiemployer \npension plans by giving employers and workers time to negotiate changes \nto the contributions and benefits in order to preserve these pension \nplans in the first place.\n  Again, this is a very commonsense approach, an opportunity for us to \nsay, at least in the short term, that we recognize the problem. We \nunderstand this is not going to be resolved with only these actions, \nbut this will go a long way to providing that temporary relief and that \nconfidence that is going to be required if we can ensure we begin to \nturn around the circumstances we are facing in this perfect storm \ntoday.\n  One of the most important aspects of this legislation, in my view, is \nthe third piece of the proposal that I have just described which deals \nwith multiemployer plans. I am concerned, frankly, that we may \nsometimes minimize the importance of these plans and not fully \nappreciate the magnitude of their importance to millions of workers. \nThose 9.7 million workers have only this to fall back on. We need to be \nfully appreciative of the importance these plans have in the daily \nlives of the American workers today.\n  What they allow workers to do is earn pensions under many different \nemployers, as I said a moment ago, helping workers in short-term or \nseasonal employment. We are talking about construction, hospitality, \nentertainment, sometimes retail. This is their only opportunity. They \nhave no real access to retirement security unless they have access to a \nmultiemployer plan. They couldn't earn pensions in the single-employer \nsystem. It doesn't exist for them. Multiemployer plans provide pensions \nto low-wage workers--hotel workers, restaurant workers, janitors, the \npeople who work through the night oftentimes so that the buildings are \nclean when we come back; the people who oftentimes are the workers in \nthe kitchen.\n  This is a critical source of pensions for employees in small \nbusinesses as well. In South Dakota, that is the bulk of our business \ncommunity--small business. We have thousands and thousands of small \nbusiness employees who have absolutely no access to pensions today were \nit not for the multiemployer system that we created.\n  We are talking about a serious concern and, I would say, a serious \nresponse to that concern as we consider this legislation today.\n  I think this chart lays out very vividly in a picture what I just \ndescribed in more rhetorical terms. The multiemployer plans provide \nsome help to workers in virtually all industries: 15.2 percent of those \n9.7 million Americans are in manufacturing; 14 percent in retail trade; \n15 percent in services; almost 10 percent in truck transportation; and \n38 percent in construction.\n  This chart in particular caught my attention because we are talking \nabout South Dakota, and we are talking about rural States in \nparticular, but we could be talking about any State. Multiemployer \nplans provide literally tens of thousands of small employers with the \nopportunity to provide competitive, comprehensive benefit plans to \ntheir employees, which would otherwise be too expensive and \nadministratively too complex for them to provide on their own.\n  As so many of my colleagues know, one of the concerns we have in our \nState is young people taking flight,\n\n[[Page S166]]\n\nleaving our State, once having been educated. We oftentimes in our \nState compare it to a good crop. The crop is grown, it is nurtured, and \nthen somebody from out of State comes along with a combine, harvests \nthe grain, takes it to another country, sells it, and makes a profit.\n\n  In some ways that is a little bit like our young people. We educate \nthem, nurture them, teach them our values, and then somebody comes \nalong and hires them away before the first employer has a chance. One \nof the reasons they are able to hire them away is oftentimes they can \nprovide better wages and better benefits.\n  Well, this is an opportunity for South Dakotans, South Dakota small \nbusinessmen and other rural small businesses, to say, look, we have an \nopportunity to keep you in our State, to provide you with a competitive \npension benefit, so you do not have to leave and go to a big city. That \nis important as well to small businesses that otherwise are not able to \nbe competitive.\n  So this is not just a retirement bill; this is not just a pension \nsecurity bill. This is legislation that will provide competitiveness to \nsmall businesses, whether it is in any one of the industries I \nmentioned. We have to find ways to ensure that we level the playing \nfield between big business and small. In part, this legislation will do \nit.\n  So I will end where I started. I am very appreciative of the efforts \nmade by our colleagues to get us to this point, to contribute to public \npolicy in a way that I think will send hope to millions of workers and \nretirees who are concerned about being right in the center of that \nperfect storm today, and, of course, to millions of small \nbusinesspeople who want very much to be able to provide benefits in a \nmeaningful way and therefore compete, as they do so effectively each \nand every day, in our free market system today.\n  So I likely will have more to say about this legislation prior to the \ntime we vote on final passage. I again thank my colleague Senator \nKennedy for his leadership and those who have brought us to this point. \nThis is good legislation.

Mr. President, let me describe briefly what the background \nof this amendment is and what the amendment will do--the effect of the \namendment is actually quite simple--and then I will discuss the reasons \nfor it.\n  As you are aware, the background of this legislation is the House-\npassed bill, H.R. 3108. An amendment to that bill has been offered by \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee, the ranking member, and others \nthat would make some corrections to the House bill, H.R. 3108 and, \namong other things, provide for a partial waiver of some payments that \notherwise would be made into the fund that helps to guarantee the \npension benefits of employees.\n  We are aware of the fact that the Federal Government has undertaken a \nresponsibility for ensuring that pensions which are funded by employers \nwill actually be there when the employees need to collect on those \npensions. But in some cases, corporations run out of money, go \nbankrupt, go out of business, or otherwise can't meet these \nobligations. In that situation, the Federal Government has to step in \nand has agreed to do so under certain terms through the Pension Benefit \nGuaranty Corporation. As a result, we have an obligation to ensure that \nthe funding for these contingent liabilities is secure. Part of the way \nwe do that is to ensure that the employers that make the obligations to \ntheir employees pay in enough money to be able to pay for the benefits \nthey have promised.\n  The problem is that some of these corporations are not in very good \nshape. As a result, there is a fear that they are not going to be able \nto make the contributions they need to make in order to pay the \nbenefits to their employees when the time comes.\n  As a result of this concern, what we have done is to say these \ncorporations need to make some catchup payments to ensure the money \nwill be there. This is necessary in part because of a technical problem \nin the way that the funding was fixed based upon a U.S. Government \nsecurity that is no longer issued, as a result, we are having to \nsubstitute a different basis for the payment which will be a blended \ncorporate bond rate, a technicality, but that is going to be the basis \nfor a couple of years of contributions for corporations until another \nmethod is devised.\n  In the meantime, corporations whose pensions are underfunded are \nbeing required to make up some of these contributions, and it is called \nthe deficit\n\n[[Page S167]]\n\nreduction contribution, or the DRC, to reduce the deficit that has been \ncreated and that we need to make up if the money is going to be there \nfor the employees when it comes time to collect their pensions.\n  This deficit reduction contribution, according to the amendment \noffered by Senators Grassley, Baucus, Gregg, and Kennedy, as I \nunderstand it, would apply to those entities that are 90-percent funded \nor less. In other words, where the plan does not fund its benefits at \n100 percent, can't pay 100 percent, it can only pay 90 percent or \nperhaps even less. So for those entities that are in this kind of \nfinancial shape, they are going to have to make a deficit reduction \ncontribution, a special catchup contribution.\n  Under the amendment, they are going to actually be given a waiver of \npart of this contribution. The idea is that they can't afford to make \nthe full contribution; therefore, we are only going to make them pay \npart of it. In fact, we are going to waive 80 percent under the \namendment--80 percent of this obligation--in the first year and 60 \npercent of the obligation in the second year. That means they are only \nmaking 20 percent in the first year and 40 percent in the second year \nof the obligation they have. These are corporations that are in \ndifficult financial condition right now and cannot pay the full 100 \ncents on the dollar that their employees would be entitled to when \nthose employees attempt to collect their pensions.\n  We clearly have a difficult situation here. The purpose of the \namendment, obviously, is to have them pay something in and try to stay \neconomically viable in the meantime. The concern, of course, of the \nPension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and others is that all we are \ndoing is digging the hole deeper or, in effect, throwing bad money \nafter good is another way of putting it.\n\n  What we are doing is giving companies that might well fail a chance \nto incur further obligations, not pay for those obligations, and then \nput the taxpayers at risk for the additional obligations incurred \nduring this 2-year period of time. That is the risk. That is the \nconcern we have.\n  Clearly, if that transpired, there would be several losers. In the \nfirst place, this partial waiver would be harmful to the workers \nthemselves because they jeopardize the expected pension benefits, \nespecially for those workers who are supposed to receive larger \npensions than the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation will actually \nguarantee.\n  One category of people is airline pilots, for example. So companies \nshould be required, in my view, to fund their pension promises to their \nemployees. They should not be excused from these promises because, in \neffect, what they are doing is making bargains that are easy to make \nwith unions and with others, promising to make payments, and then \nsaying: We are sorry, we can't make them, but we would like to have the \nFederal Government bail us out.\n  The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation right now estimates $400 \nbillion in unfunded liabilities. That is a lot of money to be backing \nup. Last year their deficit was $11.2 billion.\n  The amount of the waiver we are talking about is about $16 billion in \nbenefits. So according to the relief that is being granted by this \npartial deficit reduction contribution waiver, the PBGC, or the Pension \nBenefit Guaranty Corporation, would lose about $16 billion worth of \nfunding relief. That is money that obviously may be required at some \nfuture date but will not be there because we are not asking these \ncompanies to pay in that amount of money.\n  Another loser: We think it is unfair to the healthy plans, to those \ncorporations and employees who have actually been part of businesses \nthat have paid attention to their economics, have ensured they are \nputting enough money into their pensions to fund the benefits that \ntheir employees are due.\n  If the underfunded plan fails to pay the amount they are supposed to \nand the insurance premiums then go up, the healthy plans are the ones \nthat end up paying that difference. I believe it is unfair to excuse \nthese companies that have made the promises and then not require them \nto go ahead and pay that money and fulfill their promises.\n  It is also unfair to competitors. Stop and think about an airline, \nfor example. I feel this may well be the situation because the waiver \nis granted to certain airline companies that need it, allegedly, and to \na couple of steel companies. It is a very selected kind of waiver. The \ncompetitors of the airlines--the airlines that have been trying to \nwatch their pennies and not overcommit themselves in their pensions--\nwill be at a disadvantage. They have made their commitments to \nemployees. They have paid the money into their pension plans to make \nsure they can pay those commitments to employees, and now their \ncompetitors, that maybe have overpromised or are now going to be \nunderfunding, will be able to take that difference and apply it to \nother aspects of their business to compete with the airlines that have \ndone a good job.\n  There is nothing that says they cannot take the difference and \nundercut the other airlines in terms of their fare structure. That \ncould easily happen, and there is nothing we have here that precludes \nthat from happening. That is a very big concern I have.\n  We should not be playing favorites, one company against another, in a \nparticular business, and the airline business is certainly one in which \nthis might apply. In effect, it is a backdoor bailout for some \ncompanies, those who have not been able to fund the benefits they have \npromised to their employees. It seems to me, therefore, another \npotential loser are the competitors of the airlines we would actually \nbe benefiting here. Finally, it is a big loss to the American taxpayer \nif the taxpayer ends up on the hook for these deficits.\n  As I said, the PBGC reported a deficit of $11.2 billion in its \nsingle-employer insurance plan for fiscal year 2003, which is a record \ndeficit. Even though it estimates it will have assets sufficient to \nmeet obligations for the foreseeable future, the PBGC estimates the sum \ntotal of all the single-employer pension plan underfunding amounts to \nabout $400 billion, and it is Congress, meaning Congress on behalf of \nall U.S. taxpayers, who will be held responsible to bail out the \nPension Guaranty Board rather than to allow the entire insurance system \nto collapse.\n  In my view, these waivers are the wrong thing to do for the \nemployees, for the competitors, for the system, and certainly for the \nAmerican taxpayer. Companies that habitually underfund plans should not \nbe bailed out at the expense of others. I think the primary reason we \nare even thinking about doing this is because at least one of the \ncompanies that would be eligible simply cannot post the security or the \nbond that is required to obtain a general funding waiver from the \nTreasury Department.\n  Let me make a point that in the law there is already an ability of \nthese companies to seek a waiver. It is the general waiver authority \nthat can be sought from the Treasury Department. To do that, you have \nto prove some things. You have to post a bond and you have to prove \nsome things to the Department of the Treasury. Why can't these \ncompanies go through that process? Why do they need special relief from \nthe Congress to bail them out? Is it too much to ask that they just \nfollow the current law and apply for the regular waiver as they have \nthe right to do today? It seems to me that would be the appropriate way \nto handle this.\n  We have the amendment before us, and the reason I have offered this \nsecond-degree amendment is at least in one small way it limits the \nliability of the taxpayers should things go wrong. That is the purpose \nfor this amendment.\n  Now what is it? It is called a hold-harmless provision. What it says \nis the PBGC, the guaranty board, would be held harmless for any benefit \naccruals that occurred during the waiver period--the waiver period is 2 \nyears--or that occur 2 years after that. If a plan fails during this \nDRC waiver period, or within 2 years after the waiver period, then the \nPBGC would only have to fund the benefits that accrued up to the time \nthe waiver was claimed. It would not have to finance any benefits that \naccrued after the waiver was claimed. If you stop to think about it, \nthis makes very good sense. It is obviously important to protect the \ngoing businesses, the healthy plans, and the taxpayers with this kind \nof hold harmless.\n  One of the big dangers with this waiver of these companies that are \nnot funding their pensions adequately is\n\n[[Page S168]]\n\nthese plans claiming the waiver are going to fail, anyway. The whole \npoint of doing this for them is they are very close to failing, and the \nargument made on their behalf is they are about to fail. You do not \nwant them to fail, do you? You do not want the Government to have to \nmake good on all of these pension guarantees. Let's keep going for a \nlittle while longer, and if we waive the pension benefit they have to \npay in, the amount of the contribution they have to pay in, then maybe \nthey can stay in business a little longer.\n  Well, maybe they can; maybe they cannot. That is a big gamble we are \ntaking. What we are saying in the legislation is, all right, we will \ntry to help keep you afloat for another couple of years, but if you \nfail during that period of time or within 2 years of that period of \ntime, we should not be on the hook. We are doing our part to bail you \nout, but we are not going to pay all of your past benefits, all of the \nbenefits that have accrued to date, plus the benefits you accrue from \nnow forward by virtue of the fact that we have put in the money, or \nconversely we have granted a waiver to you so you can stay in business \nduring this period of time.\n\n  We would in effect be saying we will help you stay afloat to incur \nnew benefits that then we are going to pay for, and it would be unfair \nfor the taxpayers to be on the hook for that. So this hold-harmless \nprovision would mitigate this potential. It would limit the drains on \nthe healthy plans. It would limit the amount of the money the taxpayers \nwould be on the hook for, and I think it is eminently fair. It seems to \nme to be impossible for these companies to argue that not only should \nthey have this special benefit nobody else has, that gives them an \nadvantage over their competitors, that keeps them in business a little \nwhile longer, not only should they have that and put at risk for the \nAmerican taxpayers that they are going to have to get bailed out, but \nalso during this period of time that they are trying to get back on \ntheir feet charge the taxpayers with the new benefits that are accrued \nduring that period of time. That is what the hold harmless is designed \nto try to protect against. We will take care of the benefits you have \nincurred up to now, but nothing incurred from now forward during this \n4-year window of time. That seems to be eminently reasonable to me, and \nwhat I hope is that even though this will not be voted on until \nprobably next Tuesday, my colleagues could take a look at this, \nconsider whether it is worth supporting, and perhaps we could--I will \nnot even call a rollcall vote if Members are willing to support the \namendment and we can prevail on it, but I do insist we get this passed.\n  There is another amendment I will file, but I do not intend to send \nto the desk at this time, that I think would further strengthen the \nsituation so it is not quite as big a potential drain on the taxpayers. \nIt has to do with the fact that I think it totally reasonable to ask \nthese companies if they are going to ask for this waiver today that \nthat be it, that they not be asking for any more waivers in the future.\n  The other idea I have that I will perhaps offer later is a plan that \naccepts this DRC funding waiver we are offering in the original \namendment would then not be able to apply for a general funding waiver \nfor 2 years after the waiver period ends. Otherwise, all we are doing \nis essentially postponing the inevitable. If they intend to file for a \ngeneral waiver after 2 years, they can clearly file for a general \nwaiver today. If they think they can prove the case that they need to \nget that general waiver from the Department of the Treasury in 2 years, \nthen they could do it today.\n  In effect, under the manager's amendment, they have a 2-year holiday \nfor making their full DRC payments, which are designed to bring their \nplans into full funding. I believe it would be inappropriate to allow a \nplan that claims this 2-year DRC waiver at the end of that period to \nthen seek the general waiver for 2 more years, and would note the fact \nthat the companies that apply to the Treasury for this have to show \nthere is a substantial business hardship--they ought to be able to show \nthat--that it is temporary. If it is not temporary, then I do not know \nwhy we are throwing taxpayer money at the problem in the first place.\n  It is reasonable to expect the plan cannot continue unless the waiver \nis granted. That is in effect what at least one of these companies has \nbeen telling Members of Congress that they have to have this relief or \nelse they are not going to be able to stay in business. At that point \nthen the Secretary of the Treasury can demand of them some security, \nsome kind of bond, and grant this waiver.\n  I do not know why that general authority in the statute today is not \nadequate to take care of this problem and why we have to grant this \nspecific waiver. It seems to me if we grant this specific waiver, then \nit is not unfair to ask them to commit to us that they are not going to \nseek additional waivers after that.\n  But, again, that is something that I think makes sense. I may offer \nthat amendment later. But the amendment that I do offer, which I think \nis eminently reasonable and which I cannot imagine my colleagues would \nnot support, is simply an amendment that would hold the taxpayers \nharmless for events that occurred during the period of time this \nspecific waiver is in effect, and for a period of 2 years after that.\n  I conclude by saying I think we are on a bit of a slippery slope with \nthis entire approach. It was entirely appropriate for the House of \nRepresentatives to focus on the need for some kind of temporary \nsubstitute formula for contributions because the old formula clearly \ncouldn't work anymore. The Government was no longer issuing the \nsecurities on which the formula was based.\n  There were different choices we could have made. I thought the \nTreasury Department had the best solution, but that solution would have \nrequired the companies to pay in more money than they were willing to \npay in. That probably is the most fiscally sound. But what was decided \non as a compromise was this temporary corporate bond rate. I do not \nthink that is enough to assure the corporation pension benefits will be \nsecure, but that is what is before us.\n  By itself, I would be willing to support that for a couple of years. \nBut what I am not willing to support is this waiver of the payment for \njust two companies in one business, steel, and certain airlines that \nsay they need it and for some reason don't want to go the general \nwaiver route. I think this is entirely too generous.\n  But if we are going to do that, then I say at least let's ask for a \n``hold harmless'' during the period of the waiver and for a period of 2 \nyears afterward so at least we, the taxpayers, are not liable for new \nbenefits accrued during this period of time that we are trying to help \nthese companies out. That, I think, is the least we could expect.\n  I hope we will have a chance to visit a little bit more on this with \ncolleagues when they are here on Tuesday or perhaps on Monday morning, \nand we can have a vote at that time. Therefore, for the time being, \nthat is the extent of my discussion on this particular amendment.\n  Mr. President, seeing no other Member here, I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise in tribute to a distinguished public \nservant, and a member of the Senate for 18 years, Senator Birch Bayh of \nIndiana.\n  Today, Senator Bayh is celebrating his 76th birthday. Earlier this \nweek, I had the privilege of participating in an event honoring Senator \nBayh at the University of Connecticut. Senator Bayh was recognized for \nhis role as a chief architect of title IX, the historic legislation \nthat prohibits discrimination against women in education.\n  Before title IX became law in 1972, American women and girls were \ntreated as second-class citizens in our educational system. They were \ndiscouraged from studying subjects like math, science, and law. Many \nschools and universities had separate entrance requirements for male \nand female students--and many others did not admit women at all. Those \nwomen who did gain admission were often subject to discriminatory \npolicies. Some were denied scholarships and other forms of financial \naid. Others were excluded from honor societies, clubs, and other \norganizations and activities.\n  Thanks to title IX, women have taken their rightful place in American \neducation--as students, teachers, professors, even university \npresidents. And equality in education has helped women find \nopportunities for success in virtually every aspect of American life. \nToday's women in America are doctors, lawyers, engineers, and business \nowners. They are mayors, governors, judges, and legislators. This \ndistinguished body is privileged to count 14 women among its Members. \nAnd the day will likely soon come when this country elects its first \nwoman President.\n  Title IX's impact is felt not only in the classroom and the \nboardroom, but in the locker room as well. Since title IX was passed, \nthe number of women playing collegiate sports has increased from about \n32,000 to nearly 150,000. Today, 3 million high school girls play \ncompetitive sports, compared to only 300,000 thirty years ago. America \nhas a successful professional women's basketball league. And every 4 \nyears, the Women's World Cup in soccer attracts thousands of \nspectators, and millions of TV viewers, across our Nation. The \nUniversity of Connecticut, whose female student-athletes excel in both \nacademics and athletics, is a shining example of the dramatic and \npositive change that title IX has brought to our Nation.\n  Birch Bayh was an ardent supporter of women's rights during his years \nof service in the Senate. In addition to title IX, he also helped craft \nthe Equal Rights Amendment, which has been ratified by 35 States, \nincluding my home State of Connecticut. I would like to thank Senator \nBayh as well as the many others who helped make title IX a reality. In \nparticular, I'd like to recognize my friend and colleague Senator Ted \nStevens for his role as the lead Senate cosponsor, as well as the \nbill's sponsors in the House, the late Edith Green of Oregon and the \nlate Patsy Mink of Hawaii.\n  And last but certainly not least, I'd like to express my appreciation \nand admiration for the countless girls and women in America over the \nyears who fought to open doors that for so long were closed to them--\nfrom schools to offices to military bases to voting booths. The long \njourney towards gender equality is not yet complete. But achievements \nlike title IX show that there has indeed been taken great and \nmeaningful strides in the right direction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/22/senate-section/article/S169-2", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  Terrianne Summers, a 51-year old transgender activist was shot in the \nback of the head while getting out of her car in her driveway. Summers, \na retired Navy Lieutenant Commander, organized a local protest against \nthe Winn-Dixie supermarket chain in January after an employee was fired \nfor cross-dressing off-duty.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/22/senate-section/article/S169-3", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S169-S170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                         Sergeant Jarrod Black\n\n   Mr. BAYH. Madam President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from Peru, \nIN. Sgt. Jarrod William Black, 26 years old, died in Ar Ramadi, a town \n60 miles west of Baghdad, on December 12, 2003, after his vehicle was \nhit by an improvised explosive device. Jarrod joined the Army with his \nentire life before him. He chose to risk everything to fight for the \nvalues Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the \nworld.\n   Jarrod was the 22nd Hoosier soldier to be killed while serving his \ncountry in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Jarrod leaves behind his father, \nBill, his mother, Jane, his wife, Shawna, his brother, Brandon, and his \nsons, Jacob and Jason. Only 1 week after being deployed to Iraq the \nyoung couple found out that they were expecting a baby girl. May she \ngrow up knowing that her father gave his life so that young Iraqis will \nsome day know the freedom she will enjoy.\n   Today, I join Jarrod's family, his friends, and the entire Peru \ncommunity in mourning his death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow \nover his death, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely \nfighting to make the world a safer place. It is this courage and \nstrength of character that people will remember when they think of \nJarrod, a memory that will burn brightly during these continuing days \nof conflict and grief.\n   Rowland Garver, Jarrod's grandfather and an Air Force veteran of 20 \nyears, told Jarrod's hometown paper, the Peru Tribune, that the death \nof his grandson brings home the reality of war. These words of \nreflection and loss sting the hearts of all who know the worry and \nhonor of having loved ones serve our Nation overseas.\n   During the last phone conversation that Jarrod had with his family, \nhe called his mother and told her that he loved her and was being safe. \nHis mother says that God granted her that one last conversation with \nher son. Today, Jarrod's family remembers him as a true American hero, \nand we honor the sacrifice he made while serving his country.\n   Jarrod graduated from Peru High School in 1999, where he was an avid \nPeru Tigers fan. Friends and family members remember Jarrod for the \nlove he had for his entire family, and for his energetic personality, \nwhich he often demonstrated while cheering on his favorite team, the \nIndianapolis Colts.\n   After joining the Army in 1999, Jarrod left to begin full-time duty \nin Fort Riley, KS. Jarrod served on a tanker as part of the 1st \nBattalion, 34th Armor Division, 1st Infantry Division. He was deployed \nto the Middle East in September.\n   As I search for words to do justice in honoring Jarrod's sacrifice, \nI am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the \nfamilies of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg:\n\n       We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow \n     this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled \n     here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or \n     detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \n     say here, but it can never forget what they did here.\n\nThis statement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as \nI am certain that the impact of Jarrod's actions will live on far \nlonger than any record of these words.\n   It is my sad duty to enter the name of Jarrod Black in the official \nRecord of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his \nprofound commitment to freedom, democracy and\n\n[[Page S170]]\n\npeace. When I think about this just cause in which we are engaged, and \nthe unfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope \nthat families like Jarrod's can find comfort in the words of the \nprophet Isaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the \nLord God will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n   May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God \nbless the United States of America.\n\n\n                   honoring specialist luke p. frist\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Madam President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from \nBrookston, IN. Specialist Luke Frist, 20 years old, died at the Brooke \nArmy Medical Center at Fort Sam Houston, TX, on January 5, 2004, \nfollowing an attack, 3 days prior in Baghdad, Iraq, when the fuel truck \nhe was driving struck an improvised explosive device.\n  After joining the Army Reserves, Luke was assigned to the 209th \nQuartermaster Company in Lafayette, IN. Luke served on a fuel tanker as \na petroleum specialist during his deployment, which began in May 2003.\n  Luke was the twenty-third Hoosier soldier to be killed while serving \nhis country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. This brave young soldier leaves \nbehind his father, Dennis, his mother, Pattie, and two sisters. When \nLuke joined the Army Reserves, he was following in the military \nfootsteps of his parental grandfather, who served in World War II. With \nhis entire life before him, Luke chose to risk everything to fight for \nthe values Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around \nthe world.\n  Today, I join Luke's family, his friends, and the entire Brookston \ncommunity in mourning his death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow \nover his death, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely \nfighting to make the world a safer place. It is his courage and \nstrength of character that people will remember when they think of \nLuke, a memory that will burn brightly during these continuing days of \nconflict and grief.\n  Luke's family recalls his being in good spirits during his last phone \ncall home. According to his sister Johanna, Luke ``wanted to fight for \nhis country and be the best of the best . . . . He died doing what he \nloved.'' Today, Luke's family remembers him as a true American hero, \nand we honor the sacrifice he made while serving his country.\n  Luke graduated from Tri-County High School in 2001. He was an active \nmember of the student body, playing the trombone and tuba in the band, \nplaying on the football team, and throwing shot put as a member of the \ntrack team. Friends and family members alike remember Luke for his \nenergetic personality, his passion for being outdoors, and his \ndedication to making his dreams become a reality. When Luke was \nactivated, he was working full time while attending classes at Ivy Tech \nState College in Lafayette, with plans to transfer to Purdue University \nto pursue a career in landscape design.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Luke's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg:\n\n       We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow \n     this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled \n     here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or \n     detract.

Madam President, today I would like to pay tribute to a \nman who served in this body with distinction for 30 years, Senator \nWilliam Roth.\n  Senator Roth was first elected to the House of Representatives from \nhis adopted State of Delaware in 1966. He immediately made a name for \nhimself as he shed light on wasteful Government spending. His fight \nagainst Government waste and abuse continued when he was elected to the \nSenate in 1970, where he served the people of his State honorably for \nthree decades and chaired both the Governmental Affairs and Finance \nCommittees.\n  Senator Roth will forever be remembered for the respect he paid to \nthis institution and to his colleagues. That respect was returned many \ntimes over by his colleagues, who knew they could count on his \nintegrity, civility and all-around decency. In a time when many feel \npartisanship is on the rise, those qualities are sorely missed. Senator \nRoth should be looked to as an example for all Members of the Senate.\n  Senator Roth's modest demeanor belied his accomplishments and \ninfluence. He played significant roles in many tax policy debates over \nthe years and was a lead force in Congress with respect to efforts to \n``reinvent'' the Federal Government during the 1990s. He also was a \ndefender of the environment, opposing ocean dumping, oil drilling in \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and incineration of toxic waste.\n  I am honored to have served with Senator Roth and he will be truly \nmissed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/22/senate-section/article/S170-2", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S170-S173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, we open this year confronted with three \nadditional disappointing developments regarding judicial nominations: \nthe Pickering recess appointment, the renomination of Claude Allen, and \nthe pilfering of Democratic offices' computer files by Republican \nstaff.\n  Late last Friday afternoon President Bush made his most cynical and \ndivisive appointment to date when he bypassed the Senate and \nunilaterally installed Charles Pickering to the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Fifth Circuit. That appointment is without the consent of the \nSenate and is a particular affront to the many individuals and \nmembership organizations representing African Americans in the Fifth \nCircuit who have strongly opposed this nomination.\n  With respect to his extreme judicial nominations, President George W. \nBush is the most divisive President in American history. Through his \nextreme judicial nominations, President Bush is dividing the American \npeople and undermining the fairness and independence of the federal \njudiciary on which all Americans depend.\n  After fair hearings and open debate, the Senate Judiciary Committee \nrejected the Pickering nomination in 2002. Originally nominated in 2001 \nby President Bush, this nominee's record underwent a thorough \nexamination by the Senate Judiciary Committee and was found lacking. \nRejected for this promotion by the Committee in 2002 because of his \npoor record as a judge and the ethical problems raised by his handling \nof his duties in specific instances, Judge Pickering's nomination was \nnonetheless sent back to the Senate last year by a President who is the \nfirst in our history to reject the judgment of the Judiciary Committee \non a judicial nominee. This is the only President who has renominated \nsomeone rejected on a vote by the Judiciary Committee for a judicial \nappointment.\n  The renomination of Charles Pickering lay dormant for most of last \nyear while Republicans reportedly planned further hearings. Judge \nPickering himself said that several hearings on his nomination were \nscheduled and cancelled over the last year by Republicans. Then, \nwithout any additional information or hearings, Republicans decided to \nforego any pretense at proceeding in regular order. Instead, they \nplaced the name of Judge Pickering on the committee's markup agenda and \npushed his nomination through with their one-vote majority. The \nCommittee had been told since last January that a new hearing would be \nheld\n\n[[Page S171]]\n\nbefore a vote on this nomination, but that turned out to be an empty \npromise.\n  Why was the Pickering nomination moved ahead of other well-qualified \ncandidates late last fall? Why was the Senate required to expend \nvaluable time rehashing arguments about a controversial nomination that \nhas already been rejected? The timing was arranged by Republicans to \ncoincide with the gubernatorial election in Mississippi. Like so much \nabout this President's actions with respect to the Federal courts, \npartisan Republican politics seemed to be the governing consideration. \nIndeed, as the President's own former Secretary of the Treasury points \nout from personal experience, politics governs more than just Federal \njudicial nominations in the Bush administration.\n  Charles Pickering was a nominee rejected by the Judiciary Committee \non the merits--a nominee who has a record that does not qualify him for \nthis promotion, who injects his personal views into judicial opinions, \nand who has made highly questionable ethical judgments. The nominee's \nsupporters, including some Republican Senators, have chosen to imply \nthat Democrats opposed the nominee because of his religion or region. \nThat is untrue and offensive. These smears have been as ugly as they \nare wrong. Yet the political calculation has been made to ignore the \nfacts, to seek to pin unflattering characterizations on Democrats for \npartisan purposes and to count on cynicism and misinformation to rule \nthe day. With elections coming up this fall, partisan Republicans are \napparently returning to that page of their partisan political playbook.\n  Never before had a judicial nomination rejected by the Judiciary \nCommittee after a vote been resubmitted to the Senate, but this \nPresident took that unprecedented step last year. Never before has a \njudicial nomination debated at such length by the Senate, and to which \nthe Senate has withheld its consent, been the subject of a Presidential \nappointment to the Federal bench.\n  In an editorial following last week's appointment, The Washington \nPost had it right when it summarized Judge Pickering's record as a \nfederal trial judge as ``undistinguished and downright disturbing.'' As \nthe paper noted: ``The right path is to build consensus that \nnonpartisanship and excellence are the appropriate criteria for \njudicial selection.'' Instead we see another dangerous step down the \nRepublican's chosen path to erode judicial independence for the sake of \npartisanship and their ideological court-packing efforts. I will ask \nunanimous consent that this editorial be printed in the Record. The New \nYork Times also editorialized on this subject and it, too, was correct \nwhen it pointed out that this end-run around the advice and consent \nauthority of the Senate is ``absolutely the wrong choice for one of the \nnation's most sensitive courts.'' I will ask unanimous consent that \nthis editorial also be printed in the Record.\n  Civil rights supporters who so strenuously opposed this nominee were \nunderstandably offended that the President chose this action the day \nafter his controversial visit to the grave of Dr. Martin Luther King, \nJr. As the Nation was entering the weekend set aside to honor Dr. King \nand all for which he strived, this President made one of the most \ninsensitive and divisive appointments of his administration. I will ask \nunanimous consent that the op-ed published in the Chicago Sun Times by \nthe Reverend Jesse Jackson be printed in the Record. In this op-ed, \nReverend Jackson observed that this President ``has shown a remarkable \ncynicism about playing racial politics.''\n  So many civil rights group and individuals committed to supporting \ncivil rights in this country have spoken out in opposition to the \nelevation of Judge Pickering that their views should have been \nrespected by the President. Contrary to the false assertion made by \nthe Wall Street Journal editorial page this week, the NAACP of \nMississippi did not support Judge Pickering's nomination. Indeed, every \nsingle branch of the Mississippi State Chapter of the NAACP voted to \noppose this nomination--not just once, but three times. When Mr. \nPickering was nominated to the District Court in 1990, the NAACP of \nMississippi opposed him, and when he was nominated to the Fifth Circuit \nin 2001 and, again, in 2003, the NAACP of Mississippi opposed him. They \nhave written letter after letter expressing their opposition. That \nopposition was shared by the NAACP, the Southern Christian Leadership \nConference, the Magnolia Bar Association, the Mississippi Legislative \nBlack Caucus, the Mississippi Black Caucus of Local Elected Officials, \nRepresentative Bennie G. Thompson and many others. Perhaps the Wall \nStreet Journal confused the Mississippi NAACP with the Mississippi \nAssociation of Trial Lawyers, which is an organization that did support \nthe Pickering nomination.\n\n  This is an administration that promised to unite the American people \nbut that has chosen time and again to act with respect to judicial \nnominations in a way that divides us. This is an administration that \nsquandered the goodwill and good faith that Democrats showed in the \naftermath of September 11, 2001. This is an administration that refused \nto acknowledge the strides we made in filling 100 judicial vacancies \nunder Democratic Senate leadership in 2001 and 2002 while overcoming \nanthrax attacks and in spite of Republican mistreatment of scores of \nqualified, moderate judicial nominees of President Clinton.\n  Then, just 2 days ago, the President sent the nomination of Claude \nAllen back to the Senate. From the time this nomination was originally \nmade to the time it was returned to the President last year, the \nMaryland Senators have made their position crystal clear. This Fourth \nCircuit vacancy is a Maryland seat and ought to be filled by an \nexperienced, qualified Marylander. Over the Senate recess, the White \nHouse had ample time to find such a nominee, someone of the caliber of \nsitting U.S. District Court Judges Andre Davis or Roger Titus, two \nformer Maryland nominees whose involvement in the State's legal system \nand devotion to their local community was clear. This refusal to \ncompromise is just another example of the White House engaging in \npartisan politics to the detriment of an independent judiciary.\n  The third disappointment we face is the ongoing fallout from the \ncyber theft of confidential memoranda from Democratic Senate staff. \nThis invasion was perpetrated by Republican employees both on and off \nthe Committee. As revealed by the Chairman, computer security was \ncompromised and, simply put, members of the Republican staff took \nthings that did not belong to them and passed them around and on to \npeople outside of the Senate. This is no small mistake. It is a serious \nbreach of trust, morals, and possibly the rules and regulations \ngoverning the Senate. We do not yet know the full extent of these \nviolations. But we need to repair the loss of trust brought on by this \nbreach of confidentiality and privacy, if we are ever to recover and be \nable to resume our work in a spirit of cooperation and mutual respect \nthat is so necessary to make progress.\n  Democratic cooperation with the President's slate of judicial \nnominees has been remarkable in these circumstances. One way to measure \nthat cooperation and the progress we have made possible is to examine \nthe Chief Justice's annual report on the Federal judiciary. Over the \nlast couple of years, Justice Rehnquist has been ``pleased to report'' \nour progress on filling judicial vacancies. This is in sharp contrast \nto the criticism he justifiably made of the shadowy and unprincipled \nRepublican obstruction of consideration of President Clinton's \nnominees. In 1996, the final year of President Clinton's first term, \nthe Republican-led Senate confirmed only 17 judicial nominees all year \nand not a single nominee to the circuit courts. At the end of 1996, the \nRepublican Senate majority returned to the President almost twice as \nmany nominations as were confirmed.\n  By contrast, with the overall cooperation of Senate Democrats, which \npartisan Republicans are loath to concede, this President has achieved \nrecord numbers of judicial confirmations. Despite the attacks of Sept. \n11 and their aftermath, the Senate has already confirmed 169 of \nPresident Bush's nominees to the Federal bench. This is more judges \nthan were confirmed during President Reagan's entire first 4-year term. \nThus, President Bush's 3-year totals rival those achieved by other \nPresidents in 4 years. That is also true with respect to the nearly 4 \nyears it took for President Clinton to\n\n[[Page S172]]\n\nachieve these results following the Republicans' taking majority \ncontrol of the Senate in 1995.\n  The 69 judges confirmed last year exceeds the number of judges \nconfirmed during any of the 6 years from 1995 to 2000 that Republicans \ncontrolled the Senate during the Clinton presidency years in which \nthere were far more vacant Federal judgeships than exist today. Among \nthose 69 judges confirmed in 2003 were 13 circuit court judges. That \nexceeds the number of circuit court judges confirmed during all of \n1995, 1996, 1997, 1999, and 2000, when a Democrat was President.\n  The Senate has already confirmed 30 circuit court judges nominated by \nPresident Bush. This is a greater number than were confirmed at this \npoint in the presidencies of his father, President Clinton, or the \nfirst term of President Reagan. Vacancies on the Federal judiciary have \nbeen reduced to the lowest point in two decades and are lower than \nRepublicans allowed at any time during the Clinton presidency. In \naddition, there are more Federal judges serving on the bench today than \nat any time in American history.\n  I congratulate the Democratic Senators on the Committee for showing a \nspirit of cooperation and restraint in the face of a White House that \nso often has refused to consult, compromise or conciliate. I regret \nthat our efforts have not been fairly acknowledged by partisan \nRepublicans and that this administration continues down the path of \nconfrontation. While there have been difficult and controversial \nnominees whom we have opposed as we exercise our constitutional duty of \nadvice and consent to lifetime appointments on the Federal bench, we \nhave done so openly and on the merits.\n  For the last 3 years I have urged the President to work with us. It \nis with deep sadness that I see that this administration still refuses \nto accept the Senate's shared responsibility under the Constitution and \nrefuses to appreciate our level of cooperation and achievement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the materials to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       End Run for Mr. Pickering\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 18, 2004]\n\n       President Bush's decision Friday to install controversial \n     judicial nominee Charles W. Pickering Sr. on the U.S. Court \n     of Appeals for the 5th Circuit using a recess appointment is \n     yet another unwarranted escalation of the judicial nomination \n     wars. We have lamented some of the attacks on Mr. Pickering, \n     but his record as a federal trial judge is undistinguished \n     and downright disturbing, and Senate Democrats are reasonable \n     to oppose his nomination. Installing him using a \n     constitutional end run around the Senate only inflames \n     passions. The right path is to build consensus that \n     nonpartisanship and excellence are the appropriate criteria \n     for judicial selection.\n       The recess appointment--the president's power to \n     temporarily install federal officers without Senate \n     confirmation--is a uniquely bad instrument for federal \n     judges. Judges are supposed to be politically independent. \n     Yet Mr. Pickering will be a controversial nominee before the \n     Senate as he considers cases and will lose his job in a year \n     if he is not confirmed. Even his supporters should understand \n     that he will be subject to the political pressures from which \n     judges are supposed to be insulated.\n       We don't rule out the recess appointment in all \n     circumstances. At times judges have commanded such uniform \n     support that presidents have used the power to get them in \n     office quickly, leaving the formality of confirmation for \n     later. We supported, moreover, President Bill Clinton's lame-\n     duck recess appointment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \n     4th Circuit of Roger Gregory, who, like Mr. Pickering, was \n     held up in the Senate. But there was a big difference: Mr. \n     Gregory was not controversial. His nomination, in fact, was \n     eventually resubmitted to the Senate by none other than \n     President Bush. It was held up initially because of a long-\n     standing dispute over appointments to that court, not because \n     of any concerns about the nominee himself. There was reason \n     to hope that Mr. Gregory would be confirmed--as, indeed, he \n     was. In this case, Mr. Bush has used a recess appointment for \n     someone who cannot, on his merits, garner a vote of \n     confidence from the Senate and who has no prospect of \n     confirmation in the current Congress.\n       We don't support the filibuster of nominees, but the answer \n     to Democratic obstruction cannot be the appointment or \n     installation of temporary judges who get to hear a few cases \n     over a few months, all the while looking over their shoulders \n     at the senators who oppose them. The great damage the \n     judicial nomination wars threaten over the long term is to \n     erode judicial independence, to make judges constantly aware \n     of how they might have to answer to the Senate for a given \n     opinion. Using the recess appointment to place Mr. Pickering \n     on the 5th Circuit has made that danger into a realty.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                           A Judicial End Run\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 17, 2004]\n\n       President Bush has used the only avenue remaining to him to \n     install Charles Pickering Sr. of Mississippi on the Fifth \n     Circuit Court of Appeals: a recess appointment, which avoids \n     the confirmation process. That recess appointments are a \n     perfectly legal device used by other presidents in the past \n     does not make this appointment any more palatable. \n     Mr. Pickering is absolutely the wrong choice for one of \n     the nation's most sensitive courts.\n       Mr. Bush claimed that only a ``handful'' of senators had \n     opposed Mr. Pickering. The opposition was in fact a good deal \n     broader than that.\n       Mr. Pickering was rejected in 2002 by the Judiciary \n     Committee when the Senate was still in Democratic hands. When \n     the same committee, in Republican control, approved him last \n     fall, the nomination was blocked by a filibuster. Another \n     attempt on the president's part to win Senate approval of Mr. \n     Pickering's nomination would almost certainly have produced \n     the same result.\n       The reasons are clear enough. Over the years, Mr. Pickering \n     has displayed skepticism toward cases involving civil rights \n     and expressed doubts about well-settled principles like one \n     person one vote. The Senate inquiry into the nomination \n     uncovered troubling questions of judicial ethics. Mr. \n     Pickering took up the case of a man convicted of burning a \n     cross on the lawn of an interracial couple, urging \n     prosecutors to drop a central charge and calling a prosecutor \n     directly. He also seems outside the mainstream on abortion \n     rights.\n       Mr. Pickering is not the only hard-right candidate Mr. Bush \n     has pushed for high judicial office. But his nomination was \n     among the most troublesome. As Senator Charles Schumer said, \n     Mr. Bush's decision to bypass the Senate in this manner is \n     ``a finger in the eye'' for all those seeking fairness in the \n     nomination process.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    Bush Insults King's Legacy Again\n\n              [From the Chicago Sun Times, Jan. 20, 2004]\n\n                           (By Jesse Jackson)\n\n       Monday marked what would have been Dr. Martin Luther King's \n     75th birthday. And once more, President Bush chose the \n     occasion to issue a cold and calculated insult to African \n     Americans and Dr. King's memory.\n       Last year, the president chose Dr. King's birthday to \n     announce his decision to ask the Supreme Court to overturn \n     our civil rights laws by challenging the University of \n     Michigan's affirmative action program. Despite its \n     conservative majority, even this Supreme Court found that too \n     offensive to constitutional guarantees of equal rights, and \n     ruled against the president's case.\n       This year, the president took time from his big-donor fund-\n     raising to lay a wreath at Dr. King's grave and call for \n     racial reconciliation. Then after collecting $2.4 million \n     from wealthy beneficiaries of his tax cuts, he announced he \n     would make a recess appointment of Judge Charles Pickering.\n       Pickering shares views, history and friendship with \n     Mississippi Sen. Trent Lott, who was removed from leadership \n     of the Senate Republicans after he celebrated the \n     segregationist cause of the Dixiecrats. Pickering, with a \n     history of embracing racist causes, was rejected by the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee when Democrats held the majority.\n       Bush renominated him when Republicans took over, but \n     Pickering's views are so extreme that Democrats made him one \n     of only six judges they have blocked. Now the president \n     chooses Dr. King's holiday to announce his symbolic \n     appointment to the bench. From Willy Horton to Charles \n     Pickering, the Bush family has shown a remarkable cynicism \n     about playing racial politics.\n       But the true insult to Dr. King's memory is not Bush's \n     symbolic politics; it is the substance of his policies. Here \n     the contrast is stark.\n       Dr. King called on America to measure itself from the \n     bottom up, not the top down. As the Bible taught, we should \n     be judged on how we treat the ``least of these,'' not how we \n     cater to the most powerful.\n       Even many of Bush's supporters acknowledge he is the \n     reverse: His policies are designed to reward the wealthy and \n     serve the corporate interests that pay for his party. On his \n     watch, we've mortgaged the store to lavish tax breaks on the \n     wealthy, even as support for the poor has been cut, and \n     working people have been abandoned.\n       Dr. King devoted his life to fighting against poverty, for \n     peace; against racism, for equal opportunity. In the midst of \n     the Vietnam War, he courageously challenged America's \n     wrongheaded intervention, and warned of the moral poverty of \n     a country that spent more on its military than on its people.\n       Bush's priorities are literally the reverse. He has done \n     nothing as poverty has worsened, while finding his \n     ``mission'' in endless wars abroad. He'll spend over $200 \n     billion toppling Saddam Hussein, while cutting back on \n     programs designed to give every child a healthy start.\n       Dr. King's politics came from his deep and abiding faith. \n     Bush's faith seems defined by his politics. King spoke in \n     pulpit after pulpit challenging the faithful to join the \n     movement for social change. Bush, at his best,\n\n[[Page S173]]\n\n     goes to churches to preach social service, urging the \n     congregation to accept the status quo and help minister to \n     its victims. Like Moses, King led his people out of \n     oppression. Like Pharaoh, Bush urges people to adjust to \n     their condition.\n       Dr. King's legacy is as important today as at his death \n     because things haven't gotten much better. A report by United \n     for a Fair Economy shows racial inequities in unemployment, \n     family income, imprisonment, average wealth and infant \n     mortality have gotten worse since he died. And progress in \n     areas like poverty, homeownership, education, and life \n     expectancy has been so slow it will take literally centuries \n     to close the gap.\n       As Americans celebrate Dr. King's birthday and listen to \n     President Bush's State of the Union address tonight, we must \n     remember King's warning of the moral peril of a nation that \n     fails to create opportunity for all of its people.\n       No longer do we hear of a War on Poverty, which as Dr. King \n     noted was ``barely a skirmish'' before abandoned for war \n     abroad. Instead, as Dedrick Muhammad, author of the UFE \n     report, observed: We are left with a ``compassionate \n     conservatism, which has been very conservative in its \n     compassion.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 19, 2004]\n\n                        The Pickering Precedent\n\n       President Bush's recess appointment of Charles Pickering \n     Sr. to the federal appeals bench last Friday is a welcome \n     move, not least because it shows he's willing to carry the \n     fight over judicial nominees from here to November. Mr. \n     Pickering will now get the honor of serving a year on the \n     Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, and at 66 years old might \n     well make this his career coda. The Mississippi judge was one \n     of Mr. Bush's first nominees, in May 2001, and has always had \n     confirmation support from a bipartisan majority of Senators. \n     But he has been denied a floor vote by a minority filibuster \n     orchestrated by Northeastern liberals Ted Kennedy, Hillary \n     Rodham Clinton and her junior New York partner Chuck Schumer.\n       Mr. Bush has every right, even an obligation, to use his \n     recess power to counter this unprecedented abuse of the \n     Senate's advice and consent power. A filibuster has never \n     before in U.S. history been used to defeat an appellate court \n     nominee, but Democrats have used it against six of Mr. Bush's \n     choices. All of them have enough bipartisan support to be \n     confirmed if they could only get a full Senate vote.\n       One of the more despicable elements of the anti-Pickering \n     smear has been the use of the race card, even though the \n     judge has the support of the African-Americans who know him \n     best, including the Mississippi chapter of the NAACP. Mr. \n     Pickering sent his children to the newly integrated public \n     schools in that state in the 1960s, and he helped the FBI in \n     prosecutions of the KKK, testifying against the imperial \n     wizard in 1967 at some personal risk.\n       But these facts are irrelevant to liberals who are panicked \n     after their recent election defeats and are clinging to their \n     last lever of national power through the appointed judiciary. \n     They're hoping the public won't notice or care much about \n     this power play, which means that Mr. Bush and Republicans \n     will have to keep the issue front and center. Five Southern \n     Senate seats are open this year, and voters in those states \n     in particular deserve to know how much the bicoastal \n     Democratic liberals despise their values.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/22/senate-section/article/S173-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S173-S174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   ELECTRIC RELIABILITY ACT OF 2004 AND ELECTRICITY NEEDS RULES AND \n                           OVERSIGHT NOW ACT\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I would like to express my support for \ntwo bills that my colleague, the junior Senator from Washington, \nintroduced this week and that I am pleased to cosponsor: the Electric \nReliability Act of 2004 and the Electricity Needs Rules and Oversight \nNow Act, or ENRON Act. I strongly believe that the country needs to \nachieve a balanced national energy policy. An essential part of a \nnational energy policy should be to ensure electricity reliability and \nto protect consumers from energy market manipulation. If Congress \ncannot agree on an omnibus energy bill, then we must act to pass these \nstand-alone bills on electricity reliability and market manipulation.\n  Our citizens deserve a reliable, safe power grid. This is one of the \ncountry's most pressing energy needs. We have to do all that we can to \nprevent blackouts like the one that hit the east coast and Midwest last \nAugust and the Electric Reliability Act of 2004 takes a crucial step \ntoward that goal. The bill grants the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission--FERC--the explicit authority to create mandatory electric \nreliability standards. FERC can also approve the formation of electric \nreliability organizations, which will, subject to FERC review, enforce \nthese standards. Strong and enforceable electric reliability standards \nwill help ensure that our citizens and businesses do not have to worry \nabout their respective lives and livelihoods being disrupted by \nblackouts.\n  In fact, a joint investigation by a United States-Canadian task force \nfound that the lack of mandatory reliability standards contributed to \nthe August 14, 2003, blackout. This massive outage affected 50 million \npeople in eight U.S. States and parts of Canada. The task force report \nfound that an Ohio-based utility and regional grid manager together \nviolated at least six reliability standards on the day of the blackout. \nExamples of the reliability violations that contributed to the blackout \nincluded: not reacting to a power line failure within 30 minutes, not \nnotifying nearby systems of the transmission problems, failing to \nanalyze what was happening to the grid, inadequately training \noperators, and failing to adequately monitor transmission stations. \nSince the industry is largely self-regulated, violations of these \nvoluntary reliability standards carry no penalties.\n  In testimony before the Senate Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on \nOversight of Government Management last fall, regulators declared that \nenforceable reliability standards are vital to a secure power grid. \nThis bill is an important step toward that goal. It provides for \nenforceable, mandatory electric reliability standards to ensure that \nour Nation has a secure, reliable power grid.\n  In addition to securing our Nation's power grid, we must protect \nconsumers from energy market manipulation. We cannot let the market \nabuses that took place during the Western energy crisis a few years ago \nhappen again. The ENRON Act would prohibit the use of manipulative \npractices like the schemes used by Enron and other energy traders that \nraised prices and put consumers, and the reliability of the electric \ntransmission grid, at risk. We learned from this crisis that \nelectricity markets need close Government oversight to ensure that \ncompanies do not engage in risky trading schemes leading to soaring \nenergy prices and their own possible financial failure. In both cases, \nconsumers--the people who depend upon the electricity these companies \ngenerate or trade--are the losers.\n  Energy market manipulation crippled the west coast during 2000-2001. \nJust last month, a former energy trader pleaded guilty to manipulating \nnatural gas markets 2 years ago during the west coast power crisis. \nThis trader admitted to supplying false reports to trade industry \npublications that calculate the price of natural gas indexes, which are \nused by derivative traders to buy and sell natural gas futures and \nreal-time transactions. This manipulation apparently benefitted the \nenergy company at the expense of energy consumers.\n  Other Enron-style trading practices include ``ricochet'' electricity \ndeals. In a ricochet transaction, Enron sent California-generated power \nto another company. The electricity was then sold back to California, \nbut billed as being generated outside the State. Prosecutors state that \nthis practice allowed Enron to evade California electricity price caps. \nThere is also the ``Death Star'' trading scheme. Apparently, Enron \nattempted to generate revenue by fraudulently charging fees for \nservices Enron did not provide. Enron charged California for \nelectricity that was not delivered. Charging the State for undelivered \npower prevented the State from alleviating backlogged transmission \nlines. This market manipulation scheme was especially harmful since it \ncame at a time when part of the State experienced rolling blackouts.\n  In June, FERC deprived Enron of its right to trade power and natural \ngas. Even though the company is barred from the energy-trading industry \nit helped create, market manipulation remains a threat to consumers. In \nDecember 2003, another energy company agreed to pay $1.7 billion to \nresolve market manipulation claims brought by the California Public \nUtilities Commission and various business and residential consumers. \nOther companies allegedly bought and sold natural gas simultaneously at \nthe same price to make demand appear greater.\n  The ENRON legislation requires the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission to prohibit the use of manipulative practices like these \nthat put at\n\n[[Page S174]]\n\nrisk consumers and the reliability of the transmission grid. The Senate \nrecently went on record in support of barring abusive market practices \nwhen it approved an amendment to the fiscal year 2004 agricultural \nappropriations bill offered by Senator Cantwell. I am disappointed that \nthis language was stripped from the omnibus spending bill.\n  I think the August blackout should make clear to all of my colleagues \nthe need for improvements in the power grid system. We need to make the \nelectric grid safer and more reliable for all Americans and we also \nneed to prevent manipulation of electricity markets. For those reasons, \nI encourage the Senate to move forward and act quickly with respect to \nthese bills.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/22/senate-section/article/S174-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S174-S175]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE NEED FOR COUNTRY-OF-ORIGIN LABELING\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I rise today to speak about country-of-\norigin-labeling, an issue of critical importance to farmers, ranchers \nand the consumers in our great country.\n  Yet even as our country grapples with its first case of mad cow \ndisease, the Republican leadership and special interest groups aligned \nwith the packing industry celebrate the possible delay in the \nimplementation of my country-of-origin labeling law.\n  Yes, country-of-origin labeling is the law. We voted on it and it was \nincluded in the last farm bill. Yet today I stand before you, concerned \nthat an action in the dead of night by certain House members will sink \nthis law, a law that is good for consumers of beef as well as producers \nof beef.\n  Country-of-origin-labeling will help American producers market their \nbeef as the superior product we know that it to be. It will also help \nAmerican producers choose a product they know is safe while avoiding \nforeign product produced without the safeguards provided by the United \nStates Department of Agriculture.\n  Just a few weeks ago it was discovered that a cow from Canada was \ndiscovered with mad cow disease, yet consumers have no way to \ndistinguish meat from a Canadian cow from meat from an American or \nMexican cow.\n  As recent events have shown Americans still have confidence in \nAmerican beef and we must give them the ability to choose that beef. \nThis law is also critical to our ability to begin exporting beef to \ncountries, such as Japan, that closed their border to our beef after \nthe recent case of mad cow in Washington State. Forty-eight out of 57 \nof the United States' largest trading partners, including Japan, have \ncountry of origin labeling. Why can't we? I ask, why can't we?\n  It dismays me, that there are people opposed to this law. It will \nallow consumers to make their own decisions about food safety, a \ncritical issue in today's world of weapons of mass destruction and \nterrorism.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record an article written by \nLee Pitts titled ``Who Killed COOL?''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Who Killed COOL?\n\n                             (By Lee Pitts)\n\n       COOL has been universally praised by producer and consumer \n     organizations alike. The overwhelming majority of farmers and \n     ranchers supported it and COOL even had bipartisan support in \n     Congress. So what went wrong? Who killed COOL?\n       Here's a Most Wanted list of the thieves who stole COOL \n     from us and killed it in cold blood until COOL is deader than \n     a can of Argentinean corned beef.\n\n\n                       the man who would be king\n\n       To see who killed COOL just follow the money. And we can \n     start right at the top. George Bush has been vehemently \n     against COOL from the beginning. But one wonders why Bush \n     would feel so passionate about legislation and use up \n     political capital on something that will anger the very \n     people who helped elect him in a very tight presidential \n     race. Surely Bush must have had good reason to betray us? In \n     fact, he had had millions of reasons. Plain and simple . . . \n     Bush sold out to BIG business.\n       Remember this name: Tom Hicks. According to Forbes Magazine \n     Mr. Hicks is the 350th richest man in America with an \n     estimated net worth of $750 million. Hicks heads up a \n     leveraged buyout outfit called Hicks, Muse, Tate and Furst. \n     One of their better deals was buying Dr Pepper and 7-Up for \n     $45 million and selling it after two years for $700 million. \n     Hicks is also the man who made our current President a \n     multimillionaire by buying the Texas Rangers from a group \n     that included George W. In some circles Mr. Hicks is known as \n     ``The man behind the throne at the White House.''\n       In May, 2002, Hicks, Muse, Tate and Furst bought 54 percent \n     interest, along with ConAgra, in Australia Meat Holdings, \n     that country's largest meat processing company. Needless to \n     say, the firm sends a lot of meat in this direction. Do you \n     think Mr. Hicks' meat packing interests might have anything \n     to do with Bush's concern about COOL? If Mr. Hicks calls \n     Bush, I wonder, does he have any trouble getting through?\n       The Texas Cattle Feeders, no doubt, also leaned on their \n     favorite son. The TCFA's members import thousands of Mexican \n     steers every year into the U.S. where they would like to \n     continue passing them off as domestics. Don't you find it \n     interesting that the Representative who came up with the \n     legislation to delay COOL for one year, Mr. Bonilla, was a \n     Texas House member. In the Senate there was a similar attempt \n     by Senator Cornryn. Surprise, surprise . . . Mr. Cornryn is \n     from Texas too.\n\n\n                 usda: United States department of ann\n\n       If you're looking for the killers of COOL you can take a \n     line from Casablanca and, ``Round up the usual suspects.'' \n     Ann Veneman and her cronies at the USDA surely are guilty. We \n     all know by now that Veneman is a free trader, that's why \n     she's currently trying to rewrite the rule book to reopen the \n     border with Canada to live cattle. COOL could be an \n     impediment to Veneman's vision of one global marketplace.\n       We shouldn't be surprised by Ann's actions, she's sold us \n     out before. Like with mandatory price reporting. USDA \n     officials said COOL is a bad idea because ``there is no \n     definitive data available to quantitative the benefits of \n     COOL.'' In one voluminous COOL report there was page after \n     page of reasons why COOL is bad but there was not a single \n     sentence suggesting a benefit. If one didn't know better, a \n     casual observer might think the USDA was being biased. You \n     think?\n       The USDA completely ignored a University of Florida study \n     that outlined the many benefits of COOL. The USDA came up \n     with cost estimates between $582 million and $3.9 billion but \n     it was always the higher figure they quoted. The Florida \n     study concluded that COOL would cost a fraction of that and \n     said consumers would be given a choice and producers would \n     benefit by increased demand for U.S. produced food. All good! \n     At exactly the same time Veneman saw no benefits to COOL, \n     Japan and Korea were making it clear they wanted only U.S. \n     labeled beef. Also, at the same time a hepatitis outbreak was \n     killing three people and sickening 259 in Georgia and 16 \n     people in North Carolina. The feds aren't completely sure \n     the same strain sickened 600 people in Pennsylvania in the \n     Nation's biggest known outbreak of the disease. But they \n     are sure it was Mexican onions that caused the outbreaks \n     in Georgia, Tennessee and North Carolina. Gosh, if only \n     the onions were labeled so consumers could decide for \n     themselves if they wanted to risk death by liver failure.\n       If she had bothered to look Veneman could have also seen at \n     least one major benefit from COOL by looking northward to her \n     Canadian buddies. They started labeling their beef after the \n     Mad Cow scare and it paid off big time when Canadian \n     consumers started eating more domestic beef to show their \n     support for the domestic industry.\n       And how's this for irony: A couple days after killing COOL \n     the feds announced they were launching a major initiative to \n     track food imports for national security reasons!\n\n\n                            the meat we eat\n\n       The food processing industry hates COOL because their \n     business models are based on being able to buy product \n     anywhere around the globe, wherever it is the cheapest. Then \n     they have a U.S. inspection stamp placed on it and mix it in \n     with domestic product. If you doubt that multinationals would \n     have the breadbasket of the world turned into a beggar nation \n     consider that 11.6% of beef eaten in the U.S. is imported, \n     40% of lamb, 16.6% of all vegetables, 23.1% of fresh and \n     frozen fruit, and even 10% of wheat and wheat products. Talk \n     about carrying coal to Newcastle!\n       Meat packers don't want COOL because it would diminish the \n     profits they are making on cheap imports, like the obscene \n     profits they are now making on Canadian boxed beef. COOL \n     would derail this business model. So when COOL legislation \n     passed all the hurdles and road blocks and looked like it \n     would become a reality the packers were willing to resort to \n     dirty politics in an effort to kill it.\n       First the packers said it would cost too much. What they \n     should have said it would cost THEM too much if they had to \n     start buying more U.S. beef because consumers were demanding \n     it. We know exactly how much extra COOL will cost ranchers. \n     You can currently get your calves verified as born and raised \n     in the U.S. using a USDA approved process for 50 cents \n     apiece. That's half of the beef checkoff buck. That \n     doesn't seem like too much, does it?\n       Globalists hate COOL because it will build demand for U.S. \n     products, exactly what they don't want. COOL would dampen \n     their plans to outsource production to the cheapest supplier \n     because the only place to get U.S. products is guess where? \n     U.S.\n\n\n                            the bottom line\n\n       Ann Veneman herself helped identify some of the culprits \n     who killed COOL. She fingered the NCBA, the National Pork \n     Producers Council and the United Fresh Fruit\n\n[[Page S175]]\n\n     and Vegetable Association as the groups responsible for \n     blocking its implementation. Yes, the primary contractor for \n     your checkoff dollars, an outfit that may not even exist \n     without your beef bucks, the NCBA, stabbed you right in the \n     back. Again.\n       In the 2004 election cycle so far, agribusiness interests \n     have given President Bush $1.8 million--ten times as much as \n     the next recipient. The NCBA is one of the top agribusiness \n     contributors. They even gave Bush a cowboy hat at their \n     convention.\n       After the Conference Committee derailed COOL the NCBA \n     issued a press release saying, ``Congress carefully \n     considered possible dangers of the law before delaying \n     implementation for two years.'' Chandler Keys, NCBA's \n     lobbyist said that mandatory labeling would damage trade \n     relations with Mexico. (Although Mexico currently requires \n     country of origin labeling of U.S. beef exports.) NCBA \n     President Eric Davis said, ``Many producers were concerned \n     that these mandatory regulations could have a negative effect \n     on their bottom line.''\n       Leo McDonnell of R-CALF had a different viewpoint: \n     ``Despite NCBA's claim that independent cattle producers do \n     not want mandatory country of origin labeling, 76 U.S. cattle \n     associations, representing 26 states and including 17 NCBA \n     state affiliates, worked with R-CALIF USA to pass mandatory \n     COOL in the 2002 Farm Bill.''\n       In every poll this reporter has seen an overwhelming \n     majority of ranchers and consumers voice their support for \n     COOL. Both the American Farm Bureau and the National Farmer's \n     Union supported it. Even the NCBA admits it: ``What our \n     members have told us through votes was they want a \n     country-of-origin labeling program that is beneficial to \n     both them and to the consumers,'' said Jim McAdams, a \n     Texas cattleman and NCBA VP. The NCBA, after killing COOL, \n     then had the audacity to announce it was launching plans \n     to create a VOLUNTARY pilot country-of-origin labeling \n     program that would differentiate U.S. meat products from \n     foreign meat. Dun . . . we already have a voluntary \n     program and it doesn't work.\n       According to Leo McDonnell the real bottom line is this: \n     ``The interests of producers are being compromised by \n     organizations purporting to represent producers, but who \n     actually incorporate the financial interests of packers in \n     their policies'' That's putting it nicely. Other response to \n     the killing of COOL was swift and angry:\n       The New Mexico Stockgrowers had given the NCBA a couple \n     chances to come around but COOL was the last straw. It \n     exposed NCBA once and for all for what they really are: A \n     mouthpiece for the Texas and Kansas cattle feeders and the \n     Big Three packers. The stockgrowers recently voted to end \n     their association with the NCBA because they no longer \n     represent them. (I'd argue they never did.)\n       Fred Stokes of the The Organization of Competitive Markets \n     said: ``Country-of-origin labeling has precipitated a war. \n     Food producers and consumers are on one side with food \n     cartels and their lackeys on the other. Regrettably, the \n     leadership in our government has come down on the wrong \n     side.''\n       NFU President Dave Frederickson said, ``This two-year delay \n     is undoubtedly a tactic to make this widely popular law more \n     vulnerable to repeal after the presidential elections. The \n     delay will effectively kill COOL for meats, fruits and \n     vegetables. Wild fish would be the only food item exempt from \n     the delay, which should prove beneficial for salmon fishermen \n     in Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens' \n     state of Alaska. There is definitely something fishy about \n     this process.''\n       ``This is just another example of the White House and \n     Republican leadership allowing their biggest corporate \n     contributors to set policy,'' responded Presidential \n     candidate Howard Dean. ``Since being elected, George Bush has \n     consistently put the interests of corporate agribusiness \n     ahead of family farmers and rural America.''\n       South Dakota Stockgrowers Assn. President Ken Knuppe said, \n     ``This is a slap in the face to all of the cattle producers \n     who've fought so hard for this legislation. It is clearly a \n     political move, not an attempt to benefit producers or \n     consumers.''\n       Perhaps Paul Ringling, President of the Montana Cattleman's \n     Assn said it best: ``NCBA, packers and USDA have an unholy, \n     incestuous alliance.''\n       Some say the battle over COOL is not yet lost. Although the \n     House approved the Conference Committee report the Senate \n     will vote on it on January 20. But Tom Harkin does not expect \n     COOL to be in the final bill. ``They won't remove COOL . . . \n     they just won't give it any money,'' says Harkin.\n       The only way to override the Conference Committee action is \n     to defeat the omnibus spending bill which would also shut \n     down the federal government. As tempting as that sounds . . . \n     don't count on it happening.\n       If you must do something to voice your displeasure you \n     could dial the phone number (202-456-1111) and give a tape \n     recorder a piece of your mind. And you could quit any group \n     that played a role in COOL's defeat. I've heard some people \n     who are so upset they are going to refuse to pay the \n     checkoff, seeing how it's unconstitutional anyway. For sure \n     you should join R-CALF. As for Bush . . . if the next \n     Presidential election is as close as the last one, Bush may \n     have a lot more time to spend with his ``BIG Bidness'' \n     buddies as a result of his COOLish behavior.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/22/senate-section/article/S175-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S175-S178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMARKS OF DR. JOHN BRADEMAS\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, our distinguished former colleague \nin the House of Representatives, now president emeritus of New York \nUniversity, Dr. John Brademas, delivered an address last month in \nRabat, Morocco, at a conference on ``The Dialogue of Cultures.''\n  The conference, sponsored by the Ministry of Culture of Morocco, \nfocused on the relationships between the West and the Arab world.\n  John Brademas served in Congress, from the State of Indiana, for 22 \nyears--1959-1981--the last 4 as House majority whip. He established a \nparticular reputation for his leadership in writing legislation to \nsupport schools, colleges and universities, libraries and museums, the \narts and humanities, and to provide services for children, the elderly, \nand the disabled.\n  A graduate of Harvard University, Dr. Brademas was a Rhodes scholar \nat Oxford University where he earned a Ph.D. Last year, Oxford \nUniversity awarded Dr. Brademas the honorary degree of doctor of civil \nlaw, with a citation that described him as ``a man of varied talents \nand extraordinary energy, the most practical of academics, the most \nscholarly men of action.''\n  On leaving Congress, Dr. Brademas became president of New York \nUniversity, a position he served from 1981 until 1992, when he became \npresident emeritus, the position he now holds.\n  Mr. President, in light of the great importance of developments \nbetween the United States and Islamic countries, I believe my \ncolleagues will read with interest Dr. Brademas's thoughtful address in \nMorocco, and I ask unanimous consent to have his remarks printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Remarks of Dr. John Brademas on ``Education and Culture: Forces for \n                      Peace in a Troubled World''\n\n       I am for several reasons honored to have been invited by \n     the distinguished Minister of Culture of the Kingdom of \n     Morocco, His Excellency, Mohamed Achaari, to take part in \n     this conference on the theme, ``Is the Dialogue Between \n     Cultures Possible?''\n       This is the first time I have been in Morocco, and my wife \n     and I have immensely enjoyed visiting the famed cities of \n     Casablanca, Fes and Marrakech and seeing some of the wonders \n     of this beautiful country.\n       I have to thank my friend, a brilliant and energetic \n     Moroccan, Karim Errouaki, for having suggested I join you \n     even as I am pleased to see here other friends such as Dr. \n     Federico Mayor, the former Director General of UNESCO; \n     Professors Edward Nell of the New School University, Bernard \n     Lewis of Princeton and my New York University colleague, Noah \n     Feldman.\n       And I greatly value the opportunity to meet the \n     distinguished former Prime Minister of France, Michel Rocard, \n     and so many other eminent political leaders, scholars and \n     writers gathered this weekend at the Kingdom's Royal Academy.\n       As an American, I am well aware that Morocco was the first \n     country, in 1777, to extend diplomatic recognition to the \n     United States, and our two nations have enjoyed friendly and \n     cordial relations now for over 200 years. Secretary of State \n     Colin Powell spoke of this friendship only a few days ago in \n     Marrakech.\n       In light of 9/11, the war in Iraq, the ongoing strife in \n     Afghanistan, the continuing conflict between Israelis and \n     Palestinians, the attacks in Istanbul and elsewhere, there \n     could not be a more appropriate subject to bring us together \n     than ``The Dialogue of Cultures''.\n       My own modest offering today will focus on the \n     contributions to a more peaceful world of the institutions \n     and activities of education and culture.\n       So that you will understand my perspective, please allow me \n     some words of personal background.\n       A native of Midwest America, I am the son of a Greek \n     immigrant father and an Indiana schoolteacher mother. A \n     graduate of Harvard University, I spent three years at Oxford \n     University where I wrote a doctoral dissertation on the \n     anarchist movement in Spain.\n       First elected to the Congress of the United States in 1958, \n     I was ten times reelected, serving, therefore, for 22 years \n     and during the Administrations of six President: three \n     Republicans--Eisenhower, Nixon and Ford; and three \n     Democrats--Kennedy, Johnson and Carter.\n       In Congress I served on the Committee on Education and \n     Labor, where I helped write all the laws enacted between 1959 \n     and 1981 to assist schools, colleges and universities; \n     libraries and museums; the arts and the humanities; and to \n     provide services for children, the elderly, the disabled.\n       In my last four years on Capitol Hill, I was Majority Whip, \n     third-ranking member of the Leadership of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       A Democrat, I was defeated in Ronald Reagan's landslide \n     victory over President Carter in 1980. Shortly thereafter I \n     was invited to\n\n[[Page S176]]\n\n     become president of New York University, now the world's \n     largest private university, a position in which I served \n     until 1992 when I became president emeritus.\n\n\n                          New York University\n\n       In Congress I was author of the International Education Act \n     of 1966, to provide grants to colleges and universities in \n     the United States for study of other countries. On arriving \n     at New York University or, as we call it, NYU, I continued my \n     interest in international education.\n       We established during my presidency the Center for Japan-\n     U.S. Business & Economic Studies in our School of Business; \n     an Onassis Program of Hellenic Studies; the Skirball \n     Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies; a Casa Italiana \n     Zerilli-Marimo; and the King Juan Carlos I of Spain Center \n     for the study of the economics, history and politics of \n     modern Spain.\n       Beyond such centers at NYU--and I have not named all of \n     them--we have also, for example, the Hagop Kevorkian Center \n     for Near Eastern Studies, a leading center in the United \n     States for teaching and research about the Arab world; as \n     well as centers in Florence, London, Madrid, Paris and \n     Prague, and we hope to set up others in Africa and Latin \n     America.\n       I add that 4,400 students from the countries are on our \n     campus this year while nearly 2,000 from NYU are studying \n     abroad.\n       In my judgement, the need for us in the United States to \n     invest in knowledge of other countries and peoples takes on \n     added urgency after the war in Iraq.\n       It is no secret to any of you that the actions of the \n     United States in Iraq have met--and continue to meet--strong \n     opposition in many countries, as President Bush personally \n     observed during his visit to London a few days ago.\n       Here I could cite the report last summer issued by The Pew \n     Research Center, Views of a Changing World. Based on a \n     respected survey, the Pew Report found that ``. . . [I]n most \n     countries, opinions of the U.S. are markedly lower than they \n     were a year ago.''\n       The report continued, ``. . . [T]he war has widened the \n     rift between Americans and Western Europeans, further \n     inflamed the Muslim world, softened support for the war on \n     terrorism and significantly weakened global public support \n     for the pillars of the post-World War II era--the UN and the \n     North Atlantic alliance.''\n       In the United States and Europe, scholars, journalists and \n     public leaders have engaged in all manner of symposia on the \n     tensions between the United States and Europe as well as the \n     sharpened hostility toward America in the Islamic world.\n       Nor, as you are aware, is public opinion in the United \n     States overwhelmingly supportive of President Bush's policies \n     toward Iraq, especially in light of the killing of American \n     and British soldiers and the failure of the Bush \n     Administration to plan effectively for the aftermath of the \n     war.\n       My own view--and I believe that I reflect the opinions of \n     scholars, journalists and many political leaders in our own \n     country and abroad--is that in the war on terrorism and in \n     meeting the other challenges to civil and democratic \n     societies, military power, even when exercised by the \n     strongest nation in history, is not enough.\n\n\n                   ``soft power'' vs. ``hard power''\n\n       Not only does the United States require partners in post-\n     war Iraq as well as in other places of danger but we must \n     also give far more attention to investing in what my friend, \n     Joseph Nye, Dean of the John F. Kennedy School of Government \n     at Harvard, has called, in contrast to hard power, ``soft \n     power''.\n       ``U.S. military power is essential to global stability and \n     is a critical part of the response to terrorism'', Nye \n     agrees. But it is not enough, he adds: ``Soft power rises \n     from the attractiveness of a country's culture, political \n     ideas and policies''.\n       Nye's words were echoed recently by a powerful essay \n     published last October in Madrid's El Pais by Fedrico Mayor, \n     who declared, ``The force of Europe is not the Europe of \n     force . . . [but] the force of the spirit, of creative powers \n     . . . of democratic values . . . of education and culture . . \n     . of conciliation . . . friendship and solidarity among \n     peoples, of openness, of a culture of peace. . . .''\n       In view of what I have already said, you will understand \n     why I was so pleased to have been invited to Rabat for this \n     conference on the relationship between the West and the Arab \n     world.\n       Let me here recall that last year, in New York City, \n     speaking to a group of Ambassadors from Islamic countries \n     assigned to the United Nations, I observed that most \n     Americans had never met a Muslim and that most of us were \n     quite ignorant of the traditions of Islam.\n       Accordingly, I told the Ambassadors, unless you want \n     Americans to think that Islam is represented by Osama Bin \n     Laden, you must give more attention to teaching the best in \n     your religious faith while, on the other hand, those of us \n     who are not Muslims have a similar obligation to listen and \n     to learn.\n\n\n                    rising interest in u.s. in Islam\n\n       In fact, one now finds a burgeoning interest in Islam in \n     the United States. One cannot go into a serious bookshop in \n     New York City without seeing new volumes on Islam.\n       I think, by way of example, of the book Islam: A Mosaic, \n     Not a Monolith by the distinguished president of the Carnegie \n     Corporation of New York, Vartan Gregorian, and of After \n     Jihad: America and the Struggle for Islamic Democracy by Noah \n     Feldman, a brilliant young scholar on the faculty of the NYU \n     Law School, from whom you will hear shortly.\n       And in my country there have appeared in recent months \n     several significant reports dealing with the subject of \n     relations between the West and Arab societies. For example, \n     the Center for the Study of Presidency in Washington, DC last \n     July published An Initiative: Strengthening U.S.-Muslim \n     Communications, focusing on failures on the part of the \n     United States in conducting cultural diplomacy in the Muslim \n     world after 9/11.\n       Only last month, an advisory group chaired by a former U.S. \n     Ambassador, Edward P. Djerejian, submitted to Secretary of \n     State Colin Powell and our Congress a report entitled \n     Changing Minds, Winning Peace: A New Strategic Direction for \n     U.S. Public Diplomacy for the Arab and Muslim World.\n       I cite two other relevant reports: Arts and Minds: Cultural \n     Diplomacy amid Global Tensions, based on a conference held \n     last April at Columbia University and a Council on Foreign \n     Relations statement, Finding America's Voice: A Strategy for \n     Reinvigorating U.S. Public Diplomacy, prepared by a task \n     force chaired by a highly respected business leader, Peter G. \n     Peterson.\n       I must, however, draw your particular attention among this \n     blizzard of reports to one, published only last October by \n     the United Nations Development Program, the Arab Human \n     Development Report 2003: Building a Knowledge Society.\n       This document was written not by Americans or Europeans but \n     by a group of distinguished Arab scholars and opinion \n     leaders.\n       The report, say its authors, is ``once descriptive and \n     prescriptive, with bold recommendations for change and \n     detailed analyses of the current state of education, \n     scientific research, the media, the publishing industry, \n     culture encompassing religion, intellectual heritage and the \n     Arabic language, and other building blocks of a `knowledge \n     society' in the Arab world.''\n\n\n                     an ``arab knowledge society''\n\n       The report speaks of the ``five pillars'' of an ``Arab \n     knowledge society'', including:\n       Guaranteeing the key freedoms of opinion, speech and \n     assembly;\n       The full dissemination of high quality education;\n       Indigenizing science, investing in research and joining the \n     Information Revolution; and\n       Developing an authentic, broadminded and enlightened Arab \n     mode of knowledge.\n       The terrible attacks of recent weeks and months--in \n     Jerusalem, Baghdad, Istanbul and Riyadh--dramatically \n     demonstrate the need for radical change in the Arab world if \n     Arab countries are to look to an era of peaceful development \n     and progress and if we in the non-Islamic world are to live \n     without the omnipresent threat of terrorist activities.\n       Allow me then to assert my conviction that it is imperative \n     that we in the West, and especially in the United States, \n     learn more about countries other than our own but especially, \n     after 9/11, about the Islamic world even as we must encourage \n     Arab societies to take steps to implement the recommendations \n     in the Arab development report of which I have just spoken.\n       For further and immediate context for these several \n     reports, let me cite the eloquent words of His Majesty, King \n     Mohammed VI, two months ago, on October 10, at the opening of \n     the Fall session of the Parliament of Morocco. Speaking of \n     his determination ``to set the democratic process on the \n     right track'', His Majesty declared, ``[T]here can be no \n     democracy where there are no democrats. Democracy is a long, \n     arduous exercise, not some sort of battlefield on which to \n     wage a war for positions. Democracy implies a keen sense of \n     commitment to the notion of citizenship.\n       ``Consolidation of democracy requires that the culture of \n     responsible citizenship be fostered and enhances, a task \n     incumbent upon political parties and civil society. . . .''\n\n\n              king mohammed iv on ``the dignity of women''\n\n       In the same address, King Mohammed drew particular \n     attention to the need for steps to respect, in his words, \n     ``the dignity of women as human beings'', and recalled his \n     own remarks four years earlier: ``. . . [H]ow can society \n     achieve progress'', His Majesty asked, ``while women, who \n     represent half the nation, see their rights violated and \n     suffer as a result of injustice, violence and \n     marginalization, not withstanding the dignity and justice \n     granted them by our glorious religion?''\n       In his statement of December 3, following his meeting with \n     His Majesty, Secretary Powell congratulated the King on the \n     steps Morocco has taken to strengthen democracy such as \n     elections at the regional and parliamentary level and ``bold \n     reforms . . . for the family code.''\n       And as I am quoting the King of the Moroccan people, I note \n     also his words of October 16th this year, in Malaysia, at the \n     10th Summit of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, \n     when His Majesty said: ``. . . [I]n Morocco . . . we have \n     relied on our strong commitment to democracy and our people's \n     unanimous condemnation of terrorism, a phenomenon which is \n     clearly alien to our culture. It is also inconsistent with \n     the tolerant aims of our religion, which forbids the shedding \n     of innocent blood, advocates peaceful coexistence and upholds \n     human dignity. . . .''\n\n[[Page S177]]\n\n       This statement of the King of Morocco is in harmony, I \n     believe, with a comment, also last October, in Amman, Jordan, \n     of His Royal Highness, Prince El Hassan bin Talal, President \n     of the Club of Rome and President of the Arab Thought Forum, \n     who said then: ``. . . [L]et us not forget that we are in a \n     region inhabited by the so-called `people of the Book/ahl al-\n     kitab'--Christians, Jews and Muslims--and whether we pick up \n     the Bible, the Torah or the Qur'an, we will find all of us \n     are taught to practice and promote peace. . . .''\n\n\n               prince hassan of jordan opposes terrorism\n\n       Indeed, only weeks ago, on November 18th, speaking on \n     behalf of the World Conference of Religions for Peace, of \n     which he is Moderator, Prince Hassan declared:\n       ``The despicable attacks this week against two synagogues \n     in Turkey are brutal acts condemned by all people of faith--\n     Jews, Christians, and Muslims alike. . . .\n       ``No religious tradition can or will tolerate these acts. \n     We are united in rejecting terror, the intentional killing of \n     innocent people, whether by individuals or states. . . .\n       ``Muslims, Christians and Jews share a common history. . . \n     .\n       ``In the face of terrorism, all people of faith must \n     redouble their efforts to work together for peace.''\n       Now everyone here knows that a key question being asked in \n     the West is this: Is it possible for a country where the \n     dominant culture is Islamic to have a genuine democracy?\n       Most of you will be aware of the speech that President \n     George Bush delivered in Washington, D.C. last month, on \n     November 6, to mark the 20th anniversary of the founding of \n     the National Endowment for Democracy, an organization that \n     makes grants to private groups, including some in Morocco, \n     that are working for democracy.\n       I was, I should tell you, for seven years chairman of the \n     Endowment.\n       In his speech, President Bush asserted, ``It should be \n     clear to all that Islam--the faith of one-fifth of humanity--\n     is consistent with democratic rule'', and the President went \n     on to quote the words of King Mohammed to the Parliament of \n     Morocco calling for extending rights to women.\n       But President Bush also cited the recent report, of which I \n     have told you, in which Arab scholars warned that the global \n     wave of democracy has ``barely reached the Arab states''.\n       What then is to be done?\n\n\n                  STEPS THE UNITED STATES SHOULD TAKE\n\n       Even as I urge Arab leaders to act to build an ``Arab \n     Knowledge Society,'' there are several steps that, I believe, \n     we in the United States should take.\n       Let me speak of some.\n       First, we must strengthen the programs of educational \n     exchanges between the United States and the Middle East.\n       A year and a half ago, at a conference on the 50th \n     anniversary of AMIDEAST in Marrakech, our Assistant Secretary \n     of State Patricia Harrison observed how many alumni of these \n     exchanges are heads of state or government or have held other \n     important positions of leadership in countries of the Middle \n     East.\n       Secretary Harrison said that the State Department is \n     expanding the number of Fulbright scholarships and \n     fellowships to people from the Middle East to study in the \n     United States and for Americans to study in the Middle East.\n       As we meet in Rabat, let me note that the U.S./Morocco \n     Fulbright program includes faculty and students from both our \n     countries and that the budget is shared by the two sides.\n       Moroccan Fulbright students focus on courses in the U.S. to \n     assist them in their country's economic development.\n       The U.S. scholars who come here are professors, whose \n     experience will strengthen their university teaching back \n     home.\n       Morocco's Fulbright program, by the way, is a leader in a \n     new initiative in the Islamic world, Fulbright Foreign \n     Language Teaching Assistants: young people training to become \n     teachers in Morocco are teaching the Arabic language and Arab \n     culture at colleges and universities in the United States--an \n     exchange positive for both sides.\n       The Moroccan instructors not only teach in American schools \n     but also give talks about Islam and North Africa to other \n     audiences in the United States.\n       The U.S. Department of State also supports citizen \n     exchanges of various kinds--to build leadership in sports, \n     women's and other non-governmental organizations, in \n     journalism and the media, legal reform, the environment, \n     democracy and human rights.\n       Let me add that I think it fortunate that the newly \n     appointed Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy is \n     the distinguished former United States Ambassador to Morocco, \n     Margaret Tutwiler.\n       Certainly we in the U.S. must substantially increase our \n     investment in study of the Arab world.\n\n\n            AN NYU CENTER FOR PUBLIC DIPLOMACY AND DIALOGUE\n\n       Even as I have mentioned the Hagop Kevorkian Center for \n     Near Eastern Studies at NYU, I am very glad to say that New \n     York University has only weeks ago responded to the call of \n     the Advisory Group on Public Diplomacy for the Arab and \n     Muslim World in its report, Changing Minds/Winning Peace, by \n     proposing to create, in consultation with the U.S. State \n     Department, a Center for Public Diplomacy and Dialogue, a \n     center my colleagues at NYU believe will be ``an \n     unprecedented effort to launch a serious and ongoing exchange \n     with the Arab and Muslim world''.\n       Let me tell you what the authors of the proposal hope to \n     do. The Center will offer three approaches.\n       First, there will be three kinds of conferences. An annual \n     conference will bring together Arab and Muslim leaders from \n     the fields of government, business and religion to discuss \n     such topics as civil society, the rule of law, religion, \n     media, democratic institutions and human rights.\n       Second, there will be conferences where U.S., Arab and \n     Muslim professionals such as health officials, scientists, \n     educators, and leaders of non-governmental organizations--can \n     meet for three one-week sessions.\n       Then we hope to have ``Leaders of Tomorrow'' conferences, \n     where young individuals, rising as the next generation of \n     leaders in both the Arab/Muslim world and the United States \n     can get together twice a year.\n       A second approach under the Center's sponsorship: \n     fellowships to bring annually 100 college-age students from \n     Muslim countries to study at NYU, concentrating on law, \n     public service, education, journalism, business and science. \n     Grants of approximately $50,000 per fellow would cover costs.\n       New York University hopes eventually to establish a \n     residential presence on campus--to be called ``Dialogue \n     House''--for some of NYU's finest students and faculty from \n     all fields, who would live with the exchange students from \n     Muslim countries.\n       Because we believe cultural and arts programs are vital to \n     this public diplomacy initiative, we plan exchange programs \n     to bring artists and filmmakers from Arab and Muslim \n     societies to work with their American counterparts. NYU's \n     Tisch School of the Arts already hosts the world's only \n     International Student Film Festival.\n       We want also, in addition to college-age students, to \n     arrange brief exchange visits from high schoolers from Muslim \n     countries to be exposed to an American university and to \n     visit museums, see plays and tour business firms.\n       The third approach we hope to create under this proposal is \n     four-fold.\n       We want to organize, in cooperation with other research \n     libraries in New York City, a Comprehensive Public Diplomacy \n     Resource Center, focusing on the Middle East and open to \n     scholars, students and U.S. government officials, in effect, \n     a clearing house for information on the Arab and Muslim \n     world.\n       We plan, too, a program to preserve and digitize unique \n     books and texts from the Muslim world as well as explore \n     making U.S. texts available in translation for Muslim and \n     Arab countries.\n       We also intend to coordinate teacher-training programs with \n     faculty from other colleges and universities as well as high \n     school teachers to inject components of Arab and Muslim \n     understanding into their courses.\n       Finally, NYU will continue to offer foreign language \n     training in Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, Turkish, Hindi and Urdu.\n       I hasten to say that NYU is not the only university in the \n     United States that seeks to enhance knowledge of Arab and \n     Muslim societies but I have obviously spoken of the \n     institution I know best.\n\n\n         to improve relationship between u.s. and muslim world\n\n       Nor have I begun to exhaust the kinds of activities that \n     can be undertaken in the educational and cultural fields to \n     build understanding between the Arab/Muslim world and the \n     West.\n       Only last summer, at a ``Partners in Humanity'' conference, \n     in Amman, under the leadership of Prince Hassan, 60 leaders \n     convened to produce an action plan to improve the \n     relationship between the United States and the Muslim world.\n       Here I should like to make a point I believe it important \n     for U.S. policymakers to understand. It is not only the words \n     with which we describe our policy but the substance of the \n     policy itself, that is to say, the deeds as well as the \n     message, that will have an impact in the Arab world.\n       Marc Lynch, a scholar at Williams College, in an essay, \n     ``Taking Arabs Seriously'', in the journal Foreign Affairs \n     (September/October 2003), calls for ``a fundamentally \n     different approach to the United States' interaction with \n     [this] region--one that speaks with Arabs rather than at them \n     and tries to engage rather than manipulate''.\n       Lynch added, ``The goal should be to establish the United \n     States, through words and deeds, as an ally of the Arab \n     public in its own demands for liberal reform, rather than \n     making such reform an external imposition.''\n       Among the several recommendations from the October \n     conference in Amman was to bring together ``Christian and \n     Muslim faith-based development and aid professionals and \n     religious leaders to discuss issues of `meeting human needs' \n     ''.\n\n\n                world conference of religions for peace\n\n       I may say in respect of this proposal for inter-faith \n     cooperation that next week I shall be in Rome for a meeting \n     of the International Council of Trustees, of whom I am one, \n     of the World Conference of Religions for Peace, or WCRP, at \n     the Vatican, under the co-chairmanship of Prince Hassan.\n       The other co-chair is Richard Blum, husband of United \n     States Senator Diane Feinstein of California.\n       I add that another trustee of the WCRP is a distinguished \n     Moroccan diplomat, my friend, Ambassador Mokhtar Lamani, \n     Permanent Observer of the Organization of the Islamic \n     Conference to the United Nations.\n\n[[Page S178]]\n\n       We shall meet in Rome--Orthodox, Protestant and Roman \n     Catholic Christians as well as Jews, Muslims and Buddhists to \n     discuss the Geneva Accord and the search for peace in the \n     Middle East.\n       There is one other recommendation form Amman that I \n     applaud, which calls for bringing together ``Presidents of \n     American colleges and universities that are developing or \n     strengthening Islamic studies programs with their \n     counterparts in predominantly Muslim countries who are \n     developing American studies programs.''\n       Ladies and gentlemen, I have not, I realize, begun to touch \n     on all the ways in which the forces of learning and culture, \n     of education and the arts, can contribute to building peace \n     in a troubled world.\n       But I trust that what I have had to say offers some rays of \n     hope at a time when we are surrounded by too much darkness.\n       The distinguished Minister of Culture, Mohamed Achaari, in \n     inviting us all to Morocco, posed the question: ``Is a \n     dialogue between cultures possible?''\n       That we meet here this week in Rabat demonstrates that the \n     answer to the Minister's question is ``Yes!''\n       So let the dialogue deepen . . . and continue!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/22/senate-section/article/S178-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      RECOGNIZING GONZALO MARTINEZ'S DECADE OF SERVICE TO DELAWARE\n\n Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I rise today in recognition of \nGonzalo Martinez for his ten years of service to Delaware. Gonzalo will \nbe leaving us shortly to move to Florida. His leadership and dedication \nover the years have won him the respect and gratitude of our entire \nState. He has been, and remains, a trusted friend.\n   Gonzalo was born in Santiago, Chile. He graduated from the \nUniversity of Chile's School of Law in 1964, and moved to Washington, \nDC, in 1966 to work as a bilingual attorney in the legal department of \nthe Inter-American Development Bank. There, he worked toward the bank's \ngoal of fostering the economic and social development of Latin-America \nand the Caribbean.\n   While visiting a friend in Delaware in the early 1980s, Gonzalo fell \nin love with a house he saw here. He bought the house, and while \ncontinuing to work in Washington, he spent much of his spare time \nremodeling his home in Delaware. After 23 years of hard work at the \nbank, Gonzalo retired and moved to his beloved home in the first State. \nUpon his arrival in Delaware, Gonzalo became an active member of the \nSussex County community.\n   When Gonzalo moved to Delaware, he was approached by the Sussex Arts \nCouncil to help fill the ``black hole'' in Sussex County's Hispanic \ncommunity. He saw a desperate need for community centers, health \nprograms and other services. For years, Gonzalo tried to work with \nagencies and programs. When it became apparent that they were unwilling \nto change and meet the emerging needs of the growing Hispanic \ncommunity, Gonzalo finally partnered with other community advocates to \ncreate new institutions.\n   Gonzalo Martinez is a founding Board Member and a volunteer at El \nCentro Cultural, La Esperanza Community Center, Primeros Pasos Child \nCare Center, and La Red Health Center. Gonzalo believes that through \nthe arts we can create social justice. He founded El Centro Cultural \nand The Hispanic Festival, which attract thousands of people each year. \nLa Esperanza Community Center focuses on immigration services, \ncomprehensive pre- and post-natal care, helping domestic violence \nvictims, English and citizenship classes, and other general translation \nand interpretation services. Primeros Pasos provides safe child-care \nand early childhood education to approximately 50 children a year.\n  Gonzalo is not afraid to take risks to change the status quo and to \nprove how State government and non-profit organizations can work \ntogether to provide more efficient, cost-effective, and culturally \nappropriate services in the community.\n  During my governorship, I had the opportunity to appoint Gonzalo to \nthree councils. When I re-established the Governor's Council on \nHispanic Affairs in February of 1995, I appointed Gonzalo to the \ncouncil. The goal of the council is to advise the Governor and \nSecretary of Health and Social Services on means to improve the \ndelivery of services to the Hispanic community in Delaware.\n  In June of 1995, I also named Gonzalo to the Delaware State Arts \nCouncil. As a member of the State Council, Gonzalo contributed to the \nevaluation of grant applications and actively participated in policy \ndiscussions. Finally, I appointed Gonzalo to the Neighborhood \nAssistance Act Advisory Council in August of 2000. The Neighborhood \nAssistance Act Advisory Council was established to provide guidance and \nrecommendations to the Director of the Economic Development Office and \nthe Tax Appeal Board. Its purpose is to establish program priorities \nand to determine the impoverished areas that are in need of financial \nassistance.\n  More recently, in my first term as a U.S. Senator, Gonzalo Martinez \nhas served on my National Parks Committee, a committee established in \n2003 to recommend the best possible location for a National Park Unit \nhere in Delaware.\n  I respect and admire Gonzalo for his dedication, his passion, and \nmost of all, for his humility. He never takes credit for the \naccomplishments of the organizations. Instead of trying to build one \nlarge organization to meet all of the needs, Gonzalo has partnered with \nothers who have expertise in certain areas to create organizations to \nmeet a specific need. While the partners are all different, and the \norganizations have different missions, the thing they have in common is \nGonzalo Martinez. He sees not only what could be, but what should be.\n  Through Gonzalo's tireless efforts, he has made a profound difference \nin the lives of thousands and enhanced the quality of life for an \nentire State. Upon his departure, he will leave behind a legacy of \ncommitment to public service for both our children and grandchildren \nand for the generations that will follow. I thank him for the \nfriendship that we share, and I congratulate him on a remarkable second \ncareer. I wish him only the very best in all that lies ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/22/senate-section/article/S178-2", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S178-S179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HAL SHROYER\n\n Mr. ALLARD.

Madam President, I recognize the 10th anniversity \nof Public Allies Delaware. This organization is celebrating a decade of \nmobilizing diverse groups of young leaders by both civic participation \nand community outreach. Public Allies Delaware has built a reputation \nfor providing integral community service throughout Delaware. If this \norganization's first decade is any indication of what it will offer in \nthe future, we have much to look forward to.\n  In 1992, a diverse group of young social entrepreneurs were helped by \na number of established community and national leaders to create Public \nAllies. They believed that there were many energetic, talented young \npeople who wanted to address critical issues in their communities and \nthat many organizations and communities could benefit from such \ncontributions to society.\n  Through the signature AmeriCorps program, Public Allies identifies \ntalented young adults from diverse backgrounds and advances their \nleadership through a 10-month program of full-time, paid \napprenticeships in nonprofit organizations, weekly leadership \ntrainings, and team service projects.\n  In order to effectively achieve its goals and uphold its values, the \nprogram consists of apprenticeships, leadership training, and team \nservice projects. The apprenticeships offer Allies the opportunity to \ngain ``real world'' experience through service in nonprofit and public \nagencies. In these apprenticeships, Allies face important issues such \nas youth development, education, and public safety.\n  Furthermore, the leadership training aspect of the program helps \nAllies develop the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities so they \ncan work productively and effectively with people from all walks of \nlife. Through this leadership training, Allies attain skills in \ncommunication, critical thinking, appreciation of diversity, conflict \nresolution, and community asset recognition from a multitude of \ncommunity leaders, professional consultants, and executives from \nnonprofit and corporate organizations.\n  Recognized by the Bush and Clinton administrations as a model for \nnational service, Public Allies has grown to 11 communities nationwide \nin which more than 1,350 Allies have served. Evaluations have \ndemonstrated Public Allies' effectiveness at advancing diverse young \nleaders, strengthening communities, strengthening nonprofits, and \nstrengthening civic participation.\n  In 1994, full-time volunteer Suzanne Sysko, founded the fourth site \nof the fledgling Public Allies national organization in Wilmington, DE. \nWith her father's assistance, she obtained free office space in the PNC \nBuilding on Delaware Avenue. After putting together a strong Board of \nDirectors, she began working with Antoine Allen in the implementation \nof the program. The first class graduated in 1995 with financial \nsupport from five corporations and foundations and a grant from \nAmeriCorps.\n  In the 10 years subsequent to its inception, Public Allies Delaware \nhas made substantial progress in the areas of funding and development. \nIn 1995, the organization was able to successfully secure a 100 percent \nincrease in Public Allies Delaware's Grant-in-Aid allocation from the \nState legislature. By 1998, the board and program staff members were \nable to dramatically increase program funding by obtaining a line item \nin the State of Delaware Department of Labor's operating budget.\n  More recently, in 1999, the program began an invaluable partnership \nwith the University of Delaware's College of Human Resources, Education \nand Public Policy. Through this affiliation, Public Allies Delaware \nalumni are offered the opportunity to supplement the education and \nexperience they gained from the Public Allies program with a full-\ntuition undergraduate or graduate scholarship. To date, program alumni \nhave utilized more than a half million dollars of Federal Government \nscholarship funds and matching fund awards provided by the University \nof Delaware in pursuit of higher education.\n  Currently, Public Allies operates both in Wilmington, DE, and at a \nnew satellite site in Georgetown, DE. The program continues to maintain \na statewide presence through 11 Allies located in Sussex and Kent \nCounties and another 11 located in New Castle County. By presenting a \nvehicle by which young people can both get involved in their community \nand receive scholarship opportunities, Public Allies Delaware has \nprovided an essential service to the State.\n  I thank the Public Allies for all that they do not only in Delaware \nbut all across the country, and I wish them a very happy 10th \nanniversary. I today offer my full support and congratulate them on a \nremarkable decade of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/22/senate-section/article/S179-2", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNITION OF BRIGADIER GENERAL TYMESON\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I rise today to honor an \nexceptional Iowan. On October 20, 2003, Iowa National Guard Assistant \nAdjutant General Jodi S. Tymeson was promoted to the rank of Brigadier \nGeneral. She has the distinct honor of being the first female General \nOfficer in the history of the Iowa National Guard. Her hard work and \ndedication to service are celebrated by this promotion. I want to \nextend my deepest congratulations to Brigadier General Tymeson.\n  Serving in the Iowa Army National Guard for nearly 30 years, she \ncontinues to prove herself a capable and responsible leader and one who \ngarners respect from her colleagues.

BILL SIMPSON, JR.\n\n Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I rise today to honor the memory of \nMr. Bill Simpson. The following speeches, ``The Celebration of the Life \nand Times of Bill Simpson'' and ``Bill's Table,'' were originally \ndelivered after the occasion of Bill Simpson's burial at Arlington \nNational Cemetery by Mr. Bill Simpson III and David Lambert, \nrespectively. I ask consent the speeches be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n         The Celebration of the Life and Times of Bill Simpson\n\n        Thank you for being here today. Our family takes great \n     comfort in your support and kindness through these trying \n     times. We are eternally grateful.\n        Today, I would like to acknowledge the Veteran's Medical \n     Center in Washington, DC. The staff in this great hospice and \n     nursing home provided excellent care to my father, while \n     preserving his dignity in the last days of his life. The \n     patient care staff are angels on earth. They are truly \n     engaged in a labor of love, and that means so much to \n     families who have loved ones under their care.\n        I must also acknowledge the most supportive, faithful and \n     loyal person in our father's life. Our mother, Evelyn, never \n     wavered, not even for a single day.\n        In honor of my father, the Simpson family has established \n     ``The William Simpson Veteran's Assistance Account'' to \n     provide some needed purchases to enhance the lives of those \n     old warriors in their last days on this earth. Donations are \n     appreciated, not only by my family, but also by the veterans \n     and their families.\n        We have also begun to compile some of my father's favorite \n     stories. We have catalogued hundreds of his speeches that \n     were written while serving with the late former Governor Paul \n     B. Johnson of Mississippi, the late Senator James Eastland, \n     former President Jimmy Carter and others when he returned to \n     the private sector. My father loved the power and influence \n     of language and words and it is reflected in his writings and \n     stories.\n        If you have a story from my father's life that you would \n     like to share--or one that we haven't heard--and there are \n     millions, please send them to us. We want to share these \n     stories with his friends and family.\n        This event is being held here at the ``116 Club,'' which \n     is appropriate for many reasons. A celebration of the life \n     and times of\n\n[[Page S180]]\n\n     William Simpson would be incomplete without the 116 Club. \n     This place was his home away from home. It was where he was \n     comfortable. Here he was surrounded by people he truly loved. \n     The people in this room carried him throughout his life. He \n     loved this place. Here were people he truly admired--always \n     sharing good stories and, of course, good food! Once again, \n     we are grateful for your presence here today. It is such a \n     moving testament to my father and we thank you.\n        My father was my closest and most faithful friend. My \n     sister Ellen and I were extremely fortunate, in these times \n     when people thirst for a hero and role model, we didn't have \n     to look very far. We just looked to my father. He was a great \n     father, not only to my sister and me, but as a leader and \n     mentor for so many people--many who are here today.\n        My father was one of the most genuinely modest people that \n     I have ever known. He never stood above people. He never \n     forgot where he came from, and he never forgot or lost sight \n     of his mission to serve--to serve others unselfishly. From \n     his early days in the family seafood factory in Gulfport, \n     Mississippi, he rose to work for the President of the United \n     States, but he never lost his touch with his common roots.\n        My father was a faithful and loyal husband for over 56 \n     years to our mother, Evelyn. Faithful and loyal are words \n     used most to describe him. It is fitting that he was laid to \n     rest in the hallowed ground at Arlington National Cemetery, \n     surrounded by veterans who have faithfully served this \n     country. Our father took the oath of service to the United \n     States of America to heart--it set the course for the rest of \n     his life. Being ``faithful and loyal'' were not mere \n     commodities to be used when it was popular, and then to be \n     cast aside or compromised when it became a burden. These \n     ideals were at the core of the fabric that represented the \n     character of our father. He was ``faithful and loyal'' all \n     his life--when he wore his uniform, when he served \n     Governor Johnson, Senator Eastland, President Carter and \n     his beloved home state of Mississippi and most importantly \n     his family and friends.\n       He would tell me a story many times over in my life and he \n     would say, ``Bill, some of our friends die, and I wish we \n     could do something about it, but we can't, that's life, but \n     what we can control in this life is how you treat your \n     friends. You never quit your friends, even if they lose an \n     election, or are in trouble, or are in need. That's when you \n     need to be there.''\n       For many of us here, he was our Atticus Finch, our \n     backstop, always there with support and counsel, never having \n     to look over your shoulder, because you knew he was there. My \n     father was a man of character and courage. A great author \n     once said ``courage is grace under pressure.'' If that is the \n     case, this man was filed with grace.\n       In the tough times in Mississippi during the Civil Rights \n     Era, my father provided sound, courageous leadership. I know \n     that he prevented bloodshed across the state. He was color-\n     blind when it wasn't popular to be so. I attribute this to \n     his strong faith and love for humanity.\n       Money, fame and power meant nothing to him. He understood \n     the proper use of power to help people, not for self-\n     interest, but as a tool for service; especially for the \n     under-represented. He would captivate crowds with his words \n     and passion. He was gracious, kind, and gentle. He always \n     kept a low profile, while maintaining unshakeable integrity. \n     He was in every sense an American treasure.\n       As Senator Kennedy stated last week on the floor of the \n     Senate, ``Seeing him so often reminded me of those happy \n     times when the Senate was full of friendships and goodwill in \n     spite of huge disagreements on the issues. I know the \n     beautiful memories of his long and productive life will last \n     forever.''\n       We also received a note form Hiram Eastland who told his \n     story better than I can--``What a wonderful life and wealth \n     of friends he had. He deeply touched and brought joy and \n     inspiration to the lives of many people . . . a legendary \n     bedrock character with spirit and good humor . . . keen on \n     Mississippi and Washington insight and stories that will live \n     on in our memories. No man ever loved his family or his state \n     or country more, and no man ever understood, enjoyed, or knew \n     better how to engage and practice the art of politics for the \n     public good than Bill Simpson''.\n       As we say goodbye to this fine and decent man, let us take \n     comfort in his accomplishments and most importantly remember \n     the impact he had on our lives.\n       In closing, I would like to use one of my father's favorite \n     quotes that I think really defined his character--\n\n     The thoughts of others were light and fleeting.\n     Of lover's meeting or luck or fame.\n     Mine were of trouble and mine were steady.\n     So I was ready when trouble came.\n\n      My Father was ready.\n     Thank you.\n\n     lBill Simpson, III, January 12, 2004.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                              Bill's Table\n\n       When we gathered at Bill's table we knew from that twinkle \n     and grin that we were wrapped warm in his welcome. We knew \n     that friendship mattered most, and that our politics could be \n     checked at the door. We knew our day was about to get better \n     because we were going to spend an hour with someone very \n     special. We all knew we were about to be enriched--kindred \n     spirits listening and laughing and learning with Bill.\n       Yes, we listened, we laughed, and we learned. He told us of \n     Governors and sheriffs, of gamblers and rebels, of saints and \n     scoundrels, of Committee Chairmen and of Chairman's \n     Representatives. We heard about politics and politicians and \n     public servants. We learned about Bay of St. Louis and \n     Gulfport and Pass Christian, and, oh, yes, about the wrath of \n     the terrible Camille; he talked of the Mighty River--its \n     mischief and its majesty. Bill shared stories of his Pacific \n     comrades--heroes who saved the world in an Ocean half a world \n     away; of the Chepachet and her amphibious campaigns; of \n     battles and of brave men.\n       He spoke with quiet admiration of those who defined who he \n     was--his family most of all, but also of a Governor named \n     Johnson, of a Senator named Eastland, and of a President \n     named Carter. We heard about the Old South and the New \n     South--this Son of Mississippi had a big hand in both. He \n     talked of striving to build bridges, of civil rights; of \n     justice and of the Department of Justice; of compassion and \n     of reconciliation; of understanding and of progress.\n       But those were all words, and the essence of Bill was not \n     what he said, but who he was. Much more important than his \n     words were what we learned from Bill--and in the spirit of \n     his own lively metaphors the images of his life lessons for \n     us will keep coming back.\n       We learned from Bill that character could be as strong and \n     deep-rooted as his State's live oaks, and that friendships \n     should be as durable and as sweet as an aged bourbon. We \n     learned that trust should be as strong as the Great River \n     levees his generation helped build, and that the embrace of a \n     friend could be as warm as a Delta summer.\n       We learned that loyalty could be as fierce as a Gulf storm, \n     and personal presence as gentle as a family prayer. My own \n     prayer now is that my sons will always have a Bill Simpson in \n     their lives.\n       We thought Bill always would be at his table. Well, take \n     heart. He is still there, and he will be, next month--and \n     next year. There will be no new stories--only those we know \n     by heart--at least 116 of them. And in time they will become \n     richer--as will we--because we had a place at Bill's table.\n\n     David Lambert, January 12, 2004\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/22/senate-section/article/S180-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/22/senate-section/article/S180-2", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/22/senate-section/article/S180-3", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:55 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that pursuant to \nsection 214(a) of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (42 U.S.C. 15344), \nthe Minority Leader appoints Willie L.

A bill to provide for infant crib safety, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President. I rise along with Senator Fitzgerald \nto reintroduce the Infant Crib Safety Act. This legislation is designed \nto reduce injuries and deaths that come from infant crib accidents.\n  Earch year, about 11,500 children ages 2 and under are injured in \ncribs seriously enough to require hospital treatment. Approximately, 26 \nchildren die a year from such injuries, the highest number of deaths \ncaused by nursery-related products.\n  In fact, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, cribs \ncause more deaths than all other nursery items combined.\n  While strict guidelines exist on the manufacture of and sale of new \ncribs, there are millions of cribs sold throughout the U.S. in \n``secondary markets'' such as thrift stores and resale furniture \nstores.\n  As many as half of the 4 million infants born in this country each \nyear are placed in second hand cribs. Many of these used cribs are \nunsafe and should be taken off the market and either repaired or \ndestroyed.\n  These used cribs can have dangerous features such as protruding \ncorner post extensions, missing or broken parts, excessive slat width, \npoor fitting crib sheets, inadequate mattress supports, latches that do \nnot prevent unintentional collapse of the crib. Cribs built before 1978 \nhave a higher lead content than current regulations allow.\n  Let me give you some of the real life examples of the tragedies \ncaused by unsafe cribs.\n  At the age of 23 months, Danny Lineweaver was injured during an \nattempt to climb out of his crib. Danny caught his shirt on a \ndecorative knob on the cornerpost of his crib and hanged himself. \nThough his mother was able to perform CPR the moment she found him, \nDanny lived in a semi-comatose state for 9 years and died in 1993.\n  In another case, Luke Torgerson, a 13-month-old infant, died due to \nan unsafe crib at this daycare facility in Minnesota.\n  Parents should have confidence that a crib is a safe place to leave \nan infant. The design and construction of a baby crib must ensure that \nit is safe to leave an infant while sleeping.\n  Since cribs are the only juvenile product manufactured expressly for \nleaving a child unattended, every necessary measure should be taken to \nensure that the crib is the safest possible environment.\n  The Infant Crib Safety Act keeps unsafe secondhand or hand-me-down \ncribs out of the stream of commerce by prohibiting their sale, resale, \nlease, and use in lodging facilities or day care centers.\n  This bill does not apply to individuals who provide cribs to their \nfriends, or to any type of individual sale of a crib such as at a \ngarage sale. The bill focuses on commercial users. And currently, \ncontrols over cribs provided by transient public lodging establishments \nor sold at thrift stores are non-existent.\n  Studies have shown that hotels and motels continue to use unsafe \ncribs and thrift stores continue to sell them. In the year 2000, the \nNational Safe Kids Campaign did an investigation of cribs used by \nhotels and motels. Spot checks by the Campaign identified unsafe cribs \nin 80 percent of the cribs visited.\n  A year earlier, the Consumer Product Safety Commission found that 12 \npercent of the cribs sold in a survey of thrift stores did not meet \nexisting voluntary industry or Federal safety standards for new cribs.\n  Comparable legislation has already been adopted by a number of \nStates. Eleven States including Arizona, Arkansas, California, \nColorado, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont, \nand Washington have already passed legislation prohibiting the sale of \ncribs that do not meet current safety standards.\n  There is no good reason why cribs in all 50 States should not meet \nthese reasonable safety standards.\n  The legislation is supported by the Consumer Federation of America \nand the Danny Foundation.\n  I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues to turn this \ncommon-sense legislation into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM:\n  S. 2017. A bill to designate the United States courthouse and post \noffice building located at 93 Atocha Street in Ponce, Puerto Rico, and \nthe ``Luis A. Ferre United States Courthouse and Post Office \nBuilding''; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \ndesignate the United States courthouse and post office building at 93 \nAtocha Street in Ponce, Puerto Rico as the ``Luis A. Ferre Courthouse \nand Post Office Building.'' This legislation is meant to honor the \ndistinguished life and career of Mr. Luis A. Ferre, a dedicated \nstatesman and humanitarian of Puerto Rico.\n  Luis A. Ferre was born in 1904 in Ponce, Puerto Rico. During his \nremarkable career, Mr. Ferre was a member of the Constitutional \nConvention of Puerto Rico in 1951, a member of the House of \nRepresentatives of Puerto Rico from 1953-1956, Governor of Puerto Rico \nfrom 1969-1972, as well as the President of the Senate of Puerto Rico \nfrom 1977-1980. Perhaps most remarkable, however, was his commitment to \nhumanitarian and philanthropic activities, which included the founding \nof the Ponce Public Library and the Ponce Museum of Art.\n  In addition to serving the people of Puerto Rico, this building will \nstand as a reminder of the dedicated service Luis A. Ferre provided to \nall Puerto Ricans.\n  I am hopeful that my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill \nand that it will be enacted in the near future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BUNNING:\n  S. 2018. A bill to amend the National Trails System Act to extend the \nLewis and Clark National Historic Trail to include additional sites \nassociated with the preparation or return phase of the expedition, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2018\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prohibit, consistent with Roe v. Wade, the \ninterference by the government with a woman's right to choose to bear a \nchild or terminate a pregnancy, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I am proud to introduce the Freedom \nof Choice Act.\n\n[[Page S187]]\n\n  Thirty-one years ago, the Supreme Court handed down its decision in \nRoe v. Wade. It was a monumental day for women because for the first \ntime, a woman's right to choose whether or not to continue a pregnancy \nwas protected under the constitutional right to privacy. Roe v. Wade \nhas kept women from being forced to continue pregnancies that could \nendanger their health or render them infertile. And for the past 31 \nyears, countless lives have been saved by getting women out of back \nalleys and into safe, clean and legally protected facilities. That is \nwhy I have been fighting throughout my adult life to protect the right \nto choose.\n  However, women's reproductive rights are rapidly eroding. And anti-\nchoice advocates make no secret that their ultimate goal is to overturn \nRoe v. Wade. With just a one-vote margin protecting Roe in the Supreme \nCourt, we cannot afford to take these fundamental rights for granted. \nThe threats we face to our right to choose are real and dangerous.\n  That is why I am introducing new Federal legislation that will \nprotect a woman's right to choose. The Freedom of Choice Act of 2004 \nwould establish a statutory right to choose within the same parameters \narticulated by the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade. Under the bill, women \nwould have the absolute right to choose whether to continue or \nterminate their pregnancies before fetal viability. The bill also \nsupersedes any law, regulation or local ordinance that impinges on a \nwoman's right to choose and prohibits federal and state governments \nfrom discriminating against women, who exercise their right to choose.\n  That means a poor woman cannot be denied the use of Medicaid if she \nchooses to have an abortion. That means that abortions cannot be \nprohibited at public hospitals, thus giving women more options. That \nmeans that we respect a woman's ability to make her own decision and \ndon't force women to attend anti-choice propaganda lectures, which \nsubmit women to misleading information, the purpose of which is to \ndiscourage abortion. That means that women serving our country in the \nmilitary overseas would be able to afford safe abortions that can be \nperformed in a military hospital.\n  We need to take steps to secure our right to choose. Anti-choice is \nanti-woman and anti-equality, and it demonstrates a lack of respect for \nthe intelligence and compassion that women possess.\n  I thank the 10 cosponsors of this legislation--Senators Lautenberg, \nCorzine, Murray, Clinton, Jeffords, Lieberman, Cantwell, Feinstein, \nSarbanes and Mikulski--and I encourage all my colleagues to join this \neffort to write Roe v. Wade into Federal law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. \n        Stabenow, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. \n        Durbin):\n  S. 2021.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on our \n     country, communities all across America have been on the \n     front lines in the war against terrorism on United States \n     soil.\n       (2) Since September 11, 2001, communities have been forced \n     to bear a significant portion of the burden that goes along \n     with the war against terrorism, a burden that local \n     governments should not have to bear alone.\n       (3) Our homeland defense will only be as strong as the \n     weakest link at the State and local level. By providing our \n     communities with the resources and tools they need to bolster \n     emergency response efforts and provide for other emergency \n     response initiatives, we will have a better-prepared home \n     front and a stronger America.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to designate the Federal building located at 250 West \nCherry Street in Carbondale, IL the ``Senator Paul Simon Federal \nBuilding''; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, recently we lost our colleague Paul Simon, \na great public servant and a great friend.\n  At the age of 19, Paul Simon became the Nation's youngest editor-\npublisher when he accepted a Lion's Club challenge to save the Troy \nTribune in Troy, IL. From that start, he built a chain of 13 newspapers \nin southern and central Illinois. He also used his post in the \nnewspaper world to expose criminal activities and in 1951, at age 22, \nhe was called as a key witness to testify before the U.S. Senate's \nCrime Investigating Committee.\n  Paul Simon served the state of Illinois and the United States for \nyears. He is the only individual to have served in both the Illinois \nHouse of Representatives and the Illinois Senate, and the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives and U.S. Senate. He also served as Lieutenant Governor \nfor Illinois. In addition, he served in the U.S. Army.\n  Paul Simon highly valued education and the youth of our Nation. In \naddition to his work in Congress to strengthen public education in \nAmerica, he started the public affairs reporting program at Sangamon \nState University, now the University of Illinois at Springfield. He \nlater became the founder and director of the Public Policy Institute at \nSouthern Illinois University in Carbondale, IL, and taught there for \nmore than 6 years. In addition, Paul Simon wrote over 20 books and \nearned over 50 honorary degrees.\n  From journalism to government to education, Paul Simon set the \nstandard for honesty and caring in public life. He was an unapologetic \nchampion of the less fortunate. He was genuine in his politics, life \nand values.\n  Now those of us who loved and respected him will do our best to carry \non his tradition. We will find many ways, great and small, to honor \nhim.\n  Today, I am introducing companion legislation to a bill Congressman \nJerry Costello has introduced in the House. This bill would designate \nthe federal building at 250 West Cherry Street in Carbondale, IL, as \nthe ``Senator Paul Simon Federal Building.'' I am happy to have Senator \nFitzgerald as a cosponsor of this legislation.\n  Paul Simon moved to Carbondale in 1974, where he was elected to serve \nin the U.S. House of Representatives. He continued to call the \nCarbondale area his home until his death. Naming this building in \nCarbondale after him will help present and future generations remember \nand honor Paul Simon, a great man who lived in and worked for the \npeople of Carbondale and served our federal government with the \ngreatest integrity. I urge my colleagues to work with Congressman \nCostello and me to quickly pass this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2022\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF FEDERAL BUILDING.\n\n       The Federal building located at 250 West Cherry Street in \n     Carbondale, Illinois shall be known and designated as the \n     ``Senator Paul Simon Federal Building''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REFERENCE.\n\n       Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper or \n     other record of the United States to the Federal building \n     referred to in section 1 shall be deemed to be a reference to \n     the Senator Paul Simon Federal Building.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 2023. A bill to limit Department of Defense contracting with firms \nunder investigation by the inspector General of the Department of \nDefense; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation, along with \nmy good friend from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, to ensure that \nAmerican taxpayers are given greater protection when the Defense \nDepartment seeks to procure property or services. The United States is \nspending billions of dollars in its military and reconstruction efforts \nin Iraq and Afghanistan, and much of this money is going to private \ncompanies.\n  The purpose of this legislation is simple. It would ban companies \nunder investigation for procurement abuse and possible criminal conduct \nfrom receiving no-bid defense contracts. By closing a loophole in \ncurrent law, the Department of Defense would no longer be permitted to \nenter into contracts, through a process that does not ensure full and \nopen competition, with contractors simultaneously being investigated by \nthe Pentagon's Office of Inspector General. The legislation also \nprovides that if the President chooses to waive the prohibition in the \ninterest of national security, he must notify Congress with a full and \npublic explanation.\n  While our men and women in the Armed Services are making \nextraordinary sacrifices for this country, companies under \ninvestigation by the Pentagon's Inspector General should be barred from \nlining their pockets with money from no-bid contracts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/22/senate-section/article/S193-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2233.

We have had a very good and productive week in the \nSenate.\n  The President delivered his State of the Union Address Tuesday night, \nwhich is always an uplifting experience for all who have the \nopportunity to participate directly. And very much I express my \nappreciation for his very positive, constructive message as we all work \ntogether to move this country forward. Indeed, as the President said, \nthe state of the Union is strong, and it is confident.\n\n  Today we were able to finish our appropriations work for this fiscal \nyear, really the unfinished business for last year. It took a strong, \nbipartisan vote of 65 to 28. And with that, we adopted the Omnibus \nappropriations conference report, which will allow us to proceed to a \nregular order for this upcoming fiscal year.\n  In a few moments we will be considering and confirming several \nexecutive nominations. We have been working on that over the course of \nthis afternoon. We will continue to discuss further nominations \ntomorrow, and I am very hopeful we will have a number of other \nnominations to be approved tomorrow. I am personally appreciative and \nglad we have been able to continue this process. It is important for us \nto continue that work and bring these nominations forward as soon as \nthey are available.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/22/senate-section/article/S197-4", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S197-S198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m., \nFriday, January 23. I further ask consent that following the prayer and \npledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings \nbe approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their \nuse later in the day, and the Senate then begin a period of morning \nbusiness, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                           Thanking The Pages\n\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Madam President, we have had \na very difficult year that has just been completed. The majority leader \nand those of us who have the honor of serving in the Senate have our \nnames appear in print, we are on television, and people see and know \nwhat we do. But the one reason for our success is these wonderful \npages. I have served now going on 22 years in the Congress, and they \nare just part of our lives. We take them for granted. They do the most \nmenial things but which are so meaningful to us.\n  For example, a lot of times I have meetings in Senator Daschle's \noffice. My office is up on the third floor. These pages have taken my \nbriefcase upstairs 50 times. They bring us water. They make sure the \npeople at the desk have the right amendment. They do so many things \nthat make us look good, and they get no honor or glory for doing this.\n  These pages are juniors in high school. They are going to graduate. \nThe reason I mention this is that they are graduating in the morning \nand we likely, Mr. Leader, will never see these young people again. \nSome of them we will, maybe.\n  But over the years, as I have indicated, I have developed such a \ngreat affection for these wonderful young men and women. They sit on \ndifferent sides of the rostrum: Democrats here, Republicans here. But \nto us they are just wonderful young people, and they are representative \nof what our country is all about.\n  We are here doing the Nation's business and these young people \nrepresent the future. I want each of these young people to know, even \nthough they get none of the glory, how essential they are to the \nrunning of this institution.\n  I know the leader joins me, and I know he will be a speaker in the \nmorning at their graduation.\n  There are just a few people there. Here there are people watching. I \nwant them to know all over the country that this is a long tradition of \nthe Congress to have these young people helping us. We could not make \nit without them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I would like to reinforce what the \nassistant Democratic leader just said in that the operation of this \nbody is dependent on the boys and girls who are here with us. We don't \nhave that opportunity very often to publicly say thank you. It is \nimportant to do that. I will have the opportunity tomorrow to briefly \nthank them and their parents and family members who will be here.\n  I will simply add to what the assistant leader has said: It is a lot \nof hard work being a page. We are here a lot of hours in the day. \nTonight is a reasonable time to get out, 6:20. We start early in the \nmorning at 9:30. That is hard work. On top of that, they are going to \nschool. So they are putting in hours every day and at the same time \ncarrying a heavy workload in high school. At the same time they are \nhere and working, they realize later tonight they will be doing \nhomework, class work. It is pretty remarkable that they are here all \nday allowing us to carry on the Nation's business and facilitating that \nand helping in ways that, if they were not here, this would not be \npossible, or it would take longer and be a lot less efficient, and at \nthe same time they are committing the time and the energy and hard work \nto education, which is a big subject on the floor all the time as we \nwork.\n  It leads me to say thank you. We all have tremendous respect for you. \nIt has been a hard 5 months. We know that. We thank you for that. The \ncurriculum itself is fascinating here because at the same time they are \nlearning from great teachers through the Senate in terms of formal \neducation, they are picking up what makes this great democracy the \nshining light that it is for the world.\n  Mr. REID. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/22/senate-section/article/S198-3", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
