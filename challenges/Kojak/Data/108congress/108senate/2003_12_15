Mr. President, in October of this year, the majority leader \nsought to proceed to the Class Action Fairness Act, S. 1751.\n  I joined 40 of my colleagues in opposing the motion to proceed. I \nsaid at the time that while I supported some reform of class action \nprocedures, I could not support S. 1751 in its current form. I also \nexpressed concern about whether there would be any meaningful \nopportunity for interested Senators to negotiate changes to the bill in \na bipartisan fashion.\n  Subsequent to the vote in October, I joined with three of my \ncolleagues in sending a letter to the majority leader on November 14, \n2003. In that letter, we reiterated our interest in class action reform \nand we outlined several areas where we believed revisions to S. 1751 \nwere in order.\n  In November, Senators Landrieu, Schumer, and I entered into \ndiscussions with Senators Frist, Hatch, Grassley, Kohl, and Carper. \nThose discussions have resulted in a compromise agreed to by our eight \noffices that I believe significantly improves upon S. 1751. I ask that \nthe text of that compromise to printed in the Record immediately \nfollowing my statement. I also ask that a summary of the compromise \nproduced by my office be printed following my statement.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, I want to point out that in my view this is a \ndelicate compromise, which addresses the shortcomings of current class \naction practice while at the same time protecting the right of citizens \nto join with fellow citizens to seek the redress of grievances in the \ncourts of our Nation. As I and my colleagues said in our letter of \nNovember 14, it is ``critical'' that this agreement ``be honored as the \nbill moves forward--both in and beyond the Senate.''\n  The material follows.\n\n                                S. 1751\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Class action lawsuits are an important and valuable \n     part of the legal system when they permit the fair and \n     efficient resolution of legitimate claims of numerous parties \n     by allowing the claims to be aggregated into a single action \n     against a defendant that has allegedly caused harm.\n       (2) Over the past decade, there have been abuses of the \n     class action device that have--\n       (A) harmed class members with legitimate claims and \n     defendants that have acted responsibly;\n       (B) adversely affected interstate commerce; and\n       (C) undermined public respect for our judicial system.\n       (3) Class members often receive little or no benefit from \n     class actions, and are sometimes harmed, such as where--\n       (A) counsel are awarded large fees, while leaving class \n     members with coupons or other awards of little or no value;\n       (B) unjustified awards are made to certain plaintiffs at \n     the expense of other class members; and\n       (C) confusing notices are published that prevent class \n     members from being able to fully understand and effectively \n     exercise their rights.\n       (4) Abuses in class actions undermine the national judicial \n     system, the free flow of interstate commerce, and the concept \n     of diversity jurisdiction as intended by the framers of the \n     United States Constitution, in that State and local courts \n     are--\n       (A) keeping cases of national importance out of Federal \n     court;\n       (B) sometimes acting in ways that demonstrate bias against \n     out-of-State defendants; and\n       (C) making judgments that impose their view of the law on \n     other States and bind the rights of the residents of those \n     States.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) assure fair and prompt recoveries for class members \n     with legitimate claims;\n       (2) restore the intent of the framers of the United States \n     Constitution by providing for Federal court consideration of \n     interstate cases of national importance under diversity \n     jurisdiction; and\n       (3) benefit society by encouraging innovation and lowering \n     consumer prices.\n\n      SEC. 3.

The court, in its \n     discretion, may also require that a proposed settlement \n     agreement provide for the distribution of a portion of the \n     value of unclaimed coupons to 1 or more charitable or \n     governmental organizations, as agreed to by the parties. The \n     distribution and redemption of any proceeds under this \n     subsection shall not be used to calculate attorneys' fees \n     under this section.\n\n     ``Sec. 1713. Protection against loss by class members\n\n       ``The court may approve a proposed settlement under which \n     any class member is obligated to pay sums to class counsel \n     that would result in a net loss to the class member only if \n     the court makes a written finding that nonmonetary benefits \n     to the class member substantially outweigh the monetary loss.\n\n     ``Sec. 1714.

The compromise \n     proposal also adds a provision permitting federal courts to \n     require that settlement agreements provide for charitable \n     distribution of unclaimed coupon values.\n\n\n the compromise eliminates the so-called bounty prohibition in s. 1751\n\n       S. 1751 would have prevented civil rights and consumer \n     plaintiffs from being compensated for the particular \n     hardships they endure as a result of initiating and pursuing \n     litigation.\n       The compromise deletes the so-called ``bounty provision'' \n     in S. 1751, thereby allowing plaintiffs to receive special \n     relief for enduring special hardships as class members.\n\n\n Thie compromise eliminates the potential for notification burden and \n                               confusion\n\n       S. 1751 would have created a complicated set of \n     unnecessarily burdensome notice requirements for notice to \n     potential class members. The compromise eliminates this \n     unnecessary burden and preserves current federal law related \n     to class notification.\n\n\n        the compromise provides for greater judicial discretion\n\n       S. 1751 included several factors to be considered by \n     district courts in deciding whether to exercise jurisdiction \n     over class action in which between one-third and two-thirds \n     of the proposed class members and all primary defendants are \n     citizens of the same state.\n       The compromise provides for broader discretion by \n     authorizing federal courts to consider any ``distinct'' nexus \n     between (a) the forum where the action was brought and (b) \n     the class members, the alleged harm, or the defendants. The \n     proposal also limits a court's authority to base federal \n     jurisdiction on the existence of similar class actions filed \n     in other states by disallowing consideration of other cases \n     that are more than three years old.\n\n\n        the compromise expands the local class action exception\n\n       S. 1751 established an exception to prevent removal of a \n     class action to federal court when 2/3 of the plaintiffs are \n     from the state where the action was brought and the ``primary \n     defendants'' are also from that state (the Feinstein \n     formula). The compromise retains the Feinstein formula and \n     creates a second exception that allows case to remain in \n     state court if: (1) more than 2/3 of class members are \n     citizens of the forum state; (2) there is at least one in-\n     state defendant from whom significant relief is caught and \n     who contributed significantly to the alleged harm; (3) the \n     principal injuries happened within the state where the action \n     was filed; and (4) no other class action asserting the\n\n[[Page S16221]]\n\n     same or similar factual allegations against any of the \n     defendants on behalf of the same or other persons has been \n     filed during the preceding three years.\n\n\n the compromise creates a bright line for determining class composition\n\n       S. 1751 was silent on when class composition could be \n     measured and arguable would have allowed class composition to \n     be challenged at any time during the life of the case. The \n     compromise clarifies that citizenship of proposed class \n     members is to be determined on the date plaintiffs filed \n     the original complaint, or if there is no federal \n     jurisdiction over the first complaint, when plaintiffs \n     serve an amended complaint or other paper indicating the \n     existence of federal jurisdiction.\n\n\n        the compromise eliminates the ``merry-go-round'' problem\n\n       S. 1751 would have required federal courts to dismiss class \n     actions if the court determined that the case did not meet \n     Rule 23 requirements. The compromise eliminates the dismissal \n     requirement, giving federal courts discretion to handle Rule \n     23-ineligible cases appropriately. Potentially meritorious \n     suits will thus not be automatically dismissed simply because \n     they fail to comply with the class certification requirements \n     of Rule 23.\n\n\n         the compromise improvements treatment of mass actions\n\n       S. 1751 would have treated all mass actions involving over \n     100 claimants as if they were class actions. The compromise \n     makes several changes to treat mass actions more like \n     individual cases than like class actions when appropriate.\n       The compromise changes the jurisdictional amount \n     requirement. Federal jurisdiction shall only exist over these \n     persons whose claims satisfy the normal diversity \n     jurisdictional amount requirement for individual actions \n     under current law (presently $75,000).\n       The compromise expands the ``single sudden accident'' \n     exception so that federal jurisdiction shall not exist over \n     mass actions in which all claims arise from any ``event or \n     occurrence'' that happened in the state where the action was \n     filed and that allegedly resulted in injuries in that state \n     or in a contiguous state. The proposal also added a provision \n     clarifying that there is no federal jurisdiction under the \n     mass action provision for claims that have been consolidated \n     solely for pretrial purposes.\n\n\n  the compromise eliminates the potential for abusive plaintiff class \n                                removals\n\n       S. 1751 would have changed current law by allowing any \n     plaintiff class member to remove a case to federal court even \n     if all other class members wanted the case to remain in state \n     court. The compromise retains current law--allowing \n     individual plaintiffs to opt out of class actions, but not \n     allowing them to force entire classes into federal court.\n\n\n the compromise eliminates the potential for abusive appeals of remand \n                                 orders\n\n       S. 1751 would have allowed defendants to seek unlimited \n     appellate review of federal court orders remanding cases to \n     state courts. If a defendant requested an appeal, the federal \n     courts would have been required to hear the appeal and the \n     appeals could have taken months or even years to complete.\n       The compromise makes two improvements: (1) grants the \n     federal courts discretion to refuse to hear an appeal if the \n     appeal is not in the interest of justice; (2) Establishes \n     tight deadlines for completion of any appeals so that no case \n     can be delayed more than 77 days, unless all parties agree to \n     a longer period.\n\n\nthe compromise preserves the rulemaking authority of supreme court and \n                          judicial conference\n\n       The compromise clarifies that nothing in the bill restricts \n     the authority of the Judicial Conference and Supreme Court to \n     implement new rules relating to class actions.\n\n\n                   the compromise is not retroactive\n\n       Unlike the House Bill, the compromise will not \n     retroactively change the rules governing jurisdiction over \n     class actions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/12/15/senate-section/article/S16221-1", "month": "12", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES\n\n  Following is the federal campaign contribution report for David C. \nMulford, of Illinois, to be Ambassador Extraordinary and \nPlenipotentiary of the United States of America to India who was \ndischarged from the Committee on Foreign Relations and confirmed by the \nSenate on December 9, 2003.\n\n       Nominee: David C.
