Madam President, today the Senate will be in a period of \nmorning business until 10 a.m. At 10 o'clock, the Senate will resume \nconsideration of S. 1, the prescription drug benefits bill.\n  Yesterday afternoon, a number of Senators came to the floor to begin \nthis historic debate. I hope many Members will participate and will \ncontinue to make, over the course of today, their opening statements on \nthis important piece of legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be open for debate only until \nthe hour of 2:15 today, and further, that the time until 2:15 be \nequally divided between the two managers or their designees.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Today, the Senate will be in recess from 12:30 until 2:15 \nfor the weekly party lunches. Rollcall votes are possible during \ntoday's session, and we will notify all Members as these votes are \nscheduled over the course of the day.\n  Madam President, we will be turning our attention to Medicare \nshortly, and we will be focused on this significant, important piece of \nlegislation for the next several days. Indeed, we will stay on this \nbill until we vote on its passage. As I looked over the progress from \nlast week, I saw a lot of encouraging examples of consensus building \nand working together on both sides of the aisle, of progress and of \nachievement in a bipartisan cooperative way. We made huge progress in \nthe debate on energy and, indeed, were able to pull together a finite \nnumber of amendments.\n  Over the course of the weekend and this week, the managers of that \nbill will be looking at those amendments to see how we can, in a very \norderly way, come back and address energy and bring it to completion. \nWe also, last week, completed our action on a number of important \nissues, one of which was the FAA reauthorization. We were able to do \nthat in one day. I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their \ncooperation in moving this important and much-needed bill to \ncompletion.\n  We also passed the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act last week. In \nparticular, I want to thank the distinguished majority whip, the \nSenator\n\n[[Page S7944]]\n\nfrom Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, for bringing that bill both to our \nattention and shepherding it through the floor.\n  Last week, we also passed the Women Business Centers Preservation \nAct, sponsored by Senator Olympia Snowe, and we were able to complete a \nnumber of executive nominations. We have a whole range of other \nnominations pending, and we will work to clear these nominations on the \nExecutive Calendar and to schedule rollcall votes as necessary.\n  As we enter the Medicare debate and the amendment process, I am very \nhopeful it will follow the same pattern we showed last week in working \ntogether. We will see robust debate. The end product is something for \nwhich I think we will have strong bipartisan support. I think the \namendment process will reflect a lot of the differing approaches on \nboth sides of the aisle within each of the caucuses as we go forward \nwith the shared goal of strengthening Medicare, improving Medicare and, \nat the same time, providing America's seniors with the benefit that we \nhave been denied in the past because traditional Medicare simply hasn't \nkept up to the times, and that is prescription drug coverage.\n\n  I look forward to 2 weeks from now when we will, on this floor, \nhopefully--I optimistically say this--pass a bill that America's \nseniors and future retirees will be able to look at and say, yes, that \nis health care security and that does include the benefits that are so \nimportant to health care delivery today, namely, prescription drugs.\n  We have talked a lot about modernization of the Medicare Program over \nthe last 45 years. We had a bipartisan commission that generated a plan \nthat was bipartisan, which Senator Breaux and I put together based on \nthe findings of the Medicare Commission. The Senate Finance Committee, \nover the last several years, has had 30 hearings, with 7 devoted just \nto this issue of prescription drug coverage. Earlier in the month, we \nheld an additional committee meeting to focus specifically on the \nframework that has been put forth by the managers of the bill, Senator \nGrassley and Senator Baucus.\n  That hearing constituted the third committee hearing on Medicare this \nyear. Indeed, last Thursday night, the Finance Committee voted to send \nthis historic legislation to the floor of the Senate with a bipartisan \nvote of 16 to 5. I thank Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus for \ngetting us to that pivotal point. This Grassley-Baucus agreement \nprovides a strong base, a strong framework upon which we can achieve \nthat mutually shared goal of strengthening and improving Medicare with \na meaningful prescription drug benefit added. There are so many others \nwho should be recognized who participated in the debate, but it is \nalmost futile to do it because so many have participated in this body \nand in the House of Representatives, indeed, with the administration \nand the bold leadership of President Bush. I think because of all of \nthis activity and the foundation that we have of working on this for \nyears and years, we do have an opportunity--and indeed I argue that it \nis an obligation--to bring this debate to a point in which we take \naction and actually pass a framework to give this appropriate \nstrengthening of Medicare.\n  Yesterday, Members did have the opportunity to deliver opening \nstatements. As I mentioned, they will continue through this morning and \nlikely into the early afternoon. Later today, if appropriate, we can go \nto amendments and tomorrow have a very active day on amendments.\n  Again, I hope we will be able to turn to final passage of this bill \nbefore we adjourn for the Independence Day recess.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/17/senate-section/article/S7944-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I commend the distinguished majority \nleader for his statement and for the effort he has made to bring the \ndebate on prescription drugs to the floor over the course of the next 2 \nweeks.\n  I share his hope and his goal that by the end of this period, we can \nhave achieved what I think all Senators want--a good, vigorous debate \nabout what is the best approach to take with regard to a prescription \ndrug benefit under Medicare--and complete that debate prior to the July \n4 recess. I have indicated to him personally that it would be my \nintention to work with him to accommodate that goal. I do hope we can \nmove to the amendment phase of the debate sooner rather than later, \npreferably this afternoon.\n  I also commend Senators Grassley and Baucus for their effort in the \nFinance Committee. The vote of 16 to 5 was an indication of their \nsuccess in accommodating the concerns and the ideas of many of our \ncolleagues. They have worked on this for a long period of time and I \nthink deserve our commendation for the effort they have made on a \nbipartisan basis. During the committee process, I indicated it would be \nmy hope that I could work as vigorously as they did in achieving the \nbipartisan tone that was accomplished during the markup last week.\n  I must say, I do not share the enthusiasm for the legislation that \nsome of my colleagues do, and I wish to talk about that this morning. \nWe may have a different perspective on how close this may be, but I \nalso recognize that we have made the perfect the enemy of the good at \ntimes, and I do not want to do that in this case.\n  I hope we can make a good down payment. I hope we can achieve a \nstart. I have been concerned about how shaky a start this may be, but \nit is a start. If we are going to commit $400 billion over the next 10 \nyears to provide meaningful drug benefits, I hope we can do so \nmaximizing the use of those resources, providing the most efficient \nutilization, and a mechanism, an infrastructure, for prescription drugs \nthat will accommodate many of the goals and hopes we have for at long \nlast modernizing Medicare in a way we know must be done.\n\n  I hope we do not overpromise. It is so easy to make proclamations \nabout how good this accomplishment is, and I think we may create false \nexpectations, high expectations, for this legislation that just will \nnot be realized once the full impact of the bill is felt in the \ncountryside.\n  Some have said, for example, that this is just like FEHBP, the \nFederal Employees Health Benefits Plan, for Senators. It is not. There \nis about a $1,000-a-year difference in the value of benefits between \nwhat Senators get and what seniors are going to get.\n  To do what Senators get, we are told by economic analysts, it would \ntake about $800 billion over a 10-year period, not $400 billion. So \nthis is not FEHBP. This is something substantially below FEHBP.\n  We also must acknowledge that a senior who has $5,000 of drug costs \nwill get a benefit of about $1,700; $3,300 will still come out of \npocket out of that $5,000. So people need to be aware this is not \nFEHBP; that this is not going to address all of the concerns and needs \nthat seniors have with regard to their drug costs.\n  Having said that, I believe we put down a marker, we set a \nfoundation, and we should work with the administration and with \nespecially the Department of Health and Human Services to address some \nof these concerns, and over time I believe we can make this an even \nbetter bill. Whether it is in the next 2 weeks, the next 2 months, 2 \nyears, or 2 decades, we are going to make this a better bill, a better \nprogram.\n  There are a number of concerns I have with regard to how we can make \nit better that I hope we can address through amendments. The first \namendment Democrats will offer is simply to give seniors more choice; \nto say to them: You can pick a private sector plan if you wish, but we \nalso think you ought to be able to pick a plan that is strictly a \nMedicare plan; that you can simply extend your current Medicare \nbenefits for doctors and hospitals to\n\n[[Page S7945]]\n\nprescription drugs as well, and that should be an option for you as you \nmake your decision with regard to what choices may be right for you. \nThat will be one of our key amendments. As I said, it will be our first \namendment.\n  I am concerned as well about the volatility of premiums. There are \nthose who suggest there will not be much variation, and yet in \ntestimony we were given just last week during the markup, the experts \ntold us they could not guarantee there would not be great volatility.\n  We are concerned about the past example of Medicare+Choice, the \npremium for such plans can cost $16 in Florida and cost $99 today in \nConnecticut. That variation is what we are afraid could be part of this \nplan unless we do something about it.\n  Seniors are going to have four cost issues about which to be \nconcerned. The first is the premium. The second is the initial cap on \nbenefits and the stop-loss; that is, at what point do they lose all \ncoverage and at what point do they get catastrophic coverage--and I \nwill get to that in a minute, the gap when they pay all of the costs. \nThey will also have co-payments and the deductible. All four of those \nvariables could change dramatically. The deductible is currently $250, \nthereabouts, in the bill, but it could go up. The co-payments are 50-\n50, but it could go up. The stop loss is around $3,700 out-of-pocket. \nThat could change. And you have, of course, the premium itself which is \nestimated to be $35, but there is no guarantee.\n\n  There is no defined benefit. One plan could have a lot more benefit \nthan another. And seniors in their late eighties or early nineties are, \nI think, going to find it very confusing with all these variables with \nregard to their costs and also extremely different options and \nvariables when they get to their benefits. So there is no defined \nbenefit.\n  As I say, there is still a large issue with regard to the benefit \nfalloff, the initial benefit cap for the package overall. It has been \ndescribed as a donut hole, a coverage gap, but the benefit cap, the \nbenefit stop that kicks in at about $4,500 in drug spending, will mean \nthat seniors between $4,500 and at least $5,800 are going to have to \npay all of the premium costs and get no benefit whatsoever during that \nperiod of time. So we are going to have to deal with that as well, it \nseems to me, and that is a function of cost.\n  We also have another issue about which we are concerned. We are told \nby CBO that 37 percent of beneficiaries--this is CBO--37 percent of \nbeneficiaries with retiree prescription drug coverage will lose it \nunder this bill; 37 percent, one out of three retirees, one out of \nthree at least. I guess you could not say necessarily it is one out of \nthree employees; it could be more than that.\n  Thirty-seven percent of beneficiaries with retiree coverage today \nwill lose that prescription drug coverage when this bill kicks in. \nThere is only one way to stop that from happening: To incent employers, \nto try to discourage them in as many ways not to drop that coverage, \nand we are going to try to do that.\n  The way we write the language on how retirees can be dropped, the way \nwe incent employers by providing them with benefits to keep that \ncoverage--we are going to try to do that as well. To provide 100 \npercent of the incentive it is going to take for companies not to drop \ntheir employees would cost more money. This bill currently has some. So \nwe are going to see if we can get closer to that full amount to ensure \nthat we do not find any more companies than absolutely necessary or \npossible that will drop their employee benefits.\n  So we have a number of significant concerns about the way this is \nwritten, about the benefits, about the uncertainty, about the costs, \nabout whether or not Medicare can play more of an upfront role.\n  We have one other issue, the volatility of the benefit itself. South \nDakota is a good example of a concern that many of us have. In South \nDakota we do not have any Medicare+Choice. Companies do not want to \nserve the rural areas. So we are concerned about what it is going to \ntake to bring companies into South Dakota to compete for the benefit \nplan to be provided in our region. If we cannot find anybody, under the \nbill, Medicare kicks in for 1 year. Once Medicare has kicked in, at the \nend of 1 year's time, these private companies can come back in and the \nMedicare plan that seniors had counted on for that year no longer would \nexist and there would be competition again for the private sector plans \ncompeting if they wish to serve that particular area.\n  So there is this constant change. If there is anything seniors do not \nlike, it is change and this uncertainty that comes with change.\n  Not only that, we learned last week another disconcerting aspect of \nthis. A decision would be made sometime in September on whether plans \nwould exist for the coming year. If it can be determined by September \nthat the plans cannot be put into effect for that coming year in a \ngiven region, then what happens is Health and Human Services \nestablishes a Medicare plan, but they have to contract with a private \ncompany to provide that Medicare plan for the following year beginning \nin October.\n  So what happens under the bill between October and January is this: \nThey find out first that no two plans can compete, so the Medicare plan \nis supposed to kick in. They contract for the Medicare plan, decide \nwhat the premium, the benefits, the stop loss, and the deductible are \ngoing to be. They somehow notify all the seniors in the region. They \nbegin to try to implement the plan between October and December and \nmake all of these decisions with regard to plans, benefits, \nnotification, implementation, and administration. Technically it is \nsupposed to kick in on January 1.\n  Now, if my colleagues have seen Government work that fast in any \nother area than perhaps a military intervention somewhere, I would like \nto see where it is. I am very concerned--frankly, extremely concerned--\nabout whether or not that is even humanly possible.\n  Keep in mind, this is not going to be a one-time experience. We are \ngoing to repeat this every single year perhaps. We are going to make a \ndecision in every region whether or not these plans can compete. \nWhether it is Alaska or South Dakota, my guess is they will not find \nthem. They will then say, okay, we are going to have 3 months to fully \nimplement a Medicare fallback even though we do not know who the \ncontractor for that Medicare fallback will be on October 1.\n\n  So I have to say, as we walk through a lot of these concerns, my \ncolleagues will understand why many of us worry about setting these \nhigh expectations and then find out how seniors will deal with them and \naddress them in a way that does not cause confusion, fear, anxiety, \nfrustration that is so unnecessary if we would just do this right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Democrat leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Democratic leader, as a member of the Senate \nFinance Committee which is deliberating on this 653-page bill, if he \nwould acknowledge or at least respond to the following: I believe the \npositive aspect of this is that for those who started out this debate \nsaying we are going to eliminate Medicare, that Medicare is going to be \nreplaced with a private plan, private insurance, that argument is out \nthe window. Medicare recipients will be able to continue their basic \nMedicare coverage for hospitals and doctors. It will not be an either/\nor situation. I think that is positive.\n  We have finally reached a point where we have an honest debate over \nprescription drugs, and I think for those of us on this side of the \naisle who have been pushing for it for so long, those are two very \npositive aspects of this debate. I ask the Democratic leader if he \nwould agree with that.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would certainly agree with that, and before the \nSenator came on the floor I commended those responsible for making this \na better bill and bringing us to this point. I think that while perhaps \nit is a shaky start, it is a very important start and we can deal with \nall of these other issues. Those are two issues we have dealt with, and \nI am grateful for the fact that we have made progress.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I want to ask the Democratic leader three specific \nquestions about this bill that I think go to the heart of the challenge \nwe face.\n  It is my intention to vote for this bill but also vote for amendments \nwhich I think will improve it. First, the cost of\n\n[[Page S7946]]\n\nprescription drugs goes up 10 to 20 percent a year, and as these costs \nrise, seniors are paying more out of pocket. In 653 pages of \nlegislation, how much is dedicated to controlling the costs of drugs, \nkeeping them affordable, not just for seniors but for all American \nfamilies?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. In response to the Senator from Illinois, some of the \nbill's proponents would say that is what they hope to achieve through \ncompetition, but we have not seen that work. Medicare+Choice was \nsupposed to be competition, and it has not worked.\n  What we need to do is to have real competition with a Medicare \nbenefit plan that will kick in, that will allow us to compare what \ncould be done in the private sector with what could be done in the \npublic sector. We have seen real cost containment in the Veterans' \nAdministration. We have seen it in the Defense Department. To a certain \nextent, we have seen it in other governmental agencies, such as the \nIndian Health Service. We have not seen it yet with Medicare+Choice. \nThat is No. 1. No. 2, we will be offering an amendment offered at least \nby Senators Gregg, Schumer, and others on access to generic drugs which \nwill give people an option to buy the generic version of a given drug, \nand that will help. Senator Dorgan will offer an amendment for \nreimportation of drugs sold cheaper in other countries to allow greater \ncost containment. Those three things could go a long way to addressing \nthe issue of costs more effectively, and that is what this amendment \nprocess is going to be all about.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. The second question is: When seniors have to figure out \nwhether or not they want to get involved in this program, they have to \nmake a calculation: Is it worth it to pay a premium each month and face \na deductible at the end of the year? Will I be ahead or behind? As I \nunderstand it, we have heard a lot about a $35 monthly premium, but \nthat is not mandated in this bill. There is no requirement that it be \n$35 a month. It could be considerably more. The $250 deductible that is \nin here I guess could be changed as well. So for the seniors who are \ntrying to decide whether this makes sense based on their personal \nbudgets--and that is what it comes down to--have we not created kind of \na moving target as to what this is going to cost each senior across \nAmerica?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Well, there is not only one, there are four moving \ntargets. The first moving target, as the Senator suggests, is the \npremium. It is suggested it be $35 a month, but there is no guarantee. \nIt could be $100. It could be $20. No one knows. They will not know \nuntil they are able to determine just what it is going to take to bring \na benefit to a given region. That is only the first.\n  The suggested deductible is $275. There is no guarantee. Nobody knows \nwhether it is going to be $500 or $100. There is no guarantee on the \ncopay. It is supposed to be 50/50. It could be 70/30. There is no \nguarantee on the so-called initial cap on benefits, or the benefit loss \nat some point, whenever that kicks in. It could be $4,500. It could be \ndifferent. That is the benefit cap beyond which one has to pay all of \nthe costs of a prescription drug.\n  So there are those four variables. As the Senator suggests, more \nclarity and certainty in this legislation would go a long way to \neliminating a lot of the anxiety seniors have about this.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The last question I will ask the Democratic leader--and I \nsee others are in the Chamber--it is my understanding that when \nMedicare was created under President Johnson, from the date of the \npassage of the legislation until Medicare went into effect was less \nthan a year. It is also my understanding that this prescription drug \nprotection, whatever it offers, is not going into effect until 2006--is \nmy understanding correct--after the next election? Is that correct?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Unfortunately, the Senator is correct. Some suggest it \ntakes that long to set up the infrastructure, but as he also noted, \nMedicare took 11 months. When we established Medicare, 11 months later \nit was up and running. If an entire health care system can be developed \nwith a payment regime for doctors as well as hospitals--and I might add \nthere were two different payment regimes, Part A and Part B--in 11 \nmonths, I do not understand why it would have to take 3 years for us to \ndo this. But that is what is incorporated in the bill.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Democratic leader, those are the three areas \nthat jump forward as you look at this bill, the uncertainty in terms of \ncost, the complete lack of cost controls and reduction in prices for \nprescription drugs for American families, and the fact this is being \ndelayed until after the next election strikes me that those who are \nproposing this are afraid once seniors actually see these uncertainties \nthey may decide this is not as good a bargain as they had hoped.\n  Although this is a step forward, the alternatives we will offer on \nthe floor are going to create more certainty, more price competition, \nand a better approach for seniors.\n  I thank the Democratic leader.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Would the Democratic leader yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Recognizing that several States, including the \nState of the distinguished Democratic whip, Nevada, have implemented \nprescription drug plans of which they were not able to get any \ninsurance company to step forward to offer prescription drugs under \nthat plan because the insurance companies could not make any money, are \nwe likely to see this revolving door the distinguished Senator from \nSouth Dakota has talked about, that two companies are supposed to \ncompete and offer prescription drugs to the senior citizens but they do \nnot step forward, and they go back to the backstop, which is the \nMedicare plan, and then there is the thought they will step forward \nagain but they don't, and then they backstop back to the Medicare \nprescription drug plan? Does that suggest not only uncertainty but \nchaos?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Florida has put his finger on one of \nthe big concerns many Members have, the volatility, as he called it, \nthe revolving door.\n  What private insurance companies have stated in the past, insuring \ndrug coverage for seniors is almost like insuring for a hair cut. A \nhair cut is inevitable. So is the utilization of prescription drugs for \nseniors. Because we cannot make the actuarial analysis work, there is \nno choice; either not to go in or to be significantly subsidized to \nmake a profit, to make this work. That is why for so long we have not \nseen Medicare+Choice work very well. It has not been adequately \nsubsidized and ultimately people have just not found it in their \ninterest to sign up.\n  What we have seen is that the Medicare system has worked, has served \nthis segment of our population very effectively, and we are simply \ntrying to ensure that there is some stability. If seniors want to stay \nwith Medicare, let them do so, rather than this revolving door, rather \nthan being the guinea pigs in the private sector to find a way to \ndevise a formula, where some private insurance companies could offer \nbenefits that may or may not work over a period of years.\n  This process of selection and deselection and analysis and ultimately \nimplementation in a matter of 3 months every year could pose some \nserious problems for seniors in Florida or South Dakota.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Therefore, we could clear up that uncertainty, \nstop that revolving door, if, in fact, we gave seniors the automatic \nchoice they could get their prescription drugs through Medicare, but if \nthey had a better option, a more favorable menu of prescription drugs \nin the private sector, they could opt for that?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is exactly what we would be suggesting with the \nfirst amendment the caucus will propose. The distinguished Senator has \ncharacterized it exactly right. Why not give seniors a little more \nchoice? But with that choice, perhaps a little more certainty that \nregardless of what may happen in the private sector they will always \nhave the Medicare plan available as a choice. That is all we are \nasking. If Medicare cannot compete effectively, no one will use it and \neveryone will go to the private sector. If it can compete, if it can \nprovide a comparable benefit, why not have it, instead of going through \nthis backup business every year.\n  That will be a key priority amendment for us when we have the debate.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I would like to ask one more question of the \ndistinguished Democratic leader. At the end\n\n[[Page S7947]]\n\nof the day, if we are not able to improve the bill with some of these \namendments that have been discussed, it is either yea or nay. If we \nknow that this kind of chaos and uncertainty is coming down the road \nwhen the legislation kicks in in 2006, is the theory of the Senator \nfrom South Dakota that half a loaf is better than no loaf at all?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I have come to the conclusion, that this may not even be \nhalf a loaf but it is a start. As a start, it affords an opportunity to \ncome back in 2 months, 2 years, within the next two decades, and gives \nus a chance to build. It has the elements of a foundation upon which we \ncan improve a system of prescription drug health care delivery to \nseniors for the first time in our lifetime, for the first time in the \nlifetime of Medicare. That to me is a valuable asset to put in the bank \nso that I am prepared to accept the many deficiencies in this bill in \nan effort to get something started.\n  I don't expect I will enjoy unanimous support for that point of view \nwithin our caucus, perhaps within the Senate. But it seems to me we \nhave to start somewhere. If we fall victim to making the perfect the \nenemy of the good, then I believe we will have lost yet another year \nand there will be no help for seniors under any circumstances. I don't \nfind that acceptable.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/17/senate-section/article/S7947-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign).

Under the previous order, the hour of 10 a.m. \nhaving arrived, the Senate will proceed with consideration of S. 1, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1) to amend title XVIII of the Social Security \n     Act to make improvements in the Medicare Program, to provide \n     prescription drug coverage under the Medicare Program, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to praise the exceptional \ncommitment of Chairman Grassley as chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, ranking member, Senator Baucus, to meld both political and \npolicy differences and produce a bill that can garner support of 16 \nmembers of the Finance Committee, 16 Members of the Senate Finance \nCommittee who represented every facet of the political spectrum.\n  That they were able to execute this extraordinary achievement and \nproduce this bill, especially less than a year after the committee \nprocess was bypassed altogether, is a testament not only to their skill \nbut also to their passion for this issue.\n  They have built upon the leadership that has been provided by the \nPresident, who challenged the Congress to enact a Medicare prescription \ndrug benefit, offered principles, and more recently issued the charge \nto the Congress to have a bill on his desk in July. The Senate majority \nleader has been steadfast in his commitment not only that a markup \nshould be held in the Finance Committee but also to ensuring we had a \ntimetable to make the process work and to have this legislation on the \nPresident's desk in July. Thanks to his determination and also to the \ndetermination, commitment, and longstanding contributions made by my \ncolleagues, Senator Hatch, Senator Breaux, and Senator Jeffords, along \nwith Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus, with whom I have worked over \nthe past few years, seniors will be able to celebrate a second \nindependence day this summer: Independence from the crushing cost of \nprescription drugs.\n  As one who teamed with Senator Wyden almost 6 years ago to forge this \nfirst bipartisan prescription drug coverage bill in the Senate, I know \nit has been a rather lengthy road that has led to this day, but it has \nbeen a much longer and more arduous journey for America's seniors who \ncannot afford to wait any longer for Washington to act. So I am pleased \nwe now stand on the brink of passing legislation that will provide \nevery senior with the security of a comprehensive prescription drug \nbenefit under the Medicare Program. That means we have the opportunity \nto pass this benefit this month and to have it on the President's desk \nin July.\n  We have certainly come a long way since I started in this process \nwith my colleague, Senator Wyden, almost 6 years ago, when we fired \nsome of the opening shots in this legislative battle. We progressed \nfrom the $28 billion former President Clinton proposed for a \nprescription drug proposal to the $40 billion program that we \nestablished--Senator Wyden and I, in the Budget Committee as members of \nthat committee, for a $40 billion reserve fund over 5 years--to finally \nenacting a reserve fund several years later, again, a reserve fund for \nmore than $300 billion. Ultimately, we had the proposal last fall for \n$370 billion, and then the bipartisan bill that included that amount of \nmoney, and then, of course, the $400 billion that was proposed by the \nPresident this year.\n  I remind my colleagues that is almost $200 billion more than the \nPresident originally initiated for a proposal just last year. So we \nhave come a long way in this process over a 6-year period, from $28 \nbillion to $40 billion to $300 billion to $370 billion to $400 billion \nright now.\n  There are those who argue they have not been included in the process \nthat has brought us to the floor of the Senate this week, but I can say \nwe have had extensive hearings in the Senate Finance Committee. I \nremind my colleagues, since 1999 the Finance Committee has held 30 \nMedicare hearings with 8 focused specifically on the creation of a \nprescription drug benefit. Last year, we spent 2 weeks on the Senate \nfloor considering 5 different initiatives. During the Finance \nCommittee's consideration of this bill last week, the chairman allowed \nan extensive discussion of the issues and more than 136 amendments were \nfiled.\n  The bottom line is the policies in this consensus bill certainly were \nnot achieved in a vacuum. They are the combination of 5 years of \nvetting and bipartisan bridge building. They are the direct descendants \nof last year's tripartisan bill that we spent 2 years developing, \nmeeting every week. That was, again, Chairman Grassley, Senator Baucus, \nSenator Breaux, Senator Hatch, Senator Jeffords, and myself, and this \nultimately resulted in an evolutionary process of numerous iterations \nof various legislative initiatives and provisions. It has been a \nhealthy competition of ideas that has been forged into this piece of \nlegislation today, recognizing it is virtually impossible in a 51-49 \nSenate to design the largest domestic program, in nominal terms, ever \ncreated and to pass the most significant enhancement of the Medicare \nProgram in its 38-year history with a ``my way or the highway'' \napproach.\n  Concessions must be made. Thankfully, they have been made in arriving \nat this policy equilibrium that acknowledges, not only what is \npolitically possible but, most critically, what is workable and \nmeaningful and effective for America's seniors. The President made \nconcessions, Republicans made concessions, Democrats made concessions, \nand then there were concessions made across the ideological spectrum in \neach of our respective parties. But, in the final analysis we also have \nacknowledged that if we want to pass a prescription drug benefit, then \nwe have to achieve a consensus to ensure that seniors get this benefit \nthis year and now.\n\n  As a result, we maintained that there were certain principles that \nhad to be adhered to in the development of this legislation. Certainly \nit maintained the four principles we established when we designed the \noriginal tripartisan plan.\n  First of all, the benefit must be universal--that is the No. 1 \npriority for seniors, ensuring that any new benefit is available in \nevery region of the country regardless of whether you live in an urban \narea or a rural area--and that you could receive this benefit at the \nlowest monthly cost possible; that the benefit be targeted, with lower \nincome seniors receiving the most assistance, with limited cost sharing \nand reduced or eliminated premiums; that the benefit be comprehensive, \nproviding coverage for every therapeutic\n\n[[Page S7948]]\n\ndrug class and category from the generics to the most advanced \ninnovative therapies, while at the same time providing seniors with a \nchoice in plans; and that the benefit produce real savings.\n  In this bill, an individual with an annual income of $15,000 per \nyear, and drug expenditures of $7,000 per year, would save $6,000, an \n80-percent savings. A couple with an annual combined income of $30,000 \nand combined drug expenses of $5,000 would save $1,385, a 28-percent \nsaving.\n  All of these principles are essentially the ones that we developed in \nthe tripartisan plan and even before that, when, with my colleague \nSenator Wyden, in the legislation we introduced back in 1998, after \nmonths of intensive research and outreach and negotiations, we became \nmore convinced than ever, working across the political aisle and also \nunderstanding the policy dynamics and what undergirds the Medicare \nProgram, we had to create a universal benefit under the Medicare \nProgram with a subsidy to help lower income families pay for those \npremiums.\n  Moreover, because we believe individuals should have the same ability \nMembers of Congress and Federal employees enjoy to choose the coverage \nthat best suits their needs, seniors would be able to select their \ncoverage from a variety of offerings by private insurers.\n  Then, as today, there are those who felt that any meaningful, \nreliable benefit should be a Government-run program. But we also \nlearned from the debate last fall, when we considered various proposals \nacross the political spectrum. We considered a Government-run \nprescription drug benefit program and we got various estimates from CBO \nthat at the minimum it would cost from $600 billion to more than $1 \ntrillion by certain estimates. That is a problem because, when we have \na performance-based program that doesn't have any risk involved in \ndelivering that program, the costs go up.\n  We also saw with that approach that the program would be sunsetted \nafter 7 years, to mask the true costs, so that seniors wouldn't have \nthe true benefit of that program after 7 years because we could not \ncontain the costs with a Government-run program. Obviously, it would \naffect the future liabilities and the solvency of the Medicare Program, \nwhich we know is going to be a serious problem down the road when we \nhave more seniors retire.\n  So, finally, we decided that an approach of that kind ultimately \nwould have significant restrictions. Last year's bill, when it embraced \na Government-run program, not only did it sunset, but it also \nstatutorily limited the number of drugs a senior could purchase within \na therapeutic class to just two.\n  So that is why we diverged from that road of going down the path of a \nGovernment-run program, so they can make sure seniors have options, and \nalso so they can have the availability regardless of where they live in \nAmerica. Our bill today puts no limit on drug coverage because seniors \nshouldn't be limited in their options for treatment, just as they also \nshouldn't be limited in their options for coverage. The fact is, the \none-size-fits-all approach doesn't work when it comes to writing \nprescriptions. And it certainly won't work when it comes to \nprescription drug coverage either.\n\n  The question is how to provide seniors with choice without \nundermining the integrity of the basic tenets of the Medicare Program. \nThat was the major issue that confronted us in developing the \ntripartisan plan and certainly the proposal that is before us today. I \nbelieve the answer is to allow seniors to utilize the traditional and \nthe familiar fee-for-service delivery method.\n  Over the years, people have come to feel comfortable with this \napproach and with this model. There are those who have already been a \npart of this program, and those who will be retiring and may want to \njoin a fee-for-service but at the same time be allowed access to other \nplans that are developed by private insurers which may be better able \nto tailor the differences to suit the varied needs of seniors today. \nThis necessitated a give-and-take in this legislation.\n  Specifically, some have criticized this plan for not having a defined \nbenefit. But a defined benefit means all benefits will look alike, \nwhich brings us back to the one-size-fits-all approach. Rather, under \nthis legislation, plans have the flexibility to offer the standard \nbenefit as prescribed in the statute or to offer a benefit that is \nactuarially equivalent to the standard option.\n  The guideline insures that all plans will have the same $275 \ndeductible, $3,700 in true out-of-pocket costs for stop-loss coverage, \nand the total value. But it allows plans to vary cost sharing \nrequirements between the deductible and stop-loss to create options \nthat are the most appealing to the beneficiaries in that particular \nregion.\n  In other words, with this legislation, the value of the benefits must \nbe the same--not necessarily the benefits themselves. Again, it comes \nback to choice. Seniors will be able to choose. They can do so secure \nin the knowledge that those plans offered by private insurers include \nbenchmark standards.\n  This bill's requirements ensure that the overall quality of those \nstandards is protected and preserved in the kind of coverage that will \nbe delivered under this proposal.\n  In order to satisfy the concerns of those who say that offering \nnumerous private plans may be disrupting or confusing to seniors, the \nbill instructs the administrator for the Center for Medicare Choice to \nenter into 2-year contracts so seniors will not have to change plans \nevery year if they are happy and content with the services they are \nreceiving. This also should act as an enticement or inducement to \nprivate plans to participate because it provides them with the \nstability as well.\n  Moreover, the new program builds off of strict consumer protection \nfrom current law under the Medicare+Choice Program that requires the \nadministrator to approve marketing material and provide educational \nmaterials to help beneficiaries compare and contrast benefit options.\n  Remember, the model we are using is the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Program that serves Members of Congress as well as Federal \nemployees. In fact, the average age of a Federal employee enrollee is \n61. Choice works for them. Yet we cannot lose sight of the fact that \nover 80 percent of current fees voice strong support for the program \nand may not want to change. They may not want to test the unproven.\n\n  That is why we believed it was critical that this bill provide an \nequal drug benefit no matter which option a senior may select because \nmore than 80 percent of seniors are now with the current Medicare fee-\nfor-service program. Because those new retirees in this next decade may \nbe more accustomed to what would be delivered under a preferred \nprovider network, we wanted to offer options and choices among the \nplans that seniors could select without undermining the integrity of \nthe existing Medicare Program.\n  I know some of my colleagues would have preferred to offer a \ndifferential benefit when it came to the prescription drug coverage. \nDepending on which program you enrolled in, they wanted a better \nbenefit under the private plan as an incentive to participating in the \nprivately created model, known as PPO.\n  Again, we have no certainty as to how these plans will work. We \nobviously have a track record for the traditional fee-for-service \nprogram. We know how that program works. But we don't know how the \nprivately delivered program will work in the final analysis. That is \nsomething we will learn about as time proceeds.\n  CMS predicted, for example, that 43 percent of seniors would \nparticipate in private plans. But the Congressional Budget Office \nestimated that only 2 percent would participate in the private \nprograms.\n  What happens in the event private prescription drug benefit delivery \nplans don't flourish in a particular region as projected? We don't have \nthe traditional fee-for-service program to fall back on. What then \nhappens? We can't afford to go back to the days before the Medicare \nProgram was created and instituted in 1965 because those were the days \nof patchwork coverage that varied widely, if it existed at all for \nseniors. Again, it depended on where you lived or if you had any kind \nof medical access or if you had health insurance, which in many cases \nseniors didn't. That is why we established the Medicare Program back in \n1965--so that we\n\n[[Page S7949]]\n\ncreated evenness, fairness, and accessibility for all seniors--a \nplatform of a level of care for seniors in this country regardless of \nwhere you lived in America, regardless of your income. That is why we \nfelt and strongly believed that we needed to extend fairness to \neveryone. That was the spirit of the Medicare Program in the first \nplace.\n  Providing a differential or an equal prescription drug benefit is \njust one of the many sound compromises in this legislation, but at the \nsame time it is consistent with embracing the universal principles of \nthe Medicare Program.\n  I know some have said we have already created a private delivery \nhealth option that is doomed to fail; and, that it would hinder the \nprivate market so that plans will never possibly participate in this \nprogram.\n  In fact, we have worked very closely with insurance actuaries and \nfirms that we hope to attract so that we understand how they make \nbusiness decisions as well as how they deliver care under those plans \nand with whom they negotiated to develop those networks and those \nplans. With that knowledge, we have incorporated a number of mechanisms \nin this legislation before us today. Those mechanisms include risk \ncorridors, reinsurance and premium stabilization accounts which are \nintended to build a stable, productive model that we believe will \nattract and keep companies in the programs. That is very important.\n\n  We think these are the types of approaches and methodologies and \nprocedures that will attract private insurers to participate in the \nprograms on a regional basis.\n  Furthermore, we are instituting new cost-sharing options such as \ncombining the deductibles for Part A and Part B services--a copayment \nsystem that better resembles the private sector today.\n  For example, under the Medicare Program, there are many copayments \nfor preventive health care services. We happen to think that is in the \nwrong direction, that is the wrong emphasis. There are no copayments \nunder this model for preventive screening. That is very critical. It is \nimportant to allow seniors to have access to those types of protective \nmechanisms that helps prevent more serious illnesses down the road.\n  It also provides a catastrophic cap for medical services which \ncurrently is not included in the Medicare Program.\n  Again, there are many upgrades and updated approaches to the private \ndelivery model that do not exist in the traditional fee-for-service \nprogram.\n  Again, people will have choices in making decisions as to whether \nthis better works for them or whether they prefer the kinds of support \nand insurance included in the Medicare Program under the fee-for-\nservice as we know it today.\n  Again, we are establishing a structure that better resembles options \ndelivered in the private market in this newly created private plan to \noffer more choices to seniors and to determine which structure is more \nattractive for their needs.\n  Again, in offering this option, I believe--and many of us believe--\nthat it was also important not to undermine the fee-for-service \nprograms by instituting unproven choices. We do not know whether these \nprivately created systems will work in every part of the country.\n  We do not know who they will negotiate with in that region for \nproviders so that seniors have access to a range of providers and \nspecialists across the board which, obviously, is what the traditional \nfee-for-service program provides. So there is no way to guarantee that \nprivate companies will deliver services in all parts of the country.\n  This concern is especially acute for those of us who represent rural \nStates such as Maine, where no Medicare+Choice programs operate. We \nunderstand there have been many problems for many reasons as to why the \nMedicare+Choice Program does not work very well in many regions of the \ncountry. It works well in some but not in many parts of the country.\n  So we learned from those lessons, and we developed a fallback \nproposal in this initiative that provides security to current Medicare \nbeneficiaries or future beneficiaries that no matter where they live, \nwe ensure that in regions where private plans choose not to participate \nthe Government will contract with companies, like pharmacy benefit \nmanagers, to deliver the benefit.\n  Some have criticized this option, saying it will remove incentives \nfor plans to participate in risk-bearing models. This bridge is \nnecessary to address Members' and beneficiaries' legitimate fears that \nthey could be left out of the coverage. That is important because I \nthink it is essential we have a guaranteed, seamless Government \nfallback. But the fallback we have designed in this legislation is one \nof last resort; it is not the one of first resort. It will not be \ntriggered unless two private plans will not enter the market, and we \nlimit the contract to 1 year because we must first do everything we can \nto see that private delivery systems have a chance to flourish in this \nprogram.\n  To further entice private plans to enter the market, the \nadministrator is allowed to reduce the risk that a plan bears to almost \nnothing. Again, the goal is to attract private plans into the market, \nto work with them to manage their risk, and to make it an attractive \nmarket to serve while, at the same time, offering seniors everywhere a \nguaranteed access to care that will exist under a private delivery \nsystem because access to care should not be segmented or guaranteed \nbased on ZIP Code.\n  In that light, another concern the committee took action to correct \nlast week was the threat of large variations in the premium across \nregions. One of the basic tenets of the Medicare Program, undeniably, \nis to provide health care benefits to seniors and to persons with \ndisabilities for the same price. Whether you are a senior living in \nArizona or Portland, ME, you will pay for the same part B premium.\n  We need to recognize how disparities in prescription drug benefits \ncould lead to variations and instability for seniors enrolled in the \nprivate plans. Just consider the case of Medicare+Choice. This was an \nissue that was raised last week during the course of the debate on the \nmarkup in the Senate Finance Committee. The premiums in some regions of \nFlorida, for example, in Medicare+Choice, are $16 a month while in \nConnecticut they may pay $99 a month.\n  Just from a basic standpoint of fairness, do we really want to create \nsuch a system for seniors with their drug coverage? So we need to level \nthe playing field. Obviously, I don't want seniors in Maine to wonder \nwhy they are paying a different price for their premium than their \nneighbors across the border in New Hampshire. How can we find out if \nprivate plans are superior to fee-for-service if there are wild \nfluctuations and disparities between plans and the traditional \nbenefits? So that is why we have to determine, as we proceed with this \nprogram, how best to address that issue.\n\n  Some have said we should stipulate the premium in this legislation in \nthe statute and limit the level of variation. But according to CBO, \nthat would result in higher costs and less efficiently run programs \nbecause plans would no longer have the incentive and the flexibility to \ncraft benefit options that are the most appealing to seniors. As we \nhave seen with other Government programs--whether it is job training \nand placement services--when Congress spells out the requirements, \nplans typically provide the minimum necessary and never aspire to a \nhigher goal.\n  The committee unanimously adopted an amendment Senator Lincoln and I \noffered that provides the Secretary of Health and Human Services the \nauthority to adjust governmental payments to minimize any variation \nthat may result in premiums across the regions due to variations for \nthe standard coverage option under the new Medicare stand-alone \nprescription drug benefit. We also direct the General Accounting Office \nto study this issue once the program is operational to determine if \nwide variations actually materialize. I am confident these two actions \nwill provide Congress with the information necessary to make informed \ndecisions and will allow the Secretary to take corrective actions when \nnecessary.\n  I think this is an important issue. Obviously, this is a very new \nprogram. We are testing new theories, new operations that basically \nreflect the state of health care today with the technologies, with the \nmethods, with the providers, with the type of specialties\n\n[[Page S7950]]\n\nthat exist because we want to be able to give seniors access to a \nvariety of choices across the spectrum, including their access to \nprescription drug coverage and how it can best be delivered to seniors.\n  So we want to test the innovation, the creativity, and the \nmarketplace as well. That is why it is so important to allow the \nflexibility to be incorporated in this legislation, but, at the same \ntime, if it does not work in the way we hope or intend, we have given \nthe Secretary the ability to make adjustments on those premiums because \nit is absolutely important that he has the authority to do so. That is \nwhy we included this in the legislation.\n  We will also study the issue to determine what other actions in the \nfuture must be taken to ensure those kinds of wide variations and \nfluctuations do not occur.\n  Finally, I want to turn to the last part of my discussion, which is \nthe issue of the low-income subsidies, which I think is a remarkable \naspect of this legislation.\n  We have improved on the tripartisan plan. We learned a lot in our \nefforts, in our initiatives, over the last 2 years in terms of what is \nessential to establish a strong, low-income subsidy for our seniors \nunder the Medicare program.\n  First of all, we raised the eligibility criteria to 160 percent of \npoverty--which is $14,368 for an individual and $19,360 for a couple--\nfrom 150 percent of poverty which we included in the tripartisan bill \nlast year, and we used the eligibility criteria under the existing \nMedicare low-income assistance programs to create a seamless and simple \nprocess to target the most help with premiums, deductibles, and \ncopayments to those nearly 9 million seniors with incomes below \n$12,123. The nearly 6 million seniors who receive health care coverage \nfrom both the Medicare and the Medicaid program--those known as dual \neligibles--will continue to receive their drug coverage from the \nMedicare program. The States will receive additional assistance but \nthis is intended to allow continuity of care and reduce confusion among \nthe poorest and the most vulnerable.\n  My home State of Maine stands as an example of the impact this bill \nwill have on the 40 million individual Medicare beneficiaries. For \nexample, in 2003, there are 19,000 seniors and disabled individuals in \nMaine who receive health care benefits from both the Medicare and the \nMedicaid programs, the so-called dual eligibles. An additional 17,700 \nseniors qualify for the Qualified Medicare Benefit Program which serves \npeople with incomes below 100 percent of poverty, and they will receive \nthe greatest level of subsidy under the new Medicare prescription drug \nprogram. And 6,100 seniors are eligible for another program that serves \npeople with incomes below 135 percent of the poverty level.\n  In total, over 90,000 of the estimated 215,000 Medicare beneficiaries \nliving in Maine will qualify for one of the low-income subsidy \nprograms. That is almost half of Maine's senior and disabled \npopulation. Each will receive substantial assistance each year.\n  Moreover, unlike the tripartisan legislation, this bill will provide \nassistance without an asset test to the remaining 8.5 million seniors \nwith incomes under 160 percent of poverty regardless of their level of \nassets. Taken together, that is nearly half of all Medicare \nbeneficiaries or 43 percent of the population. That is an important \nissue. That is a departure from the tripartisan plan last year because \nwe did have another type of asset test that prevented 40 percent of \nlow-income seniors from receiving coverage. It was a concern to all of \nus including that asset test, but we were trying to include a program \nunder the $370 billion window that we had for financing this program. \nThis year we used a more consistent methodology and programs that are \nalready familiar to seniors across the country. It is fairer. We have \nbasically eliminated the asset test for those individuals and couples \nunder 160 percent of poverty level.\n  We learned from discussions over the last 2 years that a great deal \nof concern existed that we were excluding a large number of people with \nvery low income who, because of their assets totaling more than $4,000 \nfor an individual or $6,000 for a couple, would not be eligible for the \nsubsidy. We removed that asset test and, therefore, now we have 17.5 \nmillion seniors who will be eligible for low-income assistance. At the \nsame time we ensure those under 160 percent of poverty will never be \nsubject to a gap in coverage where they would be responsible for 100 \npercent of the cost. All of us would have preferred to eliminate that \ngap in coverage. But CBO again stated it would cost, by their \nestimates, somewhere in the area of $200 billion in order to accomplish \nthat goal. So we have to look at what is before us as a starting point, \na very strong starting point.\n  We have to consider that nearly 88 percent of all seniors, 35 million \npeople of the Medicare beneficiaries, that is 35 million of the 41 \nmillion Medicare beneficiaries, will spend under the $4,500 threshold \nof this so-called gap in coverage. That is before counting the \nsupplemental coverage many have that may well keep even more seniors \nbelow that gap in coverage. Moreover, it may also be likely, as with \nthe Federal Employees Benefit Program, that this bill will tailor the \nbenefits and offer options that don't include a gap. We are not \npreventing private insurers or plans from including that gap. We \nprovide them with an actuarial equivalent benefit, the same value for \neveryone. They could come up with a variety of plans, including \neliminating that gap in coverage. But for the 12 percent of \nbeneficiaries who have drug costs in excess of $4,500, and more \nspecifically the 7 percent that spend more than $3,700 per year in out-\nof-pocket costs, they will qualify for the program's catastrophic \ncoverage where the Government pays 90 percent of the cost.\n  This proposal counts toward the stop-loss coverage contributions made \nby the individual, a family member, Medicaid program, or the State \npharmacy assistance programs which will further direct help to the \nlowest income seniors, those under 135 percent of poverty and those who \nhave minimal assets.\n  Finally, I know many across the political aisle are concerned about \nincluding employer contributions toward the computation of the $4,500 \ncap. They point to the concern that some seniors will lose their \nemployer health care coverage because this bill doesn't count employer \ncontributions toward that catastrophic cap and that according to the \nCongressional Budget Office--again we had to use those determinations \nin order to design the type of program we could include in this \nlegislation within the $400 billion--33 percent of seniors had \nemployer-sponsored coverage in 2002. They estimate that approximately \n37 percent of this 33 percent population will lose their coverage by \n2013. That is approximately 4 million Medicare beneficiaries.\n\n  Obviously, this is troubling. But it is important to note that the \nCongressional Budget Office could not really estimate how much of this \nloss would be attributable to passage of this legislation. That is \nbecause employers are already dropping health care coverage for their \nformer employees at an alarming rate. As we have seen from so many of \nthe estimates that have been submitted to the committee, from 1999 to \n2001, 7 percent of employers dropped retiree coverage. And from what we \ncan determine, that trend is worsening, not improving.\n  Given the limited amount of money available, I believe the most \nprudent path may be to make adjustments to encourage companies not to \ndrop their coverage but not at the expense of seniors. Obviously the \npriority is to make sure we get the very best benefit possible for \neveryone in the Medicare program and to do it, to the extent that we \ncan, within the $400 billion program.\n  I must tell you as it stands, this legislation does include a number \nof provisions that are intended to help employers and encourage them to \nmaintain retiree health care coverage.\n  Employers can participate in this program in a number of cost-\neffective ways. An employer can wrap their benefit package around the \nMedicare benefit which means that Medicare pays first, leaving the \nemployer responsible only for the remaining cost. An employer can also \ndirectly pay their retiree's premium under traditional Medicare instead \nof offering a separate plan. And finally, under the new Medicare \nadvantage option, they can bid to be their own plan and deliver the \nservices to their retirees, which allows them to share the costs of the \ncare with the Government.\n\n[[Page S7951]]\n\n  Finally, the Medicare Advantage Program provides the flexibility to \nallow employers to pay for enhancements added to the Medicare standard \nbenefit. I supported these provisions because I believe they are fair \nand appropriate. But this issue remains a vexing challenge. What is the \ncorrect balance where we are not discouraging employers from offering \ncoverage for their retirees yet not penalizing seniors who don't have \nthe benefit of employer-sponsored coverage? That really is the problem. \nAny changes we make to offer incentives and encourage companies to \ncontinue their retiree coverage places seniors who don't have this type \nof coverage at a financial disadvantage. Obviously, that is not \nconsistent with the tenets of the Medicare Program.\n  I want to continue to work with the chairman, who has indicated his \ninterest, to explore various ways to address the issue, along with \nSenator Baucus, because it is an issue we want to explore further so \nthat we do not add to the costs of the program because employers \ndropped retiree coverage.\n  In the final analysis, there will always be those who will question \nif this is the best policy. Others will be concerned about the prudence \nof committing the Government to such large future expenditures. I, for \none, am confident we have struck the correct balance. The average \nsenior will realize $1,200 in annual savings, and the lowest income \nwill see even more assistance. I realize this proposal will not help \nevery senior in the same manner. But that is also because seniors have \nwide variations in drug costs.\n  What I do know is that the lowest incomes and those with the highest \ndrug costs will realize substantial savings. During a time of growing \ndeficits, this proposal is the best policy to meet the needs of this \npopulation as represented by the Congressional Budget Office estimates. \nThis is an important issue because, again, it is getting back to the \nfairness and balance in the legislation and who will participate.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that over three-fourths of \nMedicare-eligible beneficiaries will enroll. That is an important \nprojection for the future well-being of the Medicare Program because \nyou are going to have a blend in the participation that can also \nprovide the very best benefit to those who want to enroll in the \nprogram. But you can have a blend in the regions that are developed \nunder the new Medicare Advantage option between urban and rural of \nthose who are healthy and those who are sicker. I think those types of \nblends will be a marked departure from the Medicare+Choice program.\n\n  We create much larger regions. There will be approximately 10 regions \nin the country. It is estimated by the director of the CMS that we \ncould possibly have from six to eight plans participating in each \nregion in the country, giving a breadth of choices to those who \nparticipate in the program. Overall, we should have high participation \nin the drug benefit program.\n  So this bill undoubtedly will be one of the most significant pieces \nof legislation that we can pass this decade, and beyond. We can make \nhistory today if we set aside our partisan differences. The time is \nright, the policies are right, and a prescription drug benefit is \ncertainly the right thing to do for America's seniors. Passing this \nlegislation will be a tangible verification of society's commitment to \nproviding for those who have walked the path before us.\n  We can win this, Mr. President. We have tried before and failed. But \nI think the time has come for us to do what is right for America's \nseniors. Let us help them, help the Medicare Program to travel this \nlast mile, and bring the Medicare Program into the 21st century.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine for her \nvery fine statement. More important, a thank-you to her is warranted \nbecause of the long hours of work she has put into this subject of \nMedicare and prescription drugs. The strengthening and improvement of \nMedicare and a prescription drug program has been something the Senator \nfrom Maine has worked on for a long time. So I not only compliment her \non her statement today, but I thank her for the work she has done in \nputting together the product that is before us. Even more so than the \nproduct that is before us, I acknowledge the work she was part of \nduring the years 2001 and 2002 as part of the tripartisan group of \nSenators, including Senators Breaux, Jeffords, Hatch, Senator Snowe, \nand this Senator from Iowa, because it was the months of work during \nthe spring of 2001 through the summer of 2001, and then picking up \nagain in the spring of 2002, until we brought a bill to the floor 1 \nyear ago now to discuss. The success of that work then laid the \nfoundation for what we can do right now. That involved hours and hours \nof work for individual Members of the Senate, and more work yet for the \nstaffs of each of those Members. So I thank her for putting in the time \nin 2001 and 2002, which did not yield a successful product at that \npoint but very much made it possible for us early in the year 2003 to \nbe before the Senate. Again, I thank the Senator from Maine for that \nfoundational work.\n  I think the next speaker will be the Senator from Louisiana, Senator \nBreaux. While the Senator from Maine and I might be able to say we were \npart of the foundation of the bill that is before us, Senator Breaux \nwas in the trenches digging the footing for that foundation years \nbefore we got involved, because he was a member of what was called the \nCommission on Medicare, later called the Breaux Commission. Because of \nhis work--even before our work on the tripartisan bill--I acknowledge \nthe extra effort the Senator from Louisiana has brought to this point. \nSo I thank him and, for a second time, I thank the Senator from Maine.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, let me first express my appreciation for \nthe very kind remarks of the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. \nI think it is only appropriate to acknowledge that had it not been for \nhis perseverance and determination, we would not be here today. He set \na very tough timeline on the Senate for considering this bill. He took \nit through the appropriate hearing channels in the Senate Finance \nCommittee to bring it to this point. We had extensive staff briefings \nand discussions among Republican staff and Democratic staff. We had a \nmarkup that many people said was really very pleasant. We had \ndifferences of opinion, but everybody had an opportunity to be heard. I \ncredit creating that atmosphere to the leadership of the Senator from \nIowa. We have had situations during the year--the tax bill is one of \nthem--where we did not follow that process. As a result, perhaps the \nproduct was not as good as it should have been.\n  In this case, I think the Senate Finance Committee, in particular, \nrose to the challenge, and under the leadership of both Senator \nGrassley and our colleague Max Baucus on our side, we were able to \ncreate a cohesive group of men and women who were dedicated to \nproducing a product in a bipartisan fashion. That is exactly what \nhappened with a 16-5 vote on a Medicare reform and prescription drug \nbill, which would not have been possible had it not been for his strong \nleadership.\n  To the Senator from Maine, I offer my congratulations for her \ninvolvement, dedication, and her willingness to step outside the \ntraditional boundaries and take some chances politically, as well as \nsubstantively, in order to help produce a product which, in the end, \nultimately will be something of which we can all be very proud.\n  I think all of us realize the time has come that it is necessary for \nus to step out of the traditional boundaries that may put us at risk \nwith some constituents we all represent in order to produce a better \nproduct for those very constituents who may say don't go there; but for \nthose who had the courage to go there, we now have a product of which \nwe can justifiably be proud. The Senator from Maine has been a major \nplayer in all of these efforts. We appreciate that very much.\n  Mr. President, let me take some time, from my perspective, to try to \npresent where we are with regard to the Medicare reform and \nprescription drug bill. It was in 1965--38 years ago now--that the \nCongress of the United States did something that had never\n\n[[Page S7952]]\n\nbeen done. The Congress and President Lyndon Johnson at that time made \na fundamental decision that older Americans were going to receive \nhealth care benefits, and that the Federal Government had an obligation \nto help provide those benefits. As a result of that commitment, the \n1965 Medicare Act was adopted.\n  Ever since then, for 38 years, seniors knew when they reached the age \nof 65, they would have access to a Government-run health care program. \nThat health care program was principally designed to do what medical \nscience said was necessary back in 1965. It provided hospital insurance \ncoverage for seniors who went to the hospital, and it provided doctor \ncoverage for seniors who had to see a doctor.\n  In 1965, those were the two fundamental ways in which people received \nhealth care in the United States. You went to see your doctor and, if \nyou were sick enough, the doctor put you in the hospital. So for the \nvery first time we said to senior citizens, 65 or older, when you reach \nthat age, you are going to be part of a Government-run insurance \nprogram on your behalf.\n  For a long period of time it was a state of the art, as far as health \ncare was concerned, with regard to our Nation's seniors. It has really \nworked. It has sort of been the envy of many parts of the world because \nmany countries did not have the quality health care we had for our \nNation's seniors. That, as I say, was back in 1965, and today is today.\n\n  While health care has changed dramatically, while science has \nimproved incredibly so, the program that was designed in 1965 is still \npretty much the same program that seniors look to in order to receive \ntheir health care.\n  It has been a good program, but it is not nearly as good as it should \nbe nor nearly as good as we can make it. That is why we are here today: \nTo create a better program, to build on what was the best in 1965, to \ncreate the best in the year 2003.\n  Medical science has advanced dramatically. The health care delivery \nsystem that brings about that health care for our seniors has not \nadvanced very much at all. It is still what I call frozen in the 1960s.\n  Some have argued: All you have to do is put more money into the \nprogram and it will work fine. I suggest just putting more money into a \n1965 model program is like putting more gasoline in a 1965 model \nautomobile. It is going to still run like an old car no matter how much \ngas you put into it.\n  No matter how much money we put into the Medicare Program that was \nbuilt in 1965, it is still going to run and operate as a 1965 model. \nToday, in this body, and this period of time before the Fourth of July, \nhopefully we will have an opportunity to do something that is as \nimportant as what was done in 1965 when the Congress made that \nfundamental decision to provide health care for seniors.\n  With what we have before us, we can create a 21st century program \nwhich takes the best in science and the best in medical care and puts \nit into a quality delivery system.\n  It is interesting to note when I talk about why the current system is \ndeficient, one of the most important issues I bring to mind is the fact \nthat the Medicare Program today only covers about 47 percent of an \naverage senior citizen's health care costs they experience every year. \nThat means 53 percent is covered by the Federal Government, but it also \nmeans 47 percent is not covered.\n  Where do seniors go for the 47 percent of their health needs that are \nnot covered in this 1965 model program? If they are poor enough, they \nalso get Medicaid, or if they look for help from their children or \ntheir grandchildren, that makes up part of the difference. Or if they \nare fortunate enough to have enough funds, they can buy extra \ninsurance, called the Medigap Insurance Program, to cover the 47 \npercent of their health care costs Medicare does not cover.\n  No one I can think of in the private sector--certainly including \nMembers of Congress--has a health insurance program that does not cover \n47 percent of their health expenses. No one would want to go out and \nbuy a health insurance program that did not cover on average 47 percent \nof their needs. It would be a terrible buy. You want something that \ncovers as much as possible, and Medicare does not do that.\n  People are forced to buy the extra insurance or become so poor that \nthey qualify for the Medicaid Program or have their children or \ngrandchildren or perhaps just their friends help them with their \nMedicare costs that the program does not pick up.\n  In addition, one of the most important fundamental advances in health \ncare is the advent of the prescription drug program that has saved \nlives and allowed people to live better lives. The correct and proper \nuse of pharmaceuticals today can keep people out of hospitals or it can \nmake their hospital stay shorter. It can treat diseases that are \nprevalent today and make our lives better and our families more \ncomfortable. Yet pharmaceuticals are not even covered by Medicare \nunless you happen to be in the hospital and physicians give you the \npharmaceuticals in the hospital. Once you leave the hospital, the \nMedicare Program does not cover the pharmaceuticals.\n\n  It is a perverse incentive to stay in the hospital longer so you get \nyour drugs paid for, when really you ought to use drugs to get out of \nthe hospital sooner or to not have to go there at all.\n  The Medicare Program is full of deficiencies. It does not cover \neyeglasses. It does not cover pharmaceuticals. It does not cover many \nof the preventive health care measures we should cover. In addition, \nthe Medicare Program does not do something that today is one of the \nmost important functions we can do in health care, and that is \npreventive medicine.\n  We talk about how high health costs are in this country today, and \none of the principal reasons is because people generally do not go to \nthe doctor until they are sick. In reality, they ought to be going to \nthe doctor when they are well to find out what they should be doing in \nterms of preventive care to make sure that whatever they are prone to \nhave later in life is pushed back as far as possible or perhaps even \neliminated. Preventive care can do that, but the Medicare Program does \nlittle, if any, preventive care, and it should not be like that.\n  In fact, private health care systems work very hard to create \npreventive health care measures to keep the cost of health care down, \nto get people to live healthier lives now so their health care costs \nlater are less or perhaps even eliminated. Medicare does not do that.\n  The one thing Medicare does not do very well is to bring about \ninnovation. We have to have an act of Congress to do many functions \nthat the private sector can do automatically. The Medicare Program \nrequires an act of Congress, as I have cited many times before, to try \nto bring about new innovative ways of delivering medicine.\n  We actually had people come to our office and say: We need an act of \nCongress because we now have a medicine that can be orally administered \ninstead of intravenously injected, but Medicare does not pay for it \nunless it is intravenously injected. So we need an act of Congress to \nallow Medicare to pay for something that can be orally administered in \nthe form of a tablet. That is not how medicine should work in the 21st \ncentury.\n  We have before us a medical program for our Nation's seniors that was \nstate of the art in 1965. It has been a wonderful program. It has been \na program that has saved lives and a program that has made people's \nlives much better, but it is a program that is frozen in the 1960s.\n  We have today the opportunity to create a modern 21st century health \ncare delivery program that looks out over the country and decides what \nis the best way of delivering health care; how can we make it work \nbetter. That is the proposal before us.\n  When I had the great privilege of chairing the Medicare Commission in \n1998, we had numerous witnesses give us their suggestions. We had the \ntime to listen to the theory about what we ought to do with the \nMedicare Program. To a large extent, the groups that came before the \ncommission fell into two different groups. The first group said: The \nFederal Government should do everything in this area, the Federal \nGovernment should run the program from top to bottom, and the private \nsector should not be involved at all because we cannot trust the \nprivate sector, which has a profit motive as their main goal, to be \ninvolved in\n\n[[Page S7953]]\n\ndelivering health care to our Nation's seniors. That camp, therefore, \nsaid the Federal Government should do everything.\n\n  On the other hand, a second group of folks who came before the \ncommittee took the position: The Federal Government should not do \nanything in delivering health care. We should turn the entire program \nover to the private sector, and the private sector ought to run the \nprogram, deliver the health care benefits, because they can bring about \ncompetition, they can bring about innovation, and the Federal \nGovernment cannot do that. So the Federal Government should not be \ninvolved at all.\n  We had a fundamental difference between the two camps that said the \nFederal Government should do everything and those who said the Federal \nGovernment should do nothing at all. The beauty of what we have today \nis that we attempt to combine the best of what the Federal Government \ncan do with the best of what the private sector can do into a single \ndelivery system and present that to our Nation's seniors as a vast \nimprovement.\n  For me, it was never an either/or choice. It was never let the \nFederal Government do everything or require them to do nothing at all, \nbut, rather, to bring the two sides together. I think by doing what we \ndid is why today we see so much bipartisan support for this concept.\n  There were many of my Republican colleagues who had a preference for \nletting the private sector do it all and many of my Democratic \ncolleagues said, no, the Federal Government should do it. But when we \nhave combined the best of what both can do, we have created a system \nwhereby I think we will have bipartisan support with a very large \nnumber of Members being able to vote for this on final passage. That in \nitself is a great victory.\n  Many people thought it would never be possible. Had we taken the \nposition of one or the other, it probably would have been a very \ndivided vote. On the other hand, by combining the best of what both \nsides could do, we have, in fact, created a better system, both from a \nfundamental standpoint of good government, and we have also created a \npolitical proposition with which both sides can feel comfortable.\n  What we have attempted to do--and I tried to take hundreds of pages \nof legislative language and put it all on one chart which in itself is \na pretty difficult job--but what we have done, as my chart indicates, \nis to say that the beneficiary, of course, being our older Americans \neligible for Medicare, starting in January, because we cannot get this \nthing started overnight, every Medicare beneficiary will be able to get \nsome help and assistance on their prescription drugs under the current \nprogram; every beneficiary will start with a basic discount card \navailable to all Medicare beneficiaries where they will be able to take \nthat medical beneficiary card that is a product of the Federal Medicare \nProgram to their drugstore, or to wherever they happen to purchase \ntheir pharmaceutical drugs, and get a basic discount which is estimated \nto be somewhere around 20 or 25 percent on the drugs that they have to \npay for that have been prescribed to them by their medical doctor. That \nwould be available to all Medicare beneficiaries starting in January.\n  Also, starting in January there will be a special assistance to low-\nincome beneficiaries who would receive approximately a $600 subsidy in \naddition to the discount card. So we are saying all beneficiaries would \nget the discount card. They could go to the drugstore, get their \npharmaceuticals filled, but if they are a low-income beneficiary they \nwould also receive an additional subsidy of approximately $600.\n  It is really interesting to note, when we talk about drugs for \nseniors--and the fact is that most seniors on average have \napproximately a little over $2,000 a year in prescription drug costs. \nIt is projected to go up to a little over $3,000 by the year 2006 when \nthe big program kicks in. That is what the average senior has to pay \nfor drugs. Many of them currently are low-income seniors and Medicaid \npays for all of those drugs, or many of them have bought Medigap \ninsurance which covers those drugs. Many of them, like my father, have \na drug plan from a former employer, so they cover their drugs.\n  A substantial number of seniors right now have some coverage for \nprescription drugs, but it is not under the Medicare Program. It is by \nbuying extra private insurance, it is by being fortunate enough to have \na plan from their former employer that pays for their drugs, or many of \nthem receive it from the Medicaid Program if they are a low-income \nbeneficiary. That is certainly not good enough. Medicare should cover \nit.\n\n  So immediately starting in 2004 through 2006, under our plan, every \nMedicare beneficiary would get the basic discount card, plus low-income \nbeneficiaries would get extra assistance.\n  Beginning in the year 2006--and I know my distinguished Democratic \nleader was talking about that is a long time, and 24 months is a long \nperiod of time, but we have to do it right. We have to set this new \nprogram up on a national basis. Beginning in the year 2006, every \nMedicare recipient would be able to stay right where they are today if \nthey like their current Medicare Program.\n  I have given some of the good things it has done, and I have also \ntried to point out where it is deficient. There are a lot of \ndeficiencies. If a senior is happy with the traditional Medicare \nProgram, they can stay right in the traditional fee-for-service program \nthat we call the Medicare Program. They can stay in this program as \nlong as they would like it. And, yes, for the first time beginning in \nthat year 2006, they would also be able to stay in the traditional \nMedicare Program and get prescription drugs because we would establish \na stand-alone drug program for everybody who stays in traditional \nMedicare.\n  That stand-alone drug program would not be a Government-run and \nGovernment-micromanaged plan. For the first time, it would use a \nprivate delivery system for seniors to be able to receive \npharmaceuticals they would receive as a Medicare beneficiary. Just like \nI get my pharmaceuticals covered under my Government health plan, \nseniors would have a private delivery system. This is not turning the \nseniors over to the mercy of the private sector. This is still a \nGovernment-regulated program in the sense that the Medicare officials \nand HHS would be responsible for making sure this stand-alone drug \nprogram for seniors is run properly; that the companies that are \noffering the plans have the financial ability to offer those drugs.\n  They would utilize what we call pharmacy benefit managers to \nconstruct programs. Insurance companies would come in and offer the \nseniors a pharmaceutical stand-alone drug plan. The companies would \nutilize the pharmacy benefit managers to try to get the best possible \ndeal they could get from the pharmaceutical manufacturers. They could \nutilize formularies; they could utilize a blend where it is possible to \nchoose between brand name and generic drugs. They would be able to get \nthe best possible financial deal that they could offer to the seniors \nin a drug program.\n  Like I said, it would combine the best of what Government can do, \nwhich would be to make sure it is being run properly, with the best the \nprivate sector could do, which is bring about competition and tough \nnegotiation with the pharmaceutical companies and manufacturers in \norder to present to the senior the best possible product. The Federal \nGovernment would still be involved in overseeing it but not \nmicromanaging it.\n  For the first time they will also have another option they do not \nhave now. Beginning in 2006, every senior could stay in traditional \nMedicare just like it is, but at their choice they would also have an \nopportunity to go into a new program called Medicare Advantage. \nMedicare Advantage would, in fact, be a combination Federal/private \nsector program which would deliver to every Medicare recipient who \nwants to join an integrated health plan, which would provide them \nhospital coverage, doctor coverage, and prescription drug coverage. \nThey would also utilize the private sector delivery system for all of \nthose areas, not just the drugs that they would get under traditional \nMedicare.\n  To a great extent, their plan would be based on what we have as \nFederal employees under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, \nwhere the Federal Government, through the Office of Personnel \nManagement, sets up\n\n[[Page S7954]]\n\na benefit plan for all of us in that plan and the Federal Government \nwould set the standards as to what has to be met, what has to be \nprovided, and then private insurance companies would come in and offer \nthat coverage like they do for all of us as Federal employees.\n  Every year we would get a book, and the book shows us what is \navailable, and we have to pick and choose. We pick the plan that is \nbest for ourselves and our families. That is, in essence, what we are \ntalking about in the new Medicare Advantage. Preferred provider \norganizations such as those in the Federal system would come in and \noffer different plans and different options to our Nation's seniors.\n\n  We want to have some standards but we also want to have enough \nvariations so people have a choice to pick the plan best for them.\n  Our drug plan has a $275 deductible, a 50 percent copayment, and an \napproximately $35 premium. I happen to believe some variation is \nimportant in order for people to have a choice. Some plans may offer a \nhigher deductible or should be able to offer that. We are working \nultimately on trying to make sure there is some flexibility yet also \nsome definitiveness about what, in fact, it is going to cost. That is \nimportant. We have achieved that appropriate and proper balance.\n  Beginning in 2006, seniors will have choices of staying in \ntraditional Medicare if they want. No one will force them into picking \nanything else. Younger seniors, people not quite 65, moving into the \nnew program will be used to utilizing the new delivery system and will \nbe comfortable with it. AARP, which represents the largest number of \nsenior citizens in this country, has taken polls of their members and \nhas found men and women between 55 and 65 years of age prefer these \noptions and choices and feel comfortable with preferred provider \norganizations which more and more citizens in this country are in.\n  Preferred providers are just that: a selection of preferred doctors \nand hospitals that can deliver these services. If you want to go \noutside of that system, you can go outside of that system, but it may \ncost you a little bit more.\n  By creating these preferred provider organizations you can negotiate \nfinancial deals with them that help reduce costs and help reduce \nprices. There are a lot of people in the country that want us to reduce \nprices, reduce costs, but don't want us to do anything to bring about \nlower costs and better prices. They say they want cheaper drugs but do \nnot want restrictions on how much and what type and where they can get \nthem. We cannot do both. The same with doctors and hospitals.\n  If you try to reduce prices, you have to get doctors and hospitals to \nnegotiate the best price. By doing that, you may restrict to some \ndegree where you might go to get those medical services. You can always \ngo outside the system, but you may have to pay more for that choice \noutside the preferred provider system.\n  I want to address the point some made: we have tried this experiment \nwith health maintenance organizations, HMOs, and they have not worked. \nOne of the reasons they have not worked is the way Congress constructed \nthem and the way we reimbursed them has not been very good at all, \ncausing a lot to move out. Some HMOs are doing well in some areas and \nsome HMOs have gone bust in other counties.\n  What we are talking about is not doing this new system on a county-\nby-county basis. That was one of the big problems why HMOs did not \nwork. What this bill does is create 10 geographic regions in the \ncountry. The preferred providers will come in and offer their services \nin a region. By creating a region, you create not just a rural area--\nwhether it is Wyoming, Montana, or North or South Dakota, where a lot \nof our colleagues have expressed concern this would not work--we have \ncreated geographic regions in the country that will combine more urban \nareas with more rural areas so you get a better blend, a better mix. \nThey will be required to provide those services in the entire \ngeographic region, which gives people who provide these services a \nbetter opportunity to try and make sure it will work. In rural \ncounties, they all pulled out because there were not enough people to \nmake it work. We have created 10 geographic regions around the country \nto make it much more likely this new system will, in fact, work and \nwork very well.\n\n  There will be a lot more debate and a lot more amendments. Our \ncolleagues in the other body are also moving forward with this type of \nlegislation today and for the next couple of weeks. I am ultimately \ncomfortable that we will, in fact, be able to pass a program in this \nCongress and hopefully complete it before the 4th of July recess that \nwill create a new Medicare Program for our Nation's seniors which will \nprovide prescription drugs but also will provide a better delivery \nsystem, one that is balanced, one that combines the best of what \ngovernment can do with the best of what the private sector can do. We \nhave accomplished that.\n  Can this be improved? Of course. There is nothing we do that cannot \nbe improved. We are restricted to some degree by the fact we do not \nhave as much money as I think is truly needed and necessary in order to \ncreate a program that is one that is even better than the one I have \ndescribed. The facts are, we have $400 billion in the budget. If we had \n$500 or $600 billion or even $800 billion we could create a program \nthat is much better than the one we have created. But there will be \ntime to improve. We will have the opportunity to make this an even \nbetter program in the future. Obviously, we have to take the first \nstep. This is truly the first step in 38 years that we have had the \nopportunity to take, which will bring to our Nation's seniors a better \nprogram we can always work to improve as time guess on.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I ask unanimous consent the time during this quorum call \nbe equally charged.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am happy we are here today on what I \nthink is the first day of maybe 2 weeks of work in the Senate to pass a \nbill many Members thought would pass last summer but got tied up in \nsome election year political maneuvering in the Senate and did not \nhappen.\n  We have an opportunity this year--because this bill has broad \nbipartisan support based on the vote of 15-6 out of our committee, such \na vote gives an opportunity to bring this issue to fruition--to present \na bill to the President of the United States yet this summer.\n  Last Thursday, the Finance Committee did report out a breakthrough \nbill that would make prescription drug coverage a reality for 40 \nmillion Medicare beneficiaries. The committee approval was of a \nsweeping package of new comprehensive prescription drug benefits and \nother program improvements that makes very good sense but also keeps \ngood our commitment to our seniors.\n  Since 1965, seniors have had drug insurance without prescription \ndrugs. We have had health insurance without prescription drugs. By \npassing our bill last Thursday, the Finance Committee made history and \ncame one step closer to changing the fact that prescription drugs were \nnever a part of the Medicare Program unless they were administered in a \nhospital situation.\n\n  How did we get to the point we are today, where it looks as if we \nhave broad bipartisan support for this legislation? This important \nbreakthrough came because of the tireless work of our committee \nmembers, both Democrat and Republican, that has been going on over the \nlast 5 years, going back to the time when Senator Breaux, who just \nspoke and deserves a\n\n[[Page S7955]]\n\nlot of credit for bringing us this far--and also Senator Frist--led the \nway on prescription drugs before any of us were paying much attention \nor even listening. Then Senators Snowe, Hatch, and Jeffords carried the \ntorch for 2 years, working with Senator Breaux and this Senator from \nIowa on what we called then the tripartisan bill. It is tripartisan \ninstead of bipartisan because Senator Jeffords officially, even though \nhe sits with the Democrats, considers himself not a member of that \nparty but an independent Member of the Senate.\n  The tripartisan effort, of which I was a part, was something on which \nI was proud to work but, more importantly, not just as an end in itself \nbut, in hindsight, now I can say it set the stage, the foundation work, \nfor where we are today on a bill that is even better than the \ntripartisan bill.\n  How do you get this far? The breakthrough came because of the \nPresident's unyielding commitment to getting something done for seniors \nonce and for all. It takes more than just the Senate, it takes more \nthan just the Senate and the House, it takes the President--all three--\nto bring legislation to what we call law.\n  This budget that the President put forth put real money on the table \nfor prescription drugs--$400 billion over 10 years. So the Finance \nCommittee wasted no time in taking advantage of that $400 billion that \nwas in the budget for a specific proposal of prescription drugs and \nreporting out this good bill. I am glad about that; otherwise, we would \nnot be here--without this budget leeway.\n  The bill we passed out of committee last Thursday night is a \nbalanced, bipartisan product that flowed from good faith, from fair \ndealing, and from a commitment to consensus across party lines. So it \nis my hope that this same spirit will prevail on the floor of the \nSenate during the debate on this bill. I have no reason to believe it \nwill not. I believe the debate in our committee, by both Republicans \nand Democrats, was just the type of debate you ought to have but do not \noften see in committees, particularly on very sweeping legislation, \nwhich is what this bill happens to be.\n  I intend to do everything I can to ensure a safe and successful \npassing of this legislation. To do that, I intend to work hard to keep \nthe climate on the Senate floor as reasonable and most certainly \nbipartisan as it was in our Finance Committee through the course of \nlast Thursday.\n  Of course, legislation of this size and scope does not make everybody \nhappy. You cannot expect that it would. This bill cannot and will not \nbe all things to all people. I expect to hear from many Senators about \nprovisions, whether they be large provisions or smaller, less \nsignificant provisions in the bill, with which Members might not be \nhappy. Of course, in the process of legislating, I welcome those who \nwant to tell me about those with which they are happy as well. \nSometimes we tend more toward the negative than the positive. I think \nthere is a lot about this legislation--most of this legislation--that \nis very positive.\n\n  I pledge to work with all Senators in the days ahead to address \nconcerns people have in the underlying bill. But I will keep my eyes on \nthat larger prize, the promise we have expressed in so many elections, \nboth Republican and Democrat, to modernize and strengthen Medicare, to \nmove Medicare into the practice of medicine of the 21st century. One of \nthe major steps in that move to improve Medicare is providing a \nprescription drug benefit.\n  If we were writing a Medicare bill for the first time and we were \ndoing that in the year 2003, it would not be like 1965 when \nprescription drugs were only 1 percent of the cost of medicine. Today \nit is a much larger part of the cost of medicine and is part of keeping \npeople out of hospitals. Obviously, we would write prescription drugs \nin that 2003 brandnew Medicare bill if we were writing a brand-new \nbill.\n  I am keeping my eye on that larger prize. That prize is passage of a \ncomprehensive prescription drug benefit that will give immediate \nassistance, starting next January, 2004, and continuing as a permanent \npart of Medicare, to every citizen in America. If I were to generalize \nabout a prescription drug benefit: First, it is voluntary. People don't \nhave to buy into it if they don't want. It is very comprehensive and it \nis universal.\n  The bill before us puts that prize in our path. The Prescription Drug \nand Medicare Improvement Act brings Medicare, then, into the 21st \ncentury. The bill provides affordable prescription drug coverage on a \nvoluntary basis to every senior in America. The coverage is stable. It \nis predictable. It is secure. Most important, the value of the coverage \ndoes not vary based on where you live and whether you have decided to \njoin a private health plan. For Iowans and others in rural America who \nhave too often been left behind by most Medicare private health plans, \nthis is an important accomplishment that I insisted be in our bill when \ndelivered to the Senate floor.\n  Overall, we rely on the best of the private sector to deliver drug \ncoverage, supported by the best of the public sector to secure consumer \nprotections and important patient rights. This combination of public \nand private resources is what stabilizes the benefit and helps keep the \ncosts down.\n  Keeping costs down is essential because what I hear from the seniors \nin Iowa is not about a specific program, it is: Why are prescription \ndrug costs so high? To them, so unreasonable. Keeping drug costs down \nis essential, not just for seniors but for the program as a whole.\n  Across this bill we have targeted our resources very carefully, \ngiving additional help to our lowest income seniors. Consistent with a \npolicy of targeted policymaking, we have worked hard to keep existing \nsources of prescription drug coverage viable. Our goal, ever since we \nstarted on the tripartisan proposal 2 years ago, was not to replace \nprivate dollars with public dollars. This bill accomplishes that by \nkeeping Medicare State pharmacy assistance programs and retiree health \nbenefits strong. Surely any change of this magnitude will have some \nripple effect on other sources of coverage.\n  Regarding company-based benefits, our bill gives employers more \nflexibility than ever to participate fully in the new drug benefit.\n  We all know about the pressures employers face in maintaining health \ncare coverage under mounting cost pressures. Decisions about scaling \nback coverage or even a company dropping it altogether are bound to be \nmade regardless of whether we pass this bill. In the days ahead, we \nwill work to encourage employer participation in the new drug benefit. \nBut I am confident the balanced policy before us is a good place to \nstart.\n  I would like to speak about our fee-for-service improvements in this \nbill designated as S. 1.\n  There is a very important aspect of this bill. It is called the \nMedicare Improvement Act for a reason. Beyond just prescription drugs, \nour bill is a milestone accomplishment for improving traditional \nMedicare, especially Medicare being delivered to rural America.\n  Included in our bill is the best rural improvement and Medicare \nequity package that the Senate has ever seen. I insisted on including \nit in the committee mark because the most important Medicare reforms \ninvolved fixing outdated and bureaucratic formulas that penalize rural \nStates. This package passed the Senate 86 to 12 last month on the jobs \nand growth package. But it was tabled in conference between the House \nand the Senate.\n  I hope that vote is very strongly regarded today by the Senate so \nthat we don't even have to deal with this discussion on the floor of \nthe Senate as we did then on the tax bill.\n  Because this rural health package, or Medicare equity package--\nwhatever you want to call it--was dropped in conference, the President \nwrote a letter shortly thereafter endorsing these same provisions. I am \npleased to include them here today with his support.\n  At this point, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe President's letter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                         Washington, May 22, 2003.\n     Senator Charles Grassley,\n     Committee on Finance,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Grassley: I want to congratulate you on \n     Senate passage of the jobs and growth bill, and also on the \n     passage of\n\n[[Page S7956]]\n\n     your amendment to that bill which increased federal \n     assistance to rural providers through the Medicare program.\n       When we met in the Oval Office in early April, we discussed \n     our concerns that rural Medicare providers need additional \n     help, and we committed to addressing their problems. We \n     agreed on the need to address issues faced by rural \n     hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies, \n     and physicians.\n       You demonstrated your commitment by passing your amendment \n     last week with tremendous bipartisan support, and by pushing \n     hard for it in the conference negotiations on the jobs and \n     growth bill.\n       I will support the increased Medicare funding for rural \n     providers contained in your amendment as a part of a bill \n     that implements our shared goal for Medicare reform.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   George W. Bush.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thought I would read at least the last \nparagraph by President George Bush.\n\n       I will support the increased Medicare funding for rural \n     providers contained in your amendment--\n\n  Meaning the Grassley amendment--\n\n     as a part of a bill that implements our shared goal for \n     Medicare reform.\n\n  What the President is talking about in this letter is just exactly \nwhat we have before the Senate--the same amendment included in this \nprescription drug bill on rural equity that passed the Senate 86 to 12 \na month ago.\n  We have the prescription drug bill and the Medicare reform bill \nbefore us. These two are married up at a point that the President's \nletter refers to.\n  I want people to know that including this is something I discussed \nwith the President on at least two occasions before his May 22 letter \nto me. One time in early December when the President asked me to come \nto the White House to discuss early on the process for moving this \nlegislation along, I had an opportunity to remind him at that \nparticular point about the speech he gave in August 2002 in Davenport, \nIA, during a political event at which he appeared for Congressman \nNussle of Iowa. The President rightly complimented Congressman Nussle \nfor leading efforts in the other body to help rural equity. I reminded \nthe President that the short reference he gave in his otherwise long \nspeech was used by Congressman Nussle in his TV ads in eastern Iowa \nduring last fall's election. I wanted the President to be reminded that \nall Iowa heard him--not just a few Republicans at the Nussle campaign \nevent in August--but all Iowans heard him throughout the fall campaign \nwith parts of his speech being reproduced on this campaign ad.\n  I also had an opportunity early in April to talk to the President \nwhen the President once again visited with me about provisions of the \nprescription drug bill. He makes reference to that in the second \nparagraph of the letter. He said:\n\n       When we met in the Oval Office in early April, we discussed \n     our concerns that rural Medicare providers needed additional \n     help, and we committed to addressing their problems. We \n     agreed on the need to address issues faced by rural \n     hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies, \n     and physicians.\n\n  The President is well aware of his communicating this directly to the \npeople of Iowa even before I had my discussions with the President on \nthese issues. I am glad the President is committed to fulfilling his \nstatement to the people of Iowa that he made last summer.\n  This rural health care safety net is otherwise coming apart. That is \nwhy this rural equity issue is so important. The bill before the Senate \nbegins to mend it. The hospitals and home health agencies in rural \nAmerica lose money on every Medicare patient they see. Rural physicians \nare penalized by bureaucratic formulas that reduce payments below those \nof their urban counterparts for the very same service. Our bill takes \nhistoric steps toward correcting geographic disparities that penalize \nrural health care providers. I will summarize some of these.\n  On hospitals, we eliminate the disparity between large urban \nhospitals and small urban hospitals, as well as rural hospitals, by \nequalizing the inpatient-based payment. The hospitals in my State and \nother rural areas are paid 1.06 percent less on every discharge. That \nis a $14 million loss every year just for my State. It is time to make \nthis change permanent.\n\n  We also revised the labor share of the wage index in the inpatient \nhospitals. The wage index calculation kills our hospitals in rural \nareas. They have to compete with larger hospitals in bigger cities for \nthe same small pool of nurses and physicians. But because of the \ninequities in the wage index, they aren't able to offer the kinds of \nsalaries and benefits that attract health care workers in cities.\n  Our bill begins adjusting the labor-related share downward to correct \nthese inequities. We strengthen and improve the Critical Access \nHospital Program which has been so successful in keeping open the doors \nof some of our most remote hospitals.\n  I think in my State of Iowa, almost a third of our hospitals have \nchanged to what we call ``critical access hospitals.''\n  Also, in this bill, we create a low-volume adjustment for those \ncritical access hospitals and for other rural hospitals that aren't \nable to qualify for the Critical Access Hospital Program.\n  These hospital corrections are not partisan rhetoric. They are \nsupported by the nonpartisan Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, by \nthe Center for Medicare Systems Administrator--and he did that in a \nrecent letter to the House Ways and Means Committee--and also by 31 \nbipartisan members of the Senate Rural Health Caucus.\n  For doctors, our bill removes a penalty which Medicare imposes on \nthose who choose to practice in rural States. Medicare adjusts payments \nto doctors downward based on just where they live. We believe the value \nof the physician service is the same regardless of where that doctor \nmay live. Medicare doesn't recognize that. Our bill begins to change \nthat.\n  Our bill also provides assistance to other rural health care \nproviders such as ambulance services, and home health agencies which \nmillions of seniors in rural areas rely on every day.\n  Providers in rural States such as Iowa practice some of the lowest \ncost, highest quality medicine in the country. This is widely \nunderstood by researchers, academics, and citizens of those States, but \nit surely isn't recognized by Medicare. Medicare, instead, rewards \nproviders in high-cost, inefficient States with bigger payments that \nhave the perverse effect of incentivizing overutilization of services \nand, in the end, giving poor quality.\n  These policies are paid for, not by taking resources away from the \nprescription drug package or by taking money away from those high-cost \nStates but by other modifications to the Medicare Program that makes \njust plain, good policy sense.\n  These rural health care provisions are a fair and balanced approach \nto improving equity in rural America. My colleagues on the Finance \nCommittee--a lot of them from these same rural States--recognize that. \nAnd I think on this vote we had a month ago I can say that the full \nSenate recognizes that.\n  I would speak last about the Medicare Advantage or the preferred \nprovider organization parts of our legislation. Because beyond \nprescription drugs, and beyond the issue of rural health care, our bill \ngoes to great lengths to make better benefits and more choices \navailable for our seniors. In fact, one of the things that has been a \nfocal point of this legislation over the 2 or more years we have \nadopted it has been to give seniors the right to choose.\n  Mr. President, I see that you are rapping the gavel. Can you tell me \nwhat that is all about?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The time until \n12:30 is equally divided.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Could I ask, since there are not other people here, \nmaybe for 3 more minutes?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I would respond, Senator Dorgan wants 15 \nminutes, and then that is it.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will put the rest of my statement in the Record.\n  Mr. BREAUX. It may work out. How much time do we have, I ask the \nChair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-seven and a half minutes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. That is fine. Go ahead.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Well, the Senator from North Dakota is here.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I say to the Senator from North Dakota, the Senator wants \nto complete his statement.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Two more minutes?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Two more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n[[Page S7957]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we want to give seniors the right to \nchoose in as many areas as we can. That is why I use the word \n``voluntary.'' And that is why I use the phrase ``the right to choose \nwhat they might consider better Medicare programs than traditional.''\n  Our bill specifically authorizes provider organizations to \nparticipate in Medicare. The idea is these kinds of lightly managed \ncare plans more closely resemble the kinds of plans that we choose for \nthe Federal Government and which close to 50 percent of working \nAmericans have today but only 13 percent of the people in Medicare have \nthat today.\n  Preferred provider organizations have the advantage of offering the \nsame benefit of traditional Medicare, including prescription drugs, but \non an integrated, coordinated basis. This bill creates new \nopportunities for chronic disease management and access to innovative \nnew therapies.\n  PPOs might not be right for everyone. We are going to let seniors \nmake that choice. Our bill sets up a playing field for preferred \nprovider organizations to compete for beneficiaries. We believe PPOs \ncan be competitive and offer stronger, more enhanced benefits.\n  In the days ahead, I will be working with colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to ensure that we set up the right system, one that is truly \ncompetitive and viable for these preferred provider organizations. No \nsenior has to choose this new program. Our prevailing policy has been, \nand always will be, one that lets seniors keep what they have if they \nlike it with no changes. All the seniors, regardless of whether they \nchoose a PPO or not, can still get prescription drugs.\n  We have 2 long weeks ahead of us. My commitment is to stay here until \nthe lights go out to ensure that we pass a balanced bipartisan bill.\n  I thank my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee for their fine \nwork to get us this far.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, before Senator Grassley leaves the floor, \nI want to tell him that one piece of this legislation that I think is \nparticularly important are the provisions dealing with Medicare \nreimbursement for rural hospitals and other rural health care \nproviders. I know he talked about how this Senate has dealt with this \nconcern before, and we have. In fact, we had a very strong vote on it. \nBut at this point, significant legislation has not been signed into \nlaw.\n  The fact is, his constituents in Iowa and mine in North Dakota pay \nthe same payroll tax out of our paychecks as everybody else in the \ncountry, except we do not get the same reimbursement for much of what \nour providers do. And the result is, some very important health care \nfacilities in smaller rural States, in smaller communities, are \nstruggling and having an awfully difficult time making it because the \nprovider reimbursement system is not fair.\n  I want to compliment my colleague from Iowa and others who have \nworked on this. I have been pleased to work on it some, but his \nleadership is very important in this area. That is one piece of this \nlegislation to which I think we need to pay some attention. I will be \npleased when the President signs a bill that includes these provisions, \nand so will many of our rural health care providers who have waited a \nlong while for it.\n  Having said that, let me make a couple of comments about the broader \npiece of legislation and why we are here.\n  I think Medicare has been an excellent program for this country. \nPrior to the creation of the Medicare program, over one-half of the \nsenior citizens in America had no health insurance coverage. They \nreached their retirement years--having worked all their lives, in most \ncases--and discovered that when they were in their sixties, seventies, \nand eighties there was not a traffic jam of insurance agents or \ninsurance companies wanting to see if they could fully cover their \nhealth insurance needs once they have reached 70 and 80 years of age.\n  What they discovered was that at that age the cost of a health \ninsurance policy was almost prohibitive. The result, back in the early \n1960s, is that over half of the senior citizens in our country had no \nhealth insurance coverage at all. So the Congress passed a Medicare \nprogram, which has been a remarkably successful program.\n  The Medicare program has meant that now 99 percent of America's \nsenior citizens are covered under Medicare. They do not have to live \nwith the fear of not having some basic health care coverage when they \nreach retirement age. When they reach their declining income years, \nMedicare is there.\n  It has been there, and will be there. It has been a remarkably \nsuccessful program.\n  Some say: But there have been financing problems with Medicare. Yes, \nthat is true, and they are all borne of success. By that I mean people \nare living longer and better lives. As a result of that, there have \nbeen some financing issues and some financing difficulties with \nMedicare. We would not have any financing issues at all if we just went \nback to the old life expectancy, but people are living longer, better, \nmore productive lives. The result is that we continue to talk about how \nwe finance Medicare.\n  An example of that: My brother was telling me about a friend of his a \nwhile back who, at age 89, bought a new car. She, at 89 years old, \nbought a new car. He said she financed it with a 5-year loan. I guess \nthat is optimism. But what a wonderful thing, an 89-year-old person \nbuying a new car and getting a 5-year loan.\n  There was a story in the North Dakota papers some long while ago \nabout a man who was 99 years old and still farming. They had a picture \nof this old 99-year-old codger. He was getting on his tractor. And the \narticle talked about his son. His son was in the Army during the Second \nWorld War, and he came back and decided he would work with his dad \nuntil his dad retired. The son was about 74 years old, and his dad was \n99 years old, and still farming. It did not work out the way the son \nthought. The story was about this 99-year-old still driving a tractor.\n  I have often mentioned my uncle who is in his early eighties. I \nbelieve he is 81 or 82 years old now. He discovered in his early \nseventies that he was a runner. He ran faster than most people his age. \nHe started entering the Senior Olympics. My uncle runs the 400 and the \n800 meter. He now has 43 gold medals. He has been running in California \nand Arizona and Minnesota. My aunt thinks he is about half goofy for an \n80-year-old.\n  What a wonderful thing: An 89-year-old buying a car; a 99-year-old \nstill farming; an 81-year-old running in the 400 and the 800 races in \nthe Senior Olympics. People are living longer. That is a good thing.\n  However, Medicare, as it was developed in the 1960s, is basically for \nacute care or hospital care. If you get sick, you go to a hospital, and \nthey help you. The medical model has changed dramatically since then \nand so must Medicare. That is what brings us to the Senate floor. We \nrecognize that the prescription drugs now available that keep people \nout of the hospital, that allow them to control some of their health \nconditions and continue to lead productive lives, were not available in \nthe early 1960s when Medicare was developed.\n  We come to the floor with a proposal that says: Over 30 years has \nelapsed since the writing of the Medicare program. It is now time to \nput a prescription drug benefit in the program.\n  Let me describe what that means in my State. We have 103,000 people \nwho are on Medicare in the State of North Dakota. North Dakota is a \nrelatively small State in terms of its population. It is large \ngeographically, 10 times the size of Massachusetts in land mass, but it \nhas only 645,000 people. We have 103,000 on Medicare. The people who \nare on the Medicare program paid payroll taxes all of their working \nlives, beginning back in the mid 1960s, and that money is what provides \nthe capability of their being able to access the Medicare program.\n  Senior citizens, although they are 12 percent of America's \npopulation, consume one-third of all the prescription drugs in this \ncountry. It is probably pretty obvious to anyone who has been\n\n[[Page S7958]]\n\naround senior citizens that they often take multiple prescription \ndrugs. It is not unusual to talk to a senior citizen who takes 5 and in \nsome cases 10, 12, or more different prescription drugs every day. The \nfact is, many of them simply cannot afford to pay for these drugs. Many \nof them do not have prescription drug coverage through any kind of \ninsurance plan. Because of that need, because so many of them can't \nafford their medicines, we propose giving Medicare beneficiaries a \nprescription drug benefit.\n  A woman came up to me at the end of a town meeting in northern North \nDakota one day. She was perhaps in her late 70s or early 80s. She \ngrabbed me by the elbow and said: Mr. Senator, I want to talk to you a \nmoment. My doctor tells me that I must take a range of prescription \ndrugs to control diabetes and heart trouble. The problem is, I can't \nafford to take them and can't afford to buy them. Can you help me?\n  As she began talking about it, her eyes welled up with tears. This \nwoman, perhaps 80 years old, was stranded. The doctor said: You have \nserious health problems, diabetes, heart trouble, and more. Here is \nwhat you have to take. These prescription drugs will control your \nhealth issues.\n  She said: I don't have the money.\n  A widow, living on a small Social Security payment, she does not have \nthe capability of going in to a pharmacy and paying the very high cost \nfor prescription drugs.\n  Let me say there are some things that have happened we should \nmention. I know the pharmaceutical industry sometimes takes a look at \nme and thinks I am always on the floor trying to put downward pressure \non prescription drug prices. That is true. It is because I believe so \nstrongly that we need to make sure that miracle drugs can provide \nmiracles for those who need them. Miracle drugs cannot provide miracles \nfor those who cannot afford them.\n\n  I want to say this about the industry. First, a number of \npharmaceutical industry companies have stepped up to the plate since we \nlast debated this subject. They offer programs to provide some free \nmedicine to low-income patients and medicine discount cards for \nMedicare beneficiaries who don't have drug coverage. In 2002, we are \ntold, the American pharmaceutical companies provided free medicine to \n5.5 million patients. There are several programs of this type. Pfizer, \nEli Lilly, and many others have these programs.\n  We ought to recognize that is a good thing. We ought to say to them: \nGood job. Frankly, that is a positive step. But these programs are no \nsubstitute for offering a prescription drug benefit to all Medicare \nbeneficiaries. The pharmaceutical companies, although I have \nsignificant disagreements with them about pricing issues, ought to be \ncommended for stepping forward and providing some approaches to help \nthose very low-income seniors who have no recourse, no other \nalternatives. They have helped 5.5 million patients in the United \nStates. But that is not a substitute for offering this legislation to \nput a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare program.\n  We are going to offer some amendments to the bill before us. I will \noffer an amendment or two. Some of my colleagues will offer amendments \nin the coming week and a half with the expectation that by the end of \nnext week the Senate will finish its work on this bill. We will have \npassed legislation that for the first time since the early 1960s, when \nMedicare was created, will substantially improve the capability of \nMedicare to maintain the good health of senior citizens by adding a \nprescription drug benefit.\n  There are some weaknesses in the legislation that came out of the \nFinance Committee. My hope is we can address them and improve them. The \nlegislation that came out of committee has a coverage gap that is \npretty difficult. We need to fix that. There are periods where, even \nthough beneficiaries will be paying premiums, their purchases of \nprescription drugs will not be covered. Those periods are, of course, \nfirst with the deductible. For the first $275 in drug expenses there \nwould be no coverage. And then in addition, when seniors reach $4,500 \nin drug spending, their prescription drug coverage stops. Then \ncatastrophic coverage will kick in when their drug spending reaches \n$5,800. During that $1,300 stretch between $4,500 and $5,800 in \nexpenses, there will be no coverage at all. So senior citizens will be \npaying premiums during those months but have no coverage for the \nprescription drugs they are purchasing. That coverage gap needs to be \nfixed.\n  The legislation has no defined benefit or premium. We need to fix \nthat if we can. We don't know what kind of charges would be set by the \ninsurance companies, what the actual premium would be, exactly how \nwould they define the benefits, and would they change or differ from \nregion to region. I am particularly concerned that rural Medicare \nbeneficiaries, those in smaller States, will be charged higher premiums \nthan urban beneficiaries. We need to be very careful about that. I hope \nwe can address some of it in amendments.\n  Reducing drug costs is another issue. Having just complimented the \npharmaceutical industry, let me also say I believe we ought to pass the \ngeneric legislation that will tend to put some downward pressure on \nprescription drug expenditures. I also believe we ought to, as do some \nof my colleagues who have worked with me, have the global market system \nwork for prescription drug consumers. The way the system could work, \nnot just for Medicare but for all prescription drug consumers, is to \nallow those consumers to purchase the identical drug put in the same \nbottle made by the same manufacturing company from Canada, provided \nthat you have a safe chain of custody. In Canada, the same medicines \nthat are available in the United States are sold for a fraction of the \nprice.\n  A pharmacist in Pembina, ND, is prohibited from going to Emerson, \nCanada 5 miles north and buying a prescription drug such as Tamoxifen \nfor a fraction of the price. That pharmacist cannot now bring that \nTamoxifen back and pass the savings along to a woman who has breast \ncancer in Pembina, ND.\n  I frankly think they should be allowed to do that. That is another \nway by which we can put downward pressure on prescription drug prices.\n  Well, those are some of the issues we are going to be dealing with \nthis week.\n  Again, my fervent hope is at the end of this process we will, with a \nbipartisan piece of legislation, get the best of what all have to offer \nin this Chamber. We so often see legislation come to the floor of the \nSenate that has a pretty significant partisan split, and we often end \nup getting the worst of what can be provided rather than the best.\n  I hope in this legislation on the issue of prescription drugs and \nMedicare we all recognize a couple of points. One, it is long past time \nto do this. Were we to create the Medicare Program today, there is no \nquestion but that it would have a prescription drug benefit in it. Most \nof the lifesaving prescription drugs have become available since \nMedicare was originally written. That is No. 1. I think we are at that \npoint where virtually everybody in this Chamber understands we ought to \ndo this, and we ought to do it now.\n  The second and most important issue is we ought to do it right. There \nis a right way and a wrong way to do this.\n  First of all, the benefit ought to be reasonably simple, \nunderstandable, affordable, and provide significant benefits to the \nsenior citizens of the country who need prescription drugs. That means \nsimplifying this bill, trying to solve the coverage gap, and trying to \nput some downward pressure on prices.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Vermont 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it is not hyperbole to start by saying \nthat we are engaging in a truly historic Medicare debate--one that has \nthe potential to rival the 1965 creation of the Medicare Program. Over \nthe next 2 weeks, we will have the opportunity to consider and enact \nthe most significant Medicare modernization in 37 years. We have the \nchance to do more for the health care and well-being of our Nation's \nelderly than has been accomplished through any recent Medicare \nlegislation.\n  I commend Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus for their work in \nbringing this measure to the Senate floor.\n  The Prescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act is a landmark \nimprovement to the Medicare Program\n\n[[Page S7959]]\n\nand our colleagues deserve a great deal of credit for reaching this \nbipartisan agreement--I would say tripartisan.\n  This is a large and complex bill--measuring over 600 pages. It is not \nat all unusual for a proposal of that size to have issues remaining and \nI know there are some of our colleagues for whom these issues need to \nbe debated and addressed. So we should not be Pollyanna about the \noutcome. Work remains to be done.\n  But I have been listening to our colleagues as they have come to the \nfloor to discuss this bill and I am encouraged by the largely positive \ntone of their remarks. I am encouraged because this year I sense a \ncautious optimism among our colleagues that this Congress--this year--\nwe will be successful.\n  As our colleagues know, I have been working on various efforts to \nmodernize Medicare and to provide a prescription drug relief for our \nelders for many years. Most recently, I had the pleasure and honor to \nwork with several of our colleagues on what came to be known as the \ntripartisan bill. I joined with Senator Grassley, Senator Breaux, \nSenator Snowe, and Senator Hatch in a 2-year effort at drafting a \ncompromise measure that we felt could gain a majority of votes in the \nSenate.\n  It was a true pleasure working with my friends in the tripartisan \ngroup and although we were not ultimately successful last year, I am \nconvinced that much of our effort then has contributed to the bill we \nare debating now. So it is with a great deal of satisfaction that I am \nhere to speak in favor of S. 1, the Grassley-Baucus, Prescription Drug \nand Medicare Improvement Act of 2003.\n  S. 1 provides for a comprehensive, universal and affordable \nprescription drug benefit under Medicare. It also pioneers new \narrangements with private sector-based health plans that promise to \nintegrate traditional medical care with innovations in the areas of \ndisease prevention and chronic disease management.\n  The drug benefit, in particular though, meets four principles that \nhave guided me throughout this effort. First, this program provides a \nuniversal benefit; it is available to all Medicare beneficiaries. While \nI believe it is critical to provide a benefit to the poor and those \nwith catastrophic costs, all seniors, regardless of income, will \nbenefit from this plan.\n  Second, this program is comprehensive. Beneficiaries will have access \nto the best medicines, and will not be limited to only the cheapest \nones for the sake of saving money.\n  Third, this Medicare drug benefit is affordable--for both \nbeneficiaries and the Government.\n  Finally, for a drug benefit to be truly successful it must be \nsustainable. It will do little good to repeat the catastrophic failure \nof years past by beginning a program that we cannot carry on.\n  This program, which combines seniors' contributions with a Government \nguarantee, will have the best chance of enduring into the future.\n  I believe this bill meets these four standards. It is universal, \ncomprehensive, affordable, and sustainable.\n  Could it be improved? Probably. And that is why we will debate and \npossibly amend it this week. But this approach is a good compromise. It \noffers a respectable and responsible plan within the budget limitations \nwe face. It is a good compromise. I support this bill and urge the \nMembers here to support it as well.\n  In closing, I also thank several of our other colleagues who \ncontributed so much to this effort. I think again, that the work of our \ntripartisan group from last year did much to pave the way to today's \nbill--so I thank my colleagues for letting me join with them in seeking \na tripartisan solution.\n  Again, I thank Senators Grassley, my friend of over 28 years. We have \nworked on this issue and many others in the past. I think this will be \none of our proudest achievements.\n  Also, this bill would not have the balance that it does without the \ncontributions of other members including Senators Baucus, Daschle, \nGraham, and Rockefeller of the Finance Committee and of Senator \nKennedy's efforts to bridge the divides where they existed.\n  As I close for today, I would like to mention that the measure we are \ndebating this week contains many more significant provisions than just \nthose related to prescription drugs. So I will look forward to \nreturning to the Senate floor at a later time to discuss those \nprovisions with our colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I yield the remaining time we have to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized for 12 \nminutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Louisiana, who \nI know has spent years focusing on the issue of health care and \nMedicare prescription drug coverage.\n  First, while I present an opposing view in terms of some of what is \ndiscussed here, I share the commitment and desire of all of us to do \nwhat is right in terms of the seniors and those with disabilities who \nare on Medicare who have waited for too long for us to come together \nand act as a body, along with the President.\n  I will start by commending my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nwho have been diligently working through a number of issues and a \nnumber of obstacles to come up with an approach they believe is the \nbest approach or the most doable approach right now before the \nCongress. Certainly, Senator Grassley, Senator Baucus, Senator Breaux, \nSenator Jeffords, who just spoke, Senator Snowe, and many others have \nbeen involved in these discussions.\n  As one who has spent a tremendous amount of time myself focusing on \nMedicare and the need for updating and strengthening Medicare to cover \nprescription drugs, I commend them for their desire and concern and \nhard work in coming to this point. I do not believe we are doing all we \ncan do and should do as a country or as a Congress for our seniors \nunder Medicare.\n  I do believe Medicare has been a great American success story since \n1965. I agree that it needs to be modernized, and not just prescription \ndrugs but I agree with the Secretary of Health and Human Services who \nfocuses on prevention. I commend him for his efforts and agree with him \nthat we need to modernize Medicare to focus more on prevention and \nother options that can streamline the system and make it more \nefficient.\n  I do not believe, however, that we save dollars or create a more \nefficient system by turning over prescription drug coverage to private \ninsurance companies. At the appropriate point, I will be offering an \namendment that will give true choice to seniors by allowing them to \nchoose a private sector option but to also be able to remain in \ntraditional Medicare and get the help they need if that is their \nchoice. If we are truly talking about choice, I believe the choice \nshould be with the senior.\n  This really is a question of whom we are designing the system for, \nwhether we are designing it for the insurance companies, for the \npharmaceutical companies, or for the people who are covered under this \nsystem. I am concerned that we can do a better job for our seniors if, \nin fact, we offer them a true range of choices.\n  I find it interesting at a time when I am back home in Michigan \ntalking to the big three automakers or small businesses or others who \nare struggling with insurance premiums in the private sector, the \npremiums are skyrocketing. The average small business has seen its \nhealth insurance premiums double in the last 5 years. The automakers \nand other manufacturers in my State have seen their premiums go up 20 \nto 30 percent a year, forcing them to freeze pay increases for \nemployees, asking them to pay a larger share of the cost, cutting \nsalaries or, in some cases, people losing their jobs because their \nbusiness cannot afford to maintain the skyrocketing premium increases \nin the private sector.\n  Given that fact, I find it ironic that we are suggesting we would \nsave dollars by going to a private for-profit insurance model where, in \nfact, the premiums have been rising two or three times faster than \nthose under Medicare; that when we look at the administrative cost \ndifference, it is less under Medicare. When we look at the current \nchoices we have between Medicare+Choice, which is Medicare HMOs, or \ntraditional Medicare, we hear that studies have shown that to provide \nthe same service through the\n\n[[Page S7960]]\n\nHMO, on average, costs 13.2 percent more than if it were provided \nthrough traditional Medicare.\n  So I question, as we have precious few dollars to work with to be \nable to provide the services and the care for which our seniors are \nasking, the wisdom of moving to a model that is rising in cost faster \nthan Medicare. I have not seen evidence where, in fact, it will provide \nthe kind of competition to lower the prices, which we are all looking \nfor from the private sector at this time. In fact, what I am hearing \nfrom the business community is they want us to partner more with them, \nthe public sector and the private sector. Because we now have our \nglobal economy and businesses competing around the world and because we \nare the only employer-based health insurance system among the \nindustrialized countries, they find themselves at a competitive \ndisadvantage and are asking to partner with the private sector to both \ncontain costs and be able to help them compete and continue to be able \nto provide insurance coverage.\n\n  So in light of all of these discussions that are going on, we look at \nMedicare, which is the one piece of a health system that Congress in \nits wisdom back in 1965, along with the President, said we are going to \nmake sure is available, universal, once one is 65 or if they are \ndisabled, regardless of where they live; if they are in the Upper \nPeninsula of Michigan, Detroit, or in Benton Harbor, they know they \nwill be able to have insurance coverage, be able to choose their own \ndoctor, be able to get the care they need. They know what it costs. \nThey can count on it. That is the miracle. That is the reason so many \nseniors overwhelmingly choose traditional Medicare rather than other \nprivate sector options.\n  So we come to the difficult choice now of how to provide prescription \ndrug coverage, and there is a difference of view certainly about \nwhether we should strengthen traditional Medicare or provide \nincentives, encouragement, a carrot stick--whatever one wishes to call \nit--for those to go into managed care. I commend my colleagues for \nattempting to find that balance in the middle. I believe the balance \nreally is not struck unless we make sure that traditional Medicare is \npart of that choice.\n  I also am very concerned that we hear constantly that, in fact, we \nhave a situation where we can only afford to go a part of the way. It \nis my understanding, when all is said and done, we are talking about \nproviding most seniors--certainly middle-income seniors--with 20 or 25 \npercent to help with their drug bill over time. I do commend the \nstructure for low-income seniors, but overall we know we are not \nproviding a comprehensive prescription drug benefit with the dollars \ninvolved. It is half of what it would take to provide the same coverage \nwe have as Senators through Blue Cross and Blue Shield under the \nFederal employee health system. So we certainly are not providing what \nwe, other Federal employees, receive for a comprehensive benefit.\n  I have often heard, well, we cannot afford to do that. I feel it \nnecessary to indicate for the record one more time why it is we are \ntalking about a system that is not comprehensive, will end for several \nmonths of the year for seniors, will not provide them what they need, \nand is complicated and convoluted, I believe, and that is because of \nanother set of policies that were debated in this Congress not long \nago, coupled with what happened in 2001, and that is the question of \nmaking a determination, a value judgment, that it is a bigger priority \nto provide tax cuts for the wealthiest, the privileged few of our \ncountry, rather than helping the many of our seniors and the disabled \nto be able to put money in their pockets through prescription drug \ncoverage.\n  It is astounding to look at what that decision has done. We are told \nthat the 2001 tax cuts made permanent and the other proposals passed \nover the next 75 years will, in fact, cost $14.2 trillion, where the \nprojected Medicare and Social Security deficit combined--not just \nMedicare but Medicare and Social Security deficit--is $10 trillion.\n  This has been a conscious choice to make a decision to spend dollars \nin one way to help a few people in our country rather than to keep the \ncommitment of Social Security and Medicare that we have had for many \ndecades in our country. The fact that we are talking about an \ninadequate benefit that ends, that leaves coverage gaps of 3 or 4 \nmonths a year for our seniors, the fact that we are talking about an \napproach that does not do what they have asked us to do, is because of \ndecisions made to take revenue and instead of investing it in health \ncare for older Americans, instead of investing it in strengthening \nSocial Security for the next generation, the decision was made to \neliminate that revenue.\n  By the way, that decision has resulted this year in the highest \nsingle-year deficit in the history of our country. Unfortunately, a \nhole has been dug. I fear it will continue to be dug deeper and deeper \nwith the decisions that will be made.\n  It is not too late to decide in this debate we will do it right--real \nchoice, a real benefit--that we make decisions that are best for the \nmajority of the people we represent. They are counting on us to do this \nright.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/17/senate-section/article/S7960-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is clear from this unanimous consent \nrequest that we are waiting for CBO scoring on the Medicare bill.

I say to the Senator, my understanding is the same as \nhis, but I am not in any position to make a commitment.\n  Mr. REID. I would advise Members I don't think they can expect at 6 \no'clock to start offering amendments. I don't think the bill will be \nready at that time.

I ask unanimous consent that following his statement the \nranking member of the Budget Committee, Senator Conrad, be recognized \nto speak on this legislation now before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, we are debating the substance of the bill \nthat came from the Finance Committee with respect to a prescription \ndrug benefit for Medicare. We all recognize that providing a \nprescription drug benefit for Medicare is long overdue, something that \nhas been needed badly for a long period of time. I am heartened by the \nbipartisan nature of the vote that came out of the Finance Committee.\n  I am reminded of an occasion when I first came to the Senate and we \nbegan debating health care. I fell in step with the then-chairman of \nthe Finance Committee, Senator Moynihan from New York. Senator Moynihan \nis one whom I met when I was first serving in the Nixon administration \nand he was serving as the domestic counselor to President Nixon. I felt \nclose to him from then on.\n  As we walked through the door into the Chamber, I said to him: Pat, \ndo you think we are finally going to get some health care reform this \nyear?\n\n[[Page S7961]]\n\n  And he said: Yes, I do. In the Nixon administration the President \nwanted it and the Democrats in the Congress said no. Later on--I \nbelieve he referred to the Carter administration--the President wanted \nit and Republicans in the Congress said no.\n  He said: This time, the President wants it and the Congress wants it \nand I think we are going to get it done.\n  He turned out not to have been right in that instance, perhaps one of \nthe few times in his life when his reading of the political tea leaves \nwas incorrect because we fell into wrangling. It was on some issues \nthat were worth wrangling over, I do not want to suggest they were not, \nbut that prevented us from focusing on the core question of whether our \nhealth care circumstance in this country needed to be improved.\n  Fortunately, we have now focused on the overall question of should we \nor should we not have a prescription drug benefit for Medicare. At \nleast coming out of the committee, we have a strong bipartisan \nconsensus that we should. The reason we should is very clear, if you \nlook at the way we practice medicine.\n  Medicare was adopted in the 1960s, and it was patterned after the \nbest Blue Cross-Blue Shield fee-for-service indemnity plan written in \nthe 1960s. Now it seems that plan has been frozen in time for 40 years. \nUnfortunately, it has not had the regulatory flexibility necessary to \ndeal with the changes in the way medicine is practiced. It has required \nCongress to step in and make those changes. As Congress has done so, \nCongress has demonstrated that it is slow and it can be bogged down in \npolitical challenges that prevent changes being made.\n  By contrast, if you go to FEHBP, the Federal Employees Health Benefit \nPlan, under which we and other Federal employees are covered, you find \na degree of regulatory flexibility that allows the people who \nadminister the plan the capacity to move and change quickly as the \nmedical situation changes. Congress is not required to debate these \nchanges and, therefore, hang them up on political considerations. That \nis one of the reasons why the FEHBP has been more effective in \nproviding health care services to those who are parties to it. Clearly, \nwe in Congress need to finally catch up to the reality that the \nMedicare system is outmoded and structured upon a program that \ndesperately needs to be updated.\n  Back in the 1960s, the primary concern people had with their health \ncare was the cost of going to the hospital. You went to the hospital \nfor almost every major circumstance. Now we find through research \nfunded by Government, through research funded by the drug companies, \nand products that have emerged from that research, that many of the \nsicknesses you used to go to the hospital for and stayed for 3 or 4 \ndays can be taken care of by taking a pill. Yet Medicare says if you go \nto the hospital and run up a bill of however many tens of thousands of \ndollars to stay that many days, we will pay for it. But if you take the \npill that makes the hospital visit unnecessary, we will not. That \nclearly doesn't make sense. There is the need for the benefit of \nprescription drugs, and the Medicare system needs to catch up to that \ncircumstance.\n  The bill that emerged from the Finance Committee encourages \ncompetition between plans. It provides us a first glimpse of breaking \nthe lockstep mentality Medicare has had since the 1960s. It gives us an \nopportunity to experiment with some competition injected into the \nsystem. One of the interesting aspects coming out of this debate is the \ndifference in expectations on the part of those who are supporting it. \nThere are those on the left who are supporting this, saying this is \njust the beginning, and if we get this established, we can see a \nmassive increase of governmental programs to bring prescription drugs \nto seniors. There are those on the right who are supporting it who are \nsaying this has the degree of competition in it that will bring market \nforces into Medicare in such a way that we will see a massive increase \nin the amount of competition and the amount of market influence on \nholding down costs.\n  For both sides, this is a great leap of faith. Neither one knows \nwhether the other is right. Neither one knows exactly what will happen. \nI suppose 5 years from now when the Congress gathers we can look back \nand say, Yes, we were right injecting a sense of competition into the \nbill. It has produced tremendous benefits, brought costs down, and made \nthings more efficient. Or we might see people look at us saying, Yes, \nwe were right passing the bill. It did bring about a major new \nexpansion of Federal support for prescription drugs. We will have to \nwait and see.\n\n  But the necessity of getting a drug benefit for Medicare is driving \nthe leap of faith on both sides. It is bringing us together in a way we \nhaven't seen in this debate in the past.\n  Obviously, I am one who believes competition creates market \nefficiencies, and that the experiment will work in the direction of \ngetting more competition and more efficiency rather than in the \ndirection of getting more government involved. It is a leap of faith \nfor me.\n  I share the concern of what can happen to the cost. We know Federal \nprograms never cost what they are projected to cost. They always cost \nsubstantially more, particularly entitlement programs. For me and \nothers who hold that view to embrace this bill and say we are willing \nto take this leap of faith is indeed, I think, a fairly significant \nstep.\n  But I come back to the point I made at the beginning. We cannot \ncontinue to sustain a Medicare Program that does not recognize the role \nprescription drugs now play in the way medicine is practiced. Even \nthough it is a huge risk to move in the direction this bill represents, \nit is not as great a risk as allowing the status quo to remain and \nproceed any further. Medicare needs to be brought up to date. This is \nby no means the amount of bringing up to date I would support or that I \nhave called for here on the floor. But it is a final recognition of the \nfact that Medicare is outdated, that changes need to be made, and for \nthat reason I will take the step.\n  I commend members of the Finance Committee on both sides of the aisle \nfor the careful and thoughtful way they have approached this challenge. \nI commend them for crafting a bill that, as I say, holds out some hope \nfor everybody in the spectrum. But I hope they will continue to address \nthis question with as open a mind as possible and with the firm \nunderstanding that however sacred the word Medicare is in our political \nlexicon, the details of the program should not be sacred but should be \nbrought up to date at every possible opportunity to conform with the \nreality of the world in which we live.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the prescription drug \nbill and the Medicare reform package that is before us now. As a member \nof the Finance Committee, I was involved in the markup of this \nlegislation.\n  Let me begin by commending the chairman, Senator Grassley, and the \nranking member, Senator Baucus, our former chairman, for the way in \nwhich they brought our committee together. That was not easy to do. It \nis an extraordinarily complex undertaking to have an expansion of \nMedicare of this magnitude and to do it in a way that will achieve real \nresults.\n  I thank the chairman and the ranking member for the way they brought \nus together, and for the tone they set in the committee. We were in \nmarkup from 9 in the morning until 9 o'clock at night--12 hours of \ntogetherness that actually went very well.\n  I think we all know why we are here. When Medicare was first drafted, \nthe world was a very different place in terms of providing health care. \nAs Senator Moynihan used to explain, at the time Medicare was drafted, \nthe Merck Manual that contains all prescription drugs was a very thin \nvolume. Now when we look at the Merck Manual, it is a very weighty \ntome. There is a dramatic change in the pattern and practice of \nmedicine. Perhaps no better example is what happens with stomach \nillness. Twenty years ago, there was not much one could do for somebody \nwho suffered from ulcers other than to have surgery. But now with \nprescription drugs that address the underlying causes, stomach surgery \nhas been reduced by two-thirds. Yet, in Medicare there is no coverage \nfor those prescription drugs. You can't have a modern Medicare without \na prescription drug component.\n\n[[Page S7962]]\n\n  The problem is millions of Americans don't have any coverage. If we \nlook at an outline of where we are, we see that 38 percent of those who \nare Medicare eligible have no drug coverage. Ten percent get their \ncoverage through Medicaid, 15 percent through a Medicare HMO, 28 \npercent employer-sponsored coverage, 7 percent Medigap, and others, 2 \npercent. But nearly 40 percent have no coverage.\n  That creates some very tough situations. And we can see there are \nreal differences between where somebody lives, how old they are, and \ntheir income level, as to whether they are in that nearly 40 percent of \nAmericans who have no coverage. We see for those over the age of 85, 45 \npercent have no coverage. For those who live in rural areas--and I \nrepresent a rural area, the State of North Dakota--50 percent have no \ncoverage. Forty-four percent of those who have between $10,000 and \n$20,000 of income have no coverage.\n  What we see is the situation is going to become more challenging and \nmore difficult as out-of-pocket expenses for prescription drug \nexpenditures jump dramatically. In 2000, those out-of-pocket \nexpenditures averaged $644. By this year, it was up to $999--a 50-\npercent increase in just 3 years. And in the next 3 years, we \nanticipate another very large increase to $1,454 a year in prescription \ndrug costs.\n  The implications of that are outlined on this chart. This shows a \nstudy in eight States. It shows the percentage of seniors who reported \nforgoing needed medicines, and that is listed by chronic condition and \nprescription drug coverage.\n  What it shows by the red bar is those without coverage, and it shows \nthe percentage of seniors who did not fill prescriptions one or more \ntimes due to cost. For congestive heart failure, 25 percent of the \npeople did not fill their prescriptions because they could not afford \nit; 31 percent of those who suffered from diabetes did not fill their \nprescriptions because they could not afford it; and 28 percent of those \nwith hypertension did not fill their prescriptions because they could \nnot afford it.\n  If we go to the next element of the chart, the percentage of seniors \nwho skipped doses in order to make it last longer: For congestive heart \nfailure, 33 percent of those without coverage skipped doses; 30 percent \nof those with diabetes skipped doses because they could not afford it; \nand 31 percent of those with hypertension skipped doses because they \ncould not afford it. Obviously, that reduces the quality of care and \nultimately increases the cost. Why? Because those people are more \nlikely to be hospitalized. And it is when a senior is hospitalized that \nthe cost really escalates.\n  I think it is in all our interest--both in terms of the quality of \nhealth care but also in terms of the cost of health care--that we get \nthis right and we make the changes necessary to provide a prescription \ndrug benefit in Medicare.\n  Here, outlined on this chart, are the specific provisions of this \nlegislation. These are estimates of the basic plan which will take \neffect in 2006. This excludes the low-income subsidies. We will talk \nabout that in a moment. The premium will average about $35 a month; at \nleast that is the projection at this point. The deductibles will be \n$275 a year. From $276 to $4,500 of prescription drug costs a year, 50 \npercent will be paid by Medicare, 50 percent by the senior citizen. \nBetween $4,501 and $5,812 of prescription drug costs a year, there will \nbe no assistance from Medicare. That is the so-called coverage gap, \nwhat some refer to as the ``doughnut.'' This is an area in which there \nis no assistance, no coverage. The reason for that is not enough money. \nFor $5,813 and above in prescription drug costs, Medicare will provide \n90 percent assistance, the senior citizen 10 percent.\n  I think that is one of the most important parts of this bill. I would \nsupport this bill if there were no other provision than just this one. \nTo provide 90 percent assistance to those who have catastrophic drug \ncosts is going to make a meaningful difference.\n\n  I was just with one of my staff members in North Dakota. Her mother \nhad a rare form of cancer. At one point her drug costs were running \n$20,000 a month--$20,000 a month. Thankfully, she was insured. As we \nsee, nearly 40 percent of seniors in the country are not. How many \nfamilies could withstand a drug cost of $20,000 a month? For this \nparticular family, their drug cost now has been reduced. She is past \nthe acute phase, thankfully. Their drug costs are still running $2,500 \na month. That is $30,000 a year.\n  This provision will help people like that. It will keep people from \nbankruptcy. It will avoid people having to not have treatment. It will \nprevent crises in many families across the country.\n  That is not the only part that I think merits support.\n  As shown on this chart, these are the low-income provisions. I want \nto direct people's attention to this line. For those who are below 160 \npercent of poverty, they will get more assistance. So, for example, in \nthat zero to $4,500 range of prescription drug costs, Medicare will \npick up 90 percent of the cost for those low-income people. They will \nhave to provide 10 percent of the cost. This, to me, is another strong \nreason to support this legislation.\n  A third key element of this bill that I think merits support--\ncertainly for those who have rural areas--is the beginning of the \nleveling of the playing field between the rural areas and the more \nurban areas of the country.\n  Just to give an example, in my home State, Mercy Hospital in Devils \nLake, ND, gets exactly one-half as much in Medicare reimbursement to \ntreat a heart ailment or to treat diabetes as Mercy Hospital in New \nYork City--exactly one-half as much. Now, I would be the first to \nacknowledge there is somewhat of a difference in cost, but it isn't a \n100-percent difference. When we go to buy technology for that hospital \nin Devils Lake, ND, we do not get a discount. When we try to recruit a \ndoctor, he does not say to us: Well, you are a rural area, so I will \ntake half as much money. That is not the way it works.\n  So this incredible divergence, this disparity that exists in current \nlaw, needs to be addressed, and this bill will begin to address it. It \ndoes not close the gap, it does not eliminate the problem, but it does \nmake meaningful progress. It permanently and fully closes the gap \nbetween urban and rural standardized payment levels. But unlike the \nlegislation I introduced, it does not take effect until 2005. The \nlegislation I introduced, along with 30 of my colleagues, would have \ntaken effect in 2004.\n  It also adopts all of the other provisions of the bill that I \nintroduced along with Senator Thomas of Wyoming. It equalizes Medicare \ndisproportionate share payments. Those are the ones that are used to \ncover the costs of treating the uninsured. It establishes a low-volume \nadjustment payment for small rural hospitals. It improves the wage \nindex calculation which accounts for a hospital's labor costs. It \nensures that rural hospitals are reimbursed fairly for outpatient \nservices.\n  It provides a whole series of improvements to critical access \nhospitals, including improved payments for ambulance services, \nincreased flexibility in the bed limit, excluding critical access \nhospitals from the wage index calculation for other hospitals, which \nwill improve payments to other larger facilities, has new incentives to \nensure 24-hour access to emergency on-call providers, and has new \nmeasures to assure the critical access hospitals will receive timely \nMedicare reimbursement. It also authorizes a capital infrastructure \nloan program which will provide $5 million in loans for crumbling rural \nfacilities.\n  In addition, it provides a series of other provisions which a number \nof us have cosponsored and put before the body, including extending a \n10-percent add-on payment for rural home health agencies, many of which \nare under pressure to close; a new 5-percent increase for rural ground \nambulance services; a new 5-percent add-on for clinic and ER visits in \nrural hospitals; and a new automatic 10-percent bonus payment for \nphysicians serving in rural areas.\n  It has measures to address the geographic inequities in physician \nreimbursement, and an extension of improved payment for lab services in \nsole community hospitals.\n  This does not close the gap between rural institutions and more urban \ninstitutions, but it does make meaningful progress in leveling the \nplaying field, and that is critically important to rural hospitals.\n  Let me say, in my own State we have 44 hospitals.\n\n[[Page S7963]]\n\n  At least eight of them are in danger of closing because of this \nenormous gap in Medicare reimbursement. Over 50 percent of their \npatients are Medicare eligible. If things don't change, these \ninstitutions are going to have to close.\n  Those are positive aspects of the bill. Let me speak for a moment \nabout what is in the bill that could and should be improved. The first \nthat comes to my mind is the instability in the legislation. Seniors \nwant certainty. They want to know what they are getting. But under this \nplan, seniors could be bounced back and forth between different plans \ndepending on how many private drug-only plans enter an area. That is \nthe first problem. If a senior is in a fallback plan and two private \nplans enter the area, they must leave the plan they are in; they have \nno choice in the matter. The second problem is that every time they \nswitch between drug-only and fallback plans, their benefits could \nchange.\n  Let me illustrate that for my colleagues. Seniors, when forced to \nmove between plans--and in 4 years, a senior could be forced into four \ndifferent plans--every time, their premiums could change. The only \nthing that wouldn't change is the stop loss amount, or at least \ncouldn't change. The deductibles could change. The coinsurance level \ncould change. The coverage gap could change. The covered drugs could \nchange. And the access to a local pharmacy at no extra charge could \nchange. That is the kind of instability about which I am talking.\n  Let me illustrate with this chart. I hope my colleagues are \nlistening, or at least for those who are busy with other duties, \nperhaps their staffs are listening. It is very important to understand \nwhat could happen to a senior. In 2005, if there is only one private \nplan offered in their area, they could enroll either in that plan or in \nthe fallback plan. Let's say this particular senior takes the fallback \nplan and enrolls in that for 2006. But then the next year, another \nprivate plan comes into the area. Then the senior would be compelled to \ndrop out of the fallback plan even if they liked it and go into one of \nthe private plans.\n  Say they take private plan A for 2007. Then private plan A finds it \nis not effective for them financially to be in the plan, and they drop \nout. The next year, our senior citizen could be whipsawed into a third \nplan in 3 years. They could be over in private plan B. Then perhaps \nprivate plan B decides they can't afford to provide this coverage. They \ndrop out, and our senior citizen, in the fourth year, is in their \nfourth plan. As I say, with different formularies--that is, different \ndrugs--available to them, with different rules with respect to going to \nthe local pharmacy to get their drugs, with different copays, with \ndifferent premiums, with different deductibles, all of these changing--\nif that isn't chaos, I don't know what is. This is an area we must \naddress on the floor with amendments in order to remove some of this \nuncertainty for seniors moving ahead.\n  For those of us who represent rural areas, the fact that only 2 \npercent of rural counties had two or more Medicare+Choice plans in \nAugust 2001 ought to tell us that our people are the most likely to be \ncaught up in this whipsaw effect. Our people in rural areas are the \nmost likely not to have two private drug-only plans available to them, \nor PPO plans or HMO plans. The reality is, they are not there now. In \nmy State, there is virtually no coverage from those kinds of entities, \nalmost none. Those who are suggesting that people are going to rush to \nthis kind of business when the people who run the companies tell us \nvery directly they are not going to--we ought to pay attention to that. \nWe ought to listen to that. We ought to respond to it. I don't think it \nis going to do any of us any good to create a circumstance in which a \nsenior we represent gets whipsawed back and forth between plans, \nchanging premiums, changing deductibles, changing coinsurance, changing \nwhat drugs are covered and what are not.\n\n  There is one thing I have learned in dealing with seniors, especially \nthose who are ill: They need simplicity. They need an assurance of what \nis covered, what isn't covered, and how it works. We should not be \nsubjecting them to a changed plan every single year. That is not a plan \nthat meets the needs of seniors.\n  I urge my colleagues to pay close attention to the debate when we \nbegin to offer amendments to try to provide some greater certainty and \nstability to the plan.\n  I also am concerned about disappointed expectations. As I travel my \nState, when there is a discussion of prescription drug coverage, I find \nmost people think that means they are going to get something similar to \nwhat Federal employees receive, or they think they are going to get \nsomething similar to what people in the military receive, or they think \nthey are going to get something similar to what big companies provide. \nThat is not this plan. Let's understand what this plan is and what it \nis not.\n  To provide the same coverage that we provide Federal employees would \nnot cost the $400 billion in this plan. It would cost $800 billion. It \nwould cost $800 billion in comparison to the $400 billion in this plan \nto provide the prescription drug benefit we provide Federal employees.\n  To provide the same level of benefit to our Nation's seniors that we \nprovide our members in the military would cost $1.2 trillion, three \ntimes as much as available in this plan.\n  It is critically important that we not overpromise, that we not \nmislead people as to what they are getting and not getting. The fact \nis, there are some who I have heard say this is a 70 percent subsidy. I \ndon't know where they get that number. That is exactly the kind of \nlanguage and rhetoric that is going to lead to some very disappointed \npeople. There is no 70 percent subsidy here. There may be for people \nwho have extraordinarily high drug costs. I already indicated they get \n90 percent of their bill paid for, over $5,800 in drug costs a year, \nbut that is a very small percentage of the people.\n  It is true that very low income people get a higher percentage paid \nfor by Medicare. But overall, we should understand, of the $1.6 \ntrillion of drug costs for our Nation's seniors, this legislation is \ngoing to cover 23 percent of that, not 70 percent, as I have heard \nstated during the debate. Twenty-three percent will be paid for by \nMedicare.\n  If you look at this $400 billion legislation, $360 billion of the \ncost is for prescription drug payments--$360 billion. The total drug \ncost of our Nation's seniors is $1.6 trillion; $360 billion of $1.6 \ntrillion is 23 percent, it is not 70 percent. So let's not be \nmisleading people about how extensive this benefit is.\n  That is not to say it is not a good bill because we are limited to \n$400 billion. This is about as good a bill as you can write for $400 \nbillion. But I hope we don't mislead anyone as to what it really \nprovides.\n  One of the things we also need to think carefully about as we \nconsider floor amendments is that 37 percent of retirees with employer \ndrug coverage will lose it under the Finance Committee plan.\n  Why? Because the Congressional Budget Office says when employers look \nat this plan, some substantial number of them will drop their old \ncoverage--the coverage they are providing. That will affect 37 percent \nof retirees who currently have employer drug coverage.\n  I think we need to take additional steps to provide incentives to \nthose employers to keep on providing the drug coverage they provide. \nThat is in our economic and financial interests, and it is in the \ninterests of seniors to maintain stability in plans that they know and \nlike.\n  Mr. President, I hope this information is useful to our colleagues. \nAs I say, as a member of the Finance Committee and as ranking member of \nthe Budget Committee, I support this legislation. I voted for it. I \nthink it merits the support of our colleagues. I hope it can pass with \nresounding support here in the Chamber. I hope it will ultimately \nbecome law. We ought to do this with our eyes wide open. We ought to \nunderstand exactly what it provides and what its weaknesses are. We \nought to communicate that clearly to the American people. We ought not \nto overpromise or misrepresent. Disappointed expectations can swamp \nthis boat.\n  I am hopeful these remarks made clear what is provided and what is \nnot and those places where we have an opportunity to improve this \nlegislation. I think it is in all of our interests to commit our best \nefforts to do that over the coming days. I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S7964]]\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the \ntime of the quorum call be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1, the \nPrescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act of 2003. Last week, the \nFinance Committee took a historical step by passing the Medicare bill \nout of the committee by a strong bipartisan vote of 16 to 5, thanks to \nthe great leadership of Senators Grassley and Baucus.\n  This is one of the most important bills we will consider this \nCongress. As a new member of the Finance Committee, I was proud to \nsupport it. It is a commonsense bill that strengthens and improves the \nMedicare Program by guaranteeing a prescription drug benefit for \nAmerica's seniors. I hope the bipartisanship momentum that was created \nwithin the Finance Committee will continue during the Senate floor \ndebate.\n  Talk is cheap. Congress has been talking about passing a drug bill \nfor years. Now we have a golden opportunity and we must seize it. Our \nseniors have waited too long. It would be irresponsible to leave them \nhanging any longer. Under the budget that we passed, we have set aside \n$400 billion for a Medicare prescription drug benefit. This is a real \ncommitment by Congress to the 40 million Americans who have relied on \nMedicare, many of them literally all their lives.\n  It has been almost four decades since Medicare was created, and it is \nlong past time for Congress to strengthen it and to help bring it into \nthe 21st century.\n  In 1965, when Medicare became law, prescription drug coverage was not \nincluded in the benefit package. Back then, it did not make any sense. \nPrescription drugs played a much smaller role in medical care. But \nbecause of technology and advances in health care, and much research \nthat has been done since then, these drugs now do so much more in \nhelping to ensure the good health of America's seniors. These medicines \nhelp seniors live longer. They help them live more active and \nfulfilling lives.\n  Medicine has changed in a way no one could have predicted back in \n1965. However, Congress has failed so far to strengthen Medicare and to \nrecognize these advances and to account for the changes in health care. \nWe now have a chance to make up for that lost ground.\n  If we are going to maintain a decent Medicare Program for seniors and \nfulfill our promises to them, we owe it to them to do the best we can \nto make sure Medicare fully recognizes their needs and the advances in \nmodern medicine.\n  We have all heard of the amazing advances in prescription drugs, but \nfor many seniors these new lifesaving drugs are unaffordable. Under the \nbill before us today, many more of these drugs will be within reach of \nall seniors. This is a good bill for them, and it is a good bill for \nAmerica.\n  Part of this legislation deserves special mention. First, the bill \ngives seniors a new option when it comes to getting their health care. \nNow under Medicare, most seniors are enrolled in traditional fee-for-\nservice plans. That is understandable. It is what they know and it is \nwhat they are comfortable with. About 12 percent of seniors are \ncurrently enrolled in Medicare+Choice plans. These are managed care \nplans like HMOs.\n  Under this legislation, seniors will have another new option: \nPreferred provider organizations, or PPOs, for their health care. \nOutside of Medicare, many Americans have found PPOs to be a solid \nalternative instead of fee for service or HMOs that some patients find \nto be too restrictive. Wisely, the bill includes incentives to make \nsure that PPOs will cover both rural and urban areas, and all seniors \nin these areas will be eligible to enroll.\n\n  Coming from a small, rural State such as Kentucky this is especially \nimportant to me. In many rural parts of my State, seniors do not have a \nchoice because the economics just do not work. But the chairman of the \nFinance Committee wisely crafted this bill to provide incentives to \nensure that seniors in rural America have choices, too. If it is good \nfor Iowa, I think it is going to be good for Kentucky.\n  This bill does not require seniors to move into a PPO or an HMO for a \nbetter drug benefit. This idea has been part of other plans on Capitol \nHill, and I disagree with it. Instead, under this bill seniors can \nreceive an equal drug benefit under traditional Medicare. We give \nseniors the choice. It is voluntary. I know many seniors, especially \nour older or maybe our oldest seniors, will not want to switch out of \ntraditional fee for service. They should not be forced to do this.\n  My mother-in-law is very happy with what she has, and I am sure she \nwill not change no matter what. That is fine. After promising her she \nwould always get the care she is now receiving, it would be wrong for \nus to pull the rug out from under her or anybody like her.\n  In order to be fair to all, this legislation says the drug benefits \nwill be equal in both traditional Medicare and managed care plans, so \nseniors will not be penalized for staying with traditional Medicare \nPrograms they know and are comfortable with.\n  Another positive about the bill's benefits is the fact that seniors \nwill have more of a choice to find a drug plan that best suits their \nneeds. This is very similar to what Federal employees do when they \nchoose their health care plans. For example, the benefit structure for \nplans can differ slightly and the formularies for the plans will likely \nbe a little different one from another. It is this flexibility and \nchoice for seniors which really helps make this bill a winner.\n  I am also pleased the legislation provides a strong benefit to \nseniors who have the hardest time affording drug coverage, those who \nhave incomes below 160 percent of the poverty level.\n\n  All along I have argued that rich people such as Warren Buffett and \nBill Gates do not need our help. We need to first focus on helping \nseniors who need it most and can afford it least. I am very pleased \nthis bill does just that.\n  At 160 percent of poverty, an individual's annual income is $14,368 \nfor a single person, and for a couple annual income is $19,392. Many \nseniors in this category and certainly those who live on less struggle \nevery day to pay for their medicines. Some have to actually choose \nbetween food and medicine. Some skip taking doses of their medicine. \nThese are choices that no none in the year 2003 should have to make.\n  For the 3 million seniors who make even less, the bill provides them \nwith an even more generous benefit. These are our seniors for whom \nCongress has the largest responsibility. This bill certainly does right \nby them.\n  Finally, I am pleased the legislation provides immediate help right \nnow to many low-income seniors. In the year 2004 they will receive $600 \na year so they can better afford their prescriptions. This is an \nimmediate benefit for those who need help the most and will help bridge \nthe gap until 2006 when this new drug program is fully up and running.\n  Congress has a golden opportunity to pass a good prescription drug \nbill. We absolutely cannot let it slip through our fingers. Too many \nseniors struggle daily to pay for their prescriptions. In the past, \nPresidents and Congresses have promised too much, too many times, for \nolder Americans. It is standup time. It is time to deliver. It is time \nto get the job done. Our seniors deserve it. America deserves it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Prescription \nDrug and Medicare Improvement Act of 2003.\n  I am so pleased to be on the Senate floor today for this historic \nevent. Within the next 2 weeks, for the first\n\n[[Page S7965]]\n\ntime in our Nation's history, the Senate is going to pass a real \nprescription drug benefit for all seniors.\n  This historic time does not come a moment too soon. For years, \nseniors all over the country have been making hard choices--choices \nbetween filling a prescription and buying food; choices between losing \ntheir homes or buying the drugs they need to stay alive and healthy.\n  The prospect of providing senior citizens with access to life saving \nprescription drugs under Medicare for the first time is truly exciting. \nIt is truly a historic achievement of the 108th Congress.\n  When I talk to senior citizens around Oregon, access to prescription \ndrugs is the issue by far that resonates most clearly among them.\n  The Senate special Committee on Aging held a field hearing in Oregon \nlast August. I was privileged to chair that hearing. We were tasked the \nissue of adding prescription drugs to the Medicare program. The room \nwas packed with seniors from all around the State.\n  When I asked them to tell me how much they spent each month on drugs, \ntheir answers were astounding. They were astronomical.\n  And of course, there were the seniors who were paying for their \ndrugs. Others made the decision not to fill prescriptions or to skip \ndoses, cut their pills in half or try cheaper remedies.\n  One of our star witnesses was 76-year-old Roy Dancer, a retired \neducator from Beaverton, OR. He testified that many of his friends in \nhis small retirement community have out-of-pocket expenses for \nprescription drugs that well exceed $5,000 per year, including one \nresident with no insurance whose drug costs exceeded $8,500 per year.\n  Mr. Dancer was an active member of his community. One of the ways he \nmaintained his health was by taking eight prescription drugs daily. His \nwife, Betty, was also being kept healthy and active by using multiple \nmedications daily for her high blood pressure, diabetes, and arthritis.\n  Mr. Dancer told the committee that he had once gone to Mexico to \npurchase prescription drugs to save money.\n  That is just one small snapshot of a relatively healthy couple in a \nrelatively affluent retirement community with relatively healthy \nresidents.\n  At that field hearing, the committee also heard from an Oregon \ngeriatrician who described the irreplaceable benefits of modern \nprescription drugs, and the importance of patient compliance with a \nprescribed drug regimen to achieving the full potential benefits of \ncontemporary medical care.\n  This Aging Committee field hearing was held just 2 weeks after the \nSenate's failed attempt to pass a prescription drug benefit last year. \nAnd let me tell you, this failure weighed heavily on me during that \nhearing.\n  We are talking about basic access to life saving medicines--many of \nthem developed in this country--and in many cases these folks just \ncould not afford to buy them.\n  It was a truly humbling experience to listen to the stories of these \ngood people and know that we had not helped them.\n  I want to be able to go back to the seniors in Oregon this year and \ntell them what the U.S. Senate has finally done for them.\n  This year, I joined the Finance Committee, and we have had many, many \nmeetings to discuss how to design a drug benefit this year that we can \nactually pass and get to the President's desk. And with this bill, I \nthink we have accomplished that.\n  Every Senator comes to the floor with their views of what is the \nperfect. The question again becomes, Will our individual views of the \nperfect thwart the good? Truly, this bill represents a lot of good, and \nit certainly is a very good start.\n  When this bill is signed into law, no senior will again ever have to \nlose their home when they lose their health.\n  This bill provides substantial assistance to low income seniors, \nwhile making improvements to the Medicare program, all in a way that \nwill ensure the financial viability of the Medicare program in the long \nterm.\n  This bill doesn't give anyone a free ride. Every senior is asked to \ncontribute something for this sweeping new benefit. However, low-income \nseniors, in particular, are protected from high drug costs under this \nlegislation.\n  While everyone will pay something for their prescriptions, payments \nfor low-income seniors are tied to their ability to pay. Very low-\nincome seniors will pay very little for their prescriptions, while \nmoderately low-income seniors will pay a little more.\n  Higher income seniors will pay a small premium to have access to a \nplan with moderate cost sharing, and, importantly, protection against \ncatastrophic drug expenses. The peace of mine from this coverage alone \nis, for me, one of the most important provisions in this bill.\n  In addition to making prescription drug coverage available and \naffordable to all seniors, this bill updates the Medicare program to \ninclude new choices for seniors.\n  Making preferred provider organizations, available to seniors has \nenormous potential to improve care coordination and provision of \npreventive services for seniors.\n  Let me tell you why this is important.\n  Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions are by far \nthe most expensive group of seniors to care for. Their care is also the \nmost complex, creating quality of life challenges for many seniors, \ntheir multiple health care providers, and their families.\n  Beneficiaries with 5 or more chronic conditions represent 20 percent \nof the Medicare population but account for 66 percent of the cost. \nThese seniors to go the doctor four times as often, and fill five times \nmore prescriptions than healthier seniors.\n  I believe there is an enormous potential to improve care for this \nrapidly growing group of seniors while keeping costs down for Medicare \nby coordinating their health care better.\n  Preferred provider organizations can help do that. And while no \nsenior in America will have to move into a PPO, they will now have the \noption to do so. In my mind, that is a substantial improvement to \nMedicare.\n  For the first time in a long while, this bill also addresses one of \nthe biggest problems in Medicare--the inequity between rural and urban \nAmerica. I would like to thank Chairman Grassley again for his personal \ncommitment to this issue and for his tireless efforts on behalf of \nrural States such as Oregon.\n  In addition to correcting some of the Medicare reimbursement issues \nthat have disadvantaged people and health care providers who live and \nwork in rural areas, this bill contains numerous protections to ensure \nthat rural Americans have access to the same health care choices as \nurban Americans and at the same cost.\n  These improvements were critical to win my support for this bill, and \nthey represent just a few of the improvements in this bill over last \nyear's bill as it was debated.\n  Several months ago, the Senate Budget Committee calculated that a \ncomprehensive, responsible drug benefit that the country could also \nafford would cost around $400 billion. Subsequently, the Budget \nCommittee set aside $400 billion for the addition of a prescription \ndrug benefit in Medicare and improvements to the program.\n  This bill strengthens Medicare in a substantial way. It uses the $400 \nbillion set aside for this purpose without running the program into the \nground in the long term.\n  I know I am not alone in striving to update Medicare in such a way \nthat the program will be there for our children who will want to \nparticipate in it.\n  Americans across the country are asking for our help. They cannot \nafford to wait another year while we search for the perfect solution. \nThis bill represents years of careful research, debate, and compromise, \nand it is going to strengthen and improve Medicare for generations to \ncome.\n  I look forward to working with every one of my colleagues over the \nnext few weeks to improve this bill and to get it to the President's \ndesk before the end of summer.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time spent in quorum \ncalls during today's session be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S7966]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I understand there is a division in the time. How much \ntime do we have on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixty-five minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself such time as I might consume.\n  The history of America is that of a people always fighting for an \never more perfect union, a nation of genuine fairness and opportunity \nfor all, and that meets the basic needs of all Americans.\n  We fought to create public schools, so all children can receive an \neducation to help them succeed, and to equip them to participate fully \nin our society.\n  We have battled for civil rights, so that no one is denied \nopportunity because of race, gender, religion, national origin, or \ndisability.\n  We fought for a fair minimum wage, so that those who work 40 hours a \nweek, 52 weeks a year, should never live in poverty.\n  We created Social Security and Medicare, so that those who work their \nentire lives, and contribute so much to the nation, will be cared for \nin their golden years.\n  But ours is always an unfinished republic. With each generation, and \nin each era, we continue to perfect our democracy and to fight for \nprogress.\n  And today, one of the great challenges of our time is at long last to \nright an injustice that has harmed millions of our fellow Americans, \nthe fact that Medicare today does not provide a prescription drug \nbenefit.\n  Many of us in the Senate have battled for such a benefit for almost a \nquarter of a century. In fact, Senator Strom Thurmond and I introduced \nthe first legislation to create a prescription drug benefit in 1977. \nAnd in more recent times, Democrats have led the charge. In 1999, \nSenator Rockefeller and I introduced key legislation to provide \nprescription drug coverage in Medicare. In 2002, Democrats led the way \nonce again in offering the Graham-Miller-Kennedy Medicare prescription \ndrug bill.\n  For too many years, the prospects of enacting a Medicare prescription \ndrug benefit were jeopardized by the insistence of many Republicans and \nthe Bush administration to destroy Medicare by forcing seniors to leave \ntheir family doctors and join HMOs and PPOs. In fact, President Bush \nproposed to use a prescription drug benefit as bait, telling seniors \nthat if they wanted prescription drug coverage, they had to leave \nMedicare to get it. While purporting the give seniors choices within \nMedicare, his plan in fact gave seniors only one option, to leave the \nMedicare they love to get the prescription drugs they need. The only \nwinner in this misguided policy would be the insurance industry, which \nstood to gain $2.5 trillion dollars from the privatization of Medicare.\n  Democrats and senior citizens locked arms to fight this proposal. We \nstood up for Medicare and its promise to provide the health care needs \nof seniors citizens in retirement. Senior citizens across America said \nit's wrong to coerce them into leaving their family doctors and joining \nHMOs and PPOs to get the drug benefits they need and deserve.\n  In recent days, the voices of America's 35 million senior citizens \nwere finally heard. Last week, a bipartisan group of Senators rejected \nthe President's backwards priorities, and President Bush retreated from \nhis insistence on privatizing Medicare. Instead of holding the needs of \nseniors hostage to an ideological agenda, Republicans' willingness to \nput aside ideology and work with Democrats to create a prescription \ndrug benefit now paves the way for the largest expansion of Medicare in \nits 37-year history. After many years of battling for a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit, we now face the very real prospect that \nCongress can pass, and the President will sign, a bill that provides \nthe prescription drug benefit within conventional Medicare.\n  In fact, if you think Medicare should be privatized, then you should \noppose this bill.\n  This promising moment comes at a time of crisis for millions of our \nsenior citizens. Too many elderly citizens choose between food on the \ntable and the medicine they need. Too many elderly Americans are taking \nonly half the drugs their doctor prescribes, or none at all, because \nthey cannot afford them. Today, the average senior citizen has an \nincome of around $15,000, and prescription drug bills of $2,300. That \nis the average, and many senior citizens incur drug costs in the \nthousands of dollars each year.\n  Senior citizens are faced with a deadly double whammy. Prescription \ndrug costs are out of control, and private insurance coverage is drying \nup. Last year, prescription drug costs soared by a whopping 14 percent. \nThey have shot up at double-digit rates in each of the last 5 years. \nWhether we are talking about employee retirement plans, Medigap \ncoverage, or Medicare HMOs, prescription drug coverage is skyrocketing \nin cost, and becoming more and more out of reach for the elderly.\n  This chart reflects the rise in costs as compared to what our seniors \nare receiving in their Social Security COLA increase, going from 1998 \nwhere there was a 10 percent increase in the cost of prescription drugs \nbut seniors were getting only 2.1 percent. In 1999, it was 19.7 percent \nand the increase in the cost of living was at 1.3 percent. Then we go \nthroughout 2000, 2001, 2002, and today in 2003 it is expected to go up \nto 13 percent with seniors receiving a very modest 1.4 percent.\n  When we are talking about what is happening to the quality of life of \nour seniors, we are talking about these absolutely vital, indispensable \nmedications, prescription drugs, which they need and which are costly. \nThe fact is, so many of our seniors are on fixed incomes that with very \nmodest increases in the cost of living they are constantly being \nsqueezed, and this is putting the kind of pressure on them and on their \nlives and on their families which has caused such extraordinary pain, \nsuffering, and anguish among the seniors; and not only among the \nseniors but among their families as well.\n  The costs are one of the dramatic aspects of the whole prescription \ndrug issue, and we are going to make a downpayment hopefully with the \nacceptance of the legislation that came out of our committee. The \ninitial McCain-Schumer legislation which now is supported unanimously \nfrom our committee will help to move generic drugs on to the market \nmore quickly and be available to our seniors under this program.\n  It used to be that the only seniors with reliable, adequate, \naffordable coverage were the very poor on Medicaid, but even that \nbenefit is eroding. Today, because of the State fiscal crisis created \nby the recession and the let-them-eat-cake attitude of the Republican \nparty, even the poorest of the poor can no longer count on protection. \nStates are now facing the largest budget deficits in half a century, an \nestimated $26 billion this year, and $70 billion next year.\n  This chart is a pretty good reflection of the situation of our \nseniors on the issue of affordable, reliable and quality drug \ncoverage. Thirteen million have absolutely no coverage; 10 million have \nemployer-sponsored coverage; 5 million are under Medicare; 2 million \nare under Medigap; 3 million are under Medicaid and a small amount on \nother public coverage.\n\n  It used to be said of this group, it was the one group listed here \nthat had dependable, reliable, certain drug coverage for those under \nMedicaid, but that is no longer true. We are seeing the numbers covered \nunder Medicaid going down every year. With the States now facing very \nsizable deficits, they are cutting back on the Medicaid and the \ncoverage.\n  The result is States are cutting back on the prescription drug \ncoverage for those least able to pay. Thirty-nine States expect to cut \ntheir Medicaid drug benefit this year. In my home State of \nMassachusetts, 80,000 senior citizens were about to lose their \nprescription drug coverage under the same senior Advantage Program on \nJuly 1. Emergency action by the State legislature solved the problem \nbut only after making substantial reductions in the coverage.\n  Ten million of the elderly enjoy high-quality, affordable retirement \ncoverage through a former employer, but retiree coverage is plummeting, \ntoo. In just 8\n\n[[Page S7967]]\n\nyears, from 1994 to 2002, the number of firms offering retiree coverage \nfell by a massive 40 percent. The employer-sponsored column on this \nchart shows 10 million employer sponsored retirees.\n  We have 13 million with no coverage, 10 million with the employer \nsponsored, and we saw a gradual reduction for the poorest of our \nseniors. So let's see what is happening now. The firms offering retiree \nhealth benefits have dropped 40 percent from 1994 to 2002. In 1994, 40 \npercent of the firms offered retiree health benefits. Go back to 1988; \nit was about 85 percent; in 1994, it was 40 percent; in 2002, it was \njust over 20 to 22 percent. So we are seeing that availability \nconstantly squeezed.\n  Medicare HMOs are also drastically cutting back. Since 1999, more \nthan 2.5 million Medicare beneficiaries have been dropped by their \nMedicare HMOs. Of the HMOs that remain in the program, more than 70 \npercent limit drug coverage to a meager $500 a year or less and half \nonly pay for generic drugs.\n  I have another chart showing groups of seniors. We talked about the \nemployer sponsored seniors and the pressure they are under; we talk of \nthe pressure under the Medicaid. Let's look at those 5 million under \nthe Medicaid HMO and see what has happened to them: 2.4 million have \nbeen dropped, and of the remaining, take a look at what has happened. \nThe Medicare HMOs are reducing the level of drug coverage. Sure, some \nprovide it, but 86 percent limited the coverage to less than $1,000 in \n2003; 70 percent imposed caps of less than $500. So although they are \nproviding, if the average expenditure of a senior is $2,300 and HMOs \nare limiting it to less than $3,500, it is an empty promise.\n  We have those with no coverage. We have those in the employer \nretirement programs who are seeing reductions; we have the HMOs seeing \nreduced coverage. We have seen in the Medicaid where there has been \nreduced coverage as well. We also see that Medigap plans that offer \ndrug coverage are priced out of reach for most seniors, and the \ncoverage offered by these plans is severely limited.\n  Thirteen million beneficiaries, as I mentioned, have no prescription \ndrug coverage at all. Only half of all senior citizens have coverage \nthroughout the year. It is time to mend the broken promise of Medicare. \nIt is time to provide every senior citizen in this great country of \nours with solid, reliable, comprehensive prescription drug coverage.\n\n  As we enter this debate, our great challenge is fairness for all \nsenior citizens who need Medicare's help to afford the prescription \ndrugs they need. The resources within this Republican budget are \nlimited. The Republican budget provides only enough funding to cover \nabout a quarter of the needs of America's senior citizens over the next \ndecade. They are going to be spending $1.8 trillion. This is $400 \nmillion. They are spending $1.8 trillion, and this is $400 million, 22 \npercent. There will be large gaps.\n  It is very important to remember this is a downpayment. Those who are \nsupporting this program are strongly committed to building on this \nprogram. It is a downpayment. We are going to come back again and again \nand again to make sure we are going to meet the challenges provided by \nthis bill and out there across this country we recognize what our \nseniors are facing. We must ensure that the resources are available to \nbe used equitably.\n  As I mentioned, this bill is a downpayment on our commitment as \nDemocrats to provide for the needs of our senior citizens. We will do \neverything we can to increase the resources available to provide an \nample prescription drug benefit. If we do not succeed today, we will \nbattle the Republican budget tomorrow, next month, next year, carry \nthis issue into the next election, if necessary, until we have in place \na White House and Congress that support Medicare and give the \nprescription drug benefit the resources it deserves. However, we must \nget started.\n  This bill does much that is good. It provides a low-income benefit \nthat assures 40 percent of all seniors that they can get help with drug \nexpenses with minimum premiums and copays. It saves the average senior \nwith average drug costs approximately $600 a year--not as much as we \nshould be providing but a good downpayment toward a contract with the \nseniors.\n  This next chart is for a senior with an average income of $15,000. \nThey average $2,300 in prescription drugs. This is how the program \nworks. For $420 in premium, they will pay $1,298 in cost sharing, and \nthey get a benefit of $604, not as much as we would like to have, but \nnonetheless that $604 for an average income senior citizen is an \nimportant resource and assistance to them.\n  The next chart shows the same senior citizen with $15,000 of income. \nSay they have $10,000--we have taken the average income and the average \namount of expenditure for prescription drugs, and now we have the \naverage income of $15,000--this senior has $10,000 for prescription \ndrugs. That is a lot of money, but there are certain pills, for \nexample, dealing with treatment of cancer, that are $68 each. These \nexpenditures can be run up relatively easily, and they are run up by \nmany of our seniors. This is $10,000; they would pay in $4,500 and they \nwould receive $5,462 in savings under this bill. This is a not \ninsignificant amount of savings.\n  The next chart shows families with lower incomes. We are going from \n$9,000 to $12,000, to $13,000. This reflects the current monthly drug \ncosts, so we are talking $2,300 a year at $190 a month for the average. \nThis is the way this bill treats them. The monthly costs for a senior \nwith a $9,000 income would be $5, and they would save $185. If there \nwas a $12,000 income, and they still had to pay the $190, which again \nis the average, their monthly cost would be $10, and they would save \n$180. If the income was $13,500 and they spent the $190, their monthly \ncost would be $23, and they would save $168.\n\n  So the help, the assistance for the 40 percent of our seniors at the \nlower end of the income is very substantial, as it should be. We have \nseen where, even for the average income for the senior, it still \nprovides about $600. For those with an average income for seniors, with \nhigher amounts of prescription drug expenses, it provides a very \nimportant and substantial relief for them.\n  In addition to this--this is one of the most appealing aspects of \nthis program--this bill offers immediate relief for seniors. We are \ntalking about next January. Five million low-income seniors will \nreceive a $600 prescription drug credit card on January 1, 2004. The \nmost they will pay for it is $25. But for those of limited income, they \nwill get that free, and they will have the first $600 prior to the time \nthe program goes into effect, which will be in 2006. This will be \navailable to them in January 2004. All seniors can receive savings \nthrough the drug discount card. This is enormously important. If a \nsenior doesn't use the whole $600, they can carry that over for another \nyear.\n  Help is on the way, immediately, for 5 million seniors starting in \nJanuary of next year. That, I believe, is enormously important and \npositive news for many seniors.\n  While this bill does much that is good, it still has serious gaps and \nomissions. It will still leave many elderly suffering from severe \nfinancial strains as they try to purchase the prescription drugs they \nneed. It doesn't provide the retiree health plans with the fair \ntreatment they deserve to assure they can continue to meet the needs of \nretired workers. It could be improved by changes to ensure the coverage \nprovided every senior citizen will be as stable and reliable as \npossible. During the course of this debate, Democrats and Republicans \nin the Senate will try to address these needs. If we are unsuccessful, \nwe will continue to fight over the years ahead to fill in the gaps in \nthis program.\n  At bottom, the issue of providing adequate prescription coverage for \nseniors is a question of priorities. For the administration and for too \nmany Republicans in Congress, tax cuts for billionaires are more \nimportant than health care for senior citizens. But Senator Grassley, \nand I see him on the floor here today, and Senator Baucus and the other \nmembers of the Finance Committee deserve enormous credit for the \nexcellent job they have done, designing a benefit within a $400 billion \nstraitjacket imposed by the budget resolution.\n  I also pay tribute to the majority leader, Senator Frist, for his \nstrong leadership, assisting the Finance Committee, contributing to the \nshaping of this program which I think is commendable. It needs work but \nit is a very important, significant, and positive start.\n\n[[Page S7968]]\n\n  Because this program covers only about a quarter of the elderly's \ndrug expenditures, it still leaves too many elderly--those with incomes \nbelow 160 percent of poverty--with unaffordable costs. Forty percent, \nthose with incomes below 160 percent of poverty, will have \ncomprehensive, affordable coverage through this program or through \nMedicaid. This is a tremendous achievement. But others, particularly \nthe middle class with moderate incomes and high drug expenses, still \nface high drug costs. The benefits under this bill--a $275 deductible, \n50 percent cost-sharing, an out-of-pocket limit of $3,700 with \ncontinued copayment obligations after the limit is reached, are far \nless generous than those enjoyed by most younger Americans, even though \nthe elderly's need for prescription drugs is much greater.\n\n  We have talked about what they call the doughnut hole, where there is \nvery comprehensive coverage for those at the lower end and very \nsubstantial help for those at the higher end, and less help and \nassistance for those in the middle. That will be one of the issues \nwhich we will have a chance to address here on the floor, to try to see \nif we can't provide some additional help to those who will not be \nbenefitted as extensively as those other two groups. That will be in \nthe form of amendments that will be introduced and hopefully supported.\n  Also, I mentioned the serious issues that work because of the \ninteraction of this program in terms of retiree benefits that can \npotentially threaten retirees, and is an issue that must and should be \naddressed. I am hopeful it will be before final passage.\n  A final area where this bill could benefit from improvements is in \nthe rules and regulations established for the private insurance plans \nthat are the vehicle for delivering prescription drug benefits to \nsenior citizens and the disabled, and for the fallback plans that will \ndeliver the benefit when there are not two insurance plans meeting \nGovernment standards in each region of the country. The sponsors of \nthis bill have done much to assure that individuals who enroll in \nprivate plans will pay a reasonable premium, and that there will always \nbe coverage available in every area of the country. But more can be \ndone and should be done to assure that premiums are reliable and \naffordable everywhere and that senior citizens do not have to change \nplans frequently because of instability in the market.\n  Many Democrats were concerned that last year's Republican bill could \nprove unworkable because private insurance plans might not be willing \nto provide the drug benefit. The concern was especially strong in rural \nareas, where HMOs and PPOs have been unwilling or unable to provide \nservices. Under the compromise plan, there will be a government drug \nplan available in any place where there are not at least two private \ndrug plans meeting Medicare standards available. To increase stability \nof choices for senior citizens, private drug plans must remain \navailable in any region they choose to enter for at least 2 years. \nThus, the bill guarantees that every senior citizen, no matter where \nthey live, will be able to receive the benefits provided in the bill.\n  The Republican bill last year relied solely on competition to keep \ndrug plan premiums reasonable for senor citizens, leaving senior \ncitizens vulnerable to exorbitant charges and profiteering if \ncompetition was ineffective. This year's bill establishes tight \nregulatory criteria to assure that plan premiums are fair. It uses the \nsame rules that govern the Federal Employee Health Benefits program.\n  Specifically, the bill states that a plan cannot be approved to \nparticipate in the drug program unless its premiums are ``reasonably \nand equitably reflect the cost of benefits'' provided under the plan. \nIn the FEHBP program this requirement has been interpreted to allow \nhealth plans a maximum markup of one percent over costs.\n  Democrats have been concerned that private drug-only plans might deny \nbeneficiaries access to off-formulary drugs in order to reduce costs \nand maximize profits. Last year's Republican bill contained no \nindependent appeal rights and did not require that beneficiaries \nreceive off-formulary drugs at the preferred drug rate even if an \ninternal appeal were successful. The compromise program requires the \nplans to cover at least two drugs in each therapeutic class, \nestablishes a strong independent appeal process, and provides that off-\nformulary drugs can be obtained at the preferred drug rate if an appeal \nis successful.\n  This week the Senate has an opportunity to make the bill better. But \nwe must also guard against it becoming worse. This bill provides fair \ntreatment and the opportunity for new choices for senior citizens who \nwant to stay in Medicare as well as for those who might consider a \nprivate insurance alternative.\n  The President's plan, by contrast, sought to stack the deck against \nMedicare--and against senor citizens. Instead of the trustee of the \nMedicare program, his plan would have made the Government little more \nthan a shill for HMOs and the insurance industry. Seniors would have \nbeen poorer, their medical options would have been constrained, their \nability to choose their own doctors would have been compromised, and \nall so that wealthy HMOs and insurance companies can become even \nwealthier.\n  If all senior citizens can be forced out of Medicare and into HMO and \nprivate insurance, the revenues of the insurance industry will increase \nby more than $2.5 trillion over the next decade. Same on the insurance \nindustry for supporting this plan, and shame on the administration for \nputting the interests of wealthy and powerful political supporters \nabove the interests of the senior citizens who have built this great \ncountry.\n  The bill before the Senate says no to this outrageous scheme. But I \nanticipate that amendments will be offered during the course of this \ndebate to tilt the scales once again against senior citizens and for \nprivate insurers. It is unlikely that any Member of the Senate will \npublicly demand, as the President did, that senior citizens give up \ntheir choice of doctors in order to get prescription drugs. But there \nare more subtle ways of unraveling Medicare. Amendments may be offered \nto uncap Federal payments to private insurers, so that they have an \nopen tap to the Federal treasury, even if their services cost more than \nthose same services provided by Medicare. We need help for senior \ncitizens, not corporate welfare for insurance companies that seek to \nundermine Medicare.\n  There are other ideas that could destroy our bipartisan compromise. \nThe President says that he has embraced the bipartisan Senate \ncompromise. But some are considering implementing a vast experiment on \nsenior citizens all over this country. This experiment--called \n``premium support''--is yet another attempt to force senior citizens \ninto HMOs and other private insurance plans. It is more subtle but just \nas unacceptable as the President's original proposal. It could \ndramatically raise Medicare premiums and victimize the oldest and \nsickest of the Medicare population. It is a poison pill that could kill \nthe prospects for reform and destroy all the progress that has been \nmade in the Senate.\n  I am also gravely concerned by other proposals that would establish, \nfor the first time, a means test for Medicare benefits.\n  One of the reasons that Medicare is such a popular and successful \nprogram is that all individuals, rich and poor alike, contribute, and \nall benefit. Senior citizens want Medicare, not welfare. And tying \ncatastrophic benefits to a person's income is the camel's nose under \nthe tent that could lead to the dismantling of Medicare and its \nreplacement with welfare.\n  As this debate progresses, there will be a vast array of facts and \nfigures discussed in this chamber. Many of the issues will be discussed \nin language that will seem technical and arcane to the average \nAmerican. All of us must strive to remember why this debate is \nimportant and what it is really about.\n  The typical Medicare enrollee is a seventy-five year old widow, \nliving alone. Her total income is just $11,300 a year. She has at least \none chronic condition and suffers from arthritis. In her younger years, \nshe and her husband worked hard. They raised a family. They stood by \nthis country through economic hard times, the Second World War, the \nKorean War, and the Cold War. They sacrificed to protect and build a \nbetter country--not just for their children but for all of us. Now it\n\n[[Page S7969]]\n\nis time for us to fulfill our promise to her. It is time to assure her \nthe affordable health care she deserves. It is time to pass a \nprescription drug benefit under Medicare.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous consent that \nthe time be equally charged to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill, S. 1.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, yesterday we began what can truly be expected to be an \nhistoric effort to transform the Medicare Program in this country, an \neffort, if it is successful in these coming days, that would provide \nfor the most sweeping changes to that program since its inception in \n1965.\n  We began debate this week on the need for coverage of prescription \nmedicines under the Federal Medicare Program. While it is a debate that \nis sure to be spirited in the coming days, it is my hope the debate \nwill, in the end, result in a significant move forward that will \nstrengthen the Medicare Program for its 41 million beneficiaries and \nfor the millions of future beneficiaries who will depend on this \ncritically important program for their health and their well-being.\n  Over the past month, I have had the opportunity to convene a series \nof forums on senior health care in my home State of Connecticut in an \nattempt to frame the scope of this debate. At these forums, I heard \nfrom many constituents on many matters regarding their health care, but \nthe present lack of coverage for prescription drugs under the Medicare \nProgram was far and away--without even a close second--the most \nimportant question that was raised to me by literally dozens and dozens \nof seniors in my State.\n  I would guess in similar forums being held in other States around the \ncountry by our colleagues they have encountered virtually the same \nreaction as did I with my seniors in Connecticut: When are we going to \nget a prescription drug benefit? When are we going to get it under \nMedicare? And will it be meaningful enough to make a difference in our \nlives? Over and over and over again, in all parts of my State, this was \nthe call that I received from my constituents.\n  At these forums, I heard from seniors who literally could not afford \nto fill prescriptions called for by their doctors. I heard from elderly \nMedicare beneficiaries forced to choose between purchasing groceries or \nfilling their drug prescriptions. I heard from seniors who were forced \nto skip dosages of their medicines in an attempt to stretch their \nlimited supplies of needed medicines. And I heard from Medicare \nbeneficiaries requiring more than 10 prescribed medicines a day unable \nto afford to fill even half of those needed prescriptions.\n  Clearly, what I heard from hundreds of Connecticut's more than \n500,000 Medicare beneficiaries--in a State, I might add, that has 3\\1/\n2\\ million people--is their grave concern over the present lack of a \nprescription drug benefit under the Medicare Program.\n  Our goal over the next 2 weeks is very clear: to ensure that all \nMedicare beneficiaries have access to their needed prescribed \nmedicines. To achieve anything less in this debate would be an \nabdication of our responsibility to ensure that Federal programs \ncorrespond with the times in which we live.\n  The simple fact is that pharmaceuticals have and will continue to \nbetter the lives of millions of Americans. When the Medicare Program \nwas first enacted in 1965, few could even begin to imagine the great \nstrides we have realized in health care as a result of the development \nand widespread dissemination of pharmaceutical medicines. However, the \npresent lack of a prescription drug benefit under the Medicare Program \nfails to reflect these great gains that have been made, leaving more \nthan half of all Medicare beneficiaries without any coverage for their \nneeded medicines. This is unacceptable, and it must be remedied.\n\n  For this reason, I am heartened that it appears that today, for the \nvery first time--for the very first time since we began discussion of \nthis subject matter--we are on the cusp of passing in the Senate \ncomprehensive Medicare reforms that will, at long last, add a \nprescription drug benefit to the Medicare Program.\n  I am particularly pleased the measure reported by the Senate Finance \nCommittee last week, and that is before us this afternoon, represents a \nvery significant departure from previous plans supported by the \nadministration that would have required Medicare beneficiaries to leave \nthe traditional fee-for-service Medicare Program in order to receive \ncoverage for their prescribed medicines. Such a move would have been \nunconscionable, as 89 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries today are \nin the traditional program.\n  To force those beneficiaries to have to leave their present system of \ncoverage, and most likely the doctor they have come to know and trust, \nwould not only create great disruption, but it would also, for the \nfirst time since the program's inception, create a tiered benefit \nsystem under Medicare that would more greatly reward those who choose \nto join a private preferred provider organization or health maintenance \norganization over those who wanted to stay in the traditional Medicare \nProgram.\n  That is what the administration was originally advocating. That is \nwhat many, unfortunately, in the other body, the House of \nRepresentatives, are still pursuing and still advocating. So I hope, as \na result of the change we have seen in the last week, this breakthrough \nwill make a huge difference in the lives of Medicare beneficiaries who \nwant to retain the ability to stay under the traditional Medicare \nProgram if they so choose.\n  And so while I am pleased the bill before us soundly rejects a tiered \nbenefit system--and I commend the distinguished Senator from Iowa, the \nchairman of the committee, and the distinguished Senator from Montana, \nfor rejecting the idea of a tiered benefit system, I am deeply \nconcerned that the plan presently taking shape, as I mentioned, in the \nother body, the House, appears to rely on such a flawed plan. And until \nwe have resolved the matters between these two bodies, this fundamental \ndifference will still be out there and need to be addressed.\n  President Bush, just last week, visited my home State of Connecticut \nand called on Congress to pass a prescription drug benefit before July \n4th. For my part, I call on the President not to sign any Medicare \nreform measure that would force seniors to join private plans in order \nto receive a more generous prescription drug benefit. Such a measure \nwould signal an end to the Medicare Program as we know it and should be \nrejected out of hand. In fact, I would hope the President would say, \ncategorically, that while he wants Congress to pass a bill before July \n4th--he must say, with equal strength, that he will not sign a bill \nthat denies people under traditional Medicare the opportunity to have \nan adequate prescription drug benefit or forces them to have to make a \nchoice between staying in traditional Medicare and getting no \nprescription drug benefit or going to a private plan where they can get \nthat prescription drug benefit but having to give up traditional \nMedicare as the price. The President needs to state that he will reject \nany proposal on his desk that incorporates that idea.\n  The bill before us, S. 1, the Prescription Drug and Medicare \nImprovement Act of 2003, represents a strong step forward on this \nissue. However, no bill is perfect, and S. 1 clearly leaves much room \nfor improvement. In the coming weeks, I plan to work with my colleagues \nto specifically address concerns over the present bill's lack of \nadequate provisions to ensure that those companies presently providing \ntheir retirees prescription drug coverage receive adequate Federal \nsupport for their laudable efforts. Any measure that we enact should be \ncrafted so as to support, not supplant, the valuable efforts of \nemployers already providing prescription drug coverage for their \nretirees.\n  Additionally, I remain concerned that the gap in coverage in the \npresent\n\n[[Page S7970]]\n\nbill--the so-called donut hole--will leave many Medicare beneficiaries \nfacing high prescription drug costs with no assistance at the very time \nwhen it may be needed most. These may be the people who are the most \nsick, under the most dire medical circumstances. And if they were to \nreach that threshold of approximately $4,500 in prescription drug \ncosts, they will have to maintain paying the premiums without receiving \nany benefit until they reach the upper limit of the gap, approximately \n$5,800 in drug costs. This gap in coverage could provide a huge \nhardship on literally hundreds of thousands of Medicare beneficiaries. \nI hope we are going to be able to close the so-called donut hole, \nespecially for those in the lower income category who can least afford \nany gap in their coverage.\n  I am also concerned that S. 1 fails to adequately protect Medicare \nbeneficiaries from the very understandable confusion and uncertainty \nthat may surround these beneficiaries just as they begin to navigate \nthe intricacies of a brand new program. Specifically, I am worried \nthat, if enacted, the underlying bill would require Medicare \nbeneficiaries choosing a prescription drug plan to stay with that plan \nfor a minimum of 1 year. With the enactment of such broad and sweeping \nchanges to Medicare as S. 1 would provide, I am fearful that many \nMedicare beneficiaries will face great uncertainty trying to find the \nbest plan to meet their particular medical needs.\n  I believe we can greatly relieve this uncertainty by allowing those \ninitially choosing prescription drug plans for the first time the \nopportunity to move from one plan to another as they determine what \neach plan will specifically offer and which plan best fits their own \nneeds. We ought to give our senior citizens that opportunity. All \nMedicare beneficiaries are not the same merely because they have \nreached the same age. They are under very different circumstances with \nvery different medical needs. We ought to show them the dignity and \nrespect they deserve as an older generation to give them the ability to \nchoose the plan that serves their needs best and not force them to have \nto make decisions that may do them great harm.\n  In the coming weeks I will offer several amendments to the \nlegislation that will address these very specific issues and possibly \nother ones as well.\n  On July 30, 1965, President Lyndon Baines Johnson traveled to the \nTruman Library in Independence, MO, to sign the Medicare Program into \nlaw. In attendance on that day was the former President of the United \nStates, Harry S. Truman, 81 years of age at the time. On that day, \nPresident Johnson remarked:\n\n       No longer will older Americans be denied the healing \n     miracle of modern medicine. No longer will illness crush and \n     destroy the savings that they so carefully put away over a \n     lifetime so that they might enjoy dignity in their latter \n     years.\n\n  Almost 38 years later, we face a similar struggle of ensuring seniors \naccess to modern medicine, this time in the form of prescribed \nmedicines.\n  So it is with a great sense of hope that I join the debate this \nafternoon. Medicare's nearly 41 million beneficiaries clearly need \nassistance in affording their needed medicines. Our effort over the \nnext 2 weeks will greatly determine to what extent we assist in that \neffort.\n  Clearly, a great opportunity is presently before us. I look forward \nto working with all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, \nRepublicans and Democrats, to ensure that we seize this opportunity. It \nmay not come again. While the bill before us may be less than perfect \nand the resources we are limited to may not be as adequate as we would \nlike, we have an opportunity over the next couple of weeks to take the \nlegislation presented to us by the Finance Committee, to work on that \nlegislation and hopefully improve it in several of the areas I have \nmentioned.\n  What greater gift could we give, 38 years after Medicare's creation, \nto retirees and future generations of retirees than to grant them \naccess to this wave of new medicines and prescription drugs, that \ncannot only extend life but can substantially improve the quality of \nlife for people, which will give them the opportunity to enjoy years of \nretirement with their children and grandchildren and friends. Surely \nthese wonderful miracle drugs ought not to become the exclusive domain \nof only those who can afford to buy them.\n  Mr. President, I do not want to have to face constituents in my State \never again who will report that they had to make a choice between \nputting food in their mouths or medicines that they need; that they had \nto choose between the medicines they need because they can't afford all \nof them that the doctors have prescribed, or that they reject \naltogether the medicines that they have been prescribed because they \ncan't afford them. We can't do everything for everyone, but it seems to \nme providing a meaningful prescription drug benefit that will really \nserve the underprivileged in our society, particularly those age 65 and \nabove, is something this Congress ought not to fail to do in its \nresponsibilities.\n  I look forward to the debate. I look forward, more than anything \nelse, to voting for a package in the end that will do that which most \nof us would like to see accomplished and seeing to it that the elderly \nwill receive the full promise given to them back in 1965 that a \nMedicare Program is going to be there for them, and this time we are \ngoing to include in the program coverage for needed prescribed \nmedicines.\n  I commend those who have moved so diligently and worked so hard to \nbring us to this very optimistic moment. I am hopeful in the coming \ndays we can complete the job by adding some improvements here and \npresenting a bill to the American public which they will applaud if we \ncorrectly do our job.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that time \nthereunder be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). That has been provided.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Child Care Tax Credit\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I am rising today to encourage my \ncolleagues. I have gotten an understanding that the Republican \nleadership will be meeting in the morning to talk about the conference \nwith the House on the opportunity we have to provide 12 million \nchildren in this country some help through the tax relief package that \nwas passed in the Senate.\n  I also thank my Senate colleagues for, in a resounding way, reaching \nout to this country and to those 12 million children, as well as their \nworking families, and saying we do believe it is important that the tax \nrelief package we provide be balanced both in its fiscal responsibility \nand in its ability to reach out to all working families in this Nation \nand give them the relief so that they, too, will have the opportunity \nto be able to participate in stimulating the economy of the country. \nAfter all, that is what we are really looking for, stimulating the \neconomy and making sure we are strengthening our Nation. I think there \nis no better place to go than to the working American families.\n  So I encourage my colleagues today, as I come to the floor not to ask \nimmediately but to request of the leadership, to really thoughtfully \nput together what it is we need to do in order to expedite moving to \nconference on this issue. I also plead with the President that his \nefforts and opportunities will certainly weigh in with the Members of \nthe House, encouraging them to move forward. They have already voted in \nthe House in a motion to instruct the conferees to the Senate position. \nThis is something we can do, and do it quickly and in a very fiscally \nresponsible manner by paying for it. But we can do something now that \nis going to help working families in the next several months.\n  It is critical, as we move forward with the previous tax package \npassed, to provide relief to all Americans across this great land by \nJuly 1, and that we, too, recognize not only those precious 12 million \nchildren who are out there, but the working families they are a part \nof, recognizing that these families are preparing in the late summer to \nget their children ready to go back to school. They certainly could use \nthose resources in multitudes of ways--bringing their families \ntogether, preparing their children for the school year. We desperately \nwant to make sure that happens.\n\n[[Page S7971]]\n\n  I encourage our Republican leadership to come together to visit on \nmoving forward in the conference, recognizing that we have a tremendous \nresponsibility not only to the economy of this Nation, particularly in \nstrengthening our country, but, more importantly, to the future of the \ncountry.\n  When you look at those who will be the future leaders of the \nworkforce, the individuals who will be there to continue the great \nlegacy of this land--the children of our country--we must give those \nworking families the opportunity to take advantage of the same kind of \ntax relief that other families are going to be getting; they, too, have \nto take that opportunity to reinvest in this great country and, more \nimportantly, in their families and their children.\n  So I encourage my colleagues, as well as the leadership on the other \nside, to make sure that in the morning they will meet in a wholehearted \nfashion looking for the opportunity we have before us to be fair and \nbalanced for the multitudes of children and working families across \nthis country.\n  I, too, encourage the President to weigh in on this issue. He has a \ntremendous opportunity to make a difference, and I hope he will choose \nto do so.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I am very concerned because what I see \ncoming at us right now is a very fast train. And that train is a giant \ngiveaway entitlement program. We might be in a position to do something \nabout now, but if we wait, we will not be able to do anything about it.\n  Medicare already accounts for roughly 12 percent of the Federal \nspending and will only grow as more and more baby boomers retire. When \nMedicare was proposed in 1965--and I am one of the few people around \nold enough to remember that--I can recall the estimate of Medicare Part \nA that would cost $2.9 billion in 1970. This was 1965. The actual \nexpenditures in 1970 were $5.3 billion, roughly twice what they were \nestimating back in 1965. The estimate for 1980 was $5.5 billion. This \nis Medicare now. The actual expenditures that year totaled $25.6 \nbillion. That is five times the estimated amount.\n  The predicted expenditures for 1990 were $9.1 billion, but the actual \nexpenses totaled $67 billion, nearly seven times the estimated amount. \nCurrently, 76 percent of the Medicare beneficiaries already have some \nform of drug coverage.\n  We have talked about the fact that something that is not broken does \nnot need to be fixed. When we start looking at establishing an \nentitlement program today and go by the Medicare model, this is \nsomething that none of our kids and grandkids are going to be able to \nafford.\n  So if we keep in mind that 67 percent of the Medicare beneficiaries \nalready have some form of drug coverage--much of it is better than the \nproposal on the table now--many of these individuals could lose this \ncoverage if a prescription drug benefit is added to Medicare.\n  CBO estimates that 37 percent of the beneficiaries with employer-\nbased prescription drug coverage would lose that coverage. This \naccounts for 11 percent of the total Medicare population.\n  Many pharmaceutical companies already offer programs that give low-\nincome seniors their prescription drugs for free or for reduced prices. \nIf this bill is passes in this form, the companies may eliminate these \nprograms, forcing more people into the Medicare rolls.\n  One might say, well, we can legislate this and not allow them to do \nthat. That solution is not going to work. That would be an attempt to \nmicromanage the private sector, and that would not work. I do not think \nthere is any Member of this Senate who, if they owned a company that \nwas giving away free programs, then the Government came along and \noffered something, that they would continue that practice. That is \nexactly what would happen.\n  The need to get this legislation to the floor and passed by the end \nof June, along with the need for bipartisan support, has led to a \nseries of compromises that have resulted in a hodgepodge of a bill. \nThere are elements of this bill that are not only bad policy but will \nhave a detrimental effect on the system as a whole; for instance, the \nextension of instant Medicaid benefits to illegal aliens, placing an \nadditional burden on Medicaid; loss of employer-based benefits, thus \nexpanding an already large entitlement program.\n  According to an editorial in the Wall Street Journal yesterday, \nMonday, seniors already own 60 percent of all the wealth of the country \nand their worth is only increasing. We cannot continue to finance \nentitlement programs on the backs of current American workers, which is \nwhat this bill does.\n  The bill is not means tested. We are giving multimillionaires, even \nbillionaires, the same benefit offered to seniors on fixed incomes. In \nother words, the Bill Gateses and Warren Buffetts would get the same \nbenefit as a retired schoolteacher.\n  There is a need for Medicare reform to ensure the solvency and \nstability of the program. However, the current version of this bill \ndoes not meet those needs.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to improve this \nlegislation through amendments designed to encourage employers to \nretain the drug coverage they currently offer, to allow seniors to take \nadvantage of private plans and better options, and to keep the costs \nlow.\n  I will read a little bit of the editorial I read on the plane coming \nback to Washington. It says:\n\n       The bill that passed the Senate Finance Committee last week \n     would cover just 50 percent of the drug expenses between $276 \n     and $4,500 annually, then zero up to $5,800, and 90 percent \n     thereafter. That's nowhere near as good as many seniors \n     currently have with employer-sponsored coverage. Most \n     employers will drop or scale back that coverage once they \n     realize that the feds are willing to pick up part of their \n     tab.\n\n  That is human nature. That is what we are talking about.\n\n       The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 37 percent \n     of those with employer coverage could lose it.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire article be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. INHOFE. We want something to happen. We know there are some plans \nout there that have been offered that take into consideration that we \ndo not want one Government program that is going to end up being an \nentitlement program. If it ends up the way it is today, I am going to \nserve notice right now that after every effort we can make to pass \namendments, if they do not work and we end up with what we have today, \nI am going to be opposing this plan, and hopefully there will be \nseveral others who will do the same thing.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                          Medicare Drug Folly\n\n       Runaway trains are hard to stop, but someone has to try and \n     derail the bipartisan folly now moving ahead under the guise \n     of Medicare ``reform.'' Permit us to put a few facts on the \n     table, in the (probably fanciful) hope that somebody in the \n     White House still cares more about the long-run policy than \n     the short-term politics.\n       Let's start with the amusing irony that the supporters of \n     this giant new prescription drug benefit are many of the same \n     folks who were only recently moaning that a $350 billion tax \n     cut would break the budget. That tax cut will at least help \n     the economy grow. But the new Medicare entitlement is nothing \n     more than a wealth transfer (from younger workers to \n     retirees) estimated to cost $400 billion over 10 years, and \n     everyone knows even that is understated.\n       The real pig in the Medicare python doesn't hit until the \n     Baby Boomers retire. Social Security and Medicare Trustee Tom \n     Saving told us last week that the ``present value'' of the \n     Senate plan--the value of the entire future obligation in \n     today's dollars--is something like two-thirds the size of the \n     current $3.8 trillion in debt held by the public.\n       Bill Clinton's Medicare administrator, Nancy-Ann DeParle, \n     correctly calls it the ``biggest expansion of government \n     health benefits since the Great Society.'' She's delighted to \n     see it, but for the rest of us it is a recipe for tax \n     increases as far as the eye can see.\n       And these estimates are before Democrats ``improve'' the \n     benefit, as they are already agitating to do. That's because \n     the dirty secret of this bipartisan lovefest is that the \n     proposed drug benefit isn't all that great.\n\n[[Page S7972]]\n\n     The bill that passed the Senate Finance Committee last week \n     would cover just 50% of drug expenses between $276 and $4,500 \n     annually, then zero up to $5,800, and 90% thereafter.\n       That's nowhere near as good as many seniors currently have \n     with employer-sponsored coverage. Most employers will drop or \n     scale back that coverage once they realize that the feds are \n     willing to pick up part of their tab. The Congressional \n     Budget Office estimates that 37% of those with employer \n     coverage could lose it.\n       A Goldman Sachs analyst last week called this bill the \n     ``automaker enrichment act,'' saying companies like Ford and \n     GM would see a 15% reduction in their annual drug spending \n     and a huge decrease in unfunded liabilities. So unborn \n     taxpayers will soon have to pick up the tab for sweetheart \n     labor deals negotiated by carmakers and their unions a \n     generation or two ago.\n       Understood in these terms, a universal drug benefit is \n     neither necessary nor morally justifiable. Some 76% of \n     seniors already have some prescription drug coverage, as the \n     nearby chart shows. The average Medicare beneficiary spends \n     an affordable $999 a year out of pocket on prescription \n     drugs, and less than 5% have out of pocket expenses over \n     $4,000.\n       Seniors already own 60% of all the wealth in this country, \n     and are getting richer. A report in Health Affairs estimates \n     that by 2030 about half will have incomes of $40,000 and \n     about 60% will have assets of $200,000 or more. We're all for \n     a prosperous old age, but it is hardly a step toward social \n     justice for comfortable retirees to be further subsidized by \n     working taxpayers with mortgages and kids. The problem of \n     genuinely poor seniors can be handled with a drug discount \n     card or a means-tested subsidy.\n       We understand, of course, that these facts are unlikely to \n     interfere with the political calculus driving this giant step \n     toward Canadian health care. The Democrats want to expand the \n     welfare state, while Republicans have convinced themselves \n     that they'll get credit with seniors and be able to take \n     health care off the table for 2004.\n       The Republicans are fooling themselves in the long run, and \n     perhaps even about next year. Republicans can never win an \n     entitlement bidding war. They will spend the rest of their \n     public lives sounding like Scrooge for not expanding \n     benefits, or raising taxes on their own voters to pay for the \n     subsidies, or imposing price controls on drug makers that \n     will stifle innovation. This is how parties of the right \n     became me-too socialists in Europe.\n       The sheepish support for this from the likes of otherwise \n     conservative Senators Rick Santorum and Mitch McConnell gives \n     the game away. They're playing loyal spinners, but their \n     heart doesn't seem to be in it. They're going along for the \n     ride with a Republican White House that seems to have \n     forgotten that it has an obligation to more than its own re-\n     election.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ndiscuss a particular interest of mine: how the ``Prescription Drug and \nMedicare Improvement Act of 2003'' will protect beneficiaries in rural \nareas.\n  As we worked to develop S. 1, members of the committee were \nespecially attuned to the concerns expressed by some that private \nentities will be unwilling--or perhaps unable--to provide services to \nMedicare beneficiaries living in rural communities. That is why we \nincluded a number of safeguards to make certain that rural elderly and \ndisabled patients have access to the Medicare improvements made in S. \n1.\n  I cannot overstate how particularly important this is for my home \nstate of Utah, since most of the 29 counties and 82,144 square miles in \nUtah are rural.\n  According to the 2000 Census, Utah's population density was only 27.2 \npersons per square mile, roughly one third of the national average of \n79.6 persons per square mile.\n  So I am very interested in seeing to it that Medicare beneficiaries \nin rural areas--whether they are in Utah or for that matter in the \nState of New York, I want to make sure these beneficiaries get a fair \nshake.\n  There is no question that the Medicare beneficiaries who live in \nthese rural communities--towns and small cities like Moab, St. George, \nGreen River, Blanding, Beaver and Vernal--deserve access to the same \nservices that are available to Medicare beneficiaries living in Salt \nLake City, or for that matter, New York City.\n  I cannot criticize colleagues who are concerned that the new private \nsector-oriented delivery mechanisms we have designed in S. 1 may not be \navailable to beneficiaries in rural areas. That being said, I want to \nprovide assurances to my colleagues that the Committee worked hard to \ndesign a plan that would protect the elderly and disabled who reside in \nrural areas.\n  Indeed, it is not surprising that criticisms have been expressed that \nthere could be gaps in coverage in rural areas given the experience \nwith Medicare+Choice and Medicare HMOs.\n  These Medicare+Choice plans were established with the intent of \nproviding Medicare beneficiaries throughout the country with access to \nboth traditional Medicare and Medicare+Choice plans.\n  Unfortunately, it has not worked out that way. For a variety of \nreasons, the companies responsible for these plans found that they \ncould not offer services in all areas.\n  Not surprisingly, many of the communities that were left without \naccess to these HMOs are in rural areas.\n  I am particularly sensitive to this, because Utah is one of those \nStates in which the Medicare+Choice plan operated for one year and then \nchose to discontinue.\n  This was a great disappointment to all--beneficiaries, the provider, \nand the Government alike.\n  So I, among all others, find it completely understandable that there \nmay be a question about whether the plans will be available in rural \ncommunities.\n  I have a simple answer to that question. The new private drug plans \ncreated in A. 1 are completely different from the Medicare+Choice \nmodel.\n  We have learned from our experience with Medicare+Choice and we have \nworked to ensure we do not repeat past mistakes.\n  Let me take this opportunity to explain how the program will work.\n  Our legislation establishes a new Center for Medicare Choices within \nthe Department of Health and Human Services. This new Center will be \nheaded by an administrator who will oversee both the new drug plan and \nthe new Medicare Advantage program.\n  To operate the prescription drug plan, the new administrator will \ncreate at least 10 regions throughout the country. These regions must \nbe at least the size of a State.\n  If beneficiaries remain in the traditional Medicare program, they may \nreceive pharmaceutical assistance through a new stand-alone program \ncertified by the Government to provide coverage in that region. S. 1 \nrequires that at least two stand-alone drug plans would be offered to \nMedicare beneficiaries in each region.\n\n  Now some may ask, ``How does that ensure rural Medicare beneficiaries \nwill have access to prescription drugs distributed by private \ncompanies? How is this different from the Medicare+Choice HMOs?''\n  The answer is this.\n  The Medicare+Choice program is organized by counties. In other words, \nMedicare+Choice plans can choose to offer coverage in one county, but \nnot in another.\n  These plans may ``cherry pick,'' or choose to operate in the more \nlucrative areas, ignoring the less profitable ones. For example, they \ncan offer coverage in suburban counties where the cost of doing \nbusiness might be lower or in counties where, for one reason or \nanother, Medicare beneficiaries are healthier.\n  Under the new program, plans offering stand-alone prescription drug \ncoverage will not be able to cherry pick in this way, because they must \noperate in all areas of a much larger region.\n  If a plan wants to offer coverage in Salt Lake City, it will be \nrequired to offer coverage in St. George, Moab, Beaver, Vernal, and \nGreen River. In order to provide coverage in Salt Lake City, a plan \nwill be required to offer coverage in every county and every community \nand to every Medicare beneficiary in Utah. That is true of other states \nand their rural problems as well. I am naturally talking about my own \nhome State of Utah but it applies throughout the country.\n  We envision these regions, in many cases, encompassing more than one \nstate, and combining rural areas and urban areas.\n  Medicare+Choice does not work this way. And so, we have designed the \nplans envisioned under S. 1 based on the lessons learned with \nMedicare+Choice.\n\n[[Page S7973]]\n\n  Another criticism some in this body have voiced relates to the \nconcern that prescription drugs might be available in a predominantly \nrural region, but with higher premiums for Medicare beneficiaries \nliving in rural areas.\n  Once again, the concept of regions addresses this issue. Plans will \nbe required to charge the same premium for an option throughout the \nregion.\n  Let me add, however, that this does not ensure premiums will be \nidentical between regions.\n  This important issue was raised during the Finance Committee's \nconsideration of this legislation by my friend and colleague, Senator \nOlympia Snowe.\n  In order to address this very valid concern, our legislation gives \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services the discretion to make \nadjustments in geographic regions so there will not be a large \ndiscrepancy in Medicare prescription drug premiums across the country.\n  Other may wonder why we establish regions at all. Why not have a \nsingle premium throughout the country and private entities would bid to \nprovide prescription drugs nationwide?\n  One reason we did choose this approach is that only a few private \nentities are currently able to provide nationwide coverage. Limiting \ncompetition to those few companies would neither ensure beneficiaries \nthe best prescription drug prices nor a significant choice among \ncoverage options.\n  The approach we have chosen is one that ensures beneficiaries will \nhave access to prescription drug coverage. It provides for competition, \nand minimizes regional differences in beneficiary premium costs.\n  But some may still wonder whether private plans will choose to enter \npredominantly rural States or regions?\n  My Finance Committee colleagues and I have worked hard to ensure that \nplans have the appropriate incentives to participate in all 50 states.\n  Even so, no one can guarantee with complete certainty that private \nprescription drug plans will choose to operate in all of the States all \nof the time.\n  For this reason, we worked very hard to make certain there is a \nsafety net, a ``fallback'' plan that would provide seniors with the \ncoverage they need in the event only one or even no private sector \nplans enter a region.\n  If only one plan, or even if no plans, are willing to offer stand-\nalone prescription drug coverage within a region, the government will \nenter into an annual contract with an entity to provide a prescription \ndrug fallback plan.\n  This fallback plan would be given a one year contract to offer the \nstandard drug plan to all Medicare Part D beneficiaries in the region. \nThe fallback plan will be an insurance policy provided by the federal \ngovernment to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries in rural communities \nhave prescription drug coverage available in the event that private \nplans are slow to begin providing service in their area.\n  Some in this body argue that if the fallback option is so attractive \nwe should make it available all the time to anyone who wants it. \nIndeed, these colleagues argue that this so-called ``permanent \nfallback'' should be offered to beneficiaries in addition to the \nprivate stand-alone drug plans that would be offered to those Medicare \nbeneficiaries remaining in traditional Medicare.\n  While this may sound attractive at first, it is not.\n  Making the fallback plan a permanent option will undermine the very \nstructure upon which we have built S. 1.\n  Not only would it drastically increase costs--thus pushing the bill \nover the $400 billion 10-year limit--it would also be a disincentive \nfor private plans to enter the market.\n  I will oppose any amendment that will make the fallback plan \npermanent.\n  First and foremost, including a permanent fallback plan creates an \nuneven playing field.\n  The government fallback is a non-risk bearing entity which means that \nit will operate in regions without any risk for gains or losses. The \ngovernment pays the fallback plan for the administrative costs \nassociated with delivering the drug benefit.\n  If we make the fallback plan permanent, we are basically requiring \nprivately delivered drug plans, which are at least partially \nresponsible for bearing the risk of delivering this benefit, to enter \nthis same market and compete with these government fallback plans.\n  I think this is not only unfair, but it also sets up our drug plan \nfor failure. There isn't a private health plan out there that will \nenter such a lopsided market where we give their competitors such a \nlarge financial advantage.\n  In addition, including a permanent fallback plan will add billions of \ndollars to the cost of this bill because we will be relying, at least \npartially, on an inefficient, more costly government-style delivery \nsystem to provide beneficiaries with drug coverage.\n  When the Senate was debating the Medicare prescription drug issue \nlast year, this was one of the biggest criticisms against the drug \nbenefit plan offered by our colleague from Florida, Senator Graham.\n  The Graham drug benefit plan created a one-size-fits-all drug benefit \ndelivered by the federal government. This is not what Medicare \nbeneficiaries want. Beneficiaries want choice in drug coverage. They do \nnot want to be forced into government-run plans and offered a one-size \nfits all benefit.\n  The intent of S. 1 is to introduce a new model to deliver care to \nMedicare beneficiaries.\n  We are harnessing the efficiencies and quality of a private-delivery \nsystem in order to offer Medicare beneficiaries a meaningful drug \nbenefit. This drug benefit will include multiple choices, but it only \nworks when all options are expected to participate under the same \nrules.\n  In S. 1, we included the government fallback as a safety net to \nensure that every senior or disabled beneficiary has access to \nprescription drug coverage, but it is a fallback of last resort. And \nthat is because even the Congressional Budget Office estimates that it \nis a more costly, less efficient model to deliver care.\n  I urge my colleagues to remember these points when the Senate \nconsiders an amendment that would make the fallback plan a permanent \noption under the stand-alone drug plans.\n  Let me make one thing perfectly clear. The stand-along benefit \noffered under Medicare Part D will not be the only way in which \nMedicare beneficiaries in rural areas can obtain prescription drug \ncoverage.\n  In addition, the Medicare Advantage plans--including the current HMOs \nand new preferred provider organizations, called PPOs--will offer \nbeneficiaries comprehensive, integrated coverage, including coverage \nfor hospital services, outpatient care, and prescription drugs.\n  Private sector entities will bid to become one of three PPO plans in \na region.\n  And, HMOs can continue to contract to provide all Medicare services--\nincluding drugs--for a county.\n  My Finance Committee colleagues and I have worked very hard to \nprovide appropriate incentives to encourage the preferred provider \norganizations to participate in every region and in every State, \nwhether they are predominantly rural or urban. However, if for some \nreason, PPOs decide not to bid in a specific region, the beneficiaries \nin these regions still will have the option to obtain prescription drug \ncoverage through traditional Medicare and the new Medicare Part D plans \nthat I described earlier.\n  The bill that we approved in committee provides options for Medicare \nbeneficiaries in urban and rural areas to obtain prescription drugs \nthrough traditional Medicare and the new Part D prescription drug \nprogram, or through the new Medicare Advantage program with its \ncomprehensive health care coverage plans.\n  Furthermore, the ``Prescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act of \n2003'' ensures all Medicare beneficiaries that prescription drug \ncoverage will be available even if private entities are unable to \nprovide the coverage in their region.\n  This legislation is preferable to previous bills we have considered, \nbecause it provides Medicare beneficiaries with more choices and more \ncomprehensive coverage. It provides private entities with more \nincentives to cover rural communities, and it assures Medicare \nbeneficiaries who live in those rural communities that they will have \naccess to prescription drug coverage.\n  Just think of what we are doing here. We have a drug benefit that \nwill begin\n\n[[Page S7974]]\n\nJanuary 1, 2006, and it is a voluntary program.\n  We will issue a prescription drug card which will be offered to \nbeneficiaries from January 1, 2004, through at least January 1, 2006, 6 \nmonths after the prescription drug benefit plan is implemented. The \nprescription drug plan will be implemented on January 1, 2004.\n  The drug benefit with the Medicare Part D is a Medicare Program. At \nleast two stand-alone drug plans must be offered in each region. All \nMedicare beneficiaries will be able to participate. Those who remain in \ntraditional Medicare will have a drug benefit equal to those who go \ninto the new Medicare Advantage Program, formerly known as \nMedicare+Choice. Beneficiaries will be offered either standard drug \ncoverage or drug coverage that is an actuarial equivalent to the \nstandard drug plan. Either drug plan will be available to those \nremaining in traditional Medicare or those who begin the Medicare \nAdvantage Program, this new program.\n  The national average of monthly premiums for the drug benefit will be \n$35 per month in 2006. All drug plans will have mandatory deductibles \nand beneficiary out-of-pocket cost-sharing limits.\n  Every beneficiary will have a choice between three prescription drug \nplans. The Medicare Advantage Program will offer either a PPO option or \nan HMO option. A stand-alone drug benefit will be offered to \nbeneficiaries remaining in traditional Medicare. A maximum of three \nMedicare Advantage PPO plans will be offered per region. They will \ncompete for the opportunity and the privilege of serving the people in \nthat particular region. Health and Human Services will certify all of \nthese drug plans before they are offered to Medicare beneficiaries. In \nany event, they will be offered to all Medicare beneficiaries, seniors \nand disabled.\n  I was a member of the tripartisan group last year that put forth the \ntripartisan plan. Had we not done that, we wouldn't be as far along \ntoday as we are. I have to say I was proud to be a member of that \ntripartisan plan, along with Senators Grassley, Snowe, Breaux, and \nJeffords. There were five of us. We took on that assignment, and we \ncame up with a lot of ideas that have been improved upon in this bill. \nThis was a very important bill.\n  There is no easy solution in these areas. In spite of the desire of \nsome to have simple private sector solutions, those are not in the \ncards with the votes we have in the Senate today or in the near future, \nI have to say as well.\n\n  This bill is as close as we can go towards having two completely \ndifferent but nevertheless useful options: traditional Medicare for \nthose who do not want to leave, but this new Medicare Advantage for \nthose who really want to try something different where they may have \nadvantageous benefits over time.\n  We believe the competition fostered by this bill is going to be good \ncompetition, that it should help to keep costs down. But, most \nimportantly, we believe all seniors should have a right to prescription \ndrug benefits, and this plan will give it to them.\n  We will have lots of crying and moaning and groaning about different \nideas around here, some of which I might like just as much as what we \nhave in here, but we could not get them done. So we have come together \nin the art of the doable to get a bill that literally gives both sides \nof these options a chance to be able to excel and do better for our \nsenior citizens. That is important. That is real important. This bill \nis important. It is the first time in history we have done this. \nFrankly, a $400 billion bill over 10 years is a very important bill \nthat will do an awful lot of good for our seniors and for those who \nreally are hard up in our society and for those who have to do without \nfood or split their pills or do any number of things in order to be \nable to get the medications they need.\n  I am proud of this bill. Each one of us probably could, if we were \ndictators, come up with what we think might even be a better bill. But, \nfortunately, that isn't the way this representative republic works. We \nhave to work within the framework of the Congress. Sometimes that is a \nmessy, mixed up, sometimes very inefficient method of legislating, but, \nin the end, this country has survived because we have the greatest form \nof government in the history of the world. And this process, as sloppy \nas it might be from time to time is bringing about a bill that will do \nan awful lot of good for an awful lot of seniors in our society at a \ntime when they need it the most.\n  I just hope we can reduce the number of amendments and get this bill \npassed as soon as we can, get together with the House in a conference, \nand, of course, come up with a final package that, hopefully, will even \nbe improved that will take us throughout this next century in a way \nthat will protect our seniors and those who have suffered for want of \npharmaceutical prescription drugs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander).

Mr. President, Secretary of State Colin Powell is in \nPhnom Penh, Cambodia, for an annual ASEAN meeting. There are many \nissues he needs to pursue with ASEAN members, including, most urgently, \nsupport for the struggle for freedom in Burma.\n  Also pressing is the fate of democracy in Cambodia. Secretary Powell\n\n[[Page S7975]]\n\nmust be clear to all Cambodian democrats that the United States stands \nfirmly and publicly with them in our common cause of democracy and the \nrule of law. Secretary Powell should make it a point to meet with the \ndemocrats during his short stay in Phnom Penh.\n  It is in America's national interest, and that of Cambodia, that new \nleadership--firmly committed to transparency, accountability and \njustice--is elected in upcoming parliamentary elections next month.\n  The ruling Cambodian People's Party, CPP, and its earlier \nmanifestations have had an opportunity--nearly a quarter of a century--\nto develop that country. Their records is unimpressive, at best. Crimes \nare committed with impunity, corruption is endemic and extends to the \nhighest office, and lawlessness provides a breeding ground for \nterrorism and other criminal activities.\n  Under CPP Prime Minister Hun Sen's leadership, opposition rallies \nhave been attacked by grenade-throwing terrorists, a coalition \ngovernment disintegrated in a coup d'etat, and government-paid \ngangsters, the Pagoda Boys, caused $50 million worth of damage in anti-\nThai riots that were fueled by Hun Sen's reckless nationalistic \ncomments.\n  Secretary Powell should temper his comments praising the Cambodian \nGovernment for cracking down on terrorism. The reason terrorists are on \nCambodian soil is because of the very lawlessness perpetuated by the \nCPP. Hun Sen has swatted a few flies recently, but is directly \nresponsible for leaving the screen door wide open. A more serious \nresponse to terrorism in the region is freedom and the rule of law for \nthe Cambodian people.\n  While in Phnom Penh, Secretary Powell must push for free and fair \nelections in July. Opposition parties must not be denied access to \nmedia or the ability to conduct rallies, demonstrations, and other \nforms of free expression. Secretary Powell must make clear to Hun Sen \nthat a single, additional political killing is one too many, and that \nthe election will be judged by international standards--which, contrary \nto the Prime Minister's thinking, is not reserved only for sports \ncompetition.\n  Let me close by saying that it has come to my attention that the \nASEAN meeting is taking place at the Intercontinental Hotel, which is \nowned by Theng Bunma--a suspected Cambodian drug king pin and self-\ndescribed financier of the 1997 coup. This epitomizes all that is wrong \nin Cambodia today.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a letter from Cambodian opposition leader \nSam Rainsy to Secretary Powell calling for Suu Kyi's immediate release \nbe printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                          Kingdom of Cambodia,\n\n                                                    June 13, 2002.\n     Colin L. Powell,\n     Secretary of State,\n     U.S. Department of State, Washington, DC.\n     c/o HE Mr. Charles Ray,\n     U.S. Ambassador,\n     U.S. Embassy, Phnom-Penh, Cambodia.\n       Dear Secretary Powell: I would like to take this \n     opportunity to express my appreciation for your statement \n     calling for the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi and \n     increased pressure on Burma's military junta. The struggle \n     led by Suu Kyi is an inspiration to all those who live in \n     fear under repressive regimes, and to those who fight \n     everyday for freedom and democracy. I proudly join you in the \n     call for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and hope that you \n     will use the opportunity of your visit to Cambodia for the \n     ASEAN Regional Forum to press for an end to the suffering of \n     the Burmese people.\n       The fate of Aung Sun Suu Kyi and Burma's democracy is \n     indelibly linked to the future success of the ASEAN region. \n     The transition from communism and military dictatorship to \n     democracy would bring untold political, economic and cultural \n     benefits to one of the most diverse and potentially dynamic \n     regions in the world. In this context your statement that \n     those who oppress democracy must not be allowed to prevail \n     has particular resonance.\n       In Cambodia, we are struggling to end endemic poverty, \n     reduce appalling illiteracy rates and to provide basic \n     nutritional needs to our children. This struggle is made all \n     the more difficult by a government more committed to \n     consolidating its own power than to the welfare of its \n     people. While offering a facade of progress and stability to \n     donors and the international community, the government has \n     used fear and violence to support a lucrative patronage \n     system, exploit our natural resources and suppress opposition \n     voices. It was just today that the latest victim, a garment \n     worker protesting low wages and poor factory conditions, was \n     shot and killed by government riot police as they cracked \n     down on a peaceful demonstration.\n       Unlike in Burma, the Cambodian people will have the \n     opportunity to go to the polls in July to change their \n     leadership. They must be allowed to do so in an environment \n     free from fear and intimidation. But already we have seen \n     that the current government is willing to sue the tools of \n     fear and violence to suppress the Cambodian people's desire \n     for freedom and democracy. This year's electoral process is \n     already flawed by biased elections commission, restrictions \n     on voter registration, restrictive media access and ongoing \n     intimidation of opposition activists. The potential for \n     democracy in Cambodia is being thwarted by this government \n     and it must realize that, ``its actions will not be allowed \n     to stand.''\n       As you prepare to participate in the ASEAN Regional Forum \n     in Phnom Penh next week, I trust that you will continue to \n     provide a strong and leading voice for the release of Aung \n     San Suu Kyi. At the same time, I ask that you use the same \n     strong voice to advocate for credible elections in Cambodia--\n     elections that reflect the true will of the Cambodian people.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   Sam Rainsy,\n\n                               Leader of Parliamentary Opposition,\n     Kingdom of Cambodia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/17/senate-section/article/S7975-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7975-S7976]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNITED SERVICES ORGANIZATION\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to pay tribute \nto the United Services Organization for two vivid recent examples of \nthe legendary support and assistance that it provides for the families \nof members of our Armed Forces when their loved ones are serving away \nfrom home.\n  The USO is rightly renowned for the joy, the comfort, and the \nhappiness it has brought to our troops and their families over the \nyears. It is truly an American treasure, as it has shown once again in \nits extraordinary support for two Massachusetts families during the \nrecent war in Iraq.\n  Under the leadership of executive director Alice Harkins, the USO of \nNew England came to the aid of Sergeant Vanessa Turner who became \ncritically ill in Iraq while serving in Operation Enduring Freedom. \nUpon the onset of her illness, SGT Turner was flown back to Germany and \nto the community she left. Sergeant Turner's 15-year-old daughter \nBrittany was left in Germany while her mother was deployed to Iraq. \nBrittany remained strong, finishing the school year while visiting her \nmother in the hospital in Landstuhl, Germany. SGT Turner's family in \nRoxbury, MA, was desperate to fly to her bedside and to comfort \nBrittany. The USO of New England came to the rescue, arranging for SGT \nTurner's mother, sister, and brother to fly to Landstuhl, Germany. \nAccording to Alice Harkins, this was ``an easy request. Their children \nare our responsibility; if the service members know that the community \nis taking care of their children, then they can relax.''\n  In the second case, the Armours family in Athol, MA, was devastated \nto learn that Specialist Jamvis Armours had been critically wounded in \nIraq and had been flown to the Washington Hospital Center in \nWashington, DC. Problems arose in getting SP Armours' wife and children \nto the hospital. Again, the USO came to the rescue. They assisted the \nfamily financially and emotionally, and Alice Harkins actually drove \nfrom Boston toward Athol to see them and to ensure that they had all \nthey needed for the trip. Going the extra mile is what makes the USO so \nwidely admired throughout our country and by all the members of our \nArmed Forces wherever they serve.\n  I commend the USO of New England in all it does so well, and for \ndemonstrating in these two cases that its helping hand is always there \nwhen its help is needed most.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, since its inception, the United \nService Organization what we all know as the USO has worked to bring a \npiece of home to the members of our armed forces wherever they may find \nthemselves. From Bob Hope's legendary tours to the latest cyber-\ncanteens that allow service members to stay in contact with family and \nfriends via email, the USO works tirelessly to provide simple pleasures \nto those who venture into harm's way.\n\n[[Page S7976]]\n\n  As the population of the armed forces has changed, so too have the \nservices offered by the USO. Today, this great organization provides \nchildcare services for kids whose parents are deployed, travel \nassistance for the family of wounded service members, prepaid phone \ncards, the ever-popular celebrity tours, and countless other services \nfor our troops and their families.\n  Recently, my staff and the staff of Senator Kennedy had very close \ncontact with the personnel and services of the USO through its New \nEngland offices in Boston. Several weeks ago, our staff was contacted \nby the family of an American soldier who had become gravely ill in \nIraq. She had been evacuated to the American hospital at Landstuhl, \nGermany, where doctors determined she was near death. She was so ill \nthat her doctors ordered her medically retired, making her daughter \neligible for retirement benefits. But that reclassification also meant \nthat the Army could no longer pay for her family's travel to Germany to \nbe at her bedside. That decision, made for all the right reasons, had \nthe unintentional and regrettable consequence of bringing only more \ngrief to a family already grappling with the prospect of losing their \nloved one.\n  And that is when USO-New England and its director, Alice Harkins, got \ninvolved. When the situation was explained to her, Alice replied \nsimply, ``We're going to do this. This is why we exist.'' And, as \npromised, the USO-New England found the money and paid for the \nsoldier's family to travel to Germany.\n  Alice Harkins and her capable staff at USO-New England represent the \nbest of us. Through their vigorous efforts, their determination, and \ntheir simple desire to help those who serve in our military, they \ninspire us all. They are people who recognize what's right, and who \nshow their love of country and their love for those who serve with \ndeeds as well as words.\n  The USO receives no financial support from the U.S. Government. Its \nsuccess is due to the countless volunteers who contribute time and \nenergy for the men and women of the Armed Forces in times of war and \npeace and the generosity of sponsors who make its operation possible.\n  I know I express the sentiment of the Senate and current and former \nmembers of the Armed Forces when I say thank you, USO, for your efforts \nto bring a slice of home to those on the frontlines and for remembering \ntheir families while they are away. We should all aspire to make such a \ncontribution. Fortunately, the people of the USO, people like Alice \nHarkins, do. And we can all be grateful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/17/senate-section/article/S7976-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7976]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I speak about the need for hate crimes \nlegislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I introduced the Local \nLaw Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new categories to current \nhate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in \nGermantown, MD. A 16-year-old Arab-American girl was physically \nattacked by a group of unknown young adults on the Campus of Montgomery \nCollege on September 14, 2001. This was the first of three hate crimes \ntargeting the student and her family. On September 21, her family was \nout driving when unknown assailants threw a firecracker in front of \ntheir car. On September 28, vandals smashed the rear window of the \nfamily's minivan while it was parked in front of their home.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/17/senate-section/article/S7976-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7976]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RALLY AGAINST HATE\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge the efforts of \nmy colleagues and many others participating in the Rally Against Hate \non Capitol Hill today.\n  The rally has been organized by Senators Edward Kennedy and Gordon \nSmith, along with the Human Rights Campaign and its coalition partners, \nto show support and build momentum for passage of Federal hate crimes \nlegislation, ``The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act.''\n  Also participating in the rally today is a very brave and amazing \nconstituent of mine, Trev Broudy. Trev is a handsome 34-year old actor \nfrom West Hollywood, CA, and he is also the victim of a hate crime \nmotivated by his sexual orientation.\n  On September 1, 2003, Trev was hugging and saying goodbye to his \nfriend, Teddy Ulett, on the street in West Hollywood when two men \njumped out of a car without warning and began swinging at Trev's head \nwith a baseball bat and an iron pipe.\n  After the attack, Trev was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center \nwhere doctors cleaned away pieces of skull from the back of his head \nand pieced together other parts of skull that had been crushed. He was \nthen placed in an induced coma for over a week to guard against \nswelling of his brain.\n  Today, Trev looks and sounds fine, although he will never fully \nrecover from the attack. He has said, ``People assume because I look \nall right and I'm healthy and I'm walking and I'm talking, I'm all \nbetter, but I'm not.''\n  When Trev finally left the hospital--10 weeks after the attack--he \nthought his injuries would eventually heal and he would soon return to \nwork. However, Trev belatedly learned that a major part of his brain \nhad to be removed, leaving him with only half the vision in both of his \neyes.\n  Once having a good career as a voice-over artist, Trev now struggles \nwith the results of his injuries every day and finds it difficult to \nread even the simplest sentence. He has returned home to his old \napartment, but he will never be able to return to his old life.\n  Yet Trev is an inspiration and a hero to his family and friends back \nhome, and particularly to other gay men and lesbians who see this \nheinous crime as a personal attack on their community.\n  Los Angeles' gay and lesbian community even came together and \nprotested the county district attorney's decision not to file hate \ncrime charges against the men suspected of beating Trev. Although the \nWest Hollywood sheriff's station, which investigated the case, \ninitially filed State hate crime charges, the district attorney's \noffice chose not to file hate crimes enhancements in the case.\n  And, unfortunately, the limitations of current Federal hate crimes \nlaw prevent it from helping Trev because it does not extend basic civil \nrights protections to every American--only to a few and under certain \ncircumstances.\n  Congress should expand the ability of the Federal Government to \ninvestigate hate crimes, and it should expand the ability to prosecute \nanyone who would target victims because of hate.\n  We can, and must, do more to prevent these types of hateful threats \nand acts of violence, and passing The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement \nAct would do just that.\n  The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act would: expand current \nFederal protections against hate crimes based on race, religion, and \nnational origin; amend the criminal code to cover hate crimes based on \ngender, sexual orientation, and disability; authorize grants for State \nand local programs designed to combat and prevent hate crimes; and \nenable the Federal Government to assist State and local law enforcement \nin investigating and prosecuting hate crimes.\n  Enacting the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act is long overdue. \nIt is necessary for the safety and well-being of millions of Americans. \nUntil it is enacted, many hate crime victims and their families may not \nreceive the justice they deserve.\n  Efforts to enact this legislation have received strong bipartisan \nsupport in the past, and the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act now \nhas 48 cosponsors in the Senate. We just have not been able to get it \nto the President's desk for consideration.\n  Today, I ask all of my colleagues to rally against hate by working to \nensure that this legislation is not simply supported but actually \npassed and signed into law. Let us send a message to all Americans that \nwe will no longer turn a blind eye to hate crimes in this country.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/17/senate-section/article/S7977-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7977]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S7977]]\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO GREG BUCKNER\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I honor and pay tribute to one of \nKentucky's finer athletes. Greg Buckner, a Hopkinsville native, was \ninducted into the Kentucky All-Star Hall of Fame for his distinguished \naccomplishments as a basketball player throughout his high school, \ncollege, and professional careers.\n  As a member of the University Heights Academy basketball team from \n1991-1994, Greg led the Blazers to numerous victories including their \nfirst State basketball title in 1992 and a game winning record of 30-6 \nhis senior year. At the completion of Greg's high school career, he \nparticipated in the Kentucky-Indiana High School All-Star Game. Greg \ndistinguished himself in this contest relieving the Kentucky team of a \n54-39 halftime deficit during the first of two games. Unfortunately, \nKentucky lost that first game but would redeem itself later during the \nsecond game held in Indianapolis. Greg not only relieved Kentucky of a \n16 point halftime deficit but made a jump shot with 6.5 seconds \nremaining to win the game, 75-73.\n  The experience of the Kentucky-Indiana High School All-Star game \nwould benefit Greg Buckner for many years to come. Greg embraced the \nhigh demands inherent of the all-star game demonstrating the mental and \nphysical abilities necessary to achieve success at the college and \nprofessional levels of basketball. It was no surprise that Greg's \nleadership benefitted Clemson during his college career culminating \nwith a trip to the Elite Eight during the 1998 NCAA Tournament. Upon \nbeing drafted by the Dallas Mavericks, Greg established himself as a \nstrong defensive player and valuable rebounder. He is now a member of \nthe Philadelphia 76ers.\n  I am proud of Greg Buckner for his dedication and achievements on and \noff the court. His example of devotion, teamwork and leadership should \nbe emulated by athletes throughout Kentucky and across America. I thank \nthe Senate for allowing me to recognize Greg and voice his \npraises.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/17/senate-section/article/S7977-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7977]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n IN RECOGNITION OF THE 88th ANNIVERSARY OF THE ASBESTOS WORKERS LOCAL \n                                 No. 42\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \n88th anniversary of the Asbestos Workers Local No. 42. The \nInternational Association of Heat and Frost Insulators and Asbestos \nWorkers and the Local 42 have fought for better working conditions, \nhealth protection, employee rights, and to garner better wages for \ntheir members. They should be recognized for the work that they do.\n  The International Association of Heat and Frost Insulators and \nAsbestos Workers Union dates back to the late 1800s and the emergence \nof steam power. The expanded use of steam power during this era had a \nprofound effect on the industrial sector leading to better heated and \nmore efficient factories and plants, improved working conditions, and \nthe creation of thousands of new manufacturing jobs.\n  The widespread use of steam power also created an entirely new \nindustry--the insulation industry. Skilled insulation mechanics were \nneeded to insulate steam boilers in an effort to conserve the precious \nenergy being piped to residential and industrial facilities. The \ninsulation mechanics who provided this craftsmanship worked almost \ntotally without organized representation. By the end of the 19th \ncentury, a few localized associations attempted to look after the \ninterests of their members in specific cities.\n  The first attempt to form a national bond between insulators \nassociations came in 1900, when the Salamander Association of New York \nsent out an appeal to related crafts in other cities to form a \n``National Organization of Pipe and Boiler Covers.'' The initial appeal \ndid spark interest, and 2 years later a much more decisive action was \ntaken by the officers and members of the Pipe Cover's Union, of St. \nLouis, MO.\n  The St. Louis group sent out an announcement that it had affiliated \nwith the National Building Trades Council of America, and invited other \npipe coverer unions and related trades to join with them in the pursuit \nof better working conditions, pay that was commensurate with their \nskills, and the strength that comes from unity. The first appeal of \nunity was sent to targeted cities where other asbestos workers already \nwere enjoying the benefits of union affiliation such as New York, \nChicago, Cleveland, and Detroit. In all, seven local unions from around \nthe Nation responded favorably, and the hard work of laying the \nfoundation for an international union was begun.\n  With the St. Louis union leading the way, the interested locals met \nfor their first convention on July 7, 1903, in the city of St. Louis. \nThe results of that inaugural convention were impressive; a \nconstitution was drafted and approved; bylaws were adopted; the first \npresident was elected, Thomas Kennedy from Chicago; and a formal name \nwas adopted, the National Association of Heat, Frost and General \nInsulators and Asbestos Workers of America. On September 22, 1903, the \nAmerican Federation of Labor issued an official charter designating the \nAsbestos Workers as a national union.\n  The goals of the new International Union were spelled out in the \ncharter: ``The object of the International Association of Heat and \nFrost Insulators and Asbestos Workers shall be to assist its membership \nin securing employment, to defend their rights, and advance their \ninterests as working men; and by education and cooperation raise them \nto that position in society to which they are justly entitled.'' Since \nthat time, leaders of the International Union took this objective to \ngrow this small group of local unions to over 120 local unions and a \nmembership in excess of 20,000.\n  On July 16, 1915, General President Joseph Mullaney organized and \ndelivered Local Charter No. 42 to the Wilmington, DE, Asbestos Workers. \nTemporary officers were elected and on July 26, 1915, forty permanent \nofficers were elected. Mr. R.E. Mahan was elected as president and N.K. \nWhaler was elected as secretary. Meetings were held at the Irish-\nAmerican Hall on French Street every Monday. Local No. 42 began with \njust thirty members in 1915, with wages averaging $0.32 per hour.\n  After World War II, the International Union's growth and prosperity \nwas tempered by frightening new evidence that confirmed long-held \nsuspicions by the International Union's leadership. Workers who were \nexposed to asbestos died in disproportionate numbers from cancer. Since \nthis evidence was proven, the union has fought for passage of new \nsafety and health laws to help protect its members as well as the \npublic. The Environmental Protection Agency has banned the use of \nasbestos in the insulation industry in the United States. It has also \nbeen banned from use in many other products as well. The International \nUnion continues to provide its members with education and training with \nthe latest state-of-the-art work practices in the handling of any and \nall materials used in the industry.\n  Since 1915, Local No. 42 has grown to include some 130 active members \nand approximately 100 retired members. Today, the president, Jeff \nSmith, helps lead the way in protecting asbestos workers' rights as \nwell as their health.\n  Through its long and proud history, the Asbestos Workers \nInternational Union and Local No. 42 have never shied away from \nadversity or allowed negative factors to impede the achievement of \nthose admirable goals set out in the international charter of 1910. \nThrough the determination and commitment of their leaders and members, \nthe International Union and Local #42 continues to strive for \nemployment opportunities, equality in the work place, continuing \neducation, and the safety and well being of the membership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/17/senate-section/article/S7977-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7977-S7978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MASTER SERGEANT ANTHONY PRYOR\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I honor and pay tribute to one of \nour Nation's most courageous and admirable heroes. MSG Anthony Pryor, \nstationed at Fort Campbell, KY, was awarded the Silver Star for his \nrole in a deadly battle in Afghanistan last year. The Silver Star is \nthe third highest military honor, given for valor and gallantry in \ncombat. The inimitable leadership and bravery of MSG Pryor deserves \ncommendation of the highest regard.\n  On January 25, 2002, MSG Pryor and four other soldiers of the 5th \nSpecial\n\n[[Page S7978]]\n\nForces Group were deployed north of Kandahar for a night mission. While \nal-Qaida and Taliban fighters slept, they were assigned to take over an \nold schoolhouse building serving as an enemy compound. The mission \nturned deadly when the enemies awoke and began to shoot, compelling MSG \nPryor and his team to return fire.\n  During the battle MSG Pryor was hit in the shoulder and fell to the \nground, losing his night vision goggles. In the hand-to-hand combat \nthat ensued in the dark, MSG Pryor managed to kill his attacker. A \ntotal of 21 Taliban and al-Qaida soldiers were killed, and one was \ndetained. Most importantly, none of the Special Forces soldiers were \nkilled.\n  In a ceremony delayed for over a year because of his deployment to \nIraq, MSG Pryor exhibited unparalleled humility. Throughout the battle \nhis concern was primarily for the welfare of his fellow soldiers, and \nthis sentiment is echoed in MSG Pryor's insistence that the Silver Star \naward be a reflection of the deeds of the entire company.\n  MSG Anthony Pryor is a paragon of honor, bravery, and valor. His \nremarkable service to this country should be admired by all Americans. \nHe is a tribute to the U.S. Army and Fort Campbell. I thank the Senate \nfor allowing me to recognize MSG Pryor and extol his praises.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/17/senate-section/article/S7978-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:20 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 703, An act to designate the regional headquarters \n     building for the National Park Service under construction in \n     Omaha, Nebraska, as the ``Carl T.

A bill to enhance the criminal penalties for illegal \ntrafficking of archaeological resources, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Enhanced \nProtection of Our Cultural Heritage Act. This legislation was reported \nlast year by the Energy Committee, and I hope that this year it will \nbecome law. The bill would increase the maximum penalties for \nviolations of three existing statutes that protect the cultural and \narchaeological history of the American people, particularly Native \nAmericans. The United States Sentencing Commission asked Congress last \nyear to make these statutory changes, which would complement the \nCommission's strengthening of Federal sentencing\n\n[[Page S7982]]\n\nguidelines to ensure more stringent penalties for criminals who steal \nfrom our public lands. Senator Inouye joins me as a cosponsor.\n  This bill will increase the maximum penalties for the Archaeological \nResources Protection Act, ARPA, 16 USC Sec. 470ee, the Native American \nGraves Protection and Repatriation Act, NAGPRA, 18 USC Sec. 1170, and \nfor 18 USC Sec. 1163, which prohibits theft from Indian Tribal \nOrganizations. All three statutes currently impose a 5-year maximum \nsentence, and each includes a lower maximum for a first offense of the \nstatute and/or a violation of the statute involving property of less \nthan a specified value. This bill would create a 10-year maximum \nsentence for each statute. In response to comments from the \nadministration last year, the bill retains misdemeanor offenses for \nrelatively minor offenses.\n  The increased maximum sentences would be consistent with similar \nFederal statutes. For example, the 1994 law proscribing museum theft \ncarries a 10-year maximum sentence, as do the general statutes \npunishing theft and the destruction of Government property. Moreover, \nincreasing the maximum sentences will give judges and the Sentencing \nCommission greater discretion to impose punishments appropriate to the \namount of destruction a defendant has done.\n  Making these changes will also enable the Sentencing Commission's \n2002 sentencing guidelines to be fully implemented. The Commission has \nincreased sentencing guidelines for cultural heritage crimes, but the \nstatutory maximum penalties contained in current law will prevent \njudges from issuing sentences in the upper range of the new guidelines. \nThe 2002 guidelines had the enthusiastic support of the Justice and \nInterior Departments, the Society for American Archeology, the National \nTrust for Historic Preservation, numerous Native American nations, and \nmany others. Congress should take the steps necessary to see the \nguidelines take full effect.\n  Two of the three laws this bill amends protect Native American lands \nand property. The third, ARPA, protects both public and Indian lands, \nand provides significant protection to my State of Vermont. For \nexample, ARPA can be used to prosecute those who would steal artifacts \nfrom the wrecked military vessels at the bottom of Lake Champlain that \ndate to the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. U.S. Attorneys can \nalso use ARPA to prosecute criminals who take items that are at least \n100 years old from a protected site on Vermont state property without a \npermit, and then transport those goods into another state. In addition, \nARPA protects artifacts found on the approximately 5 percent of Vermont \nland that is Federal property, land that includes many ``ghost towns'' \nthat have long been abandoned but are an important part of our history.\n  Those who would pillage the rich cultural heritage of this nation and \nits people are committing serious crimes. These artifacts are the \nlegacy of all Americans and should not be degraded as garage sale \ncommodities or as fodder for private enrichment.\n  I would like to thank a number of people for their help and advice \nabout this legislation. Charlie Tetzlaff, as well as the rest of the \nstaff at the Sentencing Commission, helped us understand the importance \nof this issue, and made protecting our cultural heritage a priority \nwhen he served as United States Attorney for Vermont. Art Cohn, the \ndirector of the Lake Champlain Maritime Museum, and Giovanna Peebles, \nVermont's State Archeologist, were very helpful in explaining how our \nlaws protect the cultural heritage of Vermont and the rest of the \nnation, and I am grateful for their support for this bill.\n  Passage of this legislation would demonstrate Congress' commitment to \npreserving our Nation's history and our cultural heritage. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this common-sense initiative.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1271\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Occupational Safety and Health Act of \n1970 to modify the provisions relating to citations and penalties; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ``Wrongful Death \nAccountability Act,'' legislation that would, among other things, \nincrease the maximum criminal penalty for those who willfully violate \nworkplace safety laws and cause the death of an employee.\n  Unbelievably, under existing law, that crime is a misdemeanor, and \ncarries a maximum prison sentence of just 6 months. This legislation \nwould increase the penalty for this most egregious workplace crime to \n10 years--making it a felony. The bill also would increase the penalty \nassociated with lying to an OSHA inspector from 6 months to 1 year, and \nwould increase the penalty for illegally giving advance warning of an \nupcoming inspection from 6 months to 2 years.\n  In recent months, this Congress has focused on a shocking succession \nof corporate scandals: Enron, Tyco, WorldCom, to name a few. These \nrevelations of corporate abuse raised the ire and indignation of the \nAmerican people. But corporate abuses can sometimes go further than \nsquandering employee pension funds and costing shareholder value. \nSometimes, corporate abuses can cost lives.\n  My legislation is based on the simple premise that going to work \nshould not carry a death sentence. Annually, more than 6,000 Americans \nare killed on the job, and some 50,000 more die from work-related \nillnesses. Many of those deaths--deaths that leave wives without \nhusbands, brothers without sisters, and children without parents--are \ncompletely preventable.\n  Earlier this year, the New York Times published an eye-opening, \nmulti-part series that documented the failure of the Federal government \nto prosecute violators of workplace safety laws. The articles were \ndeeply disturbing to anyone concerned about the health and well being \nof workers in America, detailing one company's pattern of recklessly \ndisregarding basic safety rules. The authors linked at least nine \nemployee deaths in five states--New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Alabama, \nand Texas--over a 7-year period with the failure of a single company, \nMcWane Foundry, to follow established workplace safety regulations. \nThree of those deaths were judged to have been caused by deliberate and \nwillful violations of federal safety rules.\n  As a result of that article and a subsequent criminal investigation, \nMcWane has begun to clean up its act.\n\n[[Page S7983]]\n\nBut no one should be deluded. McWane is not the only company with a \nrecord of putting employees at risk. Others--although still the clear \nminority--continue to flout workplace safety rules and jeopardize the \nhealth and well being of workers.\n  The administration recognized that there was a problem and recently \nannounced its ``enhanced enforcement policy,'' a small step in the \nright direction. But more needs to be done, and I have requested the \nsupport of Secretary Henshaw, Administrator of OSHA, for my \nlegislation.\n  While many factors contribute to the unsafe working environment that \nexists at certain jobsites, one easily remedied factor is an \nineffective regime of criminal penalties. The criminal statutes \nassociated with OSHA have been on the books since the 1970s, but--over \ntime--the deterrence value of these important workplace safety laws has \neroded substantially. With the maximum jail sentence a paltry 6 months, \nFederal prosecutors have only a minimal incentive to spend time and \nresources prosecuting renegade employers. According to a recent \nanalysis, since the Occupational Safety and Health Act was enacted, \nonly 11 employers who caused the death of a worker on the job were \nincarcerated.\n  The logic behind this legislation is simple. The bill will increase \nthe incentive for prosecutors to hold renegade employers accountable \nfor endangering the lives of their workers and, thereby, help ensure \nthat OSHA criminal penalties cannot be safely ignored. This will \nprovide the OSHA criminal statute with sufficient teeth to deter the \nsmall percentage of bad actors who knowingly and willfully place their \nemployees at risk.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation \nand ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1272\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Wrongful Death \n     Accountability Act.''\n\n     SEC. 2. OSHA CRIMINAL PENALTIES.\n\n       Section 17 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of \n     1970 (29 U.S.C. 666) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (e)--\n       (A) by striking ``fine of not more than $10,000'' and \n     inserting ``fine in accordance with section 3571 of title 18, \n     United States Code,'';\n       (B) by striking ``six months'' and inserting ``10 years'';\n       (B) by striking ``fine of not more than $20,000'' and \n     inserting ``fine in accordance with section 3571 of title 18, \n     United States Code,'';\n       (C) by striking ``one year'' and inserting ``20 years''; \n     and\n       (E) by inserting ``under this subsection or subsection \n     (i)'' after ``first conviction of such person'';\n       (2) in subsection (f), by striking ``fine of not more than \n     $1,000 or by imprisonment for not more than six months,'' and \n     inserting ``fine in accordance with section 3571 of title 18, \n     United States Code, or by imprisonment for not more than 2 \n     years,''; and\n       (3) in subsection (g), by striking ``fine of not more than \n     $10,000, or by imprisonment for not more than six months,'' \n     and inserting ``fine in accordance with section 3571 of title \n     18, United States Code, or by imprisonment for not more than \n     1 year,''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \n        Edwards, Mr. Reed, Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n        Dodd, and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 1273. A bill to provide for a study to ensure that students are \nnot adversely affected by changes to the needs analysis tables, and to \nrequire the Secretary of Education to consult with the Advisory \nCommittee on Student Financial Assistance regarding such changes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my colleagues, \nSenator Daschle, Senator Jeffords, Senator Edwards, Senator Reed, \nSenator Clinton, Senator Murray, Senator Bingaman and Senator Dodd, to \nintroduce legislation to amend the Higher Education Act to require a \nfeasibility and impact study on the recent changes in the state and \nlocal tax tables that are the basis for determining need-based aid for \ncollege students.\n  The bill will direct GAO to complete a study in consultation with the \nAdvisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance within 90 days, well \nin advance of the 04-05 academic year when these changes would take \neffect. The advisory committee is a non-partisan board appointed by the \nPresident, which oversees college financial aid. Any future changes in \nthe tables would have to be considered in consultation with the \nAdvisory Committee.\n  When decisions are made that affect the cost of college, it is \nimportant for Congress to understand the factors that influenced that \ndecision and the practical impact of those decisions on students. In \nlight of the slumping economy, State budget crises, and rising college \ncosts, the Department's proposed changes come at a very difficult time \nfor students and their families. Raising the cost of tuition by a few \nhundred dollars may well mean that qualified students can no longer \nafford college. It is our responsibility to see that any such changes \nare made for sound reasons.\n  I also urge the Department of Education to work with Congress in the \nfuture in making these decisions, so that all of us in the House and \nSenate will have a reasonable opportunity to consider such changes \nbefore they are made.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1273\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. STUDY AND CONSULTATION.\n\n       (a) Study.--In order to ensure that students are not \n     adversely affected by the proposed changes to the tables used \n     in the Federal Needs Analysis Methodology to determine a \n     student's expected family contribution for the award year \n     2004-2005 under part F of title IV of the Higher Education \n     Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087kk et seq.), the Comptroller \n     General, in consultation with the Advisory Committee on \n     Student Financial Assistance, shall conduct a study of such \n     proposed changes that shall include an examination of the \n     impact of such changes on students. A report of the findings \n     of the study shall be transmitted to the Secretary of \n     Education and the appropriate committees of Congress not \n     later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Consultation.--Section 478 of the Higher Education Act \n     of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087rr) is amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n       ``(i) Consultation Required.--Prior to publishing any \n     notice or promulgating any regulation with respect to updated \n     tables under this section, the Secretary shall consult with \n     the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance \n     regarding such updated tables.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Bayh, Ms. Mikulski, \n        and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 1274. A bill to reauthorize and reform the national laws; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my colleagues \nin introducing legislation to reauthorize the Corporation for National \nService. In 1993 the bipartisan National Service Act created a new \nprogram to give citizens of all ages the opportunity to serve their \ncommunities. Our goal now is to work with the administration to promote \nand expand service through the State commissions and the extensive \nsystem of national organizations that recruit, train and place \nvolunteers and mentors. The legislation we are introducing, the Call to \nService Act, will reauthorize the Corporation for National Service and \nkeep these programs on track to achieve this goal.\n  Over 250,000 Americans have given a year of service in communities \nacross the country, tutoring young people, connecting people to health \ncare, and building stronger communities. Through the AmeriCorps model, \nwe can give more young people the support they need to dedicate a year \nof their lives to service. These are active citizens, and our country \nwill benefit immensely from the lessons we learn in serving others.\n  Community service knows no age limits. Thousands of older Americans \nvolunteer to tutor young people or support others in living \nindependently, or serve in local agencies. Senior citizens are a \nvaluable resource in every community, and service gives them an \neffective way to continue to be involved\n\n[[Page S7984]]\n\nin the communities they helped to build. The Foster Grandparent, Senior \nCompanion, and RSVP programs, enable seniors to contribute every day to \ntheir communities.\n  The Learn and Serve programs enable young men and women to learn \nearly in their lives that serving others is important, and that service \nis a basic responsibility of citizenship. Children learn the value of \ncommunity service, and build habits of service that last a lifetime. \nService learning programs for elementary and secondary students provide \nhands-on experiences to supplement traditional school curriculums. The \nevidence is irrefutable. Service learning works. When students help \nothers in their communities, they do better academically in school too.\n  In terms of cost effectiveness, the Federal Learn and Serve America \nprogram is an excellent investment. In the 2001-2002 school year more \nthan 800,000 students across the country from grades K through 12 had \nthe opportunity to serve their community, raise their academic \nachievement, and develop social skills. In Massachusetts, over 86,000 \nstudents of all ages currently participate in Learn and Serve programs.\n  Our bill strengthens our commitment to service by increasing the \nnumber of volunteers in AmeriCorps, lowering the age for senior service \nfrom 60 to 55 and increasing the authorization for Learn and Serve. In \naddition, our bill creates a new service opportunity for high school \nstudents. After completing 300 hours of service to their community, \nhigh school students will earn a $1,000 award to use on college. This \nincreases the critical service to communities, builds the habit of \nserving in young people and sets them on track to continue their \neducation.\n  I hope that my colleagues will support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1274\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am grateful to join my colleagues, \nSenators Evan Bayh, Ted Kennedy, and Barbara Mikulski in reintroducing \nthe Call to Service Act of 2003. This important legislation \nsignificantly expands opportunities for citizens to serve their country \nas community volunteers and in homeland security functions.\n  This legislation expands legislation that I introduced with senator \nBayh in 2001. A key component of the original McCain/Bayh proposal \nbecame law last year. To meet the changing personnel needs of today's \nmilitary, the Defense Department will now have a new, shorter-term \nenlistment option. Individuals who volunteer to serve under this new \nprogram serve on active duty for 15 months after their initial military \ntraining and can complete the remainder of their obligation by choosing \nservice on active duty, in the Selected Reserve or in the Individual \nReady Reserve, which can be fulfilled by in a civilian national service \nprogram such as the Peace Corps or AmeriCorps). In return for service, \nthe legislation provides loan up to $18,000, an educational allowance \nunder the Montgomery GI Bill. I am encouraged by the excitement \nexpressed by the Pentagon in meetings about the implementation of the \nprogram.\n  Two months after our legislation was introduced, President Bush made \nservice programs a centerpiece of his 2002 State of the Union address. \nUnfortunately, since the speech, there has not been much followthrough \non the part of this Administration.\n  From the time President Bush was the Governor of Texas, through his \nexperience as President, he has proudly pointed out the successes of \nthis program. Yet the Fiscal Year 2003 Omnibus Appropriations bill he \nsent to the Congress forced cuts in the program. Combined with a 50,000 \ncap placed on the number of AmeriCorps volunteers, AmeriCorps now faces \na crisis.\n  My office has been inundated by phone calls from nervous AmeriCorps \nvolunteers in recent days. They are all expressing the same fear that \nthey will not have the opportunity to continue their service to our \ncommunities. Idealistic young men and women in this country got excited \nwhen they heard the President promise increased opportunities to serve. \nIt is now time for the Congress and the President to expand \nopportunities to serve.\n  There is no shortage of causes that volunteers are eager to fix. We \nhave failing schools, desperate for good teachers. Children in our \npoorest communities are growing up in need of mentors. Millions of \nelderly Americans desperately want to stay in their homes and out of \nnursing facilities, but cannot do so without help with the small tasks \nof daily life. More and more of our communities are being devastated by \nnatural disasters. Many of the AmeriCorps volunteers work for \nchronically understaffed organizations such as Boys and Girls Clubs, \nHabitat for Humanity and the Red Cross. I have to ask why would anyone \nthink we should do anything except increase AmeriCorps to provide \nopportunities for as many people as possible to serve?\n  Not only does the community as a whole suffer when AmeriCorps is cut, \nbut those who are eager to serve are affected as well. Currently, over \n490 individuals serve in Arizona. Many of \nArizona's AmeriCorps volunteers take advantage of the educational \nopportunities that go along with their service. To date, over 2,100 \nArizona residents have taken advantage of the $4,725 to help pay for \ncollege or pay back student loans. The fewer the number of slots \navailable for AmeriCorps volunteers, the fewer the number of men and \nwomen who will be able to take advantage of this important opportunity.\n  I am grateful Senators Bond and Mikulski are working to ensure that \nthe OMB ruling on the use of the education trust fund is used. This \nwill ensure that the cut in the number of volunteers is less than \noriginally feared. However make no mistake, there will be far fewer \nvolunteers in 2003.\n  Our legislation seeks to increase the opportunity to serve in \nAmeriCorps. The Call to Service Act increases the number of people who \nvolunteer for AmeriCorps by 25,000 per year until 175,000 people are \nserving in AmeriCorps each year for a five year period. This is a \n125,000 increase in volunteers over the current 50,000 volunteers. Many \nof these new positions will be dedicated to homeland security. This \nlegislation links AmeriCorps to Homeland Defense by directing the \nCorporation for National Service to work with the Department of \nHomeland Security to determine ways of promoting national security \nthrough service programs.\n  This legislation also expands eligibility for willing and able \nseniors to volunteer in a variety of capacities through Senior Corps, \nincluding senior companion programs, tutoring, providing long-term \ncare, and serving as foster grandparents.\n  During my failed Presidential campaign in 2000, I had the opportunity \nto meet with students all across the country. I was deeply moved by the \nstrong desire these young men and women expressed to serve their \ncountry. While I encourage military service to those I meet, I \nrecognize this type of service is not for all. Our legislation \nincreases the opportunities for these citizens.\n  The response to the terrorist attacks of 9/11 brought out the best in \nthe citizens of the United States. Americans reached out to their \nfriends, neighbors and those in their communities. Many examples of \nserving causes greater than their self interest abound. This dedication \nto volunteer service is still alive today. We cannot continue to wait \nto provide expanded opportunities for national service. Congress should \nno longer delay in taking action on legislation to provide \nopportunities for Americans to serve.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I am privileged to reintroduce the ``Call to \nService Act'' with my colleagues, Senator John McCain, Senator Ted \nKennedy and Senator Barbara Mikulski--all great leaders on national \nservice. I am proud to join with them today to offer this significant \nexpansion of national service opportunities for all Americans--young \nand old, affluent, people of more modest means, all united in their \ndevotion to serving America.\n  In November 2001, Senator McCain and I introduced the ``Call to \nService Act'' in an attempt to harness the spirit and overwhelming \npatriotism of our citizens after September 11. We wanted to give \nconcrete opportunities to the countless Americans who were asking what \nthey could do to give back to their country.\n  Weeks after we introduced our bill, we were encouraged when the \nPresident made his own more modest service proposals a rhetorical \ncenterpiece of his 2002 State of the Union address. In that speech, \nPresident Bush promised a significant expansion of the AmeriCorps \nprogram. He said, ``We want to be a nation that serves goals larger \nthan self. We've been offered a unique opportunity, and we must not let \nthis moment pass.''\n  Unfortunately, the President is in danger of letting the moment pass. \nAnd now, almost a year and a half later, the promises of that speech \nsound hollow. The administration's efforts to expand service have been \ndisappointingly lackluster. National Service expansion was held hostage \nin the last Congress by members of the President's own party on the far \nright, while he stood idly by.\n  In fact, Americans now have fewer opportunities to serve than before. \nIn my State of Indiana, we are facing a 92 percent cut in AmeriCorps \npositions. Last year, there were nearly 400 full-time equivalent \npositions available to serve in Indiana. This year, there will only be \nfewer than 40 positions. This will have a dramatic impact on the \nAmeriCorps programs throughout Indiana and on Hoosiers throughout the \nState. It is a very real possibility that Indiana will only have one \nAmeriCorps program this year. Children are not going to be tutored and \nmentored, homes are not going to be built, neighborhoods are not going \nto be cleaned up, and communities are going to be left behind. Indiana \nis not unique, States across the country are facing similar reductions \nin programs and services.\n  I am grateful to Senators Mikulski and Bond for their efforts to \nensure\n\n[[Page S8000]]\n\nthat the OMB method of accounting is used to determine the number of \nAmeriCorps positions available this year. With this change, there will \nstill be large reductions in AmeriCorps, but the damage will not be \nquite as severe.\n  As AmeriCorps faces its greatest challenge since it was created, it \nis important to restate our commitment to this program. Our legislation \nwill expand AmeriCorps by 25,000 additional members each year for a \ntotal of 175,000 members in five years. It will continue to utilize \nvolunteers to support homeland security functions to help meet our \nNation's new security challenges in a smart, cost-efficient manner. Our \nlegislation includes strong accountability measures to ensure that the \nfunds and the volunteers will be devoting themselves to activities and \nprograms that really make a difference, really work. It expands \nopportunities for our seniors to serve, so that as the baby boom \ngeneration retires they can give back to their country.\n  We stand here today to offer this consensus approach because we know \nwe have arrived at a critical juncture in the cause of expanding \nnational service. We are at risk of missing the moment if we don't act.\n  Frankly, what is called for here is leadership. We are attempting to \nprovide that today by offering this consensus approach, Republicans and \nDemocrats, leader of the committee, those of us who are not on the \ncommittee.\n  But the President must get engaged. He's said all the right things, \nnow it is important that he do the right thing. If we're going to get a \nsignificant commitment to national service it is going to take more \nthan lip service, and I hope that he will step forward and provide the \nkind of leadership that is necessary before this opportunity slips away \nfrom us.\n  The moment has not yet passed us. Americans are eager to serve. We \nare eager to enact this legislation, put an end to this sad chapter for \nnational service, and build toward a Nation where the great energies \nand good intentions of our citizens are put to productive use.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR (by request):\n  S. 1275. A bill to establish a comprehensive federal program to \nprovide benefits to U.S. victims of international terrorism, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, by request, I introduce for appropriate \nreference a bill to establish a comprehensive Federal program to \nprovide benefits to U.S. victims of international terrorism.\n  This proposed legislation has been requested by the Department of \nState, and I am introducing it in order that there may be a specific \nbill to which members of the Senate and the public may direct their \nattention and comments.\n  I reserve my right to support or oppose this bill, as well as to make \nany suggested amendments to it, when the matter is considered by the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record \ntogether with a letter addressed to me from the Assistant Secretary of \nState for Legislative Affairs.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1275\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SEC. 101.

Richard G. Lugar,\n     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We are transmitting for your \n     consideration a draft bill to establish a program to provide \n     benefits for United States victims of international \n     terrorism.\n       The proposed legislation is based on the following three \n     principles:\n       The program should provide the same benefits to those with \n     low incomes as those with greater means;\n       Victims should receive compensation as quickly as possible; \n     and\n       The amount of compensation should be on par with that \n     provided to families of public safety officers killed in the \n     line of duty (currently $262,000).\n       Thus, the government program should not be designed as the \n     primary means of compensating victims and victims' families \n     for their losses, but rather should complement life \n     insurance, savings, and other private financial measures.\n       In contrast to a mechanism that uses blocked assets and \n     rewards those that can secure judgements before such assets \n     are exhausted, a fund based on the above principles would \n     provide compensation for all victims fairly and equitably. It \n     also preserves the President's prerogatives in the area of \n     foreign affairs.\n       The proposed fund would be administered within the \n     Department of State. The legislation includes authorization \n     for appropriations necessary to compensate victims. In \n     addition to these costs, a benefits adjudication unit will be \n     established within the Department soon after enactment.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection from the standpoint of the Administration's \n     program to the submission of this proposal to Congress.\n       We urge your support for passage of this legislation, which \n     provides compensation for U.S. victims of international \n     terrorism in a fair and rational way.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Paul V. Kelly,\n\n                                              Assistant Secretary,\n     Legislative Affairs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/17/senate-section/article/S8001-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8001-S8005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 172--HONORING THE LIFE OF MEDIA REPORTING GIANT DAVID \n BRINKLEY, AND EXPRESSING THE DEEPEST CONDOLENCES OF THE SENATE TO HIS \n                          FAMILY ON HIS DEATH\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mrs. Dole) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 172\n\n       Whereas the Senate has learned with sadness of the death of \n     David Brinkley;\n       Whereas David Brinkley, born in Wilmington, NC, greatly \n     distinguished himself as a newspaper reporter, radio \n     correspondent, and television correspondent;\n       Whereas David Brinkley attended the University of North \n     Carolina and served in the North Carolina National Guard;\n       Whereas David Brinkley's first job in Washington was \n     covering the White House in 1943 for NBC as a radio reporter;\n       Whereas David Brinkley co-anchored ``The Huntley-Brinkley \n     Report,'' along with Chet\n\n[[Page S8002]]\n\n     Huntley, which was widely popular during the 1960's;\n       Whereas David Brinkley hosted ``This Week with David \n     Brinkley'' for fifteen years and it was the number one Sunday \n     program when he retired in 1996;\n       Whereas David Brinkley covered eleven presidents, four \n     wars, 22 political conventions, a moon landing and three \n     assassinations;\n       Whereas David Brinkley wrote three books, won ten Emmy \n     awards, six Peabody Awards, and in 1992, the Presidential \n     Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor;\n       Whereas David Brinkley is considered by many to be the \n     premier broadcast journalist of his time;\n       Whereas David Brinkley was well known for his wry sense of \n     humor, fundamental decency, gentlemanly charm, and his one-\n     of-a-kind writing style will forever be remembered by his \n     friends, colleagues, and the countless members of the \n     television audience he touched week to week over his more \n     than fifty year career: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) pay tribute to the outstanding career of David Brinkley\n       (2) expresses its deepest condolences to his family; and\n       (3) directs the Secretary of the Senate to direct an \n     enrolled copy of this resolution to the family of David \n     Brinkley.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 173--TO AMEND RULE XVI OF THE STANDING RULES OF THE \n  SENATE WITH RESPECT TO NEW OR GENERAL LEGISLATION AND UNAUTHORIZED \nAPPROPRIATIONS IN GENERAL APPROPRIATIONS BILLS AND AMENDMENTS THERETO, \n   AND NEW OR GENERAL LEGISLATION, UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS, NEW \n MATTER, OR NONGERMANE MATTER IN CONFERENCE REPORTS ON APPROPRIATIONS \nACTS, AND UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS IN AMENDMENTS BETWEEN THE HOUSES \n             RELATING TO SUCH ACTS, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Sessions, and Mr. Feingold) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Rules and Administration:\n\n                              S.

READING OF CONFERENCE REPORT AND JOINT EXPLANATORY \n                   STATEMENT.\n\n       (a) Vitiating the Standing Order of the Senate Regarding \n     the Reading of Conference Reports.--The Standing Order of the \n     Senate regarding the reading of conference reports \n     established by the second sentence of section 903 of Division \n     A of Appendix D--H.R. 5666 of the Consolidated Appropriations \n     Act, 2001 (114 Stat. 2763A-198) is vitiated.\n       (b) Reading of Joint Explanatory Statement.--There is \n     established, as a Standing Order of the Senate, that the \n     presentation of a conference report includes the presentation \n     of the joint explanatory statement of the conferees required \n     by paragraph 4 of Rule XXVIII of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate, and that a demand for the reading of the joint \n     explanatory statement be subject to the same rules, \n     precedents, and procedures as apply to a demand for the \n     reading of the conference report.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the resolution I am submitting today is a \nresolution to amend the Standing Rules of the Senate to give every \nMember the ability to raise points of order in objection to \nunauthorized appropriations or locality-specific earmarks that would \ncircumvent the authorizing or competitive award process. I am pleased \nto be joined in this effort by my colleagues, Senators Kyl, Sessions, \nand Feingold.\n  Specifically, the resolution would establish a new procedure, modeled \nin part after the Byrd Rule, which would allow a point of order to be \nraised against any new or general legislation or unauthorized \nappropriations, including earmarks, in any general appropriations bills \nor amendments to general appropriations bills. It also would allow a \npoint of order to be raised against any new or general legislation or \nunauthorized appropriations, new matter, or nongermane matter in any \nappropriations conference reports, and against unauthorized \nappropriations in amendments between the Houses.\n  Unless a point of order is waived by the affirmative vote of 60 \nvotes, the unauthorized provision would be extracted from the measure, \nand the overall cost of the bill would be reduced by the corresponding \namount. Furthermore, if a point of order is sustained against a \nprovision in a conference report, that provision also would be \nstricken. The legislative process would continue, however, and the \nlegislation would revert to a nonamendable Senate amendment, which \nwould be the conference agreement without the objectionable material, \nand the measure could then be sent back to the House.\n  The proposed rules change also includes two exemptions to points of \norder that currently apply to amendments to appropriations bills under \nrule XVI: appropriations that had been included in the President's \nbudget request or would be authorized by a bill already passed by the \nSenate during that session of Congress. Such appropriations would not \nbe subject to points of order under the proposed rules change.\n  Finally, as my colleagues know, the reports accompanying \nappropriations bills and the statements of managers that accompany \nconference reports are chock full of unauthorized appropriations and \nsite-specific earmarks, typically far exceeding those in the bill \nlanguage. There has been a growing tendency over the years for these \nreports to be viewed by Federal agencies as statutory directives. The \nfact is, of course, the Appropriations Committee reports and statements \nof managers are advisory only. Unless a device for curtailing such \nearmarking in report language is also implemented, the new rule could \nbe rendered almost meaningless. Therefore, under our proposal, it would \nnot be in order to consider an appropriations bill or conference report \nif the accompanying documents include unauthorized or earmarked items.\n  The proposal would not be self-enforcing but, rather, it would allow \nany Member to raise a point of order in an effort to extract \nobjectionable unauthorized provisions. Our goal is to reform the \ncurrent system by empowering all Members with a tool to rid \nappropriations bills of unauthorized funds, porkbarrel projects, and \nlegislative policy riders.\n  For many years, I have worked to call attention to the wasteful \npractice of congressional earmarking whereby parochial interests are \nplaced above national interests. Unfortunately, congressional earmarks \nhave continued to rise year after year. In fact, according to \ninformation compiled from the CRS, the Congressional Research Service, \nthe total number of earmarks has grown from 4,126 in fiscal year 1994, \nto 10,540 in fiscal year 2002. That is an increase of over 150 percent. \nAnd for the year 2003, the increase in number, from our preliminary \nestimates, is somewhere around 1,300 earmarks.\n\n  Our current economic situation and our vital national security \nconcerns require that now, more than ever, we prioritize our Federal \nspending.\n  By the way, the earmarked funds have gone up a commensurate amount \nfrom $26.8 billion in fiscal year 1994, to $44.6 billion earmarked in \n2002. I think\n\n[[Page S8004]]\n\nwhat this chart shows is as important as the earmarks, given the fact \nthat we are now up close to $50 billion in earmarked funds in our \nappropriations bills.\n  And this chart does not include the number of fundamental policy \nchanges that are made in the appropriations process because they cannot \nget through the authorizing process, which is the proper process. And \nthey, many times--as in a case that I will mention in a few minutes--\noften cost hundreds of millions of dollars to the taxpayers. Language \nincluded in the Department of Defense appropriations bill for fiscal \nyear 1998 is a classic example. There were no funds earmarked in that \nbill that would show up here. It did show up as one policy change.\n  What it did do, in the Defense appropriations bill, is it granted a \nlegal monopoly for American Classic Voyages to operate as the only \nU.S.-flagged operator among the Hawaiian Islands. After receiving the \nmonopoly, American Classic Voyages secured a $1.1 billion loan \nguarantee from the U.S. Maritime Administration's title XI loan \nguarantee program for the construction of two passenger vessels known \nas Project America.\n  Project America's subsequent failure 4 years later resulted in the \nU.S. Maritime Administration paying out $187.3 million of the \ntaxpayers' money to cover the project's loan default and recovering \nonly $2 million from the sale.\n  I am not alone in the opinion that the earmarking process has reached \nthe breaking point. Consider the administration's recently submitted \nproposal to reauthorize the multiyear highway transit and safety \nprograms which will expire in September 30, 2003. Interestingly, that \nproposal, entitled the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient \nTransportation Equity Act of 2003, SAFETEA, proposes to largely \neliminate discretionary programs that currently exist under the \nDepartment's authority.\n  Why is that? One would think the Secretary of Transportation would be \nadvocating the growth of discretionary programs so that he can award \nFederal grants for projects based on a meritorious selection process.\n  But over the years, such discretion has been assumed by the \nappropriators during the annual transportation appropriations process \nand all but nullified any role on the part of the Secretary and his \nability to award discretionary grants.\n  Transportation Secretary Mineta, in testimony before the Senate \nCommerce Committee, stated:\n\n       SAFETEA eliminates most discretionary highway grant \n     programs and makes these funds available under the core \n     formula highway grants programs. States and localities have \n     tremendous flexibility and certainty of funding under the \n     core programs. Unfortunately, Congressional earmarking has \n     frustrated the intent of most of these discretionary \n     programs, making it harder for States and localities to think \n     strategically about their own transportation problems.\n\n  To further illustrate the enormity of the earmarking situation, my \ncolleagues need only consider the transportation earmarking that has \noccurred during the past 5 years. According to the Department of \nTransportation inspector general, Congress appropriated $18 billion in \ndiscretionary funding for highway transit and aviation discretionary \nprograms during fiscal years 1998 through 2002. Of that amount, $11 \nbillion or 60 percent was earmarked by Congress.\n  Let me just offer a few specific examples of recent earmarks: From \nthe war supplemental appropriations conference report, $110 million for \nmodernization of the Agriculture Research Service, and Animal and Plant \nHealth Inspection Service Facilities near Ames, IA. That was from a war \nsupplemental appropriations conference report, specifically for the war \nin Iraq and homeland security. From the 2003 omnibus appropriations \nconference report, $1 million for a bear DNA sampling study in Montana; \n$280,000 for asparagus technology and production in Washington; \n$220,000 to research future foods in Illinois; $10 million for a \nseafood marketing program in Alaska; $250,000 for research on the \ninteraction of grapefruit juice and drugs; $50,000 to combat feral hogs \nin Missouri; $2 million for the Biomass Gasification Research Facility \nin Birmingham, AL; $500,000 for the gasification of switchgrass in \nIowa; $1 million for the National Agriculture-Based Industrial \nLubricants Center in Iowa; and $202,500 to continue rehabilitation of \nthe former Alaska Pulp Company mill site in Sitka, AK.\n  I usually make a lot of fun and jokes about these things, but it is \ngetting out of hand. It is really getting out of hand. When we are \nlooking at a $400 billion deficit this year, can we afford $1 million \nfor a bear DNA sampling study in Montana?\n\n  The conference report also included an agricultural policy change to \nmake catfish producers eligible for payments under the livestock \ncompensation program even though hog, poultry, or horse producers are \nnot eligible.\n  Further, the conference agreement contained provisions which allow a \nsubsidiary of the Malaysian-owned Norwegian Cruise Lines the exclusive \nright to operate several large foreign-built cruise vessels in the \ndomestic cruise trade. This provides an unfair competitive advantage to \na foreign company at the expense of all other cruise ship operators and \ncreates a de facto monopoly for NCL in the Hawaiian cruise trade.\n  From the fiscal year 2002 transportation appropriations conference \nreport, nearly $1 billion in highway program funding authorized to be \ndistributed to the States by formula at the discretion of the Secretary \nwas instead, for the first time, redirected and earmarked for projects \nsuch as $1.5 million for the Big South Fork Scenic Railroad enhancement \nproject in Kentucky; $2 million for a public exhibition on ``America's \nTransportation Stories'' in Michigan; and $3 million for the Odyssey \nMaritime Project, a museum, in Washington. That was out of highway \nfunds.\n  The National Corridor Planning & Development & Corridor Border \nInfrastructure Program was authorized at $140 million. But the \nappropriators provided an additional $333.6 million over the authorized \nlevel for a total of $492.2 million in funding. The conferees then \nearmarked 100 percent of the funding for 123 projects in 38 States. \nEarmarks included, surprisingly, $54 million for three projects in West \nVirginia; $43 million for 18 projects in Kentucky; $34.5 million for \nseven projects in Mississippi; $34 million for five projects in \nWashington; and $27 million for six projects in Alabama. Twelve States \nreceived zero funding under any program: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, \nHawaii, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Carolina, \nUtah, Vermont, and Wyoming.\n  I could go on citing examples of arbitrary earmarks. I will refrain \nfor now. But something has to be done to put a halt to the alarming \nincrease in earmarking.\n  I went over the rules changes and what they meant, but I would just \nlike to give a most recent example. An issue that has arisen which is \nof great concern to many Americans is the issue of media concentration. \nWe have had several hearings in the Commerce Committee. We had the FCC \nCommissioners up before the committee after they made a ruling. It has \nprobably aroused more interest than any other issue ever before the \nFederal Communications Commission, certainly in recent memory.\n  Seven hundred fifty thousand Americans contacted the FCC on this \nissue of media concentration. The issue is difficult. It is complex. We \nhave had many hearings on it. Over time, I have become convinced that \nthis issue is a serious one. I believe there are serious problems with \nradio concentration. I am not sure what the answer is and exactly how \nwe go about addressing the issue of both vertical and horizontal \nconcentration, cross-ownership of newspapers, and television stations \nand cable stations and radio stations. But the committee will continue \nto explore it.\n  Last week, three of my colleagues from the Senate held a press \nconference: My dear friend Senator Hollings, ranking member of the \nCommerce Committee, former chairman; Senator Stevens of Alaska, second \nranking member of the committee; and Senator Lott, a very distinguished \nmember of the committee. At the time, they said they were introducing \nlegislation to freeze the ownership at 35 percent which would then \ncounteract and repeal the rule raising media concentration levels to 45 \npercent by FCC.\n  The only reason I mention this is immediately in answer to the first \nquestion, they said: If we don't get it\n\n[[Page S8005]]\n\nthrough the committee, we can always put it on an appropriations bill. \nThat was the comment made.\n  Mr. President, that is not the right way to do business on a major \nfundamental policy change, to tack it on as one line, as was described \nby Senator Hollings, that we can always just zero out the funding. That \nis not the way we should be doing business.\n  This issue should be decided by all 100 Senators on the floor of the \nSenate. I am not saying the sponsors of the legislation are wrong. But \nthis has to do with billions of dollars in acquisitions, or \nnonacquisitions, with fundamental changes within the media. The answer \nwas, well, we will put it on an appropriations bill if we cannot get it \nthrough committee. The committee will be marking it up on Thursday. I \ndon't know if it will get to the floor. That is up to the majority \nleader but, more importantly up to my colleagues who may put holds on \nit.\n  These are serious issues that impact greatly the United States of \nAmerica, and they are being decided on appropriations bills, stuck in \nwithout even so much as a hearing many times. I will be on the floor \nmany times on this issue because it is a long way from us being able to \nremove this power from the Appropriations Committee and put it back \ninto the authorizing committees where it belongs.\n  Finally, some of the proudest and most intense and enjoyable moments \nof my political career have been as chairman of the Commerce Committee. \nI believe the Commerce Committee is well suited to address these \nissues. I believe the Commerce Committee is well suited to authorize \nmajor programs and address major policy challenges that confront the \nNation, whether it is commerce, science, transportation, information \ntechnology, telecommunications, aviation, or all of the other issues. I \ndon't think they should be decided by the Appropriations Committee, as \nfar as policy is concerned. As far as the amounts of money are \nconcerned, that is their job. I pretend to have no ambitions on that \nissue.\n  We have to get this out-of-control--and I mean totally out-of-\ncontrol--situation under control. The situation has been dramatically \nexacerbated by the fact that we are now looking, in sheer whole \nnumbers, at the highest deficits in the history of this country. As far \nas a percent of GNP, they are not the highest, but we are talking about \nat least $400 billion this year.\n  We are about to--I am happy to say--pass a Medicare prescription drug \nprogram that will cost about $400 billion or more over a 10-year \nperiod. We are looking at Social Security and Medicare. We cannot \nafford this high cost anymore. I believe the chairman of the Rules \nCommittee will be holding a hearing on this issue. I don't believe it \nwould get through the Rules Committee, but I am very grateful to \nSenator Lott that he would allow a hearing on this issue. But I do not \nintend to give up on it. We will be discussing it and debating it for a \nlong time.\n  My constituents--and every American--do not expect us to act in this \nfashion, which in many cases is totally irresponsible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the Congressional Budget Act, Rule 21 of the \nHouse of Representatives, and Rule 16 of the Senate are all designed to \nestablish a balance between authorizing legislation and appropriations \nbills that would allow Congress to consider authorizing legislation in \na timely and thoughtful manner, and prevent the year-ending \nappropriations process from degenerating into a venue for policymaking \nand provincialism.\n  Yet, according to CBO, over the past several years, the total amount \nof unauthorized appropriations has ranged between about $90 billion and \n$120 billion annually, and since 1998, the number of earmarks has risen \nby 150 percent to 10,540, which cost $44.6 billion in 2002 alone. This \ntrend has made a mockery of our institutional arrangement and beckons \nus to take action to fix the system.\n  The bill introduced today is not perfect, but it recognizes the \ndeficiencies in current procedure and represents an earnest and \nthoughtful attempt to correct them. It would improve Rule 16 to close \nthe loophole that currently insulates Senate appropriations committee-\nreported bills containing unauthorized appropriations and legislative \nlanguage from points of order, while preserving the Senate's ``defense \nof germaneness'' to amend legislative language in House-passed \nappropriations bills.\n  It would also preserve balance between the Houses by allowing any \nSenator to raise a point of order against unauthorized appropriations \nincluded in a House-passed appropriations bill, conference report, or \namendment between Houses. Finally, the bill attempts to regulate the \npractice of using committee or conference report language to earmark \nfunds.\n  We have a problem; I think that much is clear. If other Members of \nthis chamber do not agree with specific provisions of this bill, I ask \nthat they offer constructive suggestions as to how best to breathe life \nback into Rule 16 and the institutional balance between authorization \nand appropriations. In the midst of the War on Terrorism and projected \nbudget deficits, it would be an abrogation of our role as elected \nofficials to allow the status quo to persist.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/17/senate-section/article/S8005-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOTICES OF HEARINGS/MEETINGS\n\n\n                      committee on indian affairs\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 172, which was \nsubmitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 172) honoring the life of media \n     reporting giant David Brinkley, and expressing the deepest \n     condolences of the Senate to his family on his death.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I spend many of my Sunday mornings \nhaving coffee with Tony Snow, Tim Russert and Bob Schieffer. The Sunday \nmorning talk shows are a chance for me--and I'm sure every Senator in \nthis Chamber--to listen and participate in some of the best and most \nlively debates in America. While today's hosts are some of the best in \nthe business, their foundation was built by a legend.\n  ``This Week with David Brinkley'' was that foundation. His show was \nthe first Sunday talk show I remember watching. David had a passion for \npolitics and it showed on the air. He set a pattern for all the other \nhosts to follow. Last Wednesday, when David passed away at the age of \n82, America lost a friend.\n  David's interest in journalism and politics started at a very early \nage. He was born in Wilmington, NC, on July 10 1920. David's first job \nin journalism was at the Wilmington Morning Star, where he wrote for \nthe newspaper while still in high school. Following graduation, he \nattended the University of North Carolina and served in the North \nCarolina National Guard. In 1943, after his discharge from the service, \nDavid moved to Washington, DC, and landed a job with NBC as a radio \nreporter covering President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the White House.\n  In 1956, David got his big break. He became a co-anchor with Chet \nHuntley during the Democratic and Republican political convention. I \nremember tuning in to David every night; in fact, I was probably the \nonly 14-year-old in America that watched the conventions from gavel to \ngavel.\n  David did such an outstanding job during the conventions that NBC \ndecided to promote him to the nightly news. ``The Huntley-Brinkley \nReport'' premiered on October 29, 1956. This was NBC's nightly \nnewscast, and it was the show that made David Brinkley a household \nname. Millions of Americans tuned in to the program nightly to get \ntheir news. Their show was so popular that, in the 1960s, David and \nChet both had higher name recognition than the Beatles and John Wayne.\n  What most Americans remember about the show was the way they signed \noff each night: ``Goodnight, Chet . . . Goodnight, David.'' It became \none of the country's first catchphrases.\n  David permanently said ``goodnight'' to ``The Huntley-Brinkley \nReport'' in 1970. He stayed at NBC for another 11 years, continuing to \nreport, anchor and host a magazine show.\n  In 1981, ABC arrived on the scene. The network offered him a Sunday \nmorning talk show. ``This Week with David Brinkley'' was the first of \nits kind--an hour rather than 30 minutes, and it became a huge ratings \nhit.\n  During his long and outstanding career, David covered 11 presidents, \n4 wars, 22 political conventions, a moon landing, and 3 assassinations. \nHe wrote 3 books, won 10 Emmy awards, 6 Peabody awards, and in 1992, \nthe Presidential Medal of Freedom--the Nation's highest civilian honor.\n  David was just as well known for his wry sense of humor, fundamental \ndecency and gentlemanly charm as he was for his one-of-a-kind writing \nstyle. I am told that he wrote all of his own scripts, which is rare, \nespecially in today's world of the 24-hour news channels. In 1987, he \nsaid: ``it's the way I've written all my life, since I was 6 years old \nand working part-time at a local newspaper. I write the way I talk. \nOccasionally, rarely, because something happened while I was already on \nthe air and I couldn't write it myself, somebody's written something \nand brought it to me. And I cannot read it. Can not!. . .  And it's not \nthat the writing is so terrible. It's just that . . . I can't read \nanything that isn't mine.''\n  My prayers and deepest condolences go out to David's family and \nfriends for their loss. Mr. President, I close by asking my colleagues \nto join me in paying tribute to David Brinkley's life and his \ncontribution to journalism and politics. There will never be another \none like him. He will be missed.\n  ``Goodnight, David.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating to this matter be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 172) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 172\n\n       Whereas the Senate has learned with sadness of the death of \n     David Brinkley;\n       Whereas David Brinkley, born in Wilmington, NC, greatly \n     distinguished himself as a newspaper reporter, radio \n     correspondent, and television correspondent;\n       Whereas David Brinkley attended the University of North \n     Carolina and served in the North Carolina National Guard;\n       Whereas David Brinkley's first job in Washington was \n     covering the White House in 1943 for NBC as a radio reporter;\n       Whereas David Brinkley co-anchored ``The Huntley-Brinkley \n     Report,'' along with Chet Huntley, which was widely popular \n     during the 1960's;\n       Whereas David Brinkley hosted ``This Week with David \n     Brinkley'' for fifteen years and it was the number one Sunday \n     program when he retired in 1996;\n       Whereas David Brinkley covered eleven presidents, four \n     wars, 22 political conventions, a moon landing and three \n     assassinations;\n       Whereas David Brinkley wrote three books, won ten Emmy \n     awards, six Peabody Awards, and in 1992, the Presidential \n     Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor;\n       Whereas David Brinkley is considered by many to be the \n     premier broadcast journalist of his time;\n       Whereas David Brinkley was well known for his wry sense of \n     humor, fundamental decency, gentlemanly charm, and his one-\n     of-a-kind writing style will forever be remembered by his \n     friends, colleagues, and the countless members of the \n     television audience he touched week to week over his more \n     than fifty year career: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) pay tribute to the outstanding career of David \n     Brinkley;\n       (2) expresses its deepest condolences to his family; and\n       (3) directs the Secretary of the Senate to direct an \n     enrolled copy of this resolution to the family of David \n     Brinkley.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/17/senate-section/article/S8007-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8007-S8008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ORDERS FOR TOMORROW\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, everyone should understand the scope of \nthe proposed resolution of the Senator from Arizona. I have before me \nsome books. The books with white covers are requests I received as \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee on one bill last January, when \nwe talked about the defense portion of what we call the omnibus bill.\n  The Chair will recall we had 11 bills that had to be put together. \nThis is the portion pertaining just to the foreign assistance \nsubcommittee dealing with matters of foreign assistance. Every one of \nthose pages is a letter from a Member of the Senate asking our \ncommittee to change a portion of the appropriations bill for the \nspecific subcommittee received from the administration. The President \nsends us a budget, and the budget is broken into 13 separate bills. \nThese represent the requests received from Senators to change just 2 of \nthose 11 bills.\n  Senator McCain's proposal would, in effect, say if any one of these \nrequests were granted, it would be subject to a point of order and it \nwould take 60 votes to allow that amendment to stay in the bill.\n  In other words, a Senator could make a motion after the Senate or the \ncommittee had agreed to one of these requests, and that motion would be \nto take it out. It would take 60 votes to sustain it. I think the \nConstitution assures a majority can pass any amendment. This is a \nprocedure that is unheard of in terms of parliamentary procedure and \none I want the Senate to know if it possibly comes up on the floor, I \nthink we shall demonstrate what a good old-fashioned filibuster is all \nabout. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/17/senate-section/article/S8008-5", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             AUTOMATIC DEFIBRILLATION IN ADAM'S MEMORY ACT\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.
