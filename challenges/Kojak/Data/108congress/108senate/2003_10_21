Mr. President, this morning there will be a period for \nmorning business to allow Senators to make statements. At 10:30 today, \nthe Senate will begin consideration of the conference report to \naccompany the partial-birth abortion ban bill. Under a unanimous \nconsent agreement, there will be up to 4 hours of debate on that \nconference report. Under a previous order, the Senate will stand in \nrecess from 12:30 until 2:15 for the respective party caucus meetings. \nAfter that recess, the Senate will continue consideration of the \npartial-birth abortion ban, with a vote on the conference report \nexpected this afternoon. That vote will be the first vote of the day.\n  Following the vote on the partial-birth abortion ban, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 1751, the class \naction fairness bill. I remind my colleagues that we had hoped to begin \nconsideration of the class action legislation yesterday. Unfortunately, \nthere was an objection to proceeding which is why it was necessary for \nus to proceed to move to that bill. Yesterday, we filed a cloture \nmotion on the motion to proceed and that vote will occur tomorrow \nmorning.\n  It is important that we are able to proceed with that bill. I \nunderstand there are differences on the substance of the legislation. \nHowever, the Senate should be allowed to consider those issues through \ndebate and votes, as appropriate. Therefore, I once again encourage my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle to allow us to begin work on \nthe bill to bring some sense to the overall class action process.\n  I was also disappointed with the objection to proceeding to the \nHealthy Forests initiative. Chairman Cochran and others on both sides \nof the aisle have been working in good faith to bring that bill to the \nfloor in a way to consider some concerns that may exist on the \nDemocratic side. Again, there was an objection to proceed to that \nmeasure. I hope Members can, over the course of this morning and today, \nrethink that objection and allow debate to begin on this very important \ninitiative, the Healthy Forests legislation.\n  We are also working hard to clear for Senate action a number of other \nimportant issues, including the fair credit reporting bill, the so-\ncalled spam legislation, as well as an agreement to move forward on the \ncharitable giving bill.\n  I remind my colleagues, both the Senate and the House have already \npassed their respective versions of that legislation and it is now time \nfor us to move to conference and reconcile those differences. Having \nsaid that, we will continue to work with the Democratic leadership in \nan effort to reach an agreement to move forward on all of the bills I \njust mentioned.\n  As we approach the last weeks of this session, we need to redouble \nour efforts to stay focused and disciplined on these agreements so we \ncan allow the Senate to consider all of these bills. I thank my \ncolleagues in advance for their cooperation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/21/senate-section/article/S12907-6", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12907-S12908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant Democratic leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. While the majority leader is in the Chamber, I say on \nbehalf of the minority, we acknowledge the importance of class action, \nHealthy Forests, charitable choice. Those are the ones I remember the \nleader speaking of. For example, charitable choice could be done within \na matter of minutes and sent directly to the House. There has been a \ndecision made by the majority--and I think not a proper one--to take it \nto conference. We could send it immediately to the House.\n\n  We are working very hard to try to cooperate with the majority on the \nmost important piece of legislation, class action. A vast majority of \nMembers on this side of the aisle want to do something on class action. \nWe have had\n\n[[Page S12908]]\n\nas our point person on this John Breaux, and he has had contact with \nthe majority to try to come up with something on this issue. I think we \nare very close to working something out.\n  Healthy Forests, as the leader knows, is a difficult issue. For \nWestern States it is extremely important. We hope that can be resolved \nquickly.\n  I bring to the leader's attention, however, we also have those \nappropriations bills we need to do. I spoke very briefly this morning \nwith the distinguished Presiding Officer. He has been in contact, as I \nam sure the leader knows, with Senator Byrd. Maybe there is still \nsomething we can do on those appropriations bills to get, if not all of \nthe six we have not passed here done, at least some of them completed. \nWe have those most important conferences. We have had, as far as I am \nconcerned, a difficult time getting a conference completed on the \nenergy and water appropriations bill. That has been a bill we usually \nbring up first because it is so important to Members in the House and \nSenate. I spoke this morning to Majority Leader DeLay, saying we need a \nlittle help from the leadership in trying to move that.\n  I hope, in addition to these other important items the leader has \nmentioned, we can work together to come up with some program to get \nsome of the appropriations bills passed. I think it is important for \nthe country.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments just made by my \ncolleague and I think his comments reflect the amount of work we \nabsolutely must accomplish in the next few days. I say that because in \nterms of the numbers of days in the weeks remaining, there are very few \nlegislative days. We should all redouble our efforts and focus on each \nand every one of these bills. They are all very important.\n  I know it may seem, as the Republican leader, I am encouraging the \nresolution of these bills by bringing them to the floor. That is \nexactly what I am doing, so we can all redouble our efforts to \naccomplish what really we want to do mutually: Go through each of \nthese, have the appropriate debate and amendment on the floor as we go \nforward.\n  Mr. REID. One bill I did not mention that I feel strongly about is \nfair credit reporting. That is also very important. I bet my office has \nreceived 100 phone calls in the last couple of legislative days dealing \nwith that legislation. We hope something can be worked out on that \nalso.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/21/senate-section/article/S12908-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, on leader time, I want to make a very brief \ncomment to highlight a few of the encouraging developments on our \neconomic front. I know we will be going to morning business, and some \nof my colleagues will be talking shortly on the issue of our economy \nand where we are in terms of jobs and job creation.\n  There have been some very encouraging developments on the economic \nfront. When the third quarter GDP figures are released next week, it is \nanticipated we will very possibly see growth as high as 6.5 percent. \nAll signs, at this point, point to a very robust holiday buying season.\n  The Department of Commerce reports consumption is strong. In the \nthird quarter, consumption grew by an annual rate of over 12 percent. \nMany economists tell us this third quarter consumption may be the \nstrongest we have seen over the last 4 years--again, very good news.\n  Likewise, the Department of Labor reports the initial jobless claims \nare at their lowest levels since February. In August, the nonfarm \nsector employment rose by 57,000 jobs. In the area of manufacturing, \nmid-Atlantic manufacturing is showing promising signs of recovery. The \nindex for new orders showed the highest gains in 8 years, and the \nmonthly index of regional manufacturing significantly topped the \neconomists' expectations. Inflation, meanwhile, remains very low. \nShort-term interest rates are also at historically low levels. There is \nmuch to cheer about in this positive news.\n  Smart, progrowth fiscal policy is helping lead this creation of new \njobs. But we have a lot more work to do. There are some structural \nproblems we need to tackle on this Senate floor in order to strengthen \nthe marketplace. We need a more efficient marketplace, a more \ntransparent marketplace. We need to make it less risky for businesses \nto go out and hire workers and to retrain those workers, and we can do \nthat by focusing on appropriate reforms such as strengthening trade; \nreducing health care costs; reducing litigation costs; reducing \ninsurance costs; strengthening energy policy, which we are doing in \nconference right now; and, I would also add, enacting strong asbestos \nreform. These are the sorts of policies that will increase \nproductivity. They will increase predictability in the marketplace, and \nthey ultimately will stoke the engines of economic growth.\n  I am really, for the first time, becoming optimistic that we have \nturned this corner and that we will see continued improvement. The \nagenda items we are working on to complete this session--many of which \nwe just discussed--will lead to more jobs, more prosperity, and a solid \neconomic recovery.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a request?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, let me make a comment about the \nappropriations bills, then about the Energy conference, and then I want \nto talk a bit about the Department of Homeland Security and the ban on \ntravel to Cuba.\n  First, the appropriations bills.\n  Our colleague, the majority leader, Senator Frist, talked just a bit \nabout that today in response to questions by the Senator from Nevada. \nMy understanding is the bills are all ready to come to the floor of the \nSenate. We were told in early September that we would, when returning \nfrom the August break, be on appropriations bills. We passed all 13 \nappropriations bills through the Appropriations Committee in the \nSenate. Yet since we passed a continuing resolution, because we did not \nhave the appropriations bills done by October 1, since that time we \nhave not completed even one additional appropriations bill.\n  I know the chairman of the Appropriations Committee wants to get \nthese bills to the floor. But instead the leader is scheduling other \nissues. I am not suggesting the other issues are unimportant, but we \nhave a responsibility to meet a deadline with appropriations bills; and \nthe question is, Where are they, and why are they not being brought to \nthe floor of this Senate?\n  I do not understand it, nor do most of my colleagues.\n  If the Committee on Appropriations has finished its work on the \nbills, why\n\n[[Page S12909]]\n\nare they not being debated on the floor of the Senate? If there is an \nintention to do one, big, continuing resolution, one large omnibus \nbill, and not have us consider on the floor of this Senate up to six \nappropriations bills, then the opportunity for a good many Senators to \noffer amendments and deal with these in a routine legislative way will \nbe lost. I suspect that is what some are wanting to have happen. It is \nnot something that looks like the legislative process as I know it.\n  Mark Twain once said: The more you explain it, the more I don't \nunderstand it. That is the case with these appropriations bills. They \nare ready. They ought to be brought to the floor, and they ought to be \na priority now. I hope the majority leader and others who are doing the \nscheduling here in the Senate will understand that and bring \nappropriations bills to the floor.\n  Mr. President, let me now just talk for a moment about something else \nthat is happening that concerns us. We have an Energy conference. My \ncolleague Senator Bingaman spoke on the floor about this yesterday. We \nhave an Energy conference. I am a conferee. I have not been invited to \na conference meeting at this point because the Republicans have decided \nthey will not allow Democratic conferees to be a part of the process.\n  What they are saying is, they will give us the conference report 24 \nhours ahead of time, and then we will have a meeting. Apparently that \nis now planned for next week. We were told it was going to be last \nSaturday, then perhaps a meeting this Monday. Now it will probably be \nnext Friday, and a meeting the following Monday.\n  In any event, there are a couple hundred pages of that report which \nhave been agreed to by Republicans dealing with very important, very \ncomplicated pieces of legislation--the electricity title, the ethanol \ntitle--and yet we are told, despite the fact it is now agreed to and \ncompleted, that those of us who were never invited to a conference are \nnot allowed to see the conference report.\n\n  It is inexplicable to me. It is, in my judgment, a legislative \nprocess that is broken. I have told the chairman of the committee on \nthis side, he would not stand for that in a moment. He would be on this \nfloor pointing into the noses of those who are doing it to say that is \nnot the way to legislate. To ask representatives of 49 Senators here in \nthe Senate to simply sit by patiently while a conference occurs and \nwhile Democrats are excluded is an arrogance I think that is \nfundamentally wrong and unsound, and I think it threatens the future of \nan energy bill. It is the wrong way to get cooperation and the wrong \nway to write an energy bill.\n  It seems to me there are good ideas on both sides of the aisle in the \nCongress, and they ought to be available in a conference, as \nconferences are usually held, to be able to improve and write a \nbipartisan energy bill. But, once again, quoting Mark Twain: The more \nyou explain it, the more I don't understand it.\n  The fact is, you can talk about this 100 different ways, and there is \nno justification for two people in the Congress to decide: We are going \nto convene in a room someplace, shut the door, and tell you what the \nenergy policy is going to be for this country. It risks, I think, the \nability to get an energy bill. I believe we need an energy bill for \nthis country's future.\n  Having said that, Mr. President, let me just talk about another issue \nthat has gotten very little attention but ought to, in my judgment.\n  The President gave a speech a couple of weeks ago saying he is going \nto crack down on travel in Cuba, because there is a law against \ntraveling in Cuba.\n  Inexplicably, Americans cannot travel in Cuba. This country is trying \nto punish Fidel Castro for his abuses, and I agree with that. But in \norder to slap Fidel Castro around and punish Fidel Castro, this \nadministration is going to limit the American people's freedom to \ntravel. Oh, the American people can travel almost anywhere else--to \nCommunist China, Communist Vietnam--but you cannot travel in Cuba.\n  The President gave a speech, I suspect aimed mostly at voters in \nFlorida, saying we are going to crack down on casual travel in Cuba. He \ndid not say ``casual travel.'' But I know it is casual travel because \nthey are chasing retired schoolteachers who rode bicycles in Cuba. They \nare denying licenses to farm groups who want to go and promote and sell \nagricultural products in Cuba, part of which is now legal because of an \namendment that I and then-Senator Ashcroft got passed in the Senate \nthat became law. But they are trying to stop farm groups from promoting \nagriculture products in Cuba by denying licensees travel in Cuba.\n  The President said we are going to have the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, which is designed to protect this country against a terrorist \nattack, exert its resources to clamp down on travel in Cuba. Here is \nwhat the Department's Web site says: ``The Department of Homeland \nSecurity will use intelligence and investigative resources to identify \ntravelers or businesses engaged in activities that circumvent the \nembargo.''\n  We are going to have the Department of Homeland Security, which is \nsupposed to be protecting us from terrorists, now using investigative \nresources and also intelligence resources to try to track down people \nwho are traveling in Cuba. They are doing that at the direction of the \nPresident.\n  Well, let me just give as example one of the kind of people they are \ngoing to use their intelligence and investigative capabilities to track \ndown: Joan Slote. Joan, as you can see from this picture, rides a \nbicycle. She is in her mid 70s. She is a Senior Olympian. She joined a \nbicycle tour of Cuba with a Canadian group.\n  She had no idea it was illegal for an American to bicycle in Cuba. \nBut she went there and came back and discovered she was fined $7,630 by \nthe U.S. Department of Treasury. They slapped her around. Shame on you \nfor bicycling in Cuba. We will fine you $7,630.\n  I said to the Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets \nControl, which is called OFAC: You ought to be ashamed of yourselves. \nYou are supposed to be tracking financial records of terrorists, and \nyou are tracking little old ladies who ride bicycles in Cuba. They \nagreed, after some embarrassment, to reduce her fine to $1,900. Then \n2\\1/2\\ months after she sent them a check, she got a letter from a \ncollection agency saying they were going to enforce collection, and \nthey were going to begin to take her Social Security payments. This was \nafter she had paid the fine.\n  But there are more than just Joan Slote. Let me give other examples \nof whom they are investigating. Cevin Allen decides to take the ashes \nof his dead father to Cuba to sprinkle on the lawn of the church where \nhis father ministered. It was his father's last request. They fine him \nfor illegal travel to Cuba. That is who Department of Homeland Security \nnow says they will use intelligence and investigative methods to track, \npeople who travel illegally in Cuba, taking your dead father's ashes to \nsprinkle on the ground in Cuba.\n  Marilyn Meister, a 72-year-old Wisconsin schoolteacher, she also had \na bicycle trip to Cuba. She was fined $7,500. Donna Schutz, a social \nworker from Chicago, went on a tour, she was fined $7,600; Kurt Foster. \nTom Warner, 77 years old, a World War II veteran, posted on his Web \nsite the schedule for the February annual meeting of the U.S.- Cuba \nSister Cities Association in Havana. He never even went to Cuba. But \nthis administration, clamping down on Cuban travel, said Warner was \n``organizing, arranging, promoting, and otherwise facilitating the \nattendance of persons at the conference without a license.'' He did not \nattend the conference. And the conference was licensed by OFAC. All he \nwas doing was posting information on his Web site. He was given 20 days \nto tell OFAC everything he knows about the conference and the \norganizations that participate in it. He has now hired a lawyer.\n  What is going on? We are chasing Joan Slote who rode a bicycle in \nCuba for thousands of dollars of civil fines, and now the President \nsays we want to use the Department of Homeland Security to investigate \nand use intelligence resources to identify Americans who travel to \nCuba. It is the most preposterous thing. Have they lost all common \nsense?\n  I understand the President's announcement. That is pure politics. But \nordering the Department of Homeland Security to use precious assets? Do \nyou\n\n[[Page S12910]]\n\nknow that we inspect less than 5 percent of the 7.6 million containers \nthat come into this country every year on ships. Yet we are going to \nuse Homeland Security assets to track little old ladies riding bikes in \nCuba so we can slap a $7,500 fine on them? It is unbelievable to me. \nYet nobody seems to be too concerned about it. We are going to hurt \nFidel Castro by limiting the right of the American people to travel.\n  We have enough votes to lift the travel ban. You can travel virtually \nanywhere else in the world. I happen to believe the best way to get rid \nof Fidel Castro is travel and trade. Just as we argue that is the case \nwith Communist China, just as we argue that is the case with the \nCommunist country of Vietnam, it is clear to me that the quickest way \nto change the Government in Cuba is travel and trade. That Government \nwill not be able to resist the influences of travel and trade. It will \nundermine it.\n  But a 40-plus year embargo has failed. It is time to understand that. \nIt makes no sense. I am wondering how many of my colleagues really \nsupport this, having the Department of Homeland Security use scarce \ninvestigative and intelligence assets to identify travelers who are \ngoing to Cuba to ride a bicycle or perhaps to take their dead father's \nashes to sprinkle on the church where he ministered. Is that what we \nshould be doing? I think not. Yet the President gives a speech aimed \ndirectly at the center of the bull's eye of Florida politics and says: \nWe are going to tighten up. We are getting tough. I will have the \nDepartment of Homeland Security investigate and use intelligence to \ntrack Americans who travel in Cuba. It is unbelievable.\n  I hope we can get a vote on this. One of the reasons we may not is we \nmay not get appropriations bills on the floor of the Senate because a \nhalf a dozen of them are through the Appropriations Committee and are \nnot being brought to the floor. If they are here, we have a chance to \noffer an amendment. Without it, when they are put in an omnibus, there \nwill be no amendments. So we will see. If there is in the future some \nomnibus appropriations bill that is cobbled together by the leadership \nin the month of October with appropriations bills that have not \npreviously been considered on the Senate floor, we will not be able to. \nWe will be prevented from offering amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota \nfor his comments and associate myself with them as well.\n  As we move through Appropriations Committees, there are a number of \nimportant issues that confront us. I rise to speak to the issue of \nhealth care and add my voice to the growing chorus of people who are \nconcerned about our Nation's health and want us to have a sense of \nurgency about health care.\n  We have just passed a bill that will allow our tax dollars to be used \nin Iraq for a universal government-paid health care system for the \nIraqis. There are people in the United States asking: What about us; \nwhat about making sure each of us has health care as well?\n  There are businesses seeing their premiums double. The average small \nbusiness is seeing their premiums double now every 5 years, and that \nis, in fact, growing even higher. Large businesses, negotiating \ncontracts, find themselves dealing with the issue of health care as the \ntop concern of both the business and employees.\n  When we look internationally at our ability to compete around the \nworld, the health care system that is tied to employment has created a \nsituation where our large businesses competing in the world are having \nmore difficulties competing successfully in this competitive \nenvironment where every dollar counts. We are hearing from unusual \nplaces a call for a focus on health care, a focus on a more universal \nkind of system that will allow us to have the health care we want for \nour families and our businesses to be able to compete both within our \ncountry and around the world.\n  What is most disturbing is when we look at the numbers in terms of \nthe costs going up and the number of people now without insurance. A \nnew survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and \nEducation Trust found that employer-sponsored health insurance premiums \nincreased almost 14 percent this year. This is the seventh straight \nyear of premium increases and the largest increase since 1990. Premiums \nnow average over $9,000 a year for the typical family health insurance \npolicy. And for an individual, it is $3,383. Rising premiums are \nplacing a very heavy financial burden on our families and are making it \nincreasingly difficult for families to find and afford health care.\n  Because there is no successful plan to stimulate the economy right \nnow, we are seeing more and more Americans go without health care and \nother basic needs. According to a recently released U.S. Census Report, \nthe number of Americans without health insurance has jumped by 5.7 \npercent to almost 44 million people. That equals the populations of 24 \nStates plus Washington, DC. Think about that. The number of people who \nare uninsured now equals the population of 24 States and Washington, \nDC. If this is not a crisis, if we do not need a sense of urgency, I \ndon't know when we will, when we look at what is happening.\n  Families U.S.A. has done their 2001-2002 survey and determined that \nin Michigan 2.3 million Michiganians under age 65 went without health \ninsurance sometime within that year. That means one in four people in \nmy great State of Michigan, under the age of 65, went without health \ncare during this time period. This is not acceptable and we need a \nsense of urgency about these issues.\n  Who are these people? Well, the majority of them are working. \nActually, more than 80 percent of the uninsured live in working \nfamilies. The majority of those who are uninsured are working. So this \nis a small business issue. This is an issue of people who are working \nbut are not in businesses that can afford health insurance themselves \nfor their employees, which is why we need to tackle this issue working \nwith our small business community as well as our large business \ncommunity.\n  When one member of a family is uninsured, it can affect all of the \nfamily and their quality of life. We know many young people going out \ninto their first jobs are not insured and run a high risk of something \nhappening and of their not being able to deal with it in a productive \nway.\n  One of my major concerns right now, as we move forward in the work on \na Medicare prescription drug benefit, is that we not forget that there \nare important parts of cost containment in that legislation that would \naffect all of those who need health insurance, or have health \ninsurance. We know that about half of the reason the cost of insurance \npremiums is going up for businesses right now is because of the cost of \nprescription drugs.\n  So one of the primary ways we can help businesses to be able to \nafford health insurance and be able to provide more opportunities for \npeople to have health insurance is to lower the price of prescription \ndrugs. The average prescription brand name drug is going up faster than \nthree and a half times the rate of inflation. So when we look at what \nwe are debating right now under Medicare, there are two very important \nfocus areas for us. One is to eliminate patent loopholes that stop \npatents from coming to an end and allow lower cost, unadvertised brands \nto be able to go on the market through our generic drug process.\n  We passed a bipartisan bill in the Senate not once but twice since I \nhave been here in the last 2\\1/2\\ years. This needs to be passed by the \nentire Congress and put on the President's desk this year, whether it \nis part of the Medicare conference report or whether it is done \nseparately.\n  We also know that if we create more competition by tearing down this \nartificial border which doesn't allow Americans to purchase safe FDA-\napproved prescriptions from other countries, particularly Canada, where \nwe know their supply chain and safety processes are virtually \nequivalent to ours, if we do that, we can also create great competition \nto lower prices.\n  There are a lot of stories right now in the paper about concerns \nabout the safety of prescription drugs at home as well as abroad--\nlegitimate issues that deal with what is happening with\n\n[[Page S12911]]\n\nwholesalers in our country, issues that need to be addressed by the FDA \nand all of us. We need to be increasing the ability for the FDA to have \nthe inspectors and enforcement powers against those kinds of activities \nthat create unsafe medication.\n  But when you talk about the issue of what has been called \nimportation, we are talking about a process that allows the local \npharmacist, the licensed pharmacist at the local pharmacy or the local \nhospital, to have the same ability to do what every part of the \npharmaceutical industry does right now, which is to do business with \nthose in another country and bring a supply chain of prescription drugs \nback to the local pharmacies.\n\n  The reason we are seeing so much activity now, so many ways people \nare trying to find prescription drugs that are affordable to them, is \nbecause prices are too high. The fact is that people cannot afford \ntheir cancer medicine, their blood pressure medicine, and those other \nkinds of medicines they need to be able to live productive lives or, in \nmany cases, be able to survive.\n  The reason we are seeing so many people looking for other ways to \nfind prescription drugs is because the prices are too high. We need to \nwork together to have a system with integrity and with safety, that \ncreates a product that is affordable, that creates a product that can \nbe available to our citizens who desperately need these lifesaving \nmedicines.\n  If we do that, we address half the reason health care costs are \nrising. We then need to focus on the question of the uninsured and how \nwe partner to be able to make sure people have access to health care, \nso we can bring those prices down.\n  In closing, we need a sense of urgency about health care. We need a \nsense of urgency here just as every business, every employee, every \nfamily has a sense of urgency about health care now and whether it will \nbe available to their families. I hope we will make that a top priority \nfor this Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, before the Senator leaves the floor, I \nhave observed that she has been diligent in continuing to focus on \nhealth care issues, including our need to somehow effect and moderate \nthe growing cost of health care in this country. She has seen an exodus \nof manufacturers out of her State and millions of manufacturing jobs \nfrom the United States. Among the reasons why they are leaving is the \nextraordinary cost of health care. Companies also tell us they are \nconsidering other places to locate and do business because of \nlitigation costs, legal costs that flow out of the costs of doing \nbusiness in our country. Those costs could deal with asbestos \nlitigation, which has taken down now over 60 companies that have gone \nbankrupt.\n  Unfortunately, a lot of people who have been hurt or exposed to \nasbestos haven't gotten the kind of money their families deserve, and \npeople who haven't been sick have taken away money from those who need \nit.\n  Another area with respect to legal costs that will get a lot of \nattention on this floor this week is the cost of class action \nlitigation and whether or not the way our class action system works in \nthis country is appropriate or needs to be changed.\n  Let me say from the outset that I think when a person is hurt or \ndamaged in some way by the acts of another person or a company, that \nperson should be compensated. They should be made whole. When a number \nof people, or a class of people, are hurt or damaged in some way by the \nactions of a company or business, that class of people should be \ncompensated and made whole as well.\n  I submit to my colleagues today that our sense of balance, though, \nhas been lost. We are seeing national class action litigation not \ntaking place in Federal courts but in many instances taking place in \nlocal courts with locally elected judges against defendants from other \nStates.\n  When the Framers of our Constitution provided for a Federal \njudiciary, one of the reasons they did so was to say when you have \nplaintiffs in one State and you have defendants in another State, just \nto make sure there is an objective legal system, we need a Federal \njudiciary to help provide for that leveling of the playing field.\n  All too often today national class action litigation pits plaintiffs \nin one State and defendants in another State in a local court where you \nhave a locally elected judge whose election or reelection depends in no \nsmall part on their ability to satisfy the plaintiffs within their \nState. We've just lost our sense of balance.\n  There have been efforts for five years now to try to make changes \nwith respect to class action litigation. It started out far different \nthan where it has ended up. The current bill is much more moderate than \nthose that came before it. Also, there is no effort with this bill to \ncap noneconomic or attorneys' fees. There is no effort to limit joint \nand several liability.\n  I want to talk about the bill that will come to the Senate floor if \nwe agree to the motion to proceed tomorrow.\n  First of all, the legislation that will come to us is not perfect. It \nmight need to be amended or changed further. It is certainly not the \nfinal product, but it is a good starting point. If we agree to the \nmotion to proceed tomorrow--it takes 60 votes--we will have the \nopportunity for those of us on our side, the Democratic side, and the \nRepublican side, to offer amendments, to have a full and open debate \nand decide whether or not we are going to change the bill. It can be \nimproved, and I certainly will support amendments. I may talk about \nthose later today or tomorrow.\n  Let me take a minute to describe the legislation that may come to the \nfloor. The issue we are trying to get at is venue shopping, where you \nhave, in some cases, litigation that is being brought and litigation of \nnational scope that ought to be in a Federal court, where the attorneys \nwho brought the lawsuit are looking for a venue where they can get a \nfriendly judge and friendly jury.\n  In some places, it is almost a cottage industry, whether it is \nMadison County, IL; Jefferson County, TX; and other places, such as \nAlabama and Mississippi. There is a perception that a defendant is not \ngoing to get a fair shake in a national class action litigation in \nthose venues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time controlled by the minority for \nmorning business has expired.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank the Chair. I will have more to say about this \nlater today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I ask that the next 15 minutes be \nequally divided between the Senator from Idaho, Mr. Craig, and the \nSenator from Oregon, Mr. Smith.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I and my colleague need to be off the \nfloor by 10:30 a.m. Will the Chair alert me when 5 minutes have passed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so notify the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/21/senate-section/article/S12911-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12911-S12912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ENERGY AND THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I am here this morning to talk about the \nreality of U.S. prosperity and how it is so closely tied to a reliable, \naffordable energy supply. The U.S. economy has suffered for the last 3 \nyears because of severe energy price fluctuations. Energy supplies have \noften been barely adequate and, in most instances, in high demand. I \nbelieve failure to enact an Energy bill will have dire consequences on \nall Americans, especially our economy, our workforce, and those who are \nbuilding the American dream.\n  There is a growing sense of urgency amongst American manufacturers, \nsmall businesses, and others that they simply cannot remain competitive \nunless we have enough reasonably priced energy to meet their demands at \na time when certain costs in our energy sector are skyrocketing, and \nthat, in my opinion, has been a major factor in contributing to the \nprolonging of a recession.\n  Rising fuel costs helped cause the deepening of the recession in the \npast four recessions we have recorded: In the 1970s, in the early \n1980s, in 1990 and 1991, and now the 2000 recession. When we look \nbackward, when we talk with economists who study this issue, all of \nthem will tie it to a spike in energy prices and the cost of energy \nrippling across the economy.\n\n[[Page S12912]]\n\n  Abundant, affordable energy stimulates economic growth. Fluctuating \nenergy prices have cost America many jobs in the last 3 years. The \nmanufacturing sector has experienced over the past 2 years consecutive \njob losses, having lost over 2 million jobs. The National Manufacturing \nAssociation said that it has been caused in significant part to energy \nprice spikes in 2000.\n  During the winter of 2000 and 2001, natural gas prices skyrocketed. \nCurtailments became common in the Northeast and in the upper Midwest. \nSkyrocketing natural gas prices of last winter went even higher than 2 \nyears ago. Now many companies that have tried to secure this gas are \nshutting down simply because they can't afford to blend it into their \nstream. They can't afford the costs, and their product produced by it \nbecomes noncompetitive. As a result, significant job loss has occurred.\n  The U.S. chemical, plastics, and fertilizer industries have been \namong the hardest hit, largely due to their dependency on affordable \nnatural gas in the face of fierce international competition.\n  Electric utilities continue to build natural gas generation. Houses \ncontinue to be built and are plugged into the gas lines.\n  The Energy bill we are working on will both save jobs and create jobs \nby bringing affordable natural gas out of Alaska. The Presiding Officer \ncertainly knows about this. Some 35 trillion cubic feet of natural gas \ncan be brought to the lower 48 States. That and the construction of \nthat pipeline could well create over 400,000 jobs. Federal royalties \ncould flow from it at $48 billion, a new Federal revenue to reduce our \ndeficit and again create jobs.\n  The Energy bill we are completing in conference calls for the \ninvestment of hundreds of millions of dollars in research and \ndevelopment in new energy technologies. This investment creates new \njobs in engineering, math, chemistry, physics, science, and all related \nfields are tied into this kind of investment, this kind of development.\n\n  The bill increases America's stake in nuclear energy, encouraging the \nconstruction of a Federal advanced nuclear reactor for the production \nof electricity and hydrogen and new technology, driving that industry \nforward and, once again, allowing America to lead the world in this \nkind of technology, this kind of advancement: Clean, manageable, safe \nforms of electrical production.\n  Our bill will facilitate the expansion and the modernization of our \nnational electrical grid. It will create additional opportunities for \ninvestments in pipelines and transmission lines and encourage the \nprivate investment in electricity transmission--all this creating more \njobs.\n  The Energy bill will provide $2 billion in investment and clean coal \ntechnology, creating engineering and research jobs. The investment also \nprotects existing coal mining jobs and processing jobs to ensure the \nlongevity of the American coal industry.\n  We protect jobs in the gas and oil industry by encouraging deep well \nexploration of oil and natural gas at a time when domestic oil \nproduction is dropping and that level of production is flat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will proceed for 1 more minute.\n  By stimulating our production of oil and gas, we not only produce the \nenergy necessary to fuel our economy, we not only protect tens of \nthousands of jobs, but we will create abundant new jobs.\n  Lastly, we had Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who spoke \nbefore the Energy Committee, both of the House and the Senate, and he \nsaid:\n\n       It is essential that we do not lose sight of the policies \n     needed to ensure long-term economic growth. One of the most \n     important objectives of these policies should be an assured \n     availability of energy . . . Developments in energy markets \n     will remain central in determining the longer run health of \n     our nation's economy.\n\n  We all understand that. Now is the opportunity and the time to \nfinalize a national energy policy, to pass it out of the Congress and \nput it on our President's desk. It is our future. It is one of the \ngreatest job creators on which the Senate will ever vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/21/senate-section/article/S12912-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12912-S12914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, along with my colleague from the State of \nIdaho, I will talk in morning business about the economy. We have heard \nfor 2\\1/2\\, nearly 3 years of the Bush Presidency that President Bush \nis responsible for the economic downturn. Little is said about the \neconomic facts that existed when he took his oath of office; \nspecifically, that the economy was in a tailspin, that Wall Street had \nlost at least $7 trillion of equities, and unemployment was rising \ndramatically.\n  Indeed, President Bush inherited a situation that was not of his \nmaking and frankly not even of President Clinton's making, because we \nhad witnessed the bursting of a stock market bubble and the dashing of \nhopes of tens of thousands of pensioners all over this country.\n  It is a fact of political life that politicians are given too much \ncredit and too much blame for the natural, immutable cycles of a free \nmarket economy. The latest casualty in this judgment on politicians is \nprobably Governor Gray Davis of California. I remember during the \nheydays, the bubble days, California was held up as the miracle model \nand Governor Davis was hailed as a hero. He accepted the credit.\n  I heard, with some pain, frankly, the other day when he acknowledged \nhow much economic trouble they were in and that he had gotten too much \ncredit for the good times and now was getting too much blame for the \nbad times. Guess what. Governor Davis was right. The truth of the \nmatter is we in public life do not control a free market economy, and \nif we ever do, we will have a socialist economy which will ill serve \nthe American people.\n\n  Before I came to this Chamber, I ran a business. On a seasonal basis, \nwe employed as many as 1,200 people. During the Reagan years, they were \nboom years; they were wonderful years. In trying to expand my business, \nI always remembered the factors that helped me make a decision whether \nto invest in a new piece of equipment or to acquire another plant. It \nhad little to do with who the President of the United States was. It \nhad little to do with the fact that I was proud that Ronald Reagan was \nmy President.\n  Two of the factors Government did have an impact upon, beyond \nregulation, were interest rates, which are controlled by the Federal \nReserve, and taxes, which are controlled by the Congress and the \nPresident.\n  In those days, taxes were coming down, interest rates were falling, \nand the American economy was booming. Then during the Clinton years, \nthere was a business correction under President Bush. As President \nClinton took his oath of office, the American economy again boomed with \nproductivity and prosperity, and President Clinton was great to take \ncredit for the conditions of our free market economy but wanted nothing \nto do with its collapse as he left the Presidency. Again, too much \ncredit, too much blame, for President Clinton and President Bush.\n  As I listen to those who aspire to the Presidency to replace our \ncurrent President, I hear them speak of the Bush economy in the most \nderisive of terms, but I wonder how they are beginning to factor in all \nthe good news that is beginning to come out about the American economy, \nas the immutable cycles of supply and demand, the falling of tax rates, \nthe falling of interest rates, are beginning to show up in the lives of \nthe American people. How will they deal with the fact that consumption \nhas been rising and topped 12 percent on an annual rate last month, and \nthat has the potential to translate into economic growth, GDP, of 6 \npercent? I suspect it will probably top out somewhere around 4 percent, \nbut that is a very healthy economy. How will they deal with the fact \nthat jobless claims are falling, and quickly, in many parts of our \ncountry? In fact, jobless claims are now lower than they were in \nFebruary.\n  More good news: production in our Nation's factories has increased, \nnot decreased. Home-building starts are now at record levels. Over 1.9 \nmillion new homes on an annual basis are on the books now and being \nbuilt as we speak. This is the second highest level of home building in \n17 years.\n\n[[Page S12913]]\n\n  I believe consumers understand that things are improving and there is \nreason to feel that once again morning is coming to America and good \ndays are ahead. But we can yet do more. I think we can do that in the \nFSC bill that has gone through our Finance Committee and is now in a \nconference committee. It contains a feature I helped get into the bill, \nas a most important provision, called repatriation. This is a provision \nthat will bring at least $300 billion of new investment in the next \nyear into the United States. What does it mean to companies in Oregon \nsuch as Nike, Intel, and Hewlett-Packard, which are our biggest \nemployers? It means they can bring these foreign profits back for \ninvestment in American jobs.\n  Some say it is not good tax policy. Some say it is not fair. I say, \ndo we want the jobs or do we not? If one wants to understand what this \nmeans in very real human terms to this country, recently Dr. Allen \nSinai completed a study on what repatriation would mean to this \ncountry. He said it would mean up to 650,000 additional jobs created in \nthe first 2 years. He said $70 billion of the deficit would be \neliminated. He said that increased GDP could be enhanced by 7 to 9 \npercent by 2005. He also said business capital spending, primarily of \nequipment, could peak at $75 billion by 2005. We can do more and \nGovernment should do what it can. It cannot control the cycles of \nsupply and demand, but we can keep downward pressure on interest rates. \nWe can keep downward pressure on taxes. We can keep rules and \nregulations reasonable and we can allow the genius of the American \npeople to be manifested again in a free market economy.\n\n  Finally, I think it is very important to note that our friends on the \nother side who say the key to American prosperity is to invest in \npublic things, in public investments, are right at the margins, but \nthey are not right at the center. What makes America work is \nentrepreneurial spirit with the right environment to invest to produce \nquality products we can afford, and to provide a service that makes us \nhappy.\n  Ultimately, those who come with great jobs bills of public works--if \nthat really could make an economy hum, then Japan would be leading the \nworld and many European countries would be leading the world because \nthey have fallen for this short-term, sugar-coated candy that says the \ngovernment can do it, private industry does not need to do it, and it \ncan be done through public works. If that were true, then the New Deal \nwould have ended the Great Depression, but it did not. World War II \ndid.\n  If that were true, then Japan and Europe would be leading the \neconomies of the world instead of waiting for the American free market \neconomy to begin taking off again.\n  In conclusion, I think the good news is the American economy is \nbeginning to hum again. For that, I am very thankful.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I will take the remainder of our time to \ntalk a little bit about jobs, an issue that has been highest on our \nagenda on this side of the aisle for a good long time, and continues to \nbe. First, I have to react a little bit to some of the comments that \nwere made earlier about moving forward. I am very frustrated that each \nbill brought to this floor is slowed down either by objection or by a \nweek's discussion and debate of amendments. Of course, everyone is \nentitled to offer amendments. But when you have to stay with a bill \nthat is fairly simple and be there for a week and a half and then \ncomplain about not getting our jobs done, that is sort of ironic.\n\n  Obviously, we have at least four things that need to be done in the \nnext several weeks. We have to continue the supplemental bill to pay \nfor our Armed Forces in Iraq as well as to get Iraq in a position to \nallow us to leave and take care of themselves.\n  We do have appropriations left. We have six that are not done yet. So \nwe do have to worry about that and move forward.\n  We have the opportunity to do something with health care, \nparticularly pharmaceuticals and Medicare, and we are in a position to \ndo that.\n  We also have an opportunity to do more with energy than we have done \nfor a very long time. I recall, having been on the Energy Committee \nboth this year and last year, when we were in conference. We had a \nconference last year, you recall, and never succeeded in getting the \nbill finished.\n  So we have some real challenges. Frankly, I have become surprised at \nthe kind of reaction we get off the floor, that almost every issue is \ndesigned to be critical of the Bush administration. What we ought to be \ndoing is doing our job, to do the things that need to be done and that \nare pending for us to do and that we can do and will do some great \nthings for the country.\n  I would like to talk a little about jobs. Of course they are most \nimportant to all of us. There are some good signs in the job market. \nThe Labor Department reported on October 3 that employment rose by \n57,000 last month, the first increase since January. The unemployment \nrate held steady. So we seem to be having some signs of getting that \njob situation back where we would like it to be.\n  We have had on our agenda a list of things that are designed to help \ncreate jobs and, as the Senator from Oregon indicated, the economy is \nwhat creates jobs--not the Government. But we can do things that help \nstimulate the economy which cause job growth.\n  One of them that is most important, and that has already been talked \nabout by my friend from Idaho, an issue that is very important to me, \nis energy security, the Energy bill. Energy security for this country \nmeans job security and the creation of jobs.\n  The comprehensive Energy bill we are talking about here has been \nscored to have about 700,000 jobs that could be accentuated and could \nbe encouraged by the passage of this bill. Many of the jobs will come \nfrom construction. Some have to do with the possibility of a pipeline \nin Alaska. Others have to do with domestic production.\n  Of course, energy has a great deal to do with our whole business \ncommunity, our whole business interest. Everyone relies on available \nand affordable energy. Certainly one of the things we have to continue \nto recall is we have become almost 60-percent dependent on foreign oil. \nWe need to do something about that. We have seen our gas supply in \ngreat demand and the prices rise while at the same time we have \nresources of gas that can be made available. We need to encourage that \ndevelopment.\n  We have an Energy bill that is quite balanced, it seems to me. We \ntalk about research that will make coal more clean so we can use the \ncoal, which is our largest fossil resource that we have available to us \nfor electricity.\n  We have renewables in there. We will continue to work on electric \nenergy created by wind and make that more efficient. We have some \nthings in there for conservation. We can make better use of our energy \nand certainly that ought to be important to us as well.\n  In addition to that, and perhaps more important in the short term, is \nto increase domestic production. To do that, one of the opportunities \nis to make it economically possible for those who are developing it \nthrough some tax changes. Those seem to be held up now. We are hopeful \nwe can move forward and get that job done. It is available for us to do \nimmediately--this week, next week. We can get this done for the first \ntime in a number of years.\n  There are other items on the agenda that have to do with jobs. There \nis tort reform, asbestos litigation reform--which is available now to \ncome to the floor. There are different views about that, of course. \nThere is nothing wrong with that. But the fact is that would create new \njobs by allowing companies to divert some of their dollars from \nlitigation toward new investment, which creates jobs. The litigation \ndefense costs are tied directly to offset expenditures relating to \n138,000 jobs that could be replaced if we can do something about those \ndistortions in the economy.\n  Class action reform is here. In fact, we are going to vote on the \nopportunity to proceed with it tomorrow because it has been stopped by \nthe other side of the aisle. Here again, class action litigation causes \na good deal of confusion and uncertainty about the marketplace. \nIndustries do not know whether their money is going to be\n\n[[Page S12914]]\n\navailable for expansion and investment or whether it is going to have \nto be saved for payments on those things.\n  We have the workforce investment reauthorization. This will improve \njob training by focusing on core skills and encouraging effective \ncooperation among job training partners so people will be better \nprepared to take on the jobs that are available. Certainly what is \nhappening in this economy is it is a more high-tech economy and more \ntraining is needed.\n  We have the Foreign Competitiveness Act, which we are dealing with \nnow in the Finance Committee, where the tax situation we have now has \ncaused a WTO objection. But we can change that so it does fit into our \nforeign trade operation and at the same time continue to create more \njobs and to have businesses do better.\n  The Small Business Administration bill is there. That would help \nensure that SBA programs will continue to provide products and services \nessential for small businesses. That is where most of our jobs are, \nparticularly in a State such as mine, Wyoming. Almost all of our jobs \nare small businesses. So the SBA bill is certainly extremely important.\n  The Homeland Investment Act is pending, too. That allows the Internal \nRevenue Code to change with the objective of encouraging reinvestment \nof foreign earnings in this country. You would be surprised at the \namount of money that is involved, if we allowed companies that do some \nof their work overseas to take some of their profits home with a \nreasonable tax payment, and we would have more money for investment.\n  So we have a lot of things to do. We have some great opportunities. \nJobs certainly has to be the priority for all of us. The stock market \nis great. We love to see that grow up. But the fact is, jobs are the \nkey to our success. We want to continue to improve there.\n\n  Finally, let me say quickly that I certainly hope we can come out of \nthe committee and finish our work on the supplemental to supply funding \nfor our Armed Forces overseas and to do something in Iraq so we can \nmove ahead.\n  I had the occasion to be in Iraq and Afghanistan a week ago for a \nweek. Certainly it was an interesting situation. There is a little \ndifferent view there than what you hear from here. Certainly our troops \nhave done an outstanding job, and continue to do an outstanding job not \nonly on the war, not only on terrorism, but also helping to rebuild. \nWe, obviously, have some continuing problems there with terrorism and \nthat has to be handled, but we are moving toward having the Iraqis and \ntheir own police force moving into that.\n  But my point is, I hope we can get over there and put Iraq more \nquickly in a position to take care of themselves so we can bring our \ntroops home. In terms of overall expenditure, that of course would be \nour greatest saving.\n  I yield the floor and yield back the remaining time we have in \nmorning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/21/senate-section/article/S12914-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, we are here today on the verge of \nsomething the United States has done on two previous occasions; that \nis, pass a conference report to ban a partial-birth abortion procedure \nto be done in the United States of America. The only difference this \ntime is we have a President who has said he is willing to sign this \nlegislation. This is a very important day for this country and for \nthose babies who would be the object of this brutal procedure. Having \nit banned in the United States of America is a historic event and a \nstep forward in human rights for this country.\n  We have overcome two Presidential vetoes but now have a President who \nwill sign this legislation.\n  The other thing that stopped this legislation from moving forward and \nbecoming law was the United States Supreme Court decision in the \nNebraska partial-birth abortion case. We have addressed those issues. \nThere were two issues the court cited as its reason--in a 5-to-4 \ndecision--for finding the Nebraska partial-birth abortion statute \nunconstitutional.\n  Those two reasons were, No. 1, that the statute was vague. We have \namended the language of this statute to make sure that the description \nof a partial-birth abortion is clear to include only those types of \nabortions and not other late-term abortion procedures, which was the \nconcern of the court. We did so by a couple of things, but the most \nessential part was that the court found that the prior description \ncould have included other forms of abortion because during other types \nof late-term abortion procedures there may be a portion of the baby's \nbody that at some point during the abortion procedure may come outside \nof the mother.\n  As a result of that, this could have been broadly construed to \nabolish those procedures, also.\n\n  In our language we are very clear. We say that the term ``partial-\nbirth abortion'' means an abortion which the person performing the \nabortion:\n\n       (A) deliberately and intentionally vaginally delivers a \n     living fetus until, in the case of a head-first presentation, \n     [all new language] the entire fetal head is outside of the \n     body of the mother, or, in the case of breech presentation, \n     [that is, feet first] any part of the fetal trunk past the \n     navel is outside of the body of the mother . . .\n\n  Now, that specificity of talking about the way in which the child is \ndelivered and then killed is fundamentally different than anything we \nhad before. All we said before was that some portion of a living, \nintact fetus must be outside of the mother. That, the court found, was \na little too vague for them. It could have included other types of \nabortions. So we are being very clear. There is no other abortion \nprocedure which the entire fetal head would be presented with the child \nstill being alive out of the mother, or the child would be delivered \nall but the head at this point and then be killed. There can be no \nconfusion as to what procedure we are talking about in this case.\n  We believe with the language we have put in this bill we have now \nsolved the constitutional problem of vagueness.\n  The second issue is the issue of women's health. We have a \nsubstantial section of findings in this legislation.\n\n[[Page S12915]]\n\nMuch of those findings occurred since the case was tried at the \ndistrict court level of Nebraska, which was the record upon which the \nSupreme Court made its decision. There has been a substantial amount of \nevidence that has been printed in the record in Congress at \ncongressional hearings that show not only the overwhelming weight of \nevidence but the dispositive weight of that evidence in this procedure \nis never--I underscore never--necessary to protect the health of the \nmother.\n  So the court found there needed to be a health exception because \nthere may have been, according to the record they looked at in the \nNebraska case, there may have been an instance in which this could have \nbeen necessary.\n  We have, without question, clarified that record to make sure that \nthe court knows that there is no medical evidence out there that this \nprocedure is ever necessary to protect the health of a mother, and \ntherefore falls outside of Roe v. Wade where a health exception is \nnecessary. In fact, the overwhelming weight of medical evidence \nsuggests this is a dangerous procedure, a much more dangerous procedure \nfor a woman than the other abortion procedures that are used at this \ntime in pregnancy.\n  We believe this bill is constitutionally sound and obviously very \nnecessary from the standpoint of who we are as a society and, I argue, \nfor just basic human rights.\n  The question is, Why are we doing this? Let me describe the \nprocedure. I did not do that when we had the conference report being \nmoved to conference, but I think it is important for people who may not \nbe familiar with this procedure to see this procedure. I hope \nsensibilities are shaken to the point where I do not have to explain \nwhy we want to ban this procedure; that by going through this procedure \nand showing what happens to a baby who is at least 20 weeks of \ngestation--in other words, at least halfway through the pregnancy; with \n40 weeks gestation, this is at least 20 weeks, and in many cases, 21, \n22, 23, 24 weeks, and in rarer cases, beyond that--but these are babies \nwho would otherwise, had they been delivered, be born alive.\n\n  Now, in the case of 20 and 21 weeks, the chance of them surviving are \nnot particularly high, although there are cases in which babies at 21 \nweeks have survived. But the point is these are children who would \notherwise be born alive, and the people who perform these abortions, \nthe abortion provider organizations, have testified that these \nabortions are performed on healthy mothers with healthy children. These \nare healthy children who otherwise would be born alive had this \nprocedure not been performed on them. I put that in the context of this \nis what we are doing to healthy children, with healthy mothers who \notherwise would be born alive. These are children who, again, the \nmedical evidence has been presented, that experience and feel pain.\n  The partial-birth abortion takes 3 days. That is the normal time. \nWhat the doctor does when the mother presents to the abortionist--and I \nsay the ``abortionist'' because these are only done--again, this is \nclear from the record--these are only done in abortion clinics. The \nperson who designed this procedure did so, and he testified to this, \nfor his convenience because he can do more of them quicker. He can do \nmore abortions more often. He is in business. These late-term abortions \nare more complicated than earlier term abortions, and they take more \ntime using other methods, so he designed a method that would take less \ntime. So this method was designed not to protect the health of the \nmother.\n  In fact, it is less healthy; it is not to protect the mother's life. \nIt is never done in the case of an emergency.\n  You would not do this in the case of an emergency because it takes 3 \ndays to do this. It is done for the convenience of the abortionist, for \nthem to make more money.\n  So this procedure was designed for the mother to be presented, to be \ngiven something to help dilate the cervix. So when the mother re-\npresents in a couple of days, her cervix is dilated, the doctor has \naccess to the baby at this point.\n  What happens is, the doctor then takes the baby--because usually at \nthat gestational age the baby is in a breach position--and goes into \nthe uterus and grabs the child by one of the limbs, usually the leg or \nthe foot, and then--if the next chart will come up--pulls out the baby \nthrough the birth canal, feet first.\n  Now, I have been blessed to have my wife deliver seven children. One \nof the fears of any pregnancy is having the child being in a breach \nposition. Every obstetrician knows, everybody who has ever gone through \na pregnancy knows, that a breach position is a dangerous position for \nthe baby to be in; it is not the natural position to deliver a child. \nSo what we are doing here is performing a procedure that is inherently \ndangerous; that is, delivering in a breach position.\n  So you are pulling the baby through the birth canal. Again, this baby \nis alive. If the baby is not alive, it is not a partial-birth abortion \nunder the definition of the statute. The baby has to be alive and \nintact. So the baby is being pulled by these forceps from the mother.\n  Again, it is being pulled out completely--and, again, the definition \nthat is in the statute--until the trunk is exposed, at least past the \nnavel. So at least the lower extremities of the baby are exposed \noutside of the mother. As such, the term ``partial birth'' comes from \nthe fact that the baby is partially born, is in the process of being \ndelivered.\n  The physician--as you can see--is holding the baby in his or her \nhand. This child weighs about 1 pound. This is a fully formed baby. It \nis not completely formed, obviously, because it is of only 20 weeks \ngestation, but hands, arms--everything--legs, toes, ears, et cetera, \nall these things you see here, that is what a baby at that gestational \nage looks like. And the relative size, vis-a-vis the size of the hand, \nis a pretty accurate depiction. This is not a cartoon. This is an \naccurate scale medical drawing.\n  As you can see from the next depiction, the baby is born, really, \nwith the exception of the head. The thing that grabs at me is, here is \nthis child who is literally inches away from being born, who would \notherwise be born alive, and in almost all cases is a healthy child--it \nis not being done for any health reason of the mother or life reason of \nthe mother; it is simply being done because the mother wants to \nterminate her pregnancy very late in the pregnancy--and the doctor has \nto hold this living child in his or her hand, with the heart beating, \nwith the baby, who is probably in shock at this point, but moving and \nalive.\n  Then what the procedure calls for is these scissors, called \nMetzenbaum scissors. The doctor feels up the baby's back. The doctor \nfinds the base of the skull and then takes these sharp scissors and \nprobes in to find the point right at the base of the skull--and, as you \nknow, a baby's skull is soft. So they take these scissors and they \nthrust them into the baby's skull.\n  Now, Nurse Brenda Shafer, who has testified before Congress, said \nthat when that thrusting action took place, she saw the baby's arms and \nlegs spasm out like this--like a baby you would hold, and if you \npretended you were going to drop the baby, how the baby sometimes would \nspasm their arms and legs out like that. That is what she said \nhappened.\n  Then, as you see from this picture, the baby's arms and legs go limp, \nbecause when you thrust a pair of scissors in the back of baby's skull, \nyou kill the baby.\n\n  But that is not enough. Now we have to remove the rest of the baby. \nSo what the abortionist does is take a suction catheter, a vacuum hose, \nand, in the hole created by these scissors, they place a vacuum hose, \nand they suck the baby's brains out to collapse the skull. It is a soft \nskull. At that point, the rest of the baby can then be removed from the \nmother's womb.\n  This goes on in America virtually every day, maybe more than once or \ntwice a day, depending on whom you believe, anywhere from a few hundred \ntimes a year to a few thousand times a year. We never have very good \ninformation because the very people who collect that information are \nthe people who oppose this procedure being banned, so they try not to \npublicize too much about what they do.\n  But the fact is, if it occurred once in America a year, this kind of \ntreatment to an innocent child, who would otherwise be born alive--was \nhealthy, with a healthy mother--there is no excuse for it.\n\n[[Page S12916]]\n\n  So when people ask the question, ``Senator, why do you keep bringing \nthis procedure back up to the Senate floor; it only stops one \nprocedure; you are not banning other procedures that are used,'' my \nanswer is, ``Because this is horrendous.''\n  In America, whether we like it or not, we are the beacon of freedom, \nbut in many cases we are also the model of what is right and just. The \nworld looks to us as Americans, as free people, as people who, probably \nuniquely in the world, get a chance to determine what our law should \nbe, what our collective morality should be, what our culture looks like \nbecause of the enormous freedom we have.\n  The heart and soul of America is reflected through our laws, unlike \nother countries that do not allow that democratic process to work so \neffectively. So when America passes laws, or when America allows \ncertain behavior to occur, the world looks at that law or that behavior \nas supported by the collective consciousness and morality of the \nAmerican public.\n  When they see this, what do they think of us? What do they think of \nus? What kind of culture do you think the rest of the world thinks \nAmerica is all about? What kind of morality or ethics do you think the \nworld thinks America is all about when they look at us and see that we \nallow this to be done to innocent little children?\n  So I think it is important for us to have laws that proscribe things \nthat we would not want our children to see, that I know a lot of people \ndo not want their children to see. My goodness, this goes on and you \nwant little children to see this? We don't want the rest of the world \nto see that we allow this kind of brutality to occur to innocent little \nchildren.\n  So the answer is, we need to do this for ourselves. We need to police \nourselves in what we are going to allow in our culture. We cannot allow \nthis kind of brutality to corrupt us, to corrupt our soul. And that is \nwhat it does. It makes us a much more brutal and harsh country if we \nstand here and say, yes, for whatever reason, we are going to allow \nthis to occur. It coarsens us, it dulls our senses, and that dulling of \nthe senses has a corrupting effect on not just how we treat little ones \nhere but how we treat each other in every aspect of our lives.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, do let me know when I have 2 minutes \nremaining out of my 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so advise the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I stand before my colleagues as a Senator \nfrom California but also as a mother who had two complicated \npregnancies and two wonderful, fabulous children, and also as a proud \ngrandmother. I stand before you to tell you this is a very sad day for \nthe women of America, a very sad day for the families of America, \nbecause what is about to happen here is this Senate is about to pass a \npiece of legislation that for the first time in history bans a medical \nprocedure without making any exception for the health of a woman. This \nis a radical thing that is about to happen.\n  Let's clear something up for the record. When the clerk read the \nbill, she said this is banning something commonly called partial-birth \nabortion. There is no such term in medicine as partial-birth abortion. \nThere is either a birth or there is an abortion. There is a \nmiscarriage. There is no such thing as partial-birth abortion. It is a \nmade-up term to inflame passions.\n  My friend knows very well, if he was willing to agree to a health \nexception to protect the health of women, if he would have sat down \nwith us on our side, we are ready to ban all late-term abortion. We are \nready to ban all late-term abortion on our side, as long as there is an \nexception for the life and the health of a woman, which is the \ncenterpiece of Roe v. Wade. If he was willing to do that, we would not \nbe taking the time of the Senate. This would be done.\n  This is more a case of wanting to keep an issue alive out there to \nmake people believe those on the other side are cruel, whether we are \nmothers or grandmothers or aunts. That is what it is about. It took me \na while to figure that out. But once I saw this bill come back to us in \nthis form--clearly unconstitutional, clearly without a health \nexception, clearly vague, and all those who have discussed this with me \ntell me it is clearly going to be declared unconstitutional because it \nis practically identical to other bills that have been declared \nunconstitutional--I saw what this is about. This is about politics. \nThat is what I believe. Because we could have a bill today, as long as \nwe protected the health of the women of this country.\n  Why would anyone in this Chamber be so callous as to pass a law \nknowingly keeping out a health exception for women? Well, if you listen \nto my friend's words and you hear the words he uses, you will \nunderstand why this is happening from the other side. My colleague uses \nthe term ``killing the child.'' As the author of the Violence Against \nWomen Act and the Violence Against Children Act, I take deep offense at \nthat language--deep offense. Women do not want to kill their child. \nWomen who have had this procedure have come to the Congress, have \nbegged Members of Congress: Do not pass this without a health exception \nfor the mother. If I didn't have this procedure, I would have been made \ninfertile.\n  I am going to go into those stories later in the debate. But here is \nthe situation. If you listen to the language ``killing the child,'' you \nmust come to the conclusion my colleague believes abortion is murder \nand women are murderers and doctors are accomplices. I thought we moved \naway from that when Roe v. Wade became the law of the land.\n  Why are we here today? I will be honest with you: because I didn't \nwant this bill to go through, and neither do people who believe women \nare important. Women deserve to have their health and lives protected \nand their fertility protected and their organs protected. Women want to \ntake a look at what this debate is all about. I have already told you \nwe were willing to go down the aisle with my friend and ban this, as \nlong as it was not vague and had a clear health exception for women. \nForget all this other talk about how cruel we all are. We were ready to \ndo that. But no, my friend and his colleagues had to keep this thing \ngoing. It is their way or the highway.\n\n  Forget about what the Supreme Court has said about vagueness. Forget \nabout what the Supreme Court has stated many times. This is basically a \nRepublican court that has upheld Roe v. Wade.\n  With the next breath my colleague says: This bill is consistent with \nRoe v. Wade. It doesn't do anything to Roe v. Wade.\n  If that is the case, why in the conference--and I was a conferee \nalong with the Senator from Pennsylvania--did they say--and they run \nthe Senate and the House and the White House--we are taking out the \nSenate amendment authored by Tom Harkin which simply said: The Congress \nbelieves that Roe v. Wade ought to be upheld?\n  There are two things in my friend's verbiage that show exactly what \nthis is about. One, the term, used over and over again, ``killing a \nchild,'' which gives me a very chilling feeling that what this whole \nthing is about is eventually saying women are murderers and should to \ngo jail, and doctors are their accomplices and they should go to jail. \nWhen you listen to verbiage, you hear a lot around here. And then, no \nproblem, this bill, he says, is just in concert with Roe v. Wade, even \nthough there is no health exception because they declared, in writing \nthis bill, that this procedure is never necessary to save the health of \na woman, which I will prove to you is made up.\n  The Senators on the other side who are pushing this are not doctors. \nThere is one, but he is not an OB/GYN. I would rather listen to the \ndoctors. I would rather listen to the health organizations rather than \nmy friend from Pennsylvania. I like him. We are friends. That is not \nthe point. We just strongly see this very differently. And we will \ncontinue to see this very differently as this issue goes on and on.\n  There we are. We are sitting in a conference committee. Here is where \nwe are. The House and the Senate passed different bills. What was \ndifferent about our bill, S. 3? Senator Harkin put in language, and the \nSenate voted on it twice--twice: once was unanimous, once was a \nmajority--to keep Roe v. Wade in the bill, a simple statement of \nsupport of Roe. So I come to\n\n[[Page S12917]]\n\nthe conference committee ready, along with Senator Feinstein, and other \nCongress people, to debate this issue. After all, my friend says here, \nwe don't have any problem with Roe. This has nothing to do with Roe.\n  Fine. Let's keep it in the bill, folks, a sense of the Senate that \nRoe v. Wade should not be overturned. The Senate voted for it twice.\n  Let me tell you how long it took them to kick that amendment out. It \nwas about 5 minutes. Not even a real discussion, not even a discussion \nabout an amendment that passed this Senate twice, not even a discussion \nabout a law which was a landmark law which passed in 1973, which has \nbeen upheld by the Supreme Court over and over and over. That is the \nkind of attitude you find from the other side when it comes to a \nwoman's right to choose. They threw out Roe v. Wade faster than you \ncould blink an eye. That is what they want the Court to do, and that is \nwhat this bill is about. That is why I want to take time here.\n  I know this thing is going to pass. I know exactly that it is going \nto pass. I have respect for that. I wish my friends would have respect \nfor the fact that Roe passed also and leave it in this bill, so we do \nnot send a confusing signal to the women of this country that their \nhealth no longer matters.\n\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania says, no problem, there is no reason \never to use this procedure. Let's look at what some of the doctors' \norganizations say. Let's hold up some of our charts on that. I will \ntell you something; I never dreamed I would be down here with Senators \nwho think they know more than doctors, but that is what happens. Let me \nread you a statement by the American College of OB/GYNs:\n\n       Especially for women with particular health conditions, \n     there is medical evidence that D [that is the procedure \n     being banned] may be safer than available alternatives. A \n     select panel convened by ACOG concluded that D may be ``the \n     best or most appropriate procedure in a particular \n     circumstance to save the life or preserve the health of a \n     woman.''\n\n  Look at this. You are in the Supreme Court and you are hearing this \ncase, S. 3; this bill is coming before you. They are going to quote \nSenator Santorum that never is this needed to save the life--though he \nwill not say that--of a woman. It is not a problem. Are you going to \nbelieve Senators or the doctors who deal with this every day of their \nworking lives? Common sense tells me, when I want to go to the doctor, \nI don't go to the Senator from Pennsylvania. We might have a nice chat \nabout things, a good political talk, but I don't want him telling me or \nmy daughter; I want a doctor who knows what they are talking about.\n  The doctors tell us this is necessary. Let's look at some other \nstatements. This is a very important letter from the University of \nCalifornia-San Francisco, Center for Reproductive Health Research and \nPolicy. This is a very important letter signed by a very important \nphysician. What does she tell us. This print is too small to read, so \nlet's get the large one that lists the problems women can face. What \nDr. Stewart tells us in very clear terms is there are serious health \nconsequences of banning safe procedures, which she considers the \nprocedure that is being banned in this bill to be, a safe procedure: \nhemorrhage, uterine rupture, blood clots, embolism, stroke, damage to \nnearby organs, and paralysis. This is a partial list of what doctors \ntell us could happen to a woman if this procedure that is being banned \nis no longer an option.\n  Who do you think the Supreme Court will listen to? Senators with no \ndegree in OB/GYN or doctors who are telling us this is what could \nhappen to a woman? Do you think we are doing the right thing by banning \na procedure without which a woman could face damage to a nearby organ, \nparalysis, or a blood clot? What is it about this bill that makes it so \nsacrosanct that you cannot add an exception for the health of the \nmother? We tried everything. The straight health exception is the one \nthat is the most constitutional. Others around here said serious \nadverse health consequences. Oh, no, that wasn't good enough.\n  There wasn't anything we could say on behalf of the women in this \ncountry that the other side would not shoot down. I don't understand \nit. I do not understand that kind of mentality. Don't we love our wives \nand our daughters and our aunts and all the women in our lives? How \ncould we pass a bill that would say even if a woman's health is \nthreatened, this procedure cannot be used, when we could have walked \ndown the aisle together and passed a bill with a health exception?\n\n  So when I come before the Senate this morning, it is with a very \nheavy heart. But it is also with the knowledge that I think this Court \nis going to throw out this bill, regardless of whether colleagues say \nin the beginning there is no problem, no relation to a woman's health, \nbecause doctors have told us the serious health consequences of banning \nthis procedure include all these horrible things. By the way, what is \nnot listed here is infertility. Later today I will show you the cases \nof women who were spared that problem because this procedure was used \non a very complicated, difficult, emergency abortion where the brain \nwas outside the baby's head, where the child would have suffered.\n  I am telling you that I don't know where the compassion is, when we \nwould have agreed to do this with a health exception. I don't know \nwhere the compassion is on the other side. My friend talked about a \ncivilized society. I want a civilized society. That means you care \nabout the women of this country. That means you care about their \npregnancies. That means you want to help them through the most \ndifficult times. That means you don't play doctor here because you are \nnot a doctor. We are about to play doctor in a big way. Fortunately, \nacross the street in the Supreme Court they will see right through it.\n  So there are many things I could tell you about this bill. I will \nshow you some others. Let's see what the Supreme Court said about why \nwe believe this bill is unconstitutional. There was a case called \nStenberg v. Carhart. The Supreme Court found their ban of this \nprocedure in this State--it was Nebraska, I believe--was \nunconstitutional. They said it put an undue burden on women because the \ndefinition is vague.\n  Now the other side said they fixed that problem. We don't think they \ndid. That will be decided. The second reason it was thrown out is there \nis no exception to protect women's health. I have to tell you that on \nboth of these counts S. 3 failed the Supreme Court test. It failed it. \nEven some of the most anti-choice people out there have written letters \ncriticizing the other side because they said why don't you do something \nthat matters.\n  This is going to be overturned in the Supreme Court. So why are we \ngoing through this, seeing these pictures? Once I was on the Senate \nfloor and a colleague wanted a 5-year-old to sit up there and look at \nthese pictures. I objected to that. That is inflaming passions. I can \nshow pictures of what it looks like when a woman gets a blood clot or \nwhen a woman is in a wheelchair and paralyzed, but I would not do that \nbecause this is not about sensationalizing anything. It is about doing \nthe right thing.\n  I will yield the floor at this time. I see the Senator from Alabama \nhere. I will return to continue this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California. I \nknow she cares deeply about this. I just suggest that things are not as \na lot of people think with regard to the question of abortion--\nparticularly partial-birth abortion, which we are talking about today. \nThat is all this bill has to do with.\n  I will just note that Faye Wattleton, a former president of Planned \nParenthood, a very pro-choice group, and now head of a new \norganization, the Center for the Advancement of Women, recently \ncommissioned a survey by the Princeton Survey Research Associates. It \ninvolved 3,329 women. This was a scientific survey. That is a very \nlarge number. A lot of polls on Presidential elections don't have that \nmany people polled.\n  That survey found that 51 percent of the women, who are supposed to \nbe offended by this small, but horrible procedure, wanted to ban \nabortion altogether, or limit it to cases of rape or incest or where \nthe mother's life is in danger.\n  Another 17 percent said abortion--this is abortion in general--should \nbe available under stricter laws than now\n\n[[Page S12918]]\n\napply. That means that 68 percent of women polled think we ought to \ntighten up the laws. This idea, that dealing with partial-birth \nabortion is offensive to women, does not strike me as being sound based \non that poll. But, of course, polls are not what we are about here. We \nare here to do what is right.\n  I do not believe this is the kind of action that most women in \nAmerica are going to be offended by. I suspect if they knew the nature \nof partial-birth abortion, as Senator Santorum has explained, the \nnumbers would be higher than 68 percent opposing it. I think we are \nhaving a growing understanding of the issue.\n  I thank Senator Santorum for raising this issue. He has been a good \nadvocate of it. It is time now that we take a step that will make \nAmerica a better place. We must just say no to this procedure. There \nare some activities that we can't allow. There are some activities that \ncan't be justified and are so beneath the decency of a nation as great \nas America that we ought to ban.\n  I remember the debate a number of years ago when Senator Bob Smith, a \nformer Senator from New Hampshire, raised this issue for the first time \nin this Chamber. He was attacked bitterly as being an extremist, \ntalking about things he ought not to be talking about on the floor of \nthe Senate. But Bob Smith stood firm, as he always did, for what he \nbelieved in. He said this was wrong. But year after year has gone by. \nWe have had hearings, and I was on the Judiciary Committee when we had \nhearings on it. We heard the implacable opposition from the pro-\nabortion forces. They wanted no yielding, no compromise, nothing that \nwould give an inch on this issue, and they dismissed facts and figures. \nSenator Bob Smith will now be vindicated. He displayed courage and \ndetermination in bringing this issue up and making sure that the \nAmerican people understood what it is about and why this is a \nsignificant step in protecting the innocent unborn, but certainly does \nnot have any broad impact throughout the abortion debate.\n  Many people probably did not believe what Senator Smith was saying at \nthe time, frankly, but we have seen more about it. I think it is true \nthat many people have not wanted to know about the gruesome details of \nthis procedure: How a child, a baby, just 3 inches from complete birth \nis deliberately and systematically killed. That is not something about \nwhich we want to talk. We cringe to say the words. I wish they were not \ntrue, but unfortunately, they are true.\n  The destruction of a partially born child continues to this day. It \nis an affront to the decency of America, and I do believe this is a \nrational and appropriate legislative response on behalf of the American \npeople.\n  The Senate is on record as agreeing with this view. Last year, we \nanswered a very important question when we passed the Born Alive Infant \nProtection Act. This legislation basically said that if a child is \naccidentally born during a partial-birth abortion procedure--that is, \nthe baby was actually born and removed from the mother--if the head was \nto move that final couple of inches, then that child's life would be \nprotected. What else could we do? Why should we even have a law that \nwould say that you have a right to kill a child who has been removed \nfrom the mother? The Born Alive Infant Protection Act was passed \nunanimously by this body. Partial-birth abortion inflicts pain and \nsuffering on the child being born. That we know today. A few years ago, \nwe were told by the experts that the anesthetic given to the mother \nwould ensure the child feels no pain. However, we have learned this is \njust not true. Professional societies of anesthesiologists have refuted \nthis claim.\n  The most mind-boggling aspect of this procedure, however, is that it \nis absolutely unnecessary. Almost all of the partial-birth abortion \nprocedures that are performed in America are elective and not due to \nany danger to the mother's life. A number of people during this debate \nhave expressed concern about the life of the mother, and that is a \nvalid concern. I heard this argument during my time on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. We had a number of hearings on the subject.\n\n  There are exceptions included in this bill to protect the life of the \nmother if it is in danger, although the evidence suggests that such \ncircumstances virtually never occur.\n  Even in extremely rare circumstances where the life of the mother may \nbe endangered by a pregnancy, the only medical requirement is that she \nbe separated from the child. There is no requirement that the child be \nkilled. The legislation provides, however, for a contingency in which \nthe life of a mother is threatened. It would permit this partial-birth \nabortion procedure but only ``to save the life of a mother whose life \nis endangered by physical disorder, physical illness, or physical \ninjury, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or \narising from the pregnancy itself.''\n  That is a pretty broad protection to a mother who may be endangered, \nbut I really think it is unnecessary. The fact is the American Medical \nAssociation, a major institution in America, one that has consistently \ndefended abortion rights, has declared this procedure is never \nmedically necessary. That is an official position of the American \nMedical Association that it is never medically necessary. This is not \nwhat we need to be doing when there is a danger to the life of the \nmother. It is not necessary, and it should be outlawed.\n  The support for ending this procedure goes beyond our traditional \ndebate on abortion. The support exists overwhelmingly in a bipartisan \nway because the partial-birth abortion procedure deeply offends our \nsensibilities as a people, as human beings who care about one another, \nwho know that life is fragile, and who believe that all human beings \nneed to be treated with respect and dignity, even though they may be \nweak.\n  The Declaration of Independence notes life, liberty, and the pursuit \nof happiness as the ideals of the American life. Without this bill, a \nchild partially born has those rights ripped away in a most vicious \nway. Allowing partial-birth abortion is a dangerous policy. It is a \nthin line. There is a thin thread that can justify this procedure that \nis, in essence, I believe, infanticide, as said by the former Senator \nDaniel Patrick Moynihan from New York.\n  This is a dangerous line we are pushing. If we say that a child \npartially born can be killed----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 10 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given \n4 additional minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we certainly have no problem with that \nrequest, just that it come out of the time of the Senator from \nPennsylvania, Mr. Santorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the pro-abortion groups implacable in \ntheir opposition to any reduction in so-called choice powers, \nemphatically insisted and went around the country declaring that the \nnumber of partial-birth abortions performed every year was small.\n  They insisted these despicable procedures were only performed in \nextreme medical circumstances. Therefore, they said the Federal \nGovernment should not pass laws to stop it, but that was a flat out \nlie. I do not use that word often, but I will repeat it. It was not \njust an error. It was a lie.\n  These claims were either manufactured or disseminated in an attempt \nto minimize the significance of the issue and to dismiss the issues \nraised by Senator Smith. In my view, it was based on an ends justify \nthe means theory.\n  As reported in a 1997 front-page article in the Washington Times, Mr. \nRon Fitzsimmons, the executive director of the National Coalition of \nAbortion Providers--let me say that again, the executive director of \nthe National Coalition of Abortion Providers, who had been traveling \nthe country saying these procedures were rare, had a change of heart. \nIn his own words, he publicly admitted that he had ``lied through his \nteeth'' about the number of partial-birth abortions that were \nperformed.\n  He estimated that ``up to 5,000 partial birth abortions are performed \nannually, and that they are primarily done on healthy women and healthy \nfetuses.'' That is what we are dealing with today.\n  So I say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, how can we \nanswer to our children and our constituents, our highest ideals as \nAmericans, if we\n\n[[Page S12919]]\n\nallow children to be destroyed in this way? If we are a nation that \naspires to goodness, that aspires to be above the coarse and to meet \nminimum standards of decency, this legislation is most strongly needed.\n  I find it very puzzling that there continues to be strong resistance \nby a few to the banning of this one brutal procedure. I ask myself: Why \nis that? I have heard it said that the people who oppose partial-birth \nabortion do so for religious reasons, as if that is an illegitimate \nreason to consider as one evaluates public policy.\n  Was it illegitimate when Dr. Martin Luther King marched for freedom \nbased on his belief in the Scriptures? Religious principle is not an \nillegitimate reason for a motivation, but that has been a complaint \nabout those who question the procedure.\n  I have analyzed the opposition to this bill and I cannot see that it \ncan be founded on the law. I cannot see that it can be founded on \nscience; the AMA says it is not necessary. I cannot see that it can be \nfounded on ethics; certainly not. Why is it? The only thing I can see \nis that there is a sort of a secular religious opposition to any \ncontrol whatsoever on abortion that is, I believe, driven by an \nextremist group. We are going to allow these procedures to go forward \nas long as abortionists wish to perform them, they say, and you, \nCongress, just have no say in it whatsoever.\n  I do not believe that is a rational argument. It is not justified. \nThis legislation is specific.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that I have 1 additional \nminute.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, under the same conditions previously asked.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this legislation would ban one simple, \ngruesome, unjustifiable procedure for destroying the life of a \npartially born child. I do not believe that threatens anybody's \nprinciples, but I will say one thing, not doing it threatens the \ndecency and morality of the American people. Every day that it \ncontinues is a stain on the conscience of America.\n  I support this legislation, and I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania \nfor his leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized for 20 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, this is an historic day. For the first \ntime since Roe v. Wade, we are going to deal with the issue of abortion \nand limit the practice in one significant way. This is an historic day \nfor life; for establishing and supporting a culture of life in the \nUnited States; for freedom; and for human rights--for the dignity of \nthe weakest and most vulnerable amongst us, which we all profess to \nsupport.\n  This is will go down in history as a pivotal day, where we start to \nrecognize that the child in the womb is a child. The child in the womb \nis not a piece of property. The child is, indeed, a person with dignity \nand rights and is entitled to life. That is a very important thing for \nus to recognize and for the United States to support.\n  I will begin my comments by showing a picture of a very young child. \nThanks to modern technology, we are able to see a lot more these days. \nWe now have what is called 4D, four dimensional, CAT scans of children \nin the womb. We can see children smiling and yawning in the womb at a \nvery young age.\n  I recently had a gentleman in my office--we actually had him testify \nin front of the Commerce Committee--who performs surgeries on children \nin the womb--in utero surgeries. This gentleman works on children in \nthe womb a great deal, and in doing these surgeries, for example, he \nsays a child in the womb acts just like a child outside the womb. One \nhas to go into the womb, when they are performing the surgery, to \nanesthetize the child. When a doctor goes in with a needle to poke the \nchild in the womb, they have to chase them. There is a confined area \nthat the child can run around in the womb, but as they go in with that \nneedle the child jerks back, holds their buttocks back. They do not \nlike to get the needle in them.\n  Having five children myself--two of them are five now--I know it is a \nmajor procedure for us to go in and get immunizations in the doctor's \noffice. For us to get two children immunized, it takes five people--two \nholding down, one giving the shot, and a couple of us saying, there, \nthere, it is all right.\n  It turns out that children in the womb are very similar. They do not \nlike the pain. They feel it. They pull back from it. They repulse, and \nyet it is something we need to do.\n  I wish to continue my remarks by talking about a famous young child \nwho is probably more famous before he was born than most people are \nduring their life--Samuel Alexander Armas. I had him testifying about 2 \nmonths ago. He is now 3 years old. Samuel is a unique and beautiful \nchild. He actually testified in front of the committee.\n  This is his hand coming out of his mother's womb. He had spina \nbifida, which a number of people recognize is a very difficult thing. \nThe spinal cord does not develop. The child generally has great \ndifficult in mobility and can also be deaf resulting from that. Yet we \nhave now found a way that in utero, in the womb, that we can operate on \nthat child and close that area.\n  When Samuel testified at age 3 in front of my committee, he was fine; \nthough, he does have some mobility problems with his legs. When his \nparents discovered that he had spina bifida, they had recommendations \nfrom their physicians that the pregnancy should be terminated. The \nparents said, no, no, we believe in life. We are not going to do this \nto our child. At that time, they had even named him Samuel. They asked: \nWhat else can we do? They were told of in utero surgeries, and they \ndecided to try it.\n  This in utero surgery actually took place at 21 weeks of age, which \nis about the timeframe that partial-birth abortions occur--21 weeks. I \nwant to show a positive side of this. They went in and did the surgery \non Samuel. They fixed the problem of the spina bifida. As they were \nconcluding the surgery on Samuel, this picture was taken of his \nmother's womb. The surgery on Samuel was resolved and a photographer \nfrom USA Today was in the room taking pictures. USA Today had asked \npreviously if they could be present at the surgery, taking \npictures. This surgery was being done at Vanderbilt University Medical \nCenter. The photographer was there. He had taken pictures throughout \nthe surgery. The surgery was just wrapping up when all of a sudden they \nsaw the womb shake a little bit and Samuel's hand comes out of the \nwomb.\n\n  The doctor is looking at it. Out of curiosity, I guess, as much as \nanything, he puts his finger near the womb and Samuel grabs the \ndoctor's finger--21 weeks of age, and Samuel holds onto it.\n  The photographer, in just a moment's notice, just clicks it. He \ndoesn't know if he even gets the picture. He just senses that there is \nsomething important that has just happened. The hand lets go and goes \nback into the womb--Samuel likes it better in the womb at this point in \ntime--and they close up the womb. The surgery is successful.\n  This picture that appeared in USA Today--it has actually been all \nover the world and is one of those famous pictures--has been renamed \n``The Hand of Hope,'' as Samuel reaches out from the womb and grabs \nhold of that next generation already there, seeking and yearning to \njoin them.\n  The photographer was stunned about it. He was stunned how the picture \nhad come out. He was stunned by the response that he received around \nthe world. He gets e-mails on a regular basis, all the time, frankly, \nin response to this ``Hand of Hope.'' It has appeared in USA Today and \nin newspapers around the world multiple sets of times.\n  We had Samuel in to testify. We had his parents testify about what \nthey went through to undergo this surgery. We had a doctor testify \nabout the number of things we can now cure in utero. I think it is \nimportant that we start to cover children in utero because, when you \nhave these sorts of surgeries, they are expensive, but they are \nimportant and they are better covered at that point in time. This is a \nheroic thing. It is a beautiful thing.\n  It is the other end of the tragedy that we close here today because \nSamuel, until this procedure is banned, could be\n\n[[Page S12920]]\n\naborted legally and killed by this brutal procedure called partial-\nbirth abortion. Partial-birth abortion is a procedure that we have had \ngruesomely described to the American public on numerous occasions. So \nwhile at this stage of life, Samuel has a hand of hope. He also could \nlegally be killed at this point in time by that brutal procedure, \npartial-birth abortion, which involves no anesthetic, nothing--just a \nbrutal, gruesome procedure that we will not stand for anyplace in the \nworld, being the country that we are that believes in freedom and hope \nand in opportunity for everybody. We believe in life and liberty and \nthe pursuit of happiness.\n  The central debate we are finally getting out into is this little \nhand of Samuel, and asking is that the hand of a person or is that the \nhand of a glob of tissue? Is it the hand of an individual? Is it the \nhand of an extension of the mother? Is it a person or is it a piece of \nproperty? That is the central question, and it is a question we have \nwrestled with before. We wrestled with this question on the slave issue \nwhen we--in that original sin of the United States of having slavery--\nwould not recognize an individual as a person but rather as a piece of \nproperty. It was a horrible thing, a horrible chapter. We have all \nrecognized that and we say it was a bad thing.\n  Now we are on the same debate. Here is little Samuel's hand. Is it \nthe hand of a person or the hand of a piece of property? If it is \nproperty, we can dispose of it as we choose to see fit. If it is a \nperson, it has rights and we have responsibilities towards that \nbeautiful child; that Samuel is and is on a continuum, this child, from \nthat point of time as well.\n  Do we want that child killed or do we want that child cured? Do we \nwant that child in our society or do we want that child somehow just \nkind of done away with for whatever reason the case might be?\n  I do hope we get into a substantial and long-term debate about the \nnature of Samuel and his hand of hope as he reaches out from the womb \nand, by that little hand, says to us: I am a person. I am yearning to \nbe free, yearning to live. I have much to give to you. I have much to \ngive to this society. I have much to help with, and I want to do it and \nI want to be able to help you. I want to be there with you when my time \ncomes. And Samuel did. He came out, and he is now with us.\n\n  We are this day moving forward on an issue of human dignity that I \nthink is incredibly important. I think it is also an obligation for us \nto stand and recognize that human life--at whatever stage--is sacred, \nunique, and a precious gift. Each day when we have the call that says \nwe lost a soldier in Iraq--two--three--each of us in this country just \ngets sick at the stomach because that person was somebody's brother; \nthat person was somebody's sister; that person was somebody's father or \nmother; that person is unique, sacred, and that person is precious to \nus.\n  Is Samuel Alexander Armas any less unique and sacred and precious? If \nyou kill him at this point in time, isn't he dead for the rest of his \nlife? Is it somehow that because he is in the womb he is not a life \ncontinuum at that point in time? Is there something different here?\n  At this point in time he is property, and then when he comes out of \nthe womb he becomes a person with rights and responsibilities? Why? Is \nit that he is dependent here in the womb? He is dependent when he is \nborn, but he is property here that can be disposed of, and he is a \nperson who must be protected when he is born? His hand speaks to us. \nHis hand challenges us. His hand is a hand of hope to us as a society \nthat says, yes, we recognize the rights of the most vulnerable amongst \nus, and we are going to protect them. We are going to stand for them. \nWe are not going to let them be killed.\n  This is an enormous day. This has been a long, 7-year fight about the \nissue of partial-birth abortion. In many ways it has been instructive \nto us as a country. I am absolutely convinced the American people are \nconvinced that Samuel is a child and not somehow a piece of property or \na lump of tissue. People in this country do not want children killed. \nThey do not want that to take place.\n  As this debate has gone on and on, what we found is the American \npublic has shifted. Now, particularly amongst young women of child-\nbearing age, you are seeing for the first time since this has been \nrecorded that they are more pro-life than pro-choice. They are \nrecognizing this is a child, it is a person, it has rights, it has \nbeauty, it has things it wants to contribute. It is important that we \nlet that child contribute.\n  Last weekend was a celebration of Mother Teresa's beatification. It \nis quite something. A number of people in this body had a chance to \nmeet Mother Teresa--a great contributor to the society around the world \nto the most weak and defenseless. She often came to the United States \nand graced us with her presence. She talked about the beautiful things, \nand she would talk about each of us having our own Calcuttas, where we \ncan help people wherever we are. She talked about poverty in America. \nActually, she was talking about the poverty of love.\n  She was most harsh about the institution of abortion, where a mother \nwould end the life of her own child. She cared deeply for the mother \nand she cared deeply for the child.\n  She once said this: If we can accept that a mother can kill her own \nchild, how can we tell other people not to kill one another?\n  She asked this sort of haunting, piercing question. If we allow this \nin society, don't we spawn a continual culture of death instead of a \nculture of life at the very inception of things? What do we say to \nSamuel later on? Well, OK, we could have killed you by a brutal \nprocedure at this point in time, legally, and that would have been \nfine, or we could have saved your life. There was no protection in \nparticular one way or the other.\n  This is an important day for life. It is an important day for a \ntransition in the culture of life. I ask people who are opposed to this \nban to look at this hand of Samuel.\n  My colleague from California cares passionately about this issue, and \nabout the issue of choice and the right of a woman to choose. But I \ndon't know that she or anybody else can deny that this is the hand of a \nchild, and we have some responsibilities to that child as well. Maybe \nwe can call a hand a piece of property. But I don't know how else \nbiologically it could be defined. I don't know how else physically it \ncould be defined.\n  With each passing day, and our technology getting better and better \nand better, I really do ask people on the other side, Is this not a \nchild?\n  Am I not a person? Am I not a brother? A sister? Am I not?\n  Others care deeply about the right to choose. I respect that. But we \nall have choices to make. Is it one that we choose to terminate a \nbrother or sister, a person who could be a parent, a person who could \nbe a contributor, or do we not?\n  It really is a defining moment. I hope people on the other side would \nlook at this picture and say: Yes, I cannot deny the humanity of that \nhand, the hand of hope. I support the ban on partial-birth abortion and \nlook forward to the day when it is signed.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n30 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will you let me know when I have used 7 \nminutes and I will yield time to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  I am very pleased to be joined by Senator Lautenberg. I will respond \nwith my comments to the comments of the Senator from Kansas who was \nvery eloquently talking about the most vulnerable among us.\n  As the author, when I was in the House, of the Violence Against Women \nAct, as the person who offered the amendment which allowed abortion \nafter rape in the House--and that passed for Medicaid patients--and as \nthe author of the Violence Against Children Act today--and I hope my \ncolleague will cosponsor that bill because it is a wonderful way to \nhighlight the most vulnerable among us--the example the Senator talked \nabout, the case of Samuel, illustrates why the pro-choice position is \nso much the right position--In that case, the doctor recommended an \nabortion but the parents made another choice. The parents acted and \nsaid to the doctor: We do not agree. So they had the right to choose \nwhat they wanted to do. And good for them.\n\n[[Page S12921]]\n\n  But if we legislate bans on this and bans on this--you have to have a \nchild, you do not--and we turn into China or countries like Romania \nthat said you shall have the babies, on the one hand, or you may not \never have a baby, on the other, then we lose the ability for families, \nwith their God, with their conscience, with their doctor, to make the \ndecision they want to make.\n  The important thing is that the family have the choice. That is why I \nstand here today.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will not yield time because Senator Lautenberg is in a \nrush.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I ask that it not be taken off your time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield for a short time.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Is this the hand of a child?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Senator, you did not listen to what I said, because you \nwere talking to your staff, when I stood up.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I am responding to what you were saying.\n  Mrs. BOXER. No, you did not. I said, good for the parents for making \nthe choice and standing up for the doctor who gave them another \nsuggestion. Fine. That is what a pro-choice position is. That is why I \nam so much for Roe v. Wade. That is why I stand here as a mother, as a \ngrandmother, as a Senator from a very large State, admitting, Senator, \nand admitting to all my friends in the Senate, in the Congressional \nRecord for all times, that I am not a doctor and I am not God. I am a \nhuman being. I trust other human beings to make these decisions. I \ntrust Samuel's family to make the decision they made. The doctor gave \nhis opinion.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. And I will not yield at this time.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Just a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will not yield at this time. I will continue my \nstatement. I do not want to lose my trend of thought because we are \nabout to do something today that, although hailed by the other side, is \nthe first time in history that the Senate is going to ban a medical \nprocedure that is considered by many doctors--and we have put it in the \nRecord, pages and scores, and I ask unanimous consent that they be \nprinted in the Record--doctors and nurses have told us this procedure \nis often essential to protect the life and health of a woman.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           The American College of\n\n\n                              Obstetricians and Gynecologists,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 2003.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: The American College of Obstetricians \n     and Gynecologists (ACOG) reaffirms its Statement of Policy on \n     Intact Dilation and Extraction, initially approved by the \n     ACOG Executive Board in 1997.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Ralph Hale, MD,\n                                         Executive Vice President.\n       Attachment.\n\n                        ACOG Statement of Policy\n\n\n              statement on intact dilation and extraction\n\n       The debate regarding legislation to prohibit a method of \n     abortion, such as the legislation banning ``partial birth \n     abortion,'' and ``brain sucking abortions,'' has prompted \n     questions regarding these procedures. It is difficult to \n     respond to these questions because the descriptions are vague \n     and do not delineate a specific procedure recognized in the \n     medical literature. Moreover, the definitions could be \n     interpreted to include elements of many recognized abortion \n     and operative obstetric techniques.\n       The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \n     (ACOG) believes the intent of such legislative proposals is \n     to prohibit a procedure referred to as ``Intact Dilatation \n     and Extraction'' (Intact D & X). This procedure has been \n     described as containing all of the following four elements:\n       1. Deliberate dilatation of the cervix, usually over a \n     sequence of days;\n       2. Instrumental conversion of the fetus to a footling \n     breech;\n       3. Breech extraction of the body excepting the head; and\n       4. Partial evacuation of the intracranial contents of a \n     living fetus to effect vaginal delivery of a dead but \n     otherwise intact fetus.\n       Because these elements are part of established obstetric \n     techniques, it must be emphasized that unless all four \n     elements are present in sequence, the procedure is not an \n     intact D & X.\n       Abortion intends to terminate a pregnancy while preserving \n     the life and health of the mother. When abortion is performed \n     after 16 weeks, intact D & X is one method of terminating a \n     pregnancy. The physician, in consultation with the patient, \n     must choose the most appropriate method based upon the \n     patient's individual circumstances.\n       According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     (CDC), only 5.3% of abortions performed in the United States \n     in 1993, the most recent data available, were performed after \n     the 16th week of pregnancy. A preliminary figure published by \n     the CDC for 1994 is 5.6%. The CDC does not collect data on \n     the specific method of abortion, so it is unknown how many of \n     these were performed using intact D & X. Other data show that \n     second trimester transvaginal instrumental abortion is a safe \n     procedure.\n       Terminating a pregnancy is performed in some circumstances \n     to save the life or preserve the health of the mother. Intact \n     D & X is one of the methods available in some of these \n     situations. A select panel convened by ACOG could identify no \n     circumstances under which this procedure, as defined above, \n     would be the only option to save the life or preserve the \n     health of the woman. An intact D & X, however, may be the \n     best or most appropriate procedure in a particular \n     circumstance to save the life or preserve the health of a \n     woman, and only the doctor, in consultation with the patient, \n     based upon the woman's particular circumstances can make this \n     decision. The potential exists that legislation prohibiting \n     specific medical practices, such as intact D & X, may outlaw \n     techniques that are crucial to the lives and health of \n     American women. The intervention of legislative bodies into \n     medical decision making is inappropriate, ill advised, and \n     dangerous.\n       Approved by the Executive Board.\n       January 12, 1997.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          American Medical Women's\n\n\n                                            Association, Inc.,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, March 25, 2003.\n     Hon. Jerrold Nadler,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Nadler: The American Medical Women's \n     Association (AMWA) strongly opposes HR 760, the ``Partial-\n     Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003.'' While the Association has \n     high respect for each member and their right to hold whatever \n     moral, religious and philosophical beliefs his or her \n     conscience dictates, as an organization of 10,000 women \n     physicians and medical students dedicated to promoting \n     women's health and advancing women in medicine, we believe HR \n     760 is unconscionable.\n       AMWA has long been an advocate for women's access to \n     reproductive health care. As such, we recognize this \n     legislation as an attempt to ban a procedure that in some \n     circumstances is the safest and most appropriate alternative \n     available to save the life and health of the woman. \n     Furthermore, this bill violates the privilege of a patient in \n     consultation with her physician to make the most appropriate \n     decision regarding her specific health circumstances.\n       AMWA opposes legislation such as HR 760 as inappropriate \n     intervention in the decision-making relationship between \n     physician and patient. The definition of the bill is too \n     imprecise and it includes non-medical terminology for a \n     procedure that may ultimately undermine the legality of other \n     techniques in obstetrics and gynecology used in both abortion \n     and non-abortion situations. At times, the use of these \n     techniques is essential to the lives and health of women. The \n     potential of this ban to criminalize certain obstetrics and \n     gynecology techniques ultimately interferes with the quality \n     of health and lives of women. Furthermore, the current ban \n     fails to meet the provisions set forth by the Supreme Court \n     in Stenberg v. Carhart, a ruling that overturned a Nebraska \n     statute banning abortion because it contained no life and \n     health exception for the mother.\n       AMWA's position on this bill corresponds to the position \n     statement of the organization on abortion and reproductive \n     health services to women and their families.\n       AMWA believe that the prevention of unintended pregnancies \n     through access to contraception and education is the best \n     option available for reducing the abortion rate in the United \n     States. Legislative bans for procedures that use recognized \n     obstetrics and gynecological techniques fails to protect the \n     health and safety of women and their children, nor will it \n     improve the lives of women and their families.

Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: We are writing to urge you to stand in \n     defense of women's reproductive health and vote against S. 3, \n     legislation regarding so-called ``partial birth'' abortion.\n       We are practicing obstetrician-gynecologists, and academics \n     in obstetrics, gynecology and women's health. We believe it \n     is imperative that those who perform terminations and manage \n     the pre- and post-operative care of women receiving abortions \n     are given a voice in a debate that has largely ignored the \n     two groups whose lives would be most affected by this \n     legislation: physicians and patients.\n\n[[Page S12922]]\n\n       It is misguided and unprincipled for lawmakers to legislate \n     medicine. We all want safe and effective medical procedures \n     for women; on that there is no dispute. However, the business \n     of medicine is not always palatable to those who do not \n     practice it on a regular basis. The description of a number \n     of procedures--from liposuction to cardiac surgery--may seem \n     distasteful to some, and even repugnant to others. When \n     physicians analyze and debate surgical techniques among \n     themselves, it is always for the best interest of the \n     patient. Abortion is proven to be one of the safest \n     procedures in medicine, significantly safer than childbirth, \n     and in fact has saved numerous women's lives.\n       While we can argue as to why this legislation is dangerous, \n     deceptive and unconstitutional--and it is--the fact of the \n     matter is that the text of the bill is so vague and \n     misleading that there is a great need to correct the \n     misconceptions around abortion safety and technique. It is \n     wrong to assume that a specific procedure is never needed; \n     what is required is the safest option for the patient, and \n     that varies from case to case.\n\n\n                               the facts\n\n       (1) So-called ``partial birth'' abortion does not exist.\n       There is no mention of the term ``partial birth'' abortion \n     in any medical literature. Physicians are never taught a \n     technique called ``partial birth'' abortion and therefore are \n     unable to medically define the procedure.\n       What is described in the legislation, however, could ban \n     all abortions. ``What this bill describes, albeit in non-\n     medical terms, can be interpreted as any abortion,'' stated \n     one of our physician members. ``Medicine is an art as much as \n     it is a science; although there is a standard of care, each \n     procedure--and indeed each woman--is different. The wording \n     here could apply to any patient.'' The bill's language is too \n     vague to be useful; in fact, it is so vague as to be harmful. \n     It is intentionally unclear and deceptive.\n       (2) Physicians need to have all medical options available \n     in order to provide the best medical care possible.\n       Tying the hands of physicians endangers the health of \n     patients. It is unethical and dangerous for legislators to \n     dictate specific surgical procedures. Until a surgeon \n     examines the patient, she does not necessarily know which \n     technique or procedure would be in the patient's best \n     interest. Banning procedures puts women's health at risk.\n       (3) Politicians should not legislate medicine.\n       To do so would violate the sanctity and legality of the \n     physician-patient relationship. The right to have an abortion \n     is constitutionally-protected. To falsify scientific evidence \n     in an attempt to deny women that right is unconscionable and \n     dangerous.\n       The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecology, \n     representing 45,000 ob-gyns, agrees: ``The intervention of \n     legislative bodies into medical decisionmaking is \n     inappropriate, ill advised, and dangerous.''\n       The American Medical Women's Association, representing \n     10,000 female physicians, is opposed to an abortion ban \n     because it ``represents a serious impingement on the rights \n     of physicians to determine appropriate medical management for \n     individual patients.''\n\n\n                              the science\n\n       We know that there is no such technique as ``partial \n     birth'' abortion, and we believe this legislation is a \n     thinly-veiled attempt to outlaw all abortions. Those \n     supporting this legislation seem to want to confuse both \n     legislators and the public about which abortion procedures \n     are actually used. Since the greatest confusion seems to \n     center around techniques that are used in the second and \n     third trimesters, we will address those: dilation and \n     evacuation (D), dilation and extraction (D), \n     instillation, hysterectomy and hysterotomy (commonly known as \n     a c-section).\n       Dilation and evacuation (D) is the standard approach for \n     second-trimester abortions. The only difference between a D \n     and a more common, first-trimester vacuum aspiration is that \n     the cervix must be further dilated. Morbidity and mortality \n     studies indicate that this surgical method is preferable to \n     labor induction methods (instillation), hysterotomy and \n     hysterectomy.\n       From the years 1972-76, labor induction procedures carried \n     a maternal mortality rate of 16.5 (note: all numbers listed \n     are out of 100,000); corresponding rate for D was 10.4. \n     From 1977-82, labor induction fell to 6.8, but D dropped to \n     3.3. From 1983-87, induction methods had a 3.5 mortality \n     rate, while D fell to 2.9. Although the difference between \n     the methods shrank by the mid-1980s, the use of D had \n     already quickly outpaced induction, thus altering the size of \n     the sample.\n       Morbidity trends indicate that dilation and evacuation is \n     much safer than labor induction procedures, and for women \n     with certain medical conditions, e.g., coronary artery \n     disease or asthma, labor induction can pose serious risks. \n     Rates of major complications from labor induction were \n     more than twice as high as those from D There are \n     instances of women who, after having failed induction, \n     acquired infections necessitating emergency D, which \n     ultimately saved her fertility and, in some instances, her \n     life. Hysterotomy and hysterectomy, moreover, carry a \n     mortality rate seven times that of induction techniques \n     and ten times that of D\n       There is a psychological component which makes D \n     preferable to labor induction; undergoing difficult, \n     expensive and painful labor for up to two days is extremely \n     emotionally and psychologically draining, much more so than a \n     surgical procedure that can be done in a few hours under \n     general or local anesthesia. Furthermore, labor induction \n     does not always work: Between 15 and 30 percent of cases \n     require surgery to complete the procedure. There is no \n     question that D is the safest method of second-trimester \n     abortion.\n       There is also a technique known as dilation and extraction \n     (D). D is merely a variant of D There is a dearth of \n     data on D as it is an uncommon procedure. However, it is \n     sometimes a physician's preferred method of termination for a \n     number of reasons: it offers a woman a chance to see the \n     intact outcome of a desired pregnancy, thus speeding up the \n     grieving process; it provides a greater chance of acquiring \n     valuable information regarding hereditary illness or fetal \n     anomaly; and there is a decreased risk of injury to the \n     woman, as the procedure is quicker than induction and \n     involves less use of sharp instruments in the uterus, \n     providing a lesser chance of uterine perforations or tears \n     and cervical lacerations.\n       It is important to note that these procedures are used at \n     varying gestational ages. Neither a D nor a D is \n     equivalent to a late-term abortion. D and D are used \n     solely based on the size of the fetus, the health of the \n     woman, and the physician's judgment, and the decision \n     regarding which procedure to use is done on a case-by-case \n     basis.\n\n\n                            the legislation\n\n       Because this legislation is so vague, it would outlaw D \n     and D (and arguably techniques used in the first-\n     trimester). Indeed, the Congressional findings--which go into \n     detail, albeit in non-medical terms--do not remotely \n     correlate with the language of the bill. This legislation is \n     reckless. The outcome of its passage would undoubtedly be \n     countless deaths and irreversible damage to thousands of \n     women and families. We can safely assert that without D and \n     D, that is, an enactment of S. 3, we will be returning to \n     the days when an unwanted pregnancy led women to death \n     through illegal and unsafe procedures, self-inflicted \n     abortions, uncontrollable infections and suicide.\n       The cadre of physicians who provide abortions should be \n     honored, not vilified. They are heroes to millions of women, \n     offering the opportunity of choice and freedom. We urge you \n     to consider scientific data rather than partisan rhetoric \n     when voting on such far-reaching public health legislation. \n     We strongly oppose legislation intended to ban so-called \n     ``partial birth'' abortion.\n           Sincerely,\n     NAtalie E. Roche, MD,\n       Assistant Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology, New \n     Jersey Medical College.\n     Gerson Weiss, MD,\n       Professor and Chair, Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology \n     and Women's Health, New Jersey Medical College.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    March 5, 2003.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: I understand that your will be \n     considering Senate S. 3, the ban on abortion procedures, soon \n     and would like to offer some medical information that may \n     assist you in your efforts. Important stakes for women's \n     health are involved: if Congress enacts such a sweeping ban, \n     the result could effectively ban safe and common, pre-\n     viability abortion procedures.\n       By way of background, I am an adjunct professor in the \n     Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive \n     Sciences at the University of California, San Francisco, \n     where I co-direct the Center for Reproductive Health Research \n     and Policy. Formerly, I directed the Reproductive Health \n     program for the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and served \n     as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Population Affairs for the \n     United States Department of Health and Human Services. I \n     represented the United States at the International Conference \n     on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo, Egypt, and \n     currently serve on a number of Boards for organizations that \n     promote emergency contraception and new contraceptive \n     technologies, and support reducing teen pregnancy. My medical \n     and policy areas of expertise are in the family planning and \n     reproductive health, prevention of sexually transmitted \n     infections including HIV/AIDS, and enhancing international \n     and family planning.\n       The proposed ban on abortion procedures criminalizes \n     abortions in which the provider ``deliberately and \n     intentionally vaginally delivers a living fetus . . . for the \n     purpose of performing an overt act that the person knows will \n     kill the partially delivered living fetus . . .'' The \n     criminal ban being considered is flawed in a number of \n     respects:\n       It fails to protect women's health by omitting an exception \n     for women's health;\n       It menaces medical practice with the threat of criminal \n     prosecution;\n       It encompasses a range of abortion procedures; and\n       It leaves women in need of second trimester abortions with \n     far less safe medical options: hysterotomy (similar to a \n     cesarean section) and hysterectomy.\n       The proposed ban would potentially encompass several \n     abortion methods, including\n\n[[Page S12923]]\n\n     dilation and extraction (d, sometimes referred to as \n     ``intact d''), dilation and evacuation (d), the most \n     common second-trimester procedure. In addition, such a ban \n     could also apply to induction methods. Even if a physician is \n     using induction as the primary method for abortion, he or she \n     may not be able to assure that the procedure could be \n     effected without running afoul of the proposed ban. A likely \n     outcome if this legislation is enacted and enforced is that \n     physicians will fear criminal prosecution for any second \n     trimester abortion--and women will have no choice but to \n     carry pregnancies to term despite the risks to their health. \n     It would be a sad day for medicine if Congress decides that \n     hysterotomy, hysterectomy, or unsafe continuation of \n     pregnancy are women's only available options. Williams \n     Obstetrics, one of the leading medical texts in Obstetrics \n     and Gynecology, has this to say about the hysterotomy \n     ``option'' that the bill leaves open:\n       ``Nottage and Liston (1975), based on a review of 700 \n     hysterotomies, rightfully concluded that the operation is \n     outdated as a routine method for terminating pregnancy.''--\n     Cunningham and McDonald, et al., Williams Obstetrics, 19th \n     ed., (1993), p. 683.\n        Obviously, allowing women to have a hysterectomy means \n     that Congress is authorizing women to have an abortion at the \n     price of their future fertility, and with the added risks and \n     costs of major surgery. In sum, the options left open are \n     less safe for women who need an abortion after the first \n     trimester of pregnancy.\n        I'd like to focus my attention on that subset of the women \n     affected by this bill who face grievous underlying medical \n     conditions. To be sure, these are not the majority of \n     women who will be affected by this legislation, but the \n     grave health conditions that could be worsened by this \n     bill illustrate how sweeping the legislation is.\n       Take for instance women who face hypertensive disorders \n     such as eclampsia--convulsions precipitated by pregnancy-\n     induced or aggravated hypertension (high blood pressure). \n     This, along with infection and hemorrhage, is one of the most \n     common causes of maternal death. With eclampsia, the kidneys \n     and liver may be affected, and in some cases, if the woman is \n     not provided an abortion, her liver could rupture, she could \n     suffer a stroke, brain damage, or coma. Hypertensive \n     disorders are conditions that can develop over time or spiral \n     out of control in short order, and doctors must be given the \n     latitude to terminate a pregnancy if necessary in the safest \n     possible manner.\n       If the safest medical procedures are not available to \n     terminate a pregnancy, severe adverse health consequences are \n     possible for some women who have underlying medical \n     conditions necessitating a termination of their pregnancies, \n     including: death (risk of death higher with less safe \n     abortion methods); infertility; paralysis; coma; stroke; \n     hemorrhage; brain damage; infection; liver damage; and kidney \n     damage.\n       Legislation forcing doctors to forego medically indicated \n     abortions or to use less safe but politically-palatable \n     procedures is simply unacceptable for women's health.\n       Thank you very much, Senator, for your efforts to educate \n     your colleagues about the implications of the proposed ban on \n     abortion procedures.\n           Sincerely,\n     Felicia H.

Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: On June 29, 2000, in Stenberg v. \n     Carhart, 530 U.S. 914 (2000), the U.S. Supreme Court held \n     that Nebraska's sweeping ban on abortion--misleadingly \n     labeled a ban on so-called ``partial-birth abortion''--was \n     unconstitutional. I was one of the attorneys who represented \n     LeRoy Carhart, M.D., the Nebraska physician who challenged \n     the ban in that case.\n       In Carhart, the Court held that Nebraska's abortion ban was \n     unconstitutional for two reasons. First, the Court held that \n     the ban did not prohibit only one type of abortion procedure, \n     but instead outlawed several methods, including the safest \n     and ``most commonly used method for performing pre-viability \n     second trimester abortions,'' Carhart, 530 U.S. at 945, and \n     therefore constituted an undue burden on women's right to \n     choose. Second, the Court held that the Nebraska ban was \n     unconstitutional because it failed to include an exception \n     for women's health. The Court noted that ``a State may \n     promote but not endanger a woman's health when it regulates \n     the methods of abortion'' and that ``the absence of a health \n     exception will place women at an unnecessary risk of tragic \n     health consequences.'' Carhart, 530 U.S. at 931, 937.\n       The new federal bill (H.R. 760, S. 3) contains the same two \n     flaws. Like the Nebraska law, the federal bill fails to limit \n     the stage of pregnancy to which the bill's provisions apply, \n     so the ban could criminalize abortions throughout pregnancy \n     (nor just post-viability or ``late term'' abortions, as the \n     bill's sponsors often claim), and the definition of ``partial \n     birth abortion'' in the bill is broad enough to criminalize \n     numerous safe abortion procedures, including the safest and \n     most commonly used method for performing abortions early in \n     the second trimester, the D method (not just one abortion \n     procedure, as the bill's sponsors misleadingly imply). \n     Moreover, the federal bill fails to limit its prohibitions to \n     abortions involving an ``intact'' fetus, fails to explicitly \n     exclude the D technique or the suction curettage abortion \n     method from the law's prohibitions, and fails to include \n     definitions of key terms such as ``living'' or ``completion \n     of delivery.'' Like the Nebraska law, the federal bill also \n     fails to include the constitutionally mandated health \n     exception. Therefore, the federal bill is unconstitutional \n     for the same reasons as the Nebraska law struck down in \n     Carhart.\n       Because the U.S. Supreme Court has already struck down \n     legislation containing the same constitutional flaws \n     contained in the new federal bills, these bills can only be \n     seen as a direct attack on the Supreme Court's decision, on \n     the safest and most common abortion procedures in the second \n     trimester, and on the protection for women's health that have \n     been consistently reaffirmed throughout three decades of \n     abortion jurisprudence.\n       Please feel free to contact me with any further inquiries.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Priscilla Smith,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me reiterate who is being compassionate. Our side of \nthe aisle, down to every person, and the pro-choice side of the aisle. \nOn the other side we have a few. We agree to this ban if there is an \nexception for the health and life of a woman. The other side said no. \nAnd the clear fact is, when the other side says there will not be an \nexception for the health of the woman, the other side is not being \ncompassionate.\n  Let me tell you, when a woman is told--and we will take out what \ncould happen to a woman if this is not available--some of the health \nconsequences, when a woman is told she could have a stroke, that she \ncould wind up paralyzed, that she could wind up hurting or harming \nother organs, we are talking about a major problem to women.\n  To say you are being compassionate and you are being caring to the \nmost vulnerable when you turn your back away from the fact that a woman \ncould have a hemorrhage, she could have her uterus ruptured, she could \nbe made infertile, she could have blood clots, embolism, a stroke, \ndamage to nearby organs, or paralysis if this particular procedure is \nnot available to her--if you have no compassion, if you smile when you \nlook at this, if you do not feel what it is like for a woman to face \nthis, if you put this in the back of your mind, I am sorry, in my view \nyou are not for the most vulnerable at all.\n  We could have banned this procedure if we had added a health \nexception. But the other side is so demagogic on this, they will not \nwalk down the bipartisan aisle with us. That is a very sad commentary. \nThey said the health exception is too broad. They do not trust women. \nFace it, they think a woman is going to make something up?\n  We said, OK, add ``serious adverse health consequences.'' No, they \nwould not do that either.\n  The Supreme Court decided a very similar ban was unconstitutional. \nWhat the Supreme Court said about the fact that there was no health \nexception in the Stenberg v. Carhart case, that came out of Nebraska \nlaw, that had no health exception and was vague--first, they said the \nbill bans more than one procedure:\n\n       Even if the statute's basic aim is to ban D, its language \n     makes clear that it also covers a much broader category of \n     procedures.\n\n  Some would say that is the intent of the other side, to take away a \nwoman's right to choose. So they say they are banning one procedure \nwhen, in fact, it is so vague that maybe they are banning more.\n  I would have more respect and admiration for my friends on the other \nside if they just said, let's just ban abortion, just call it killing, \nput away the women into jail who have an abortion, send the doctors to \njail. That is what is in their heart. But no, they do not want to do \nthat.\n  My colleague from Alabama talked about a poll. I have other polls \nthat did not track that which I will print in the Record. The polls I \nhave do not go along with those polls.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 7 minutes the Senator asked to be notified \nof have elapsed.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will take 3 more minutes before I yield as much time as \nhe may consume to my colleague from New Jersey.\n  The poll I have is very difficult. We have a majority of 56 percent \nbelieving abortion should be legal in all or most cases. That is a very \nrecent poll. It has a margin of error of 1 to 3 points; 55\n\n[[Page S12924]]\n\npercent believe the Government should not be involved in this private \nmedical decision. I ask unanimous consent to have that printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            NARAL Pro-Choice America 2004 Presidential Poll\n\n       Anna Greenberg of Greenberg, Quinlan, Rosner Research Inc. \n     conducted this poll for NARAL Pro-Choice America between June \n     5, 2003 and June 12, 2003 among 1,200 likely voters with a \n     margin of error of 1/3.\n       While the 2004 election will be shaped by the economy, \n     security and the war on terrorism, a woman's right to choose \n     will play an important role in the presidential contest. \n     Protecting a woman's right to choose, especially when it is \n     framed as protecting her right to privacy and freedom from \n     government interference, can move important swing voters \n     including Independents and suburban voters toward a pro-\n     choice Democratic candidate.\n       Here are our findings:\n       The country is pro-choice. A majority, 56 percent, believes \n     that abortion should be legal in all or most cases.\n       The country does not want the government involved in a \n     woman's private medical decisions. Eighty percent of voters \n     believe that abortion is a decision that should be made \n     between a woman and her doctor as compared to just 11 percent \n     who say it's a decision that should be made by the \n     government. Only 27 percent of those who are identified as \n     ``pro-life'' believe that government should make the \n     decision. Even a majority of those who identified as ``pro-\n     life'' (55 percent) believe that a woman and her doctor \n     should make the decision.\n       The presidential race will be competitive and choice can \n     play an important role. After a fully informed debate that \n     includes the candidate's position on a woman's right to \n     choose, the race between President Bush and a generic \n     Democrat tightens considerably. Initially, a generic \n     Democratic candidate trails President Bush 15 points, 38 to \n     53 percent; after hearing the candidates' competing agendas \n     that includes support for a woman's right to choose, the race \n     tightens to a 6-point race, 44 to 50 percent.\n       Choice moves swing voters. After hearing two statements \n     describing the Democratic candidate and President Bush's \n     position on choice, support for a generic Democratic \n     candidate increases from 44 to 46 percent, while support for \n     President Bush drops 2 points, 48 to 46 percent. This \n     movement is driven by moderately pro-choice voters who did \n     not yet support the Democratic candidate at that stage of the \n     survey (more below).\n       A principled commitment to privacy is the strongest message \n     a pro-choice can make about choice. The privacy message is \n     the strongest pro-choice message for a Democratic candidate \n     and is consistent with the values promulgated in recent \n     Supreme Court decisions. Fully 71 percent of voters say the \n     privacy argument is a convincing reason to support the \n     Democratic candidate for president; a majority (52 percent) \n     says it is a very convincing reason.\n       A woman's right to choose is a private and very personal \n     choice, and it should remain that way. The decision to have \n     an abortion should be a decision made between a woman and her \n     doctor. The government should stay out of private medical \n     decisions.\n       Important swing voters move towards a pro-choice Democratic \n     candidate. After a fully informed debate that includes the \n     candidate's position on choice, there is a 16-point shift \n     toward the Democratic candidate among Independent voters, a \n     12-point shift among suburban voters and a 10-point shift \n     among moderate voters.\n       A pro-choice Democratic candidate can improve his or her \n     standing with moderately pro-choice voters. Voters who \n     describe themselves as pro-choice move from a 7-point margin \n     for a Democratic candidate (49 to 42 percent) in the initial \n     vote to vote to a 28-point margin for a Democrat (61 to 33 \n     percent) in the final post-choice positioning vote.\n       Democrats have a strong advantage on gender issues. Whether \n     that means women's rights, a woman's right to choose or \n     abortion, voters believe that Democrats do a better job on \n     these issues. The strongest advantage is on a woman's right \n     to choose with 60 percent of voters saying Democrats do a \n     better job on the issue as compared to just 19 percent who \n     believe Republicans do a better job on the issue.\n       Other findings of interest: 61 percent of Americans know \n     someone who had an abortion, including 56 percent of those \n     who identified themselves as ``pro-life.''\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. We have different polls. But my friend from Alabama is \ntotally correct. This is not about polls. He can prove in one poll that \nhe is right; I can prove in one poll that I am right. The issue is in \nour hearts. We do not agree with each other.\n  If you want to make a woman a criminal, make a doctor a criminal, \ncome here, we will have a vote up or down on that. Do not chip away, \nchip away, chip away, and hurt women in the process. The Court has \nstated that this is unconstitutional, bottom line.\n  On the other hand, my colleague said: our bill that bans this \nprocedure is not violative of Roe because we have declared in the \nfindings that the health issue is immaterial.\n  Well, good luck. When you have doctors testifying, when you have \nnurses testifying, when you have health professionals testifying, when \nyou have women testifying, ``We have had this procedure,'' because they \nknew they might die if they did not or they would be made infertile, \nand compare that to Senators or Congresspeople, I think the Court will \nlook at the professional judgment of doctors because we are not doctors \nhere. And we are certainly not God.\n\n  So let's call it what it is. It is not compassionate to pass a bill \ntoday that turns its back on the health of women. That is not \ncompassionate. And the Supreme Court, let's see what else they said \nabout this particular philosophy that you are going to get in this bill \nand why they overturned the last one that did the same thing.\n  Even if it only banned D, meaning the proposal my colleagues say \nthey are banning, this ban would pose grave health risks. This is the \nSupreme Court:\n\n       The record shows that significant medical authority \n     supports the proposition that, in some circumstances, D \n     would be the safest procedure.\n\n  This is the Court, the same Court that is going to hear your ban that \nhas no health exception:\n\n       A statute that altogether forbids D creates a significant \n     health risk. The statute consequently must contain a health \n     exception.\n\n  I ask my colleague if he is ready to speak because I am ready to \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Here is what we know so far. We have a bill that has no \nhealth exception. It bans a procedure doctors say is needed. We have a \nbill that looks just like the Supreme Court case, and the Supreme Court \nsaid it is unconstitutional. And in the course of the conference, the \nconferees on the other side threw out the language that supports the \nRoe v. Wade decision.\n  This is a bad package for the families of America. I know the \nhandwriting is on the wall that it will pass, but the issue is not \ngoing away.\n  I yield to my colleague as much time as he may wish to consume, \nSenator Lautenberg from New Jersey. I thank him for coming over today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from California \nfor her courage to stand up here and take a position when what we are \nseeing on the other side, with its pictures and statements about how \nthis process is running rampant through America. It is not. We ought to \nface up to reality.\n  My position is kind of: There they go again. There they go again, \nwanting to curb people's rights, rights that are abundant and ought to \nremain in place without us touching them, civil rights such as \naffirmative action, rights such as the ability to have your day in \ncourt to make your case, and not have it snatched away to protect the \ngun industry from lawsuits no matter how reckless their behavior.\n  We do not hear anything nor have we ever seen a picture here of a \ngunshot victim who may never be able to walk again. We know Jim Brady \nwill not walk again on his own, because of a gunshot wound. Do we see \nthose kinds of pictures, the horror? Do we see surgical procedures \ndepicted here in the Chamber, pictures of people having their \nintestines removed or something of that nature? Sure, they are ugly, \nbut the point is that sometimes doctors have to do them to preserve \nsomeone's health, and that's a positive purpose.\n  At any rate, the other side wants to take away workers' rights to \njoin unions and get overtime pay. The other side wants to promote \njudicial nominees who are anti-choice, anti-union, and anti-civil \nrights.\n  This is an attempt to regulate people's behavior.\n  I have noticed one thing here since this debate has begun: We have \nnot seen one woman talk in favor of the side that says: This procedure \nought to be banned. Put the doctors in jail. We have 15 women in the \nSenate, but not one is here defending the position that says: Take away \nthe doctors' ability to practice medicine as they see fit.\n  Listen. I want to be clear here. And I want everybody to hear my \nvoice: I am\n\n[[Page S12925]]\n\nnot pro-abortion. I am pro-choice. I believe a woman has the right to \nmake a decision, in concert with her doctor, about her health.\n  What happens if she has another sick child or she herself suddenly \nfinds that her health is being ruined, physically or mentally? Does she \nhave a right to make her decision? I think so.\n  I have a child who is now pregnant with my 10th grandchild. We do not \ntalk about abortions. Thank God, my other grandchildren and their \nmothers have been healthy. But we had their health checked to make sure \neverything was going to be OK because nothing is more important than \nhaving my three daughters and my daughter-in-law available to take care \nof the children they have and to make sure that their families stay \nintact.\n  But here, in what I call the ``male-garchy'' that is the United \nStates Senate, we have the men deciding what ought to happen with women \nwho, with their doctor, want to make a decision to protect their \nhealth.\n  The Senator from California was eloquent. She said: Provide those \nexceptions for the health and well-being of a mother. But no, that is \nnot good enough: We don't like the way these women are making these \ndecisions. We don't like it. We don't think they are mature enough to \nmake these decisions. They are mature enough to be a mother, but are \nthey mature enough to make their own decisions about their body? No, \nnot according to the ``Big Boys' Club'' here; they should not be \nallowed to do that.\n  This is always a very difficult discussion. I don't think my friends \nwho are on the opposite side are evil; they just happen to be wrong, in \nmy view. I do not attribute anything to them except that I want to \nexpose what I think is the truth; and that is, this growing trend to \nregulate people's behavior in this free, democratic society about which \nwe talk so much.\n  When our young people fight in Iraq, when they fought in Vietnam, or \nin other wars--I fought in World War II--the fight has been to protect \npeople's freedoms--freedoms. What are we doing trying to take away a \nright, and threatening doctors who perform a procedure they judge \nnecessary to protect the life and health of the mother?\n  I voted against this bill, and I intend to vote against the \nconference report. A woman's right to choose is in greater danger now \nthan it has been at any time since the Supreme Court issued its \ndecision in Roe v. Wade 30 years ago.\n  Supporters of this bill use the term ``partial-birth abortion.'' \nThere is no medical term ``partial-birth.'' It is a term deliberately \nconcocted by the anti-choice movement to inflame passions. Make no \nmistake: the procedure(s) covered by this phony term are not chosen \nlightly. Does anybody here think that a woman who is 6 or 7 months \nalong in her pregnancy, who falls prey to illness or disease, or \ndiscovers for some other reason that the pregnancy must be terminated--\ndoes anybody think that is an easy decision? It absolutely is not.\n  I am the father of 4 and, as I mentioned, the grandfather of 9--Lord \nwilling, 10 soon.\n  But how can such a decision be challenged? How can the woman's \ndecision, made in concert with her doctor, who says, ``I recommend this \nas a necessary procedure''--be challenged? Well, here in the ``Boys' \nClub,'' a woman and her doctor won't be allowed to make that decision. \nIn my opinion, that is not right. I think the message the other side is \nsending to women is: Your behavior is abominable. We don't want you to \ndo it. And here we have these poor people, these poor woman, who are \nrisking their own health, carrying a fetus for 6 or 7 or 8 months--\nnever a pleasant experience, I assure you.\n  As I said, there is no such medical term as ``partial-birth \nabortion,'' and that is intentional because this bill is not designed \nto ban one particular abortion procedure but many safe and legal \nmedical procedures. If S. 3 is ultimately passed, and President Bush \nsigns it into law, as he has promised, he will become the first U.S. \nPresident to criminalize safe medical procedures.\n  Nobody is fooled by the real objective here, which is to chip away at \na woman's right to choose and, ultimately, to criminalize legal and \nsafe abortion procedures.\n  No. When people know what this bill is really about, they are \nopposed. An ABC News poll showed that 61 percent of Americans oppose \ncriminalizing abortion procedures if a woman's health is threatened.\n  The bill is deceptive. It is extreme. We already know this bill won't \npass the constitutional test. When we debated this bill back in March, \nmany of us who are pro-choice said clearly, directly, that we would \naccept this bill if the bill's proponents would just make an exception \nfor the life and health of the mother. That is what we were asking for. \nWhat is wrong with that? I don't understand the other side's objection \nto that.\n  Their obstinance shows the true position of those who want to police \nour conduct and decide how people ought to behave. It is too bad. It is \nnot right.\n  The sponsors of S. 3 have repeatedly resisted reasonable attempts to \ninclude a health exception such as the Feinstein substitute, which was \ndefeated. This bill is purely political. Everybody here knows it will \nbe ruled unconstitutional. Five members of the current Supreme Court \nhave struck down a State ban on so-called partial-birth abortions. The \nsame fate awaits this legislation. And in New Jersey, my State, the \nState Supreme Court overturned a similar ban in 2000.\n  About a month ago we had a very enlightening debate on the Senate \nfloor over an important amendment offered to S. 3 by our colleague, \nSenator Harkin. The amendment reaffirmed support for the Supreme \nCourt's decision in Roe v. Wade. The House Republican leadership \ndecided that the Senate did not have the wisdom, and their leadership \nand their anti-choice friends removed Senator Harkin's language in \nconference. Striping this bill of the Harkin amendment that reaffirms \nRoe v. Wade shows us what the President and his anti-choice allies are \nreally after. They want to overturn Roe v. Wade. It has been said many \ntimes. Unfortunately, this bill puts them on that path.\n  During the previous debate on this bill, the junior Senator from \nPennsylvania characterized the Harkin amendment, a reaffirmation of \ncurrent law, as extreme. That is absurd. Not being willing to protect a \nwoman's health is extreme. It is extreme, and it is wrong.\n  We know where this administration is headed. We know the true motives \nof the anti-choice administration and its allies in Congress. Look no \nfurther than the recent decision in 2002 made by the Bush \nadministration to amend the State Children's Health Insurance Program \nto provide coverage for fetuses and embryos rather than for pregnant \nwomen.\n  This rabid ideology extends so far that the administration won't \nallow the United States to participate in international family planning \nprograms. We are so paranoid about this, it is ridiculous.\n  I urge my colleagues to think this whole matter through, to put \nwomen's health and access to safe medical care before ideology, not to \nvote for this thinly veiled attempt to overturn Roe v. Wade. I urge \nthat they vote against this unconstitutional bill before us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much time do I still retain?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time remaining is 76 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I mean under the agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. I will use the 6 minutes and then the \ntime will revert to my colleague from Pennsylvania.\n  I thank my colleague and friend from New Jersey for coming to the \nChamber to lay out so many of the unstated issues that revolve around \nthis debate. The points he made today are important. Before he leaves, \nI want to ask him a question on my time. I know he is the proudest \ngrandpa of 9, soon to be 10, we hope and expect. You have served for \nmany years not only in public life but as a leader in business and \nleader of the community.\n  We hear from the other side about the need to protect the vulnerable. \nMy friend stands with me as a supporter of the Violence Against Women \nAct, a supporter of the Violence Against Children Act and the need to \ndo everything we can for the most vulnerable, to protect them from \nenvironmental hazards.\n  I find it interesting that they will talk on the other side and show \npictures on the other side of fetuses before\n\n[[Page S12926]]\n\nthey are born. And the compassion, I don't doubt that for a minute. I \nhave no doubt that my colleagues feel such compassion. Believe me, I do \nas well. Having given birth to two premature babies, I totally \nunderstand the love and compassion you give to the child you are \ncarrying.\n  But I want to say to my friend, isn't there something missing here \nfrom this discussion of compassion? Should we not show compassion for a \nwoman who desperately seeks to have a child and is told in the 7th \nmonth, the 6th month, something has gone terribly awry, that the baby's \nhead is so large, the brain perhaps is developing outside of the skull, \nthere are other problems, that the doctor says, to spare this woman a \nterrible life-threatening illness or to spare her infertility, that he \nrecommends or she recommends that this procedure that is now being \noutlawed is the only way to, A, spare the woman from these possible \nhealth consequences which are serious and long term, could even land \nher in a wheelchair, render her unable to take care of her other \nchildren, and to spare that fetus, if it were born, the worst nightmare \nof a brief and short life? This happens to women. Does my friend not \nsee the compassion in working with this family in a way that would give \nthe woman dignity, preserve her health, the fetus dignity? I will talk \nabout this because we have pro-life women, very religious, who went \nthrough this to spare the indignity to the fetus, to spare the pain to \nthe fetus, to spare their own health. Is there not compassion in that \ndecision and in that choice?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, in fact, the question is a very good \none. It addresses the issue we are discussing. Why is there no \nagreement to the request of so many of us to go along and outlaw \ncertain procedures altogether, get rid of them, as long as the health \nand well-being of the mother is taken care of?\n  I endowed initially--and it is still in existence--a cancer research \ncenter. It is called the Lautenberg Cancer Research Center, paid for \nwith my own funds and people from whom I have raised money. We focus on \nbreast cancer and other issues. We try to protect the women's health at \nall costs. We are not as generous here as we are to the fat cats who \nare going to get those huge tax cuts. Oh, no, they are entitled to \ntheirs. But when it comes to potentially taking care of women's health, \na child's health, men's health, all of it--well, it is OK to do that to \na point. But to let women make their own decisions is outrageous.\n  There is nothing more tragic than to see a woman unable to take care \nof herself or her family as a result of continuing with a pregnancy \nthat robbed her of her well-being.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, my friend is right. I just hope we recognize, \nbecause I know the Supreme Court recognizes it, that if we turn our \nbacks on the women of this country as we are going to do today, first, \nit will never hold up across the street in the Supreme Court--no way.\n  Second of all, we are threatening the health of so many women. Before \nmy friend leaves, I want to give him two brief stories. Eileen Sullivan \nof California--and these women are so courageous to tell the stories--\nis a Catholic with 10 brothers and sisters. Eileen had long awaited her \nfirst child. She and her husband were devastated to discover, at 26 \nweeks of pregnancy, that testing revealed overwhelming fatal \nabnormalities in their son, including an improperly formed brain, a \nmalformed head, no lungs, and a nonfunctioning liver. The severe \nanomalies were incompatible with life.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is up.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent for just 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Eileen and her husband sought the advice of medical \nspecialists, but the prognosis grew worse with each additional test. \nFinally, the Sullivans, religious Catholics, made the decision they \nthought was most compassionate for their son, safest for Eileen, and \nmost likely to allow them to have a healthy child in the future. Eileen \nhad a D abortion in July of 1996.\n  I will conclude by saying I don't think it is compassionate to take \naway the choice of a woman such as this who is grappling with her \nreligion, ethics, and making a decision with her family to do what is \nright for her family and for this unborn child. I think it is such a \nstatement that there is no respect for the people of this country, \nthere is no value given to their values, their souls, their religion, \nto their way of dealing with tragedy.\n  I don't understand how my friends from the other side of the aisle, \nwho always talk about Big Brother interfering, could move into this \narea and turn their backs on the American families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, it is very clear to me that the Senator \nfrom New Jersey and I have a fundamental difference on how we view this \nissue. For the Senator from New Jersey to liken this procedure to the \nremoval of an intestine, to compare the killing of a fetus----\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. To compare the killing of a fetus to the removal of an \nintestine--a fetus like in this picture, where you can see that little \nhand, that is a 21-week-old. That is the age at which these children \nare killed by partial-birth abortion. To compare the killing and \nextinguishing of life to the removal of an intestine is----\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield for a very brief question? My \nfather was 42 when he was stricken with colon cancer and he had his \nintestine removed to try to save his life. It was an ugly, painful \nprocedure. As I equate this with any painful procedure that is \nsurgically necessary. They tried to save his life but were \nunsuccessful.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Senator from New Jersey is equating the removal of \ntissue that was damaging to the person involved--removing an intestine \nto preserve that health or life. This little child, in almost every \nsituation--in fact, the industry agrees: healthy mothers, healthy \nchildren--that little child is not a threat to this mother. It is not a \ncancerous lesion. It is not a defective or deformed part of that \nperson's body that is threatening their health. This is a living \norganism. It happens to be a human being inside of the mother, and it \nis being killed not for the health of the mother or for the life of the \nmother but because the mother no longer wants the child.\n  The father of the Senator from New Jersey whose operation was \nperformed was removing something that was damaging his health and \npotentially threatening his life. That is not the case here. To compare \nthe two shows you the fundamental difference in our view.\n  What are we saying to people when we liken little children to \ncancerous parts of someone's body? We just see these little children \nas, what, threats? As something to be excised because they are not \nwanted? Is that the way we look at children? Is that how we see them--\nas cancerous lesions? Then we wonder why we have so much child abuse in \nthis country, why one-third of the pregnancies end in abortion, why our \nculture is degraded, because we compare them to cancerous intestines on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, the first thing I want to address is: the \nother side has been talking about the health of the mother and that \nthis bill includes a provision if the life of the mother is threatened. \nAs far as the health of the mother is concerned, a select panel \nconvened by the American Medical Association could not find any \n``identified circumstance'' where a partial-birth abortion was the only \nappropriate alternative.\n  We have heard a lot of testimony from OB/GYNs and all kinds of \nmedical experts that this procedure is never necessary. To argue that \nit is somehow medically necessary is a false argument. This procedure \nis so grotesque that when it is described, it makes people shudder. I \nonce described this procedure when I spoke to some high school kids, \nand I used it as an example. I got complaints from the parents because \nwe talked about such a gruesome procedure in a school. I can understand \nwhy they would be upset.\n  But people have to understand that this gruesome procedure is \nhappening in the United States. What we are trying to do now in the \nCongress is to say\n\n[[Page S12927]]\n\nthis is so outrageous that we need to ban it.\n  I am a health care professional and I cannot even imagine a doctor or \na nurse being involved in one of these procedures, delivering the baby \nout of the birth canal up to about here, the neck--arms and legs \nmoving, holding that little baby in their hand, feeling life in their \nhand, a little heartbeat--and voluntarily taking forceps and jabbing \nthem into the back of the skull. The skull is too big to come out so \nthey have to collapse the skull down, sucking out the contents of the \nskull--the brains, basically. The baby at that point can feel pain. It \nis documented. In fact, it feels pain more than a normal child that has \ninhibitory pain fibers. We are saying this is somehow humane for the \nchild, and that is literally beyond me.\n  This procedure is completely, in my mind, indefensible; it is \ninfanticide. I want to talk about abortion in general because the other \nside is saying this is just chipping away at the rights of abortion. I \nremember when President Clinton said that abortion should be safe, \nlegal, and rare. I think those were his terms. I was thinking to \nmyself, safe, I can understand that; legal, from his perspective, I can \nunderstand that; but if you don't believe it is wrong, who cares \nwhether it is rare?\n  If there is nothing wrong with abortion, why should it be rare? Who \ncares? If it is not a baby, if it is just a blob of tissue, like the \nother side says, who cares whether it happens all the time? Why do we \ncare whether it is rare?\n  The reason even somebody like Bill Clinton says it should be rare is \nbecause there is something in our conscience that is telling us \nabortion is wrong. Eighty-six percent of Down syndrome babies are \naborted today--86 percent. We have an incredible young man right out \nhere who runs the elevators. His name is Jimmy. He has Down syndrome.\n  We have a great organization in Las Vegas called Opportunity Village \nwhich deals with a lot of people. It employs a lot of people, finds \nthem a job, people with either congenital problems, whether Down \nsyndrome or other problems, or whether they have had a brain injury. We \nare saying to those people: You don't have the right to live. We are \nsaying to the Jimmys of the world: You know what, you aren't perfect, \nso you don't have the right to live. That is what abortion is about. Is \nit going to be difficult? Yes, but life isn't guaranteed to be easy.\n  Mr. President, we have to look at what we are becoming as a society. \nIf we do not value human life to the point where it is OK to have \nlittle imperfections, what are we becoming as a society? Haven't we \nseen in history the societies that have tried to create the perfect \nrace, how immoral that was? Isn't that what we are trying to do \nsomewhat with abortions and some of the other new medical technologies \nthat are coming out?\n  This is a very emotional issue, and I understand people who believe \nabortion should be legal. There are a lot of women who have had \nabortions, who have gone through incredible stress--post-abortion \nsyndrome, as it is known. It is likened to post-traumatic stress \nsyndrome. I feel badly, and I feel pain for those women and men who \nhave been involved with abortions.\n  Sometimes as a defense mechanism, one tries to justify what one did. \nI think it is important for us to show compassion for those people who \nhave been involved and it is important not to judge other people's \nmotives. But at the same time, we have to look, as a country, at \nwhether it is right or wrong. If it is a baby, it is wrong. It just is. \nIf it is a baby, it is murder. If it is not a baby, if it is some \ntissue, like the other side says, that is exactly right, it should be \nlegal. It should be absolutely legal, if it is just tissue. But if it \nis a human life, then that human life deserves to be defended. That \ninnocent human life deserves all the protections of the law, whether \nthey have Down syndrome, spina bifida, or any other congenital ailment. \nThey deserve the same protection under our law any other ``normal'' \nhealthy child has.\n  We have to look at ourselves as a society and what type of a society \nwe want to have going into the future. America's greatness has been \nbecause we have had strong moral standards. This is the great moral \nproblem of our day about which we have to do some soul-searching as a \ncountry, to be on our knees in prayer to figure out the right course of \naction. For me, it is clear.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to do a lot of soul-searching on this \nissue. I believe if you are honest, people will see the rights of a \nbaby deserve to be protected.\n  I thank the manager of the bill and others who have been involved in \nthis issue for the great work they have done. This is truly a fight \nworth doing and worth doing right.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/21/senate-section/article/S12927-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nColorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Pennsylvania, \nMr. Santorum, and Senator Frist for their leadership on this particular \nissue. Both have worked extremely hard. I also commend the Presiding \nOfficer for his leadership for the rights of the unborn.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the Partial-Birth Abortion Act, \nwhich is S. 3. This legislation is designed to help protect unnecessary \nsuffering of the unborn child and also to protect the mother. It \nprohibits a partial-birth abortion, which is a partial delivery of a \nliving baby, the killing of a baby before complete delivery.\n  The bill allows partial-birth abortion except for the life of the \nmother, and in cases where there is endangerment by physical disorder, \nillness, and injury.\n  I will go through some of the bill's definitions, which I think say a \nlot about what this bill is all about.\n  The term ``partial-birth abortion'' means an abortion which, first, \n``the person performing the abortion deliberately and intentionally \nvaginally delivers a living fetus until, in the case of a head-first \npresentation, the entire fetal head is outside the body of the mother, \nor, in the case of breech presentation, any part of the fetal trunk \npast the navel is outside the body of the mother for the purpose of \nperforming an overt act that the person knows will kill the partially \ndelivered living fetus.'' That is the way it is defined in the bill. \nFurther, the term ``partial-birth abortion'' means an overt act, other \nthan completion of delivery, that ``kills the partially delivered \nliving fetus with this procedure.''\n  This type of abortion is called a D abortion, which would be \nprohibited, also referred to as a dilation and extraction abortion. The \nbill defines ``extraction'' as: ``Extraction from the uterus and into \nthe vagina of all of the body of a fetus except the head, following \nwhich the fetus is killed by extracting the contents of the skull.'' \nAfter the baby's skull tissue is rooted out, then the remains of the \nbaby are removed.\n  I emphasize, this bill does not prohibit other abortions. For \nexample, it does not prohibit what is commonly referred to as D, or \ndilation and evacuation, a procedure which includes dismemberment of \nthe baby inside the uterus, induction of preterm labor with the fetus \nforced from the uterus, and suctioning of the baby out of the uterus. \nIt does not prohibit suction abortion, which involves scraping the \nfetus apart from the placenta, or suctioning the baby out of the \nuterus. It does not prohibit all other types of abortion that might be \napplied, such as a Caesarian section or a hysterotomy.\n  The bill protects the life and safety of the mother. Partial-birth \nabortion was never intended to be a procedure to protect the health of \nthe mother. This procedure has become a form of abortion. On the \ncontrary, we need a ban in order to protect the health of the mother. \nIt is a dangerous procedure, it is a fringe procedure, and it is \noutside the mainstream of routine medicine.\n\n[[Page S12928]]\n\n  The American Medical Association, for example, which is an \norganization that is committed to medical excellence on behalf of \npatients and professionals, opposes this procedure. The AMA has \ndescribed this procedure as unsafe and dangerous. The American Medical \nAssociation has stated it is ``not good medicine,'' ``not medically \nindicated.''\n  There are some specific exceptions: If the mother's life is in \ndanger. The bill allows abortion if endangered by physical disorders or \nillness or injury.\n  In the bill, again, it says:\n\n       Any physician who, in or affecting interstate or foreign \n     commerce, knowingly performs a partial-birth abortion and \n     thereby kills a human fetus shall be fined under this title \n     or imprisoned not more than 2 years or both. This subsection \n     does not apply to a partial-birth abortion that is necessary \n     to save the life of a mother whose life is endangered by a \n     physical disorder, physical illness, or physical injury, \n     including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or \n     arising from the pregnancy itself.\n\n  I went through a lot of the procedures of the bill just to let the \nMembers of the Senate know how grotesque this procedure is. This bill \nis necessary and important.\n  This legislation is designed to protect infants. Testimony in \ncommittee indicates there is pain to the baby when this partial-birth \nabortion procedure is conducted. Professor Robert White, who is \ndirector of the Division of Neurosurgery and Brain Research Laboratory \nat Case Western Reserve School of Medicine, testified before the \nConstitution Subcommittee in 1995. These are his exact words:\n\n       The fetus within this time frame of gestation, 20 weeks and \n     beyond, is fully capable of experiencing pain. Without \n     question, all of this is a dreadfully painful experience for \n     any infant subject to such a surgical procedure.\n\n  The procedure should not exist or be permitted, in my view. It is \npainful, morbid, inhumane, and simply barbaric. A majority of Americans \nbelieve we should end this practice and it should be illegal except if \nnecessary to save the life of the mother.\n  The House and Senate have passed a number of times on this \nlegislation. We passed a partial-birth abortion bill from this body in \nthe 104th, 105th, and 106th Congresses. In the 108th Congress, both the \nHouse and the Senate passed this ban--with a vote in the House of 181 \nfor, 142 against. It was a bipartisan vote. Again, we had a bipartisan \nvote in the Senate, where we had 64 for and 33 against.\n  It is important that we pass this particular legislation. The \nPresident strongly supports S. 3. President Bush, in his State of the \nUnion Address, asked Congress to:\n\n     . . . protect infants at the very moment of birth, and end \n     the practice of partial-birth abortion.\n\n  We need to act now. I again thank my colleagues in the Senate who \nhave been such strong advocates of eliminating partial-birth abortion \nexcept in situations threatening the life of the mother. I am pleased \nwe are acting now, and I thank my colleagues for their support of this \nimportant ban for the Nation's children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. After conferring with my colleague from California, we \nset this in place. I will yield to the Senator from Illinois for 10 \nminutes. I ask unanimous consent that following that 10 minutes, the \nSenator from Ohio be recognized for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois. If he needs further time, I agree to an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this debate is not something I look \nforward to on the floor of the Senate. This is one of the toughest \nissues any elected official ever has to face. It is highly \ncontroversial. In my home State of Illinois, in my hometown of \nSpringfield, virtually everywhere I travel, there is a strong \ndifference of opinion on the issue of abortion.\n  I understand that, and I really have to say as to all those who come \nto the floor today on either side of this issue, we should never \nquestion their motives because I think each and every one of us has \ntried to search our soul to find out what is fair and what is just. In \nmany instances here, we are talking about things beyond our expertise \nas individuals. Some of us are lawyers, some have other backgrounds. \nVery few, if any of us, have medical credentials. But we come today to \nconsider something which is historic, and that is that we would ban in \nthe United States a medical procedure.\n  To my knowledge, that has never been done. It is being done here \nunder the pretense that it is the humane and right thing to do. Yet \nwhen you speak to the professionals, those who do this for a living, \nthe obstetricians and gynecologists, they basically tell you, be \ncareful, because you can't really predict in every instance what a \nmother might face late in a pregnancy. But this bill has decided that \nregardless of the medical emergency that might face a mother late in \nher pregnancy--regardless, we are going to eliminate once and for all \nthis medical procedure. I think that is a very historic and very \ndangerous action.\n  I wonder if, in retrospect, we would do it in any other area of \nmedicine. But when it comes to the politically controversial area of \nabortion, many politicians and elected officials just come roaring \nthrough the door and say: Let me tell you what we are going to do and \nwhat we are not going to do.\n  I have tried to look at this in honest and fair terms. Let me tell \nyou what I believe. I believe all late-term abortions should be \nstrictly construed and prohibited in almost every case. I only allow \ntwo exceptions for any type of late-term abortion procedure: The life \nof the mother, and where the mother faces grievous physical injury if \nshe goes through the pregnancy.\n  I said in an amendment I brought to the floor, just to make certain \nwe know what we are doing, two doctors have to certify that either her \nlife is at stake or, in fact, she runs the risk of grievous physical \ninjury. I can stand behind that. I can say in good conscience that \nthose are the only two exceptions for which I will stand.\n  But the bill before us today does not allow those two exceptions. If \na mother faces the possibility of grievous physical injury if she \ncontinues the pregnancy, this bill will still ban a procedure which \nsome doctors believe is best for her under those circumstances. \nConsider that for a moment. Consider what we are saying. Even if the \nwoman faces grievous physical injury, she has to continue the \npregnancy, or at least seek some other way of terminating the pregnancy \nthat might not be as good for her.\n  Don't take my word for it. Again, I am a lawyer, I am a legislator. \nBut the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists was asked \nabout this procedure, and this is what they said. When abortion is \nperformed after 16 weeks, intact D, which is what is called partial-\nbirth abortion here, is one method of terminating a pregnancy. This is \nthe important language from the professionals, from the obstetricians \nand gynecologists. Listen closely:\n\n       The physician, in consultation with the patient, must \n     choose the most appropriate method based upon the patient's \n     individual circumstances.\n\n  If it were your wife whose life was at stake, whose physical well-\nbeing were at stake, isn't that the standard you would want, that the \ndoctor and your wife and family would make the best decision, \nappropriate to her medical circumstances? There is no doubt in my mind. \nThere is no doubt in the minds of the women who have come to tell me of \nthe sad stories of their pregnancies that ended so badly.\n  Yet in this bill we are saying, as politicians and legislators, we \nwant to step into that room in the doctor's office, we want to stand \nbetween the doctor and the patient, and we want to make the \ndecision. We want to say to that doctor, regardless of what you think \nis best for this woman who faces grievous physical injury if she goes \nforward with the pregnancy, regardless of what is best for her in your \nmedical, professional opinion, we are going to take away from you one \nprocedure which you can use. It might be the best one for her, but it \nis not the best one politically. That is why this bill is before the \nSenate. That is a sad circumstance.\n\n  In one of the most frightening times in a woman's life, when she is \nso late in her pregnancy that they have decorated the room for the \nbaby, picked the\n\n[[Page S12929]]\n\nname, they know what they will do when the baby comes home, she gets \nthe tragic news that something has happened no one anticipated. One of \nthe ladies from my State came forward. I met her a few years ago. Vicki \ntalked about having two children and a third child on the way. Here she \nwas, late in her pregnancy. She described the pregnancy as disgustingly \nnormal. At 32 weeks in the pregnancy, 8 months into the pregnancy, she \nwent in for an ultrasound and discovered the little boy she was \ncarrying had at least 9 major anomalies, including a fluid-filled \ncranium with no brain tissue at all, compacted, flattened vertebrae, \ncongenital hip dysplasia, skeletal dysplasia, and hyperteloric eyes. \nThe doctor told her this baby will never survive outside the womb and \nbecause of her physical condition he said she should terminate the \npregnancy if she wanted to live and if she ever wanted to have another \nchild.\n  Her husband, a doctor, sat down with her. They told me, personally, \nof crying through the night, making this decision and finally deciding \nthey had to do this. And they did. She terminated this pregnancy with \nthe very procedure that is being banned by this bill. She did it \nbecause she thought she had no choice. The doctor told her she had no \nchoice. Frankly, if this bill passes, that procedure would not be \navailable to her.\n  What has happened to Vicki since? The good news is she became \npregnant again and she delivered a son, Nicholas, a little boy I met \nright outside the Capitol. This is a woman who did not want to be a \nmother, who did not want to be pregnant? No. It is a woman who, through \nno fault of her own, found herself facing a medical emergency and \ndeciding at the last moment, with her husband and her conscience, what \nwas the best thing to do. She chose the very procedure which is going \nto be banned and prohibited by this bill.\n  That is unfortunate. There has been so much publicity back and forth \nabout abortion procedures. Trust me, there is no way to terminate a \npregnancy which is clean and sanitary and something you would want to \npublicize on television. It is a gruesome procedure at any stage in the \npregnancy. Yet we have been led to believe this termination of \npregnancy is somehow much different.\n  When I came before the Senate and said, all right, I will go along \nwith terminating all late-term abortion procedures except when the \nmother's life is at stake or she is running the risk of grievous \nphysical injury, we will require two doctors to certify that and will \npenalize a doctor if he misrepresents or lies about that, I thought, \nfinally, we found a reasonable middle ground. Those who are opposed to \nvirtually all abortions still would not vote for that amendment. Even \nthough we had support of people who are pro-life and pro-choice, they \ncould not support it.\n  The Supreme Court, across the street, has told us what happens to \nbills such as the one we are passing today. If you do not include a \nprovision in there to consider the health of the mother, grievous \nphysical injury, for example, if you do not include that provision, \nthen you fail by the Roe v. Wade test.\n\n  Do not ask this Senator to stand here and make this statement with no \nevidence. The Court already mandated that decision in Stenberg v. \nCarhart. Nebraska, in that case, struck it down, with virtually the \nsame language before the Senate today. They said it lacks any exception \nfor the preservation of the health of the mother. This bill lacks any \nexception for the preservation of the health of the mother.\n  Why are we here today? Because some people understand that \nregenerating this issue on a regular basis is good for some \npolitically. But it is not good for this Nation, not to have closure on \nan issue or at least some reasonable compromise where we can limit all \nlate-term abortion procedures.\n  There are some who are opposed to all forms of abortion. I respect \ntheir point of view. I respect the principles that bring them to that \ndecision. But for those who believe, as I do, that abortion should be \nrare and should be safe, that we should limit it to the most \nextraordinary cases, particularly late-term abortions, I offered an \namendment to do that. It was rejected. Instead, we have this bill \ncoming before the Senate, headed to the Supreme Court, which does not \ninclude the exception necessary to protect the health of the mother--\nprotect the health of the mother I met, a woman who faced an \nextraordinary medical emergency.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nOhio is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nPennsylvania, Senator Santorum, Senator Brownback, Senator Graham, \nMajority Leader Frist, also my colleague, Senator Allard, who spoke \njust a moment ago, for their unending and unwavering efforts to put a \npermanent end to this horrible partial-birth abortion procedure.\n  We are here today because a civilized society cannot tolerate this \ntype of procedure. With all due respect to my colleague, my friend from \nIllinois, this is not about politics. This is about what kind of a \nsociety we have, what kind of a country, what kind of a people we are.\n  This will be the third time for the Senate and the Congress to vote \nto ban this inhumane procedure--a procedure which, I point out, has \nabsolutely no medical purpose. Time and time again, the testimony we \nheard in front of our Judiciary Committee is this procedure is never--I \nrepeat, never--medically indicated. I also point out, just to make sure \nthere is a a provision in this bill that provides for a life-of-the-\nmother exception, the testimony time and time again from all the \nexperts was this is never medically indicated.\n  This has been before the Senate before. We have voted on this before. \nThe difference today is after Congress votes to ban this procedure this \ntime, this time the President of the United States will sign this bill \ninto law. Soon, once this becomes the law of the land, the abortionist \nwill not be able to legally perform this brutal act on our society's \nmost innocent victims. Once this becomes the law of the land, the \nabortionist will no longer pull living babies feet first out of their \nmother's wombs, puncturing their skulls and sucking out their brains. \nThose are the facts, much as we hate to talk about them.\n  I have come to the Senate before and talked about different specific \nstories. I have talked about the story of Baby Hope. The stories of \nlittle children like Baby Hope will no longer occur. I described before \nin the Senate in detail the story of Baby Hope. This was the story \nwhere the abortionist, Dr. Mark Haskell, in Dayton, OH, inserted, as he \nhas done thousands of times, a surgical instrument into this little \nchild--in this case, Baby Hope--into Baby Hope's mother to dilate her \ncervix so Baby Hope could eventually be removed and killed. In this \ncase, Baby Hope's mother went home to Cincinnati expecting to return 3 \ndays later to Dayton for the completion of the procedure. This is a 3-\nday procedure. In this case, the mother's cervix dilated too quickly \nand as a result Baby Hope was actually born but died shortly \nthereafter.\n  Mr. President and Members of the Senate, on the death certificate \nthere is a space for the cause of death or ``Method of Death.'' In Baby \nHope's case, the method of death is written in with the word \n``natural.'' Well, that, of course, is simply not true. There is \nnothing natural about the events that led to the death of this tiny \nlittle child. We all know that Baby Hope did not die of natural causes.\n  We cannot nor should we ever forget this tragedy, nor others like it \nas recounted by medical professionals.\n  My colleagues may recall the story of Brenda Pratt Shafer, a \nregistered nurse who was assigned to Dr. Haskell's abortion clinic one \nmorning in the early 1990s. I have told this story on the Senate floor \nmany times.\n  Nurse Shafer observed Dr. Haskell use the partial-birth abortion \nprocedure to abort babies that day. In fact, she testified before our \nSenate Judiciary Committee in 1995.\n  I would like to share with my colleagues again--and I pray that this \ntime will be the final time we have to tell this story on the Senate \nfloor--exactly what the nurse saw and what she testified to in front of \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  Nurse Shafer gave very gripping, very telling, very truthful \ntestimony. This is what she said. She described the partial-birth \nabortion she witnessed on a child that was 26\\1/2\\ weeks. This is what \nshe said:\n\n\n[[Page S12930]]\n\n\n       The young woman was 18, unmarried, and a little over six \n     months pregnant. She cried the entire three days she was at \n     the abortion clinic. The doctor told us, ``I'm afraid she's \n     going to want to see the baby. Try to discourage her from it; \n     we don't like them to see the babies.''\n\n  The nurse continues:\n\n       Dr. Haskell went in with forceps and grabbed the baby's \n     legs and pulled them down into the birth canal.\n       Then he delivered the baby's body and arms--everything but \n     the head. The doctor kept the head right inside the uterus. \n     The baby's little fingers were clasping and unclasping and \n     his little feet were kicking.\n       The baby was hanging there, and the doctor was holding his \n     neck to keep his head from slipping out. The doctor took a \n     pair of scissors and inserted them into the back of the \n     baby's head, and the baby's arms jerked out in a flinch, a \n     startle reaction, like a baby does when he thinks he might \n     fall. The doctor opened up the scissors, stuck a high-powered \n     suction tube in the opening and sucked the baby's brains out.\n\n  The nurse continues:\n\n       Now the baby went completely limp. We cut the umbilical \n     cord and delivered the placenta. He threw the baby in a pan \n     along with the placenta and the instruments he had just used. \n     I saw the baby move in the pan.\n       I asked another nurse and she said it was just reflexes. \n     The baby boy had the most perfect angelic face I think I have \n     ever seen in my life. When the mother started coming around, \n     she was crying--``I want to see my baby.''\n\n  ``I want to see my baby.''\n\n       So we cleaned him up and put him into a blanket. We put her \n     in a private room and handed her the baby. She held that baby \n     in her arms and when she looked into his face, she started \n     screaming--``Oh my God, what have I done? This is my baby.''\n  Soon we will rest more easily knowing we are very near the end, very \nnear the day when we do not have to retell Nurse Shafer's story--the \nday when my colleagues, such as Senators Santorum and Brownback and \nGraham and Majority Leader Frist and the rest of us who have fought \nthis battle, will not have to come to the Senate floor and talk about \npartial-birth abortion. Nobody wants to talk about this act. Nobody \nwants to tell the story, to tell Nurse Shafer's story.\n  Now is finally the time we will ban this horrible, horrible \nprocedure. I look forward to this forthcoming vote in just a few hours \nand our subsequent delivery of this bill to the President for his \nprompt signature.\n  This is the right thing to do. The facts are there. The facts are \nthat this procedure is not medically indicated; it is not medically \nnecessary. We should be judged, I believe, not just by what we do in \nsociety; I think we also should be judged by what we put up with, by \nwhat we tolerate.\n  I say to my colleagues, no civilized society should tolerate this \ntype of action. We should say today, by our vote, we simply will not \ntolerate this, that this is wrong. We cannot allow this to continue in \nthis great country of ours.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, could you tell us how much time remains on \nSenator Santorum's side and how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 38 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from California has 58\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Would the Presiding Officer be so kind as to tell me when \nI have used 20 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, you have heard a tragic story here of a woman who had \nan abortion who really did not want to have one. I have to tell you, \nthat is why I am so proud to be a pro-choice Senator, a pro-choice \nAmerican, a pro-choice Californian, fighting for that woman's right to \nnever, ever, ever have to have an abortion if she decided she did not \nwant one.\n  At the same time, I want the other side to understand that Roe v. \nWade is the law of the land and that at the early stages of a pregnancy \nGovernment should stay out of a personal, private, moral, and religious \ndecision. That is exactly what being pro-choice means. It means the \nwoman described by my friend must never be forced to have an abortion, \never, no matter what goes wrong with the pregnancy--no matter what--if \nshe insists on going through with it and wanting to have that child. \nRegardless of the risk to her health, she has the right to do it. That \nis what being pro-choice is about. Being anti-choice means that \nGovernment will dictate that situation.\n  What we have here today and why our side has decided we wanted to \nhave another debate on this is because, just as the other side has \nsaid, the anti-choice side has said this is a historic day, we agree. \nThis is, indeed, a historic day because, for the first time in history, \nCongress will be banning a medical procedure that is considered \nmedically necessary by physicians, physicians who know. And we will put \nthose statements in the Record once again.\n  My colleague, Senator DeWine, very eloquently said this debate is \nabout what kind of a country we are. That is true. What kind of a \ncountry would say to half of its population, ``We don't trust you; We \nthink you would choose murder''? What kind of a country would say to \nits doctors, who take the Hippocratic oath, ``Do no harm. We don't \ntrust you. You are going to jail''? In this bill, they will go to jail \nif they use this technique and it was not to save the life of a mother.\n  Imagine the circumstance where a doctor is making this decision: I \nthink my patient might die if I don't use this. My God, I have to read \nthe law. Oh, my God, she might live. How could I be sure? I am not \npositive. I think she might die.\n  That woman lying in front of that doctor is in great danger. That is \nwhy so many medical organizations and OB/GYNs are saying: Please, \nSenators, stop playing doctor. When we were kids, we had a doctor's \nset. We put on the white coat. If we want to do that, we should go get \nour medical degree. But don't stand here and talk about the fact that \nwe can just make this a better country by outlawing medical procedures \nwithout an exception for the health of the woman. What kind of country \ndoes that? What kind of country says to half of its population: Yes, \nyou are important, but if you are lying on the table and you could wind \nup being paralyzed or getting a stroke, you are just not that \nimportant. What kind of country says that to women? That is why I am \nhere today. This bill is going to pass overwhelmingly. We know the \ndrill. This President is going to sign it. There is going to be a big \nsigning ceremony. There is going to be an immediate court suit. The \nbill will be stayed. The debate will occur across the street in the \nSupreme Court. This bill is the same bill essentially that was declared \nunconstitutional before because the judges understand--maybe better \nthan my colleagues over here understand--the life and the health of a \nwoman is very important, and it must be protected in accordance with \nthe law.\n  We have been told by physicians--we have the statements in the \nRecord--that by banning this procedure, a woman might get a hemorrhage. \nShe might rupture her uterus. She could get very serious blood clots. \nShe could get a stroke, an embolism. She could have damage to nearby \norgans. She could be paralyzed for life. Do you want to vote that way? \nYou have a chance. If you don't make a health exception, then you are \nessentially saying women are just not that important.\n  If you love your mother, don't vote for this bill. If you love your \ndaughter, don't vote for this bill. Because if she finds herself in \nthis horrific circumstance of a pregnancy gone desperately wrong, where \nthe doctor informs her, perhaps, that the baby's brain is outside of \nthe skull, that there would be excruciating pain if the baby is born, \nthat she could lose her fertility, that she could perhaps suffer a \nstroke, she won't be able to do anything about it. Is that what we want \nto do here in the Senate?\n  In many ways this is an exercise in politics, because we believe very \nstrongly this bill will be overturned when it gets across the street. \nIt is not an exercise I take lightly when colleagues think so little of \nthe women of this country, of the mothers of this country, of the \ndaughters of this country that they would pass a bill with no health \nexception.\n  I don't think that is what Americans want. When they really \nunderstand this, they turn against it. If you hear it without the full \nexplanation, of course we say: Let's not do this procedure. But if you \nsay, but it may be necessary to save the life or health of a woman, \npeople say: OK, then at least allow it in those circumstances.\n\n[[Page S12931]]\n\n  There isn't a Democrat on this side of the aisle who wouldn't have \nvoted for a health exception along with a life exception, and this \nprocedure would be banned. As a matter of fact, we have proposed--and I \nhave written legislation--banning all late-term abortions except for a \nhealth exception and a life exception.\n  We all come here and say we know what Americans want. It is \ninteresting because, of course, we are trying to determine that. \nSenator Sessions had a poll that said women in this country no longer \nwant the right to choose. That is what he said. I have a poll that \nshows everyone in this country believes Roe is a fair balance and \nshould continue. But let me tell you what I think Americans want. Let \nme tell you what I know Californians want. I don't speak for every \nCalifornian. I couldn't. There are 35 million of us. But the vast \nmajority of us--and we have had amazing polls on this point--want \nAmerican women protected. They want children protected. They want \nprivacy protected. They want women respected. They trust women more \nthan they trust Senators. They want us to do the right thing, and they \nknow what the right thing is.\n\n  They understand Roe v. Wade took a very difficult decision and \nexplained it in a way that is a balance between all the rights \ninvolved.\n  Here is what Roe v. Wade essentially says: In the first 3 months \nafter pregnancy, a woman has the right to choose and the Government \ncannot get involved. After that, the Government can get involved. As a \nmatter of fact, after viability, the Government could ban all abortion, \nwhich I support, except for the life or health of a woman. I happen to \nbelieve that was a Solomon-like decision. It balanced all the concerns. \nBut the most important thing it did is it respected women for the first \ntime.\n  This was a struggle. Women died. The Senator from Pennsylvania says \nit was only 85 women a year who died before Roe. We have evidence and \nwe have articles to put in the Record today that will show you we \nbelieve the 5,000-a-year figure is more on the mark, because the 85 is \nonly a report to the CDC from States where abortion was legal and in \nmany States abortion was illegal in those years. Thousands of women \ndied.\n  As I said before, let's face it, that is what the underlying tension \nis in the debate, because this particular procedure is done very \nrarely. What is really at stake here is Roe v. Wade.\n  How do I know that? I know it because of the language used on the \nother side over and over again: Killing children, killing children, \nkilling children. My God, as someone who wrote the Violence Against \nChildren Act, I have to hear people talk about the fact that women are \nout there every day killing children, that doctors are out there \nkilling children.\n  Roe v. Wade is not about killing children. Roe v. Wade is about \nrespecting women to say this is a moral issue. This is a religious \nissue. This is a family issue. This is a privacy issue. Government \nshould stay out in the early stages. In the later stages, government \ncan in fact legislate.\n  If you take the rhetoric used in the Chamber today and you \nextrapolated it in a logical fashion, it means the other side thinks \nall abortion is murder from the minute of conception. If there is a \nmurder committed, there is a murderer, and you have to say that is the \nwoman because, if you listen to their rhetoric, that is what it is \nabout. The doctor is an accomplice in this act. Frankly, I would have \nmore, shall we say, legislative respect for my colleagues--I have \npersonal respect for them, but I would have more legislative respect \nfor them--if they just came out and said, call it what it is: Abortion \nis murder. That is why we threw out the Harkin amendment that was in \nthis bill supporting Roe. We think abortion is murder. We want women in \njail. We want doctors in jail. Maybe they even want the death penalty \nfor a woman. I don't know. I haven't probed them on it.\n  That is really what this debate is about. It is why it is important \nto take the debate to the American people. The beauty of being pro-\nchoice is you totally respect the woman regardless of her view.\n  If she is 18 years old, or 17, or 19, and she wants to have that \nchild, a pro-choice American says: What can we do to help you make it \neasier? But if she doesn't and it is something she wants to deal with \nvery early in the pregnancy, then just the same way, we say it is your \nchoice; we respect that choice.\n  This debate is a very important one, a very historic debate. It is \ntrue that this bill has passed several times. We expect it to pass \ntoday. But this is the first President who will ever sign a bill \noutlawing a medically necessary procedure.\n  Now, I am going to prove it is a medically necessary procedure \nbecause I am going to put in the Record a series of letters. First is \nthe ACOG statement, the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists. We can play doctor all we want here. These are the folks \nwho are out there birthing our children, out there telling us month \nafter month, as we go back for our checkup when we are pregnant, how \nimportant it is to have good nutrition, not to smoke, not to have \nalcohol, how to protect that fetus and have a healthy baby. These are \nthe people who want healthy babies born. What do they say? They say:\n\n       The intervention of legislative bodies into medical \n     decisionmaking is inappropriate, ill-advised, and dangerous.\n\n  I will repeat that. The obstetricians and gynecologists from all over \nthis country told us that:\n\n       The intervention of legislative bodies into medical \n     decisionmaking is inappropriate, ill-advised, and--\n\n  The last word is powerful--\n\n     dangerous.\n\n  This bill, if it is upheld by the Court--which I don't believe it \nwill be--is putting women's lives in danger. Don't ask me; ask the \ndoctors. The testimony of Anne Davis is clear. She is a physician. She \nis very eloquent on the point. She even says that the life exception in \nthe bill is very narrow, which is something I agree with, but I hope \nthe Court will look at that. She says this procedure that is about to \nbe banned by this bill may well be the safest procedure for women in \ncertain circumstances. She was very clear in her testimony.\n  I commend to my colleagues her testimony on March 25, 2003, before \nthe House Subcommittee on the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, the American Public Health Association writes:\n\n       We are opposed to [this bill] because we believe this and \n     other legislative and judicial restrictions to safe, \n     medically accepted abortion procedures severely jeopardize \n     women's health and well-being.\n\n  You are going to hear my colleagues on the other side say: This bill \ndoesn't hurt women's health--not a problem, not an issue. This bill \ndoesn't conflict with Roe. Why? Because they wrote in the findings that \nthis bill has nothing to do with the health of a woman. Please. Give \nwomen just a little bit of credit here.\n  So here is the American Public Health Association clearly telling us \nwhy they believe this is a jeopardy to women's health and their well-\nbeing.\n  Then we have the American Medical Women's Association in a letter \nthey wrote to us. They strongly oppose this ban, and this is what they \nsay, because I think it is a very important thing they say here:\n\n       While the Association has high respect for each member and \n     their right to hold whatever moral, religious and \n     philosophical beliefs his or her conscience dictates, as an \n     organization of 10,000 women physicians and medical students \n     dedicated to promoting women's health and advancing women in \n     medicine, we believe [this bill] is unconscionable.\n\n  Doctors are telling us this bill is ``dangerous.'' These doctors are \ntelling us that this bill puts women's health ``in jeopardy.'' Doctors \nare telling us loudly and clearly that this bill is ``unconscionable.'' \nBut it is going to be passed and it will get the signature of the \nPresident and, if not overturned, it is going to hurt the women of our \ncountry.\n  They go on to say:\n\n       Legislative bans for procedures that use recognized [OB/\n     GYN] techniques fail to protect the health and safety of \n     women and their children, nor will it improve the lives of \n     women and families.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S12932]]\n\n\n                                          American Medical Women's\n\n\n                                            Association, Inc.,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, March 25, 2003.\n     Hon. Jerrold Nadler,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Nadler: The American Medical Women's \n     Association (AMWA) strongly opposes HR 760, the ``Partial-\n     Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003.'' While the Association has \n     high respect for each member and their right to hold whatever \n     moral, religious and philosophical beliefs his or her \n     conscience dictates, as an organization of 10,000 women \n     physicians and medical students dedicated to promoting \n     women's health and advancing women in medicine, we believe HR \n     760 is unconscionable.\n       AMWA has long been an advocate for women's access to \n     reproductive health care. As such, we recognize this \n     legislation as an attempt to ban a procedure that in some \n     circumstances is the safest and most appropriate alternative \n     available to save the life and health of the woman. \n     Furthermore, this bill violates the privilege of a patient in \n     consultation with her physician to make the most appropriate \n     decision regarding her specific health circumstances.\n       AMWA opposes legislation such as HR 760 as inappropriate \n     intervention in the decision-making relationship between \n     physician and patient. The definition of the bill is too \n     imprecise and it includes non-medical terminology for a \n     procedure that may ultimately undermine the legality of other \n     techniques in obstetrics and gynecology used in both abortion \n     and non-abortion situations. At times, the use of these \n     techniques is essential to the lives and health of women. The \n     potential of this ban to criminalize certain obstetrics and \n     gynecology techniques ultimately interferes with the quality \n     of health and lives of women. Furthermore, the current ban \n     fails to meet the provisions set forth by the Supreme Court \n     in Stenberg v. Carhart, a ruling that overturned a Nebraska \n     statute banning abortion because it contained no life and \n     health exception for the mother.\n       AMWA's position on this bill corresponds to the position \n     statement of the organization on abortion and reproductive \n     health services to women and their families.\n       AMWA believes that the prevention of unintended pregnancies \n     through access to contraception and education is the best \n     option available for reducing the abortion rate in the United \n     States. Legislative bans for procedures that use recognized \n     obstetrics and gynecological techniques fails to protect the \n     health and safety of women and their children, nor will it \n     improve the lives of women and their families. If you have \n     any questions please contact Meghan Kissell, at 703-838-0500.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Lynn Epstein, MD,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Then you have the Physicians for Reproductive Choice and \nHealth. They make a very good point--a point we have made over and over \nagain: There is no mention of the term ``partial-birth abortion'' in \nany medical literature. Physicians are never taught a technique called \n``partial-birth abortion'' and cannot even define it, which is one of \nthe things the Court said was too vague a definition. So why do you \nthink my colleagues are banning something called partial-birth abortion \nwhen there is no such thing, according to physicians, as partial-birth \nabortion? I will give you 10 seconds to think it over.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 20 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent for 10 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I gave you 10 seconds to think about why we are banning \nsomething called partial-birth abortion when there is no such medical \nprocedure. The answer is, it is a highly charged bunch of words. There \nis no such thing as partial-birth abortion in the medical literature; \nyou either have a birth or an abortion. But it charges people up. It \ngives you a picture that is not accurate.\n  This is what the Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health tell \nus:\n\n       Physicians need to have all medical options available in \n     order to provide the best medical care possible. It is \n     unethical and dangerous--\n\n  There is the word again ``dangerous''--\n\n     for legislators to dictate the details of specific surgical \n     procedures. Banning procedures puts women's health at risk.\n\n  ``Risk,'' ``danger,'' ``jeopardy,'' and ``unconscionable'' are the \nwords that go along with this bill. They are not my words. They are \nwords of physicians who have lived their life to help women have \nbabies. That is what they are about.\n\n       Politicians should not legislate decisionmaking by doctors.\n\n  They call it medical decisionmaking.\n\n       To do so would violate the sanctity and legality of the \n     physician-patient relationship. To falsify scientific \n     evidence in an attempt to deny women their right is \n     unconscionable.\n\n  There it is. ``Unconscionable,'' ``dangerous,'' ``jeopardy,'' and \n``at risk'' are the words we are being told. But we are going to vote \nfor this bill because it is about politics. It is easy to say I cannot \nbuy this procedure. We could have banned it completely. We could have \nbanned all late-term abortion completely with a life exception, health \nexception. But, oh, no, I think the other side would rather have an \nissue than make progress. That is not just me talking, that is very \nanti-choice people who have said this is going to be overturned across \nthe street in 5 minutes.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print this letter from Physicians for \nReproductive Choice and Health in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Physicians for Reproductive\n\n\n                                            Choice and Health,\n\n                                                     New York, NY.\n     Hon. Jerrold Nadler,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Nadler: We are writing to urge you to \n     stand in defense of women's reproductive health and vote \n     against H.R. 760, legislation regarding so-called ``partial \n     birth'' abortion.\n       We are practicing family physicians; obstetrician-\n     gynecologists; academics in obstetrics, gynecology and \n     women's health; and a variety of other specialties in \n     medicine. We believe it is imperative that those who perform \n     terminations and manage the pre- and post-operative care of \n     women receiving abortions are given a voice in a debate that \n     has largely ignored the two groups whose lives would be most \n     affected by this legislation: physicians and patients.\n       It is misguided and unprincipled for lawmakers to legislate \n     decision-making in medicine. We all want safe and effective \n     medical procedures for women; on that there is no dispute. \n     However, the business of medicine is not always palatable to \n     those who do not practice it on a regular basis. The \n     description of a number of procedures--from liposuction to \n     cardiac surgery--may seem distasteful to some, and even \n     repugnant to others. When physicians analyze and refine \n     surgical techniques, it is always for the best interest of \n     the patient. The risk of death associated with childbirth is \n     about 11 times as high as that associated with abortion. \n     Abortion is proven to be one of the safest procedures in \n     medicine, significantly safer than childbirth, and in fact \n     saves women's lives.\n       While we can argue as to why this legislation is dangerous, \n     deceptive and unconstitutional--and it is--the fact of the \n     matter is that the text of the bill is so vague and \n     misleading that there is a great need to correct the \n     misconceptions around abortion safety and technique. It is \n     wrong to assume that a specific procedure is never needed; \n     what is required is the safest option for the patient, and \n     that varies from case to case.\n\n\n                               the facts\n\n       (1) So-called ``partial birth'' abortion does not exist.\n       There is no mention of the term ``partial birth'' abortion \n     in any medical literature. Physicians are never taught a \n     technique called ``partial birth'' abortion and therefore are \n     unable to medically define the procedure.\n       What is described in the legislation, however, could ban \n     all abortions. ``What this bill describes, albeit in non-\n     medical terms, can be interpreted as any abortion,'' stated \n     one of our physician members. ``Medicine is an art as much as \n     it is a science; although there is a standard of care, each \n     procedure--and indeed each woman--is different. The wording \n     here could apply to nay abortion patient.'' The bill's \n     language is too vague to be useful; in fact, it is so vague \n     as to be harmful. It is intentionally unclear and deceptive.\n       (2) Physicians need to have all medical options available \n     in order to provide the best medical care possible.\n       Tying the hands of physicians endangers the health of \n     patients. It is unethical and dangerous for legislators to \n     dictate the details of specific surgical procedures. Until a \n     surgeon examines the patient, she does not necessarily know \n     which technique or procedure would be in the patient's best \n     interest. Banning procedures puts women's health at risk.\n       (3) Politicians should not legislate medical decision-\n     making.\n       To do so would violate the sanctity and legality of the \n     physician-patient relationship. The right to have an abortion \n     is constitutionally protected. To falsify scientific evidence \n     in an attempt to deny women that right is unconscionable and \n     dangerous.\n       The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, \n     representing 45,000 ob-gyns, agrees: ``The intervention of \n     legislation bodies into medical decision making is \n     inappropriate, ill advised, and dangerous.''\n       The American Medical Women's Association, representing \n     10,000 female physicians, is opposed to an abortion ban \n     because it ``represents a serious impingement on the rights \n     of physicians to determine appropriate medical management for \n     individual patients.''\n\n\n                              the science\n\n       We know that there is no such technique as ``partial \n     birth'' abortion, and we believe this\n\n[[Page S12933]]\n\n     legislation is a thinly-veiled attempt to outlaw all \n     abortions. Those supporting this legislation seem to want to \n     confuse both legislators and the public about which abortion \n     procedures are actually used. Since the greatest confusion \n     seems to center around techniques that are used after the \n     first trimester, we will address those: dilation and \n     evacuation (D), dilation and extraction (D), \n     instillation, hysterectomy and hysterotomy (commonly known as \n     a c-section).\n       Dilation and evacuation (D) is the standard approach for \n     second-trimester abortions. The D is similar to first-\n     trimester vacuum aspiration exception that the cervix must be \n     further dilated because surgical instruments are used. \n     Morbidity and mortality studies indicate D is preferable to \n     labor induction methods (instillation), hysterotomy and \n     hysterectomy because of issues regarding complications and \n     safety.\n       From the years 1972-76, labor induction procedures carried \n     a maternal mortality rate of 16.5 (note: all numbers listed \n     are out of 100,000); the corresponding rate for D was 10.4. \n     From 1977-82, labor induction fell to 6.8, but D dropped to \n     3.3. From 1983-87, induction methods had a 3.5 mortality \n     rate, while D fell to 2.9. Although the difference between \n     the methods shrank by the mid-1980s, the use of D had \n     already quickly outpaced induction.\n       Morbidity trends indicate that dilation and evacuation is \n     much safer than labor induction procedures and for women with \n     certain medical conditions, labor induction can pose serious \n     risks. Rates of major complications from labor induction, \n     including bleeding, infections, and unnecessary surgery, were \n     at least twice as high as those from D There are instances \n     of women who, after having failed inductions, acquired \n     infections necessitating emergency D as a last resort. \n     Hysterotomy and hysterectomy, moreover, carry a mortality \n     rate seven times that of induction techniques and ten times \n     that of D\n       There is a psychological component which makes D \n     preferable to labor induction, undergoing difficult, \n     expensive and painful labor for up to two days can be \n     extremely emotionally and psychologically difficult, much \n     more so than a surgical procedure that can be done in less \n     than an hour under general or local anesthesia. Furthermore, \n     labor induction does not always work: Between 15 and 30 \n     percent or more of cases require surgery to complete the \n     procedure. There is no question that D is the safest method \n     of second-trimester abortion.\n       There is also a technique known as dilation and extraction \n     (D). There is a limited medical literature on D because \n     it is an uncommonly used variant of D However, it is \n     sometimes a physician's preferred method of termination for a \n     number of reasons: It offers a woman the chance to see the \n     intact outcome of a desired pregnancy, to speed up the \n     grieving process; it provides a greater chance of acquiring \n     valuable information regarding hereditary illness or fetal \n     anomaly; and D provides a decreased risk of injury to the \n     woman, as the procedure is quicker than induction and \n     involves less use of sharp instruments in the uterus, \n     providing a decreased chance of uterine perforations or tears \n     and cervical lacerations. The American College of \n     Obstetricians and Gynecologists addressed this in their \n     statement in opposition to so-called ``partial birth'' \n     abortion when they said that D ``may be the best or most \n     appropriate procedure in a particular circumstances to save \n     the life or preserve the health of a woman, and only the \n     doctor, in consultation with the patient, based on the \n     woman's particular circumstances, can make this decision.''\n       It is important to note that these procedures are used at \n     varying gestational ages. Both D and D are options for \n     surgical abortion prior to viability. D and D are used \n     solely based on the size of the fetus, the health of the \n     woman, and the physician's judgment, and the decision \n     regarding which procedure to use is done on a case-by-case \n     basis.\n\n\n                            the legislation\n\n       Because this legislation is so vague, it would outlaw D \n     and D (and arguably techniques used in the first \n     trimester). Indeed, the Congressional findings--which go into \n     detail, albeit in non-medical terms--do not remotely \n     correlate with the language of the bill. This legislation is \n     reckless. The outcome of its passage would undoubtedly be \n     countless deaths and irreversible damage to thousands of \n     women and families. We can safely assert that without D and \n     D, that is, an enactment of H.R. 760, we will be returning \n     to the days when an unwanted pregnancy led women to death \n     through illegal and unsafe procedures, self-inflicted \n     abortions, uncontrollable infections and suicide.\n       The cadre of physicians who provide abortions should be \n     honored, not vilified. They are heroes to millions of women, \n     offering the opportunity of choice and freedom. We urge you \n     to consider scientific data rather than partisan rhetoric \n     when voting on such far-reaching public health legislation. \n     We strongly oppose legislation intended to ban so-called \n     ``partial birth'' abortion.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Member Physicians.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am going to read you the story of Viki \nWilson. Viki is a pediatric nurse. She lives in California. Her husband \nBill is an emergency room physician. The Wilsons were expecting their \nthird child when they received a devastating diagnosis at 36 weeks of \npregnancy.\n  I hope every colleague will listen to this story and, for a moment, \nthink about this couple and what they faced.\n  Viki was married to an emergency room physician. They were told after \n36 weeks of pregnancy, of looking forward to this baby, that a large \nportion of the brain was formed outside the skull and most of the \nbaby's tissue was abnormal. They were told by several physicians, \nincluding geneticists and perinatologists that their daughter they \nnamed Abigail could never survive outside her mother's womb, and that \nthe so-called healthy baby kicks that Viki had thought for sure she was \nfeeling were, in fact, seizures caused by the pressure as the baby's \nhead had lodged in her pelvis.\n  Think about how you would feel if you were that father, if you were \nthat mother, if you were that grandma, if you were that grandpa, if you \nwere the mother of Viki or the mother-in-law or the father or the \nfather-in-law or you were the brother of Viki or you were the brother-\nin-law or you were the sister or you were the aunt. They learned this \npregnancy was doomed. They learned the baby they wanted so much could \nnever live outside the womb. They learned the risks of this continued \npregnancy to Viki, the very severe risks she faced.\n  They decided this procedure that is being banned today was the safest \nand best procedure for Viki. They talked about it; they prayed on it; \nthey discussed it with their family; they discussed it among themselves \nwith their physicians. They brought in every specialist one can think \nabout, and they decided this was the best thing for Viki's family and \nfor her children and for her children she hoped to have in the future.\n  The Wilsons held a funeral for Abigail, and a playground at their \nchildren's Catholic school is named in her honor. And then, very soon \nafter, the Wilson family welcomed a baby son, actually through \nadoption. Is this the kind of person you want to harm? Is this the kind \nof woman you want to put at risk? Is this the kind of couple to which \nyou are saying: Sorry, even if your doctors say Viki might have a \nstroke, Viki might be paralyzed, no can do; we can't help you because \nSenators playing doctor decided this procedure should no longer be a \nchoice, an option for a woman in a severe and tragic circumstance.\n  I have to tell you, I have looked inside my heart up and down. I do \nnot understand how we move forward as a society, how we move forward as \na compassionate country when we do something that can conceivably hurt \nthousands and thousands of women and thousands and thousands of \nfamilies. We could have passed this bill in a nanosecond. Just make a \nhealth exception. It would have met the objections of the Court with \nthe health exception and a little bit less vagueness on the procedure, \nand we would have done something that would have been important. But, \noh, no, I guess in the end the women of this country just don't matter \nthat much.\n  I think this record is very clear. The physicians who know what they \nare talking about, who deal with these pregnancies every day don't want \nus to do this. The women, many of them very religious, who have been \nfaced with this crisis tell us: Please, please make a health exception \nbecause if we didn't have this procedure, A, we might have died; B, we \nmight have been paralyzed; C, we might have been made infertile; D, we \nmight have had a stroke or embolism or damaged our nearby organs.\n\n  Why are we doing this? There is no such procedure called ``partial-\nbirth abortion.'' It is in every letter from the physicians. There is \nno such procedure. It is a made-up term to make this debate what it \nreally is not about. It is a very sad day for us that we are banning a \nprocedure that I have proven, by putting into the Record letter after \nletter from physicians, is necessary sometimes to save the life and \nhealth of a woman. We are banning this with no health exception. This \nis not the right thing to do.\n  This bill was stripped of the supportive language of Roe v. Wade that \nthis Senate passed twice--not once but twice--saying that Roe v. Wade \nshould remain the law of the land. Oh, no,\n\n[[Page S12934]]\n\nthey were so radical in that conference committee, they kicked out that \nvery simple statement where most Americans agree that Roe v. Wade, \nmaking this decision in the early stages of a pregnancy in private--\nGovernment stay out of it; Senator Boxer, I might think you are really \na good gal, but stay out of my private life. They are right. I don't \ndeserve to be in it.\n  Senator Harkin has just come to the Chamber. He is the one who had \nthat amendment which was adopted by this Senate twice, and how proud I \nwas to stand with him. I wonder if it is OK with my colleagues, since \nSenator Harkin has arrived, if I give him 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, can Senator Harkin take about 10 minutes? Does the \nSenator want more time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, if I can have a couple minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Fifteen minutes, 20? I yield up to 20 minutes to the \nSenator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for up to \n20 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his inquiry.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, are we under time constraints on this \nmeasure?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, we are.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Chair please state for the Senator what the \nsituation is right now in terms of this conference report?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 27\\1/2\\ \nminutes. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 37, almost 38 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to talk about this \npending measure. First and foremost, I applaud the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Boxer, for her unwavering leadership and commitment in \nprotecting a woman's right to privacy and to choose. No one has fought \nharder and longer, both in the House and in the Senate and in all of \ntheir public life, to protect a woman's right to choose than Senator \nBoxer of California.\n  Senator Boxer has my highest esteem for all the work she has done to \nmake sure that the women of this country are not controlled by \nideology, by one religious belief, or by the actions of a male-\ndominated Senate and House of Representatives and, I might add, now a \nmale-dominated Supreme Court.\n  We are going to vote this afternoon on this so-called late-term \nabortion bill. I have serious questions about whether it will pass \nconstitutional muster. I don't believe it will. So what we are doing is \nreally a political exercise. This is what I call something to go out \nand get the vote for, by exciting passions, arousing fears, and by \ntrying to state in overblown terms what this is all about.\n  The bottom line and what it really comes down to is whether or not \nthe health of the mother is a constitutionally protected right of women \nin this country.\n  In 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court said similar State legislation was \nnot constitutional because it lacked a health exception. It was not \nconstitutional because there was no protection for the health of the \nmother. So what does the Senate and the House do? Pass legislation that \nstill lacks the health exception. That is why it is unconstitutional.\n  I am also very disappointed that the conferees stripped from the bill \nmy sense-of-the-Senate resolution about a woman's right to privacy. I \nhad offered, as I had before, a simple statement that it was the sense \nof the Senate that we supported the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision \nand it should not be overturned. It passed 52 to 46. It was attached to \nthis late-term abortion bill which also passed the Senate. The Senator \nfrom California said the conference took less than 5 minutes to drop my \nresolution, without discussion.\n  Roe v. Wade is the moderate, mainstream policy American women have \ncome to rely on, and it took the conferees less than 5 minutes, without \ndiscussion, to drop it. What that says to me is very startling. \nCongress has turned its back on America's women--their right to \nprivacy, their right to choose. America's women are now second-class \ncitizens.\n  Let me again give a brief review of what I am talking about. On \nJanuary 22, 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court announced its decision in Roe \nv. Wade, a challenge to a Texas statute that made it a crime to perform \nan abortion unless a woman's life was at stake. That was the Texas law. \nThe case had been filed by Jane Roe, an unmarried woman who wanted to \nsafely and legally end her pregnancy. Siding with Roe, the Court struck \ndown the Texas law. In its ruling, the Court recognized for the first \ntime the constitutional right to privacy ``is broad enough to encompass \na woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.''\n  It also set some rules. The Court recognized the right to privacy is \nnot absolute and that a State has a valid interest in safeguarding \nmaternal health, maintaining medical standards, and protecting \npotential life. A State's interest in ``potential life'' is not \ncompelling, the Court said, until viability, the point in pregnancy at \nwhich there is a reasonable possibility for the sustained survival of \nthe fetus outside of the womb.\n  A State may but is not required to prohibit abortion after viability, \nexcept when it is necessary to protect a woman's life or health.\n  That is what my resolution was all about, to say we agree that Roe v. \nWade was an appropriate decision and should not be overturned.\n  Before the 1973 landmark ruling of Roe v. Wade, it is estimated that \neach year 1.2 million women resorted to illegal abortions, despite the \nknown hazards of frightening trips to dangerous locations in strange \nparts of town, of whiskey as an anesthetic, of ``doctors'' who were \noften marginal or unlicensed practitioners, sometimes alcoholic, \nsometimes sexually abusive, unsanitary conditions, incompetent \ntreatment, infection, hemorrhages, disfiguration, and death. By \ninvalidating laws that forced women to resort to back-alley abortions, \nRoe was directly responsible for saving women's lives.\n  It is estimated as many as 5,000 women died yearly from illegal \nabortions before Roe. Only 10 pieces of legislation were introduced in \neither the House or the Senate before the Roe decision, but in the 30 \nyears since the ruling more than 1,000 separate legislative proposals \nhave been introduced. The majority of these bills have sought to \nrestrict a woman's right to choose.\n  Unfortunately, what is often lost in the rhetoric and in some of \nthose proposals is the real significance of the Roe decision. The Roe \ndecision recognized the right of women to make their own decisions \nabout their own reproductive health.\n  The decision whether to bear a child is profoundly private and life \naltering. As the Roe Court understood, without the right to make \nautonomous decisions about pregnancy, a woman could not participate \nfreely and equally in society. Roe not only established a woman's \nreproductive freedom, it was also central to women's continued progress \ntoward full and equal participation in American life.\n\n  In the 30 years since Roe, the variety and level of women's \nachievements have reached a higher level. As the Supreme Court observed \nin 1992:\n\n       The ability of women to participate equally in the economic \n     and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their \n     ability to control their reproductive lives.\n\n  As I have often said, the freedom to choose on the part of women is \nno more negotiable than the freedom to speak or the freedom to worship \nin our Constitution.\n  I do not believe any abortion is desirable. I do not think anybody \ndoes. I have struggled with this issue all my adult life as a father. \nHowever, I do not believe it is appropriate to insist my personal views \nbe the law of the land and that I impose those on anyone else. So I \nurge my colleagues to vote against the final bill, first because it is \nunconstitutional, but also because by dropping the resolution we \nadopted saying Roe v. Wade should continue to be the law of the land, \nit sends the wrong message to American women. What it says is they are \nnot equal to men. They cannot make decisions for themselves. We men \nwill make those decisions for them. They do not have the same \nprotections under the Constitution in this bill. Somehow they are \nsecond-class citizens.\n\n[[Page S12935]]\n\n  I say to the women of this country, as I have said before on the \nfloor, they must be concerned about this.\n  We passed the resolution on Roe v. Wade 52 to 46. Well, that was a \nwin, I guess one might say, for upholding the belief that Roe v. Wade \ncontinue to be the law of the land, but 46 Senators basically voted to \nsay Roe v. Wade ought to be overturned, that it should not be the law \nof the land, that we need to go back in time to prohibit all abortions, \nregardless.\n  I say to those who may think this is just one particular procedure \nthat we are somehow prohibiting here--and again I want to point out, as \nthe Senator from California so eloquently pointed out time after time, \nthis is the first time in the history of this Senate that Senators have \ndecided against a medical procedure, the only time we have somehow put \non the cloak of knowing better than doctors, professionals, and women \nthat somehow we politicians know better.\n  Aside from that, if my colleagues think this is all this is about, \nthey are sadly mistaken. That is not what this is about. I say to the \nwomen of America, this is step one. I say especially to young women, \nwho sort of take it for granted--I mean, Roe v. Wade was 30 years ago, \nancient history in the United States of America--especially young women \nwho believe, as they have grown up, having this freedom to choose, \nhaving the right to control their own reproductive health, if they \nthink this is something that inures to them because they were born in \nAmerica, they have another think coming. There are people who do not \nwant them to have that right. There are people in this Senate who want \nto turn the clock back and say women have no right to make any decision \non their reproductive health. But, then again, isn't that what we had \nin Texas before Roe v. Wade? That is what this country was like before \nthat.\n\n  The Supreme Court said no, there is something else that has to do \nwith the health of a woman, too, and a woman's right to control her own \nbody and a woman's right to privacy.\n  Again, I see where this is going with 46 votes in the Senate. Just \nthink, a couple of votes here or there in the next election, you can \nkiss Roe v. Wade goodbye, because that is what will happen. And with \none or two Justices on the Supreme Court who feel this way, that will \nbe the end of Roe v. Wade. That will be the end for women who think \nthey have the right to control their own reproductive health in this \ncountry--to make their own decisions. That is where this is headed.\n  I know Senators, many Senators have personal feelings about that. \nFine. There are Senators who believe very deeply that Roe v. Wade \nshould not be the law of the land, who believe it never should have \nbeen decided that way, who believe that women should not have a right \nover their reproductive health. There are people who believe that.\n  Fine, if they want to believe that for themselves, that's their \nbelief structure. But in this pluralistic society in which we live, in \nwhich we respect each other's rights but do not try to impose our own \npersonal religious or moral beliefs on others, the Supreme Court really \ndid, in fact, reach a logical and I think fair and balanced approach.\n  Yet there are those who want to strip that away--that no matter \nwhat--a woman does not have the right to make her own decisions and the \nright to privacy. And what does that mean? Well, it will mean we're \ngoing back to the back alley.\n  This, really, to me is more than just an issue about some narrow \nprocedure, I say to my friend from California. This is about whether or \nnot the women of this country are going to be treated as equals with \nmen or as second-class citizens. I ask the Senator from California, \nrhetorically, what other times has the Senate said there are certain \nmedical procedures which applied to men that cannot be conducted? What \nis next? Is there something else coming down the pike we don't know \nabout? I don't think it will affect men but it will affect women. It is \na holdover from mediaeval times, a holdover from the days in which \nwomen did not have the right to participate fully in society. That is \nwhat this is about more than anything else.\n  I thank the Senator from California for her courage, for her wisdom, \nfor her judgment, and for being so stalwart, making sure we know what \nthis battle is about. I think we see the writing on the wall here. It \nis going to pass. It is going to pass. If the Supreme Court adheres to \nits previous decisions, it will throw it out because there is no \nexception for the health of the mother. I guess then there will be a \npolitical issue to whip up emotions around the countryside.\n  I wish we could take emotions out of this and just talk about it on \nthe basis of what women want. I will close on this. I have often asked, \nthink to yourself, what would happen if we had 100 women sitting here? \nI mean a cross section of America, liberal, conservative, moderate, \ndifferent religions, different ethnic backgrounds--just a good cross \nsection of women in America. Do you really think, down deep in your \nheart, this would be passed before the Senate? No way. No way would \nthis ever pass. Or, if you had a majority of the women in the House of \nRepresentatives? Absolutely not.\n  Women do make up more than half of our society. I forget, how many \nwomen Senators do we have now?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Fourteen.\n  Mr. HARKIN. There are 14 out of 100. So women are drastically \nunderrepresented in the body. They are underrepresented on the Supreme \nCourt.\n  Women have made great strides. Fourteen is more than there were when \nI came here--there were only one or two at the time I came here. They \nare making strides.\n  What this says is we are going to turn the clock back. I don't want \nto turn the clock back and neither does the Senator from California. We \nhave to make sure women in America have their constitutional right to \nprivacy, just like men. That is what this is really about.\n  I thank the Senator. I am proud to be on her side.\n  I retain the remainder of our time. I yield the floor and retain the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield 10 minutes to the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee who has done incredible work on this legislation now for a \nfourth Congress that he has been involved in moving this forward. This \nmoment of accomplishment here would not have happened except for the \ngreat work of the Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent that following the remarks of \nthe Senator from Utah, the Senator from California be recognized under \nSenator Boxer's time for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator should be advised----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, while I have the floor, let me ask \nunanimous consent that the vote on adoption of the conference report to \naccompany S. 3, the partial-birth abortion ban bill, occur at 5 p.m. \ntoday, provided that the time between the expiration of the current \ntime allocation and 5 p.m. be equally divided between Senators Santorum \nand Boxer or their designees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today because it is difficult for me \nto understand how anybody could support this barbaric, heinous approach \ntoward abortion. The Senate passed S. 3, the partial-birth abortion ban \nof 2003, with strong bipartisan support, 64 to 33, back in March of \nthis year. The legislation passed the House in June with similarly \nstrong bipartisan support, 282 to 139. We were then forced to debate \nthe motion to go to conference in September.\n  We completed the conference in September. Now we are finally able to \nvote on passage of the conference report. Let's get on with it. This \nhas taken a long time in this Congress, but it also has taken 7 years \nto get to this point. Even though the Congress has passed similar \nlegislation before, finally we will be able to send it to President \nBush, who will sign it into law.\n  I know the people of my home State of Utah recognize the importance \nof this effort. The vast majority of people in Utah and, I believe, in \nour country, recognize that the practice of partial-birth abortion is \nimmoral, offensive,\n\n[[Page S12936]]\n\nand impossible to justify. This procedure is so heinous that even many \nwho consider themselves pro-choice cannot defend it.\n\n  Senator Santorum should be applauded for his tireless efforts to \nachieve this goal. His leadership has been essential and very much \nappreciated. I admire his efforts to protect innocent human life, \nespecially here, where it is so graphically obvious this procedure \ncannot be defended.\n  By now we have all seen Dr. B. Benoit's film of the 3-dimensional \nultrasound of the baby in utero, yawning and even smiling. This \nappeared in the Evening Standard in London. It is a picture of an \nunborn baby smiling inside the womb. It says: ``Picture Exclusive, \nProof Babies Smile in Womb.'' It is truly amazing and enlightening what \nadvancing technology has enabled us to see. This truly is an incredible \nwindow into the mother's womb, where it has to be clear to all who view \nit that this is a living human being, a living baby.\n  Yet there are those who want to protect the ability to violently \ncrush this young life. In the case of the procedure we seek to ban with \nthis legislation, it is a baby just inches away from being born. Yes, \ninches away from being born.\n  For those who may not have a clear understanding of this procedure, \nlet me describe it. This is a little graphic, I agree, but we need to \nensure that the American people understand what is going on. How anyone \ncan justify this barbaric procedure is beyond me. A baby is almost \nfully delivered with only her head remaining inside the birth canal \nwhen the doctor stabs scissors into the base of the baby's skull to \nopen a hole into which he then inserts a suction tube and sucks out the \nbrain so the skull collapses. Then they pull the baby out and say it is \nnot a living human being even though just seconds before this was a \nfull human being, a living human being with legs dangling and kicking. \nI honestly do not know how anyone can avoid being truly sickened when \nthey see a baby being killed in this gruesome manner. It is not done on \na mass of tissue but to a living baby capable of living outside the \nwomb, capable of feeling pain, and at the time this procedure is \ntypically performed, capable of living outside the womb.\n  All this legislation does is ban the one procedure. As the testimony \nin the House made clear, the fact is, there is no medical need to allow \nthis type of procedure. It is never medically necessary, it is never \nthe safest procedure available, and it is morally reprehensible and \nunconscionable.\n  As I mentioned when we debated the bill in the spring, we have all \nheard in recent years about teenage girls giving birth and dumping \ntheir newborns into the trash can. One woman was criminally charged \nafter giving birth to a child in a bathroom stall during the prom and \nstrangling and suffocating the baby before leaving the body in the \ntrash. Tragically, there have been several incidents around the country \nin the past few years. This should not surprise us. This is what \nhappens when we continue, as some would do here, to devalue human \nlife--those who would like to stop this bill by and large.\n  William Raspberry argued in a column in the Washington Post:\n\n     . . . only a short distance [exists] between what [these \n     teenagers] have been sentenced for doing and what doctors get \n     paid to do.\n\n  He got it right. When you think about it, it is incredible that there \nis a mere 3 inches separating a partial-birth abortion from murder. \nPartial-birth abortion simply has no place in our society and rightly \nshould be banned. President Bush has described partial-birth abortion \nas ``an abhorrent procedure that offends human dignity.'' With that, I \nwholeheartedly agree.\n  Basic human decency, I hope, will prevail. I pray that never again \nwill it be legal in this country to perform this barbaric procedure. \nUnfortunately, I am sure the opponents of this measure will seek to \nchallenge the law in court where I hope good judgment will ultimately \nprevail.\n  In Stenberg v. Carhart, the Supreme Court confirmed:\n\n       . . . by no means must physicians [be granted] unfettered \n     discretion in their selection of abortion methods.\n\n  The House has already passed this conference report. It is time for \nthis Congress to finish its work and send this bill to the President \nfor his signature.\n  Oddly enough, young girls out there, young women, are becoming more \nand more opposed to abortion. I believe it has been this debate, this \nbarbaric procedure that is the cause for them to think it through and \nto acknowledge that inside that womb of the mother is a living human \nbeing, a living baby, and especially one capable of living outside the \nmother's womb.\n  This is a serious debate. This is as serious a bill as we can have \nbefore the Senate. I hope our colleagues will vote overwhelmingly to \npass the conference report as we simply have to get rid of this \nbarbaric and inhumane procedure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I rise in opposition to the conference report \naccompanying S. 3 which some, I think inaccurately, call the partial-\nbirth abortion bill. In fact, this bill, originally introduced by \nSenator Santorum, is more accurately called the unconstitutional anti-\nchoice bill, given the fact that it is flagrantly unconstitutional and \nits primary result will be to chill second-trimester abortion \nprocedures.\n  I voted against this conference report in the recent House-Senate \nconference on this bill and also on the floor of the Senate last March.\n  This is the first bill since Roe v. Wade in 1973 that outlaws safe \nmedical procedures and recriminalizes abortion. It is a major step \nforward in the march to obliterate a woman's right to control her own \nreproductive system and to eviscerate the entire choice movement in \nthis country.\n  This bill is unconstitutional, I believe, for two reasons. First, it \nuses a vague definition of dilation and extraction abortion, or D \nabortion. This technique is also called intact dilation and evacuation, \nor intact D It is also sometimes called, inaccurately, partial-birth \nabortion.\n  The sponsors of the bill have refused to use a definition of D that \nI suggested and that tracks the medical definition submitted by the \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Why? Why would \nthey refuse to use a definition suggested by the elite medical group of \nobstetricians and gynecologists who deal with this issue--a definition \nthat would enable those obstetricians and gynecologists to know exactly \nwhat this legislation makes a crime?\n  I believe there is a reason. I believe that this bill deliberately \nuses a vague definition of D in order to affect other kinds of \nsecond-trimester abortions and thus impact the right to choose. Because \nits definition is so loose, the bill would ban and otherwise interfere \nwith perfectly legal, permissible abortion techniques. It will also \nhave a chilling effect on doctors, who will be afraid to perform \nabortions other than D for fear they will be subject to investigation \nand prosecution. Why? Because the bill does not use an accepted medical \ndefinition of D\n  Second, the bill lacks any health exception. This has been spoken \nabout before, and I will do it again. The Supreme Court ruled in \nStenberg v. Carhart that any ban must have a health exception. This \nbill has no health exception. Why are we bothering to pass a bill that \nis so clearly unconstitutional?\n\n  The only reason I can think of is the proponents of the bill do not \nbelieve the health of a mother is sufficient reason to interrupt a \npregnancy.\n  In fact, the supporters of the bill are not trying to remedy its \nconstitutional defects. Rather, they are just making minor alterations \nto the findings in the bill.\n  I also oppose the bill because it omits language a majority of the \nSenate added last March recognizing the importance of Roe v. Wade and \nstating that this important opinion should not be overturned.\n  Unfortunately, as has been said, this language was stripped out in \nconference over the strenuous opposition of Senator Boxer, Congressman \nNadler, Congresswoman Lofgren, and myself.\n  As an initial matter, I want to lay one myth to rest; that is the \nmyth that\n\n[[Page S12937]]\n\nmost Americans support this bill. Supporters of the bill have \nrepeatedly and erroneously argued that a majority of the country \nsupports banning D abortion.\n  For example, in introducing this bill, Senator Santorum stated on the \nfloor that ``the American people clearly believe this is a procedure \nthat should be prohibited.''\n  However, such statements are not borne out by recent polls. For \nexample, last July, ABC News released a nationwide poll which showed 61 \npercent of Americans oppose bans on so-called partial-birth abortion \nprocedures if a woman's health is threatened. The bill now before us \ncontains no health exception. That means a substantial majority of \nAmericans think this bill is wrong.\n  I also want to mention a poll taken by Greenberg, Quinlan, Rosner \nResearch, Inc. between June 5, 2003, and June 12, 2003, of 1,200 likely \nvoters. The poll found a majority of Americans--56 percent--believe \nabortion should be legal in all or most cases.\n  In addition, this poll found the country does not want the Government \ninvolved in a woman's private medical decisions. Eighty percent of \nvoters believe abortion is a decision that should be made between a \nwoman and her doctor. In fact, even a majority of those who identified \nthemselves as pro-life said a woman and her doctor should make the \ndecision.\n  In stark contrast, this bill criminalizes safe abortion procedures, \nand it puts the abortion decision in the hands of the Government and in \nthe hands of politicians, not the woman and her doctor.\n  I would now like to mention Randall Terry, the founder of Operation \nRescue, and the man who the New York Times called ``an 'icon' of the \npro-life movement.'' Mr. Terry is one of the staunchest foes of the \nright to choose in the entire Nation. He is known for harboring views \nso strong on the abortion issue that he has been jailed dozens of times \nfor blocking clinics and for having a human fetus delivered to former \nPresident Bill Clinton. He is also known for speaking his mind.\n  Let me read some quotes from Mr. Terry in a press release issued \nthrough the Christian Communication Network, dated just a month ago, \nSeptember 15, 2003. This press release is entitled: ``Randall Terry, \nFounder of Operation Rescue Says, `Partial-Birth Abortion Ban is a \nPolitical Scam but a Public Relations Goldmine.''\n  Let me repeat that: ``Partial-Birth Abortion is a Political Scam but \na Public Relations Goldmine.''\n  Mr. Terry says the bill before us is a ``Political Scam.'' \nSpecifically, he states:\n\n       This bill, if it becomes law, may not save one child's \n     life. The Federal courts are likely to strike it down. . . \n     .The bill provides political cover in an election season to \n     cowardly ``pro-life'' political leaders who have done little \n     for the pro-life cause.\n\n  That is not me. I am quoting Randall Terry, the founder of Operation \nRescue.\n  Let me repeat: ``This bill, if it becomes law, may not save one \nchild's life. The Federal courts are likely to strike it down. . . .''\n  And he is right.\n  Mr. Terry then goes on to say:\n\n       If the President and Congress want to accomplish a small, \n     but real, step they should outlaw all abortions after 20 \n     weeks--the age when a baby can live outside the womb.\n\n  Interestingly enough, his suggestion is similar to an amendment I \noffered on the floor of the Senate and in the joint House-Senate \nconference on this bill. This amendment would have banned all \npostviability abortions except and unless a doctor determines such an \nabortion is necessary to protect the life and health of the woman.\n  This is the way to go. If someone truly believes these abortions, \nwhich are not medically defined in the bill, should not take place, and \nif one believes the child is capable of life, then ban postviability \nabortions. I was prepared to see that enacted into law. But it was \nvoted down twice, on the floor and in the conference committee.\n  I would like to take a moment to explain in detail why I think this \nbill is poorly drafted and is virtually certain to be struck down by \nthe courts.\n  The conference report bill is unconstitutional for two reasons.\n  First, it attempts to ban the specific medical procedure it calls \n``partial-birth abortion,'' but it fails to use the accepted medical \ndefinition of what surgical procedure constitutes partial-birth \nabortion. The refusal of the sponsors of the bill to accept the medical \ndefinition of intact D is revealing. It makes it clear they are not \nreally intent or interested in banning intact D or D, but, rather, \nthey seek to muddy the waters to make it harder for women to get legal \nabortion using other legal and acceptable techniques. That, in my view, \nis the underlying purpose of the bill.\n  The Supreme Court ruled in Stenberg v. Carhart that any ban must have \na health exception. This bill clearly, despite many attempts by this \nsenator and others to put one in, has no health exception. The other \nside has repeatedly opposed a health exception.\n  Here is what Justice O'Connor said in her deciding opinion in \nStenberg v. Carhart:\n\n       [B]ecause even a post-viability proscription of abortion \n     would be invalid absent a health exception, Nebraska's ban on \n     pre-viability partial birth abortions, under the \n     circumstances presented here, must include a health exception \n     as well. . . .The statute at issue here, however, only \n     excepts those procedures necessary to save the life of the \n     mother whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, \n     physical illness or physical injury. This lack of a health \n     exception necessarily renders the statute unconstitutional.\n\n  Now, I must ask you, why would anybody, after this case, with the \nswing judge making that statement, draft a bill that so clearly \nviolates the Supreme Court's decision? Justice O'Connor has very \nclearly said the ``lack of a health exception necessarily renders the \nstatute unconstitutional.''\n  The fact the sponsors are ignoring the clear words of the Supreme \nCourt is suspect to me. It is even more suspect given the fact that \njust last year the U.S. Government took the position in court that any \nban on D must include a health exception. The Santorum bill, then, \nnot only contravenes the Supreme Court but also flies in the face of \nthe position taken by the U.S. Department of Justice.\n  Let me read from a brief filed by the United States in February of \n2002 in Women's Medical Professional Corporation v. Bob Taft, a case in \nthe Sixth Circuit involving an Ohio statute prohibiting late-term \nabortion including D According to this brief:\n\n       the Court [in Carhart] stressed that the Nebraska statute \n     prohibited the partial birth method of abortion except where \n     that procedure was ``necessary to save the life of the \n     mother,'' . . . in violation of the Court's prior holdings in \n     Roe v. Wade . . . and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern \n     Pennsylvania v. Casey . . . that a State must permit \n     abortions, ``necessary in appropriate medical judgment, for \n     the preservation of the life or health of the mother . . . ''\n\n  The original brief even has the words ``or health'' underlined.\n  In other words, according to a brief filed by the United States \nGovernment last year, under Carhart, Roe, and Planned Parenthood, a \nState ``must'' provide a health exception for the woman. Yet we fly \nmerrily in the face of that. It is ridiculous.\n  Supporters of the Santorum bill argue that they can ignore this \nlanguage by throwing into the bill some questionable factual findings \nthat a health exception is unnecessary. Baloney. They argue that these \nso-called findings make irrelevant the Supreme Court's constitutional \ndetermination in Carhart that a health exception is necessary.\n  The Framers of the Constitution did not intend that Congress be able \nto evade Supreme Court precedent and effectively amend the Constitution \njust by holding a hearing and generating questionable testimony from \nhandpicked witnesses. In fact, the Supreme Court has made crystal clear \nthat Congress cannot simply ignore a constitutional ruling they dislike \nby adopting a contrary legislative finding and telling the Court that \nthey have to defer to it. That is just what is being done here.\n  Let me quote Chief Justice Burger on this point:\n\n       A legislature appropriately inquires into and may declare \n     the reasons impelling legislative action but the judicial \n     function commands analysis of whether the specific conduct \n     charged falls within the reach of the statute and if so \n     whether the legislation is consonant with the Constitution.\n\n  So make no mistake about it. You can say anything you want in the \nfindings, and it isn't going to be dispositive\n\n[[Page S12938]]\n\nas to whether the statute meets the test of the Constitution of the \nUnited States.\n  I also want to quote from U.S. v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000), a \ndecision that struck down part of the Violence Against Women Act. I \npersonally disagree with this decision, but it is controlling law. In \nthat case, the Supreme Court held that ``the existence of congressional \nfindings is not sufficient, by itself, to sustain the \nconstitutionality'' of the challenged provision of the Violence Against \nWomen Act. That is on page 614.\n  So why are these findings in the bill? I believe the other side is \nwell aware of U.S. v. Morrison and other cases. Why are they doing it \nthis way then? There has to be a reason.\n  Here the sponsors of S. 3 are trying to do exactly what the Supreme \nCourt said the Congress cannot do: Use congressional findings to do \nsomething that is clearly unconstitutional. The sponsors of this bill \nare effectively trying to overturn binding Supreme Court precedent and \nrewrite the Constitution by enacting a bill that on its face violates \nStenberg v. Carhart. They have clearly overstepped their bounds.\n  Mr. President, one of the most disappointing aspects of this debate \nis that a majority of the House-Senate conference on this bill decided \nto thwart the will of the Senate and strip out language recognizing the \nimportance of Roe v. Wade. This decision clearly unmasked the sponsor's \nclear intention in introducing this bill: to strike at Roe. The \nprovision stripped out of the bill was a simple sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution. Let me read its exact language:\n  One, the decision of the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, \n1973, was appropriate and secures an important constitutional right.\n  Two, such decision should not be overturned.\n  They struck this language out. Why? Because they want Roe overturned. \nThat is the reason.\n  I am pleased that the Roe v. Wade amendment was added to the bill \nlast March on a bipartisan vote of 52 to 46. Unfortunately, the House-\npassed late-term abortion bill lacked the language. The House refused \nto agree to it.\n  While I oppose the criminalization of safe abortion techniques in S. \n3, I strongly support the Roe v. Wade language we added to that \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator has used 20 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield 4 additional minutes and retain \nthe remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from California.\n  In the past 30 years, since the Supreme Court upheld a woman's right \nto choose, a great deal has changed for women in America. But now, in \n2003, we are about to push women back to where they were in the 1950s, \na generation that I remember well, a generation of passing the plate to \nraise money for abortions in Mexico, a generation of back alley \nabortions, a generation of tremendous mortality and morbidity for \nwomen, a generation of fear. It makes no sense.\n  The fact that a majority of the House-Senate conference stripped out \nsense-of-the-Senate language that merely summarized Federal abortion \nlaw should be exhibit A for anyone who doubts that this bill is really \na frontal political attack on choice in America.\n  I am also disappointed that the conference refused to accept a \ncommonsense amendment I offered to the bill before us today. That \namendment, as I said, would have banned all postviability abortions \nexcept if determined by the doctor that such an abortion was necessary \nto protect the life and health of the woman.\n  With that amendment, the sponsors of this bill could have gotten what \nthey wanted legally. Why didn't they take it? The reason they didn't \ntake it is because if you have an anti-choice bill with a nebulous, \nvague definition, you can chill all legal second trimester abortions.\n  Let me tell you one more thing about the amendment I offered. To \nensure compliance with the amendment, we even provided that a doctor \nwho would perform a postviability abortion on a woman whose health or \nlife is not at risk could be fined up to $100,000. That amendment would \nhave put medical decisions back into the hands of doctors but, at the \nsame time, prevented abuses. In my view, if a doctor believes such a \nprocedure is necessary to protect a woman's life or health, then he or \nshe should be able to perform that procedure.\n  Why do some Senators believe that the Federal Government even needs \nto be involved in this issue?\n  Why is this legislation even necessary? Roe v. Wade clearly allows \nStates to ban all postviability abortions unless it is necessary to \nprotect a woman's life or health, and 41 States already have bans on \nthe books. All States are free today to do so if their State \nlegislatures so choose.\n  The fact is, abortions this late in the pregnancy are rare and \nusually performed under tragic circumstances, such as a brain outside \nof a child's skull or vital inner workings outside of the body that \ncannot be connected.\n  Mr. President, the whole focus of many in this Congress and in the \nconservative movement has been to give power and control back to the \nStates and eliminate the Federal Government from people's lives. So \nanyone who believes in States' rights must now question the logic of \nimposing a new Federal regulation on States in a case such as this, \nwhere States already have the authority to ban postviability abortions \nand where a dominant majority of States--41--have already enacted such \na law.\n  Is Federal legislation really necessary? No. I say to my colleagues \nthat this clearly is a political bill designed to fan the flames and \ninvade Roe v. Wade and weaken it substantially. It attempts to ban a \nmedical procedure without properly identifying that procedure in \nmedical terms.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a number of letters \ndemonstrating that this legislation poses a serious threat to women's \nhealth be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Association of Reproductive\n\n\n                                         Health Professionals,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 20, 2003.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: We are writing on behalf of thousands of \n     health care providers to urge you and your colleagues to \n     oppose federal legislation criminalizing safe abortion \n     procedures (S. 3, the so-called ``Partial Birth Abortion Ban \n     Act of 2003'').\n       This bill is deceptive, is based on a number of flawed \n     assumptions, and is unnecessary. First, ``partial-birth \n     abortion'' is not a medical term but a non-scientific and \n     politically biased rhetorical expression invented by \n     activists to convey misrepresentations about safe and \n     medically necessary abortion procedures. The term ``partial-\n     birth abortion'' is not used by any of the major national \n     medical organizations, including the American College of \n     Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical Women's \n     Association, the American Public Health Association, and the \n     Association of Reproductive Health Professionals (ARHP).\n       Second, the bill is deceptive because it does not specify \n     any particular stage of pregnancy--contrary to assurances by \n     its sponsors that the bill's intent is to focus only on third \n     trimester abortions.\n       Finally, abortions during the third-term are already \n     illegal in almost every state except to save the woman's life \n     or health, and are rarely performed. This legislation is \n     unnecessary and is an example of political ideology trumping \n     science and appropriate medical decision-making.\n       Published literature attests to the fact that placing \n     restrictions on abortion services is harmful to the health of \n     women and that medical decisions should be left to health \n     care providers. ARHP is concerned because S. 3 dictates \n     health care methodology to the clinicians who must provide \n     medical care under the most difficult of circumstances. \n     Restrictions imposed by the government on abortion services \n     will not reduce the need for abortion or the quantity of \n     abortions performed, it will only make abortion less safe.\n       If you or members of your staff have any questions or would \n     like additional information, please contact Wayne C. Shields \n     at the ARHP office at (202) 466-3825 or wshields@arhp.org.\n           Sincerely,\n     Felicia H. Stewart, MD,\n       Chair, ARHP Board of Directors.\n     Wayne C.

As an \n     organization that is dedicated to ensuring the\n\n[[Page S12939]]\n\n     fundamental human right to reproductive health care for \n     Latinas, their families, and their communities, we cannot \n     support the proposed legislation which would drastically \n     inhibit a woman's right to choose, as well as prohibit \n     medically safe procedures which are often necessary to \n     protect and save the life of the woman.\n       NLIRH supports the right of every Latina to be in charge of \n     her own life, to determine if and when to have children, and, \n     to seek the full range of reproductive health options \n     available. These health options include access to quality \n     gynecological care, family planning and contraception, \n     fertility treatment, and all abortion services. Contrary to \n     popular belief, Latinas do access abortion services, and 51% \n     of Latinas actively identify as pro-choice. While abortion \n     may not be an option for every Latina, we support the right \n     of every Latina to make her own personal and private decision \n     about abortion and we also support efforts to restore public \n     funding for abortion. For Latinas, accessing abortion \n     services is often difficult already, due to cultural, \n     linguistic, legal, and economic barriers, and banning safe \n     abortion procedures would only further impede upon our rights \n     to choose what is medically and personally appropriate for \n     us.\n       Restricting and criminalizing any abortion procedure would \n     undermine the fundamental human right to self-determination, \n     and would endanger the lives of women for whom abortion may \n     be medically necessary. Decisions regarding when to have \n     children are often difficult, personal, and morally \n     complicated, and should be made only by the woman.\n       We appreciate your attention to our concerns, and strongly \n     urge you to vote against the so-called ``Partial-Birth \n     Abortion Ban of 2003.''\n           Sincerely,\n     ------.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Medical Students for Choice,\n\n                                    Oakland, CA, October 19, 2003.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of Medical Students for \n     Choice, a national organization representing more than 7,000 \n     medical students and residents, I write to urge your \n     opposition to H.R. 760/S. 3, the (so-called) Partial-Birth \n     Abortion Ban Act of 2003.\n       Medical Students for Choice is dedicated to ensuring that \n     woman's right to choose from a full range of reproductive \n     health options is preserved. We believe that a physician, in \n     consultation with the patient, should make the decision \n     regarding what method should be used to terminate a \n     pregnancy. Physicians need to have all medical options \n     available in order to provide women with the best medical \n     care possible.\n       We are opposed to H.R. 760/S. 3 because we believe this and \n     other legislative and judicial restrictions to safe, \n     medically accepted abortion procedures severely jeopardize \n     women's health and well-being. We also oppose the bill \n     because it fails to include adequate health exception \n     language in instances where certain procedures may be \n     determined by a physician to be the best or most appropriate \n     to preserve the health of the woman. This bill ties the hands \n     of physicians and endangers the health of women. Further, we \n     believe that this bill is deceptive and represents a thinly \n     veiled attempt to restrict women's access to all abortion \n     procedures. ``Partial birth'' is a political term, not a \n     medical term. Despite the anti-choice political rhetoric, \n     this bill is neither designed nor written to ban only one \n     procedure. The bill's prohibitions would apply well before \n     viability and could ban more than one procedure. These so-\n     called ``partial birth'' abortion bans are deliberately \n     designed to erode the protections of Roe v. Wade.\n       Thank you for your attention to our concerns regarding the \n     negative effect this legislation would have to a woman's \n     right to a safe, legal abortion.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         Angel M. Foster, D.Phil.,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Mexican American Legal\n\n\n                                 Defense and Educational Fund,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 14, 2003.\n\n     Re Conference Report H.

Rept. 108-228, the so-\n     called Partial Birth Abortion Act of 2003 (the Act). MALDEF, \n     a national non-profit organization whose mission is to \n     protect and promote the civil rights of the over 35 million \n     Latinos living in the United States, believes this \n     legislation is unconstitutional and harmful to women's \n     health.\n       The Act is unconstitutional for at least three reasons. \n     First, the legislation does not include a health exception. \n     The Supreme Court has held that laws regulating abortion must \n     adequately safeguard a woman's health. This legislation does \n     not include such an exception. Contrary to the legislative \n     findings indicating that a health exception to the ban is \n     never necessary, many physicians have stated that this \n     legislation would prevent them from performing procedures \n     that are necessary to protect a woman's health. Second, the \n     legislation is unconstitutional because the language of the \n     ban is overly broad. The ban is not limited to specific \n     medical procedures and actually could prohibit the safest \n     abortion techniques in certain cases, thereby unduly \n     burdening a woman's right to choose. Finally, determining \n     which procedure is medically necessary is a medical decision \n     that should be made by a physician and his or her patient, \n     not by the federal government. The Supreme Court has \n     emphasized the need for physicians to have adequate \n     discretion to make these types of medical decisions.\n       The Supreme Court directly addressed this type of ban in \n     Stenberg v. Carhart, 530 U.S. 914 (2000). In Stenberg, the \n     Court found Nebraska's ban on so-called partial birth \n     abortion unconstitutional because the legislation's language \n     was overly broad and it lacked a health exception. The \n     federal version of the ban now pending before you contains \n     the same flaws and is similarly unconstitutional.\n       This legislation is an unprecedented attempt by the federal \n     government to restrict women's access to abortion that \n     ultimately jeopardizes the health of women. MALDEF strongly \n     opposes this legislation and urges you to do so as well. If \n     you have any questions please contact Angela Hooton at (202) \n     293-2828.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Antonia Hernandez,\n     President and General Counsel.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         National Latina Institute\n\n\n                                      for Reproductive Health,\n\n                                   Brooklyn, NY, October 17, 2003.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: The National Latina Institute for \n     Reproductive Health (NLIRH) strongly opposes S. 3, the \n     ``Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003''. As an \n     organization that is dedicated to ensuring the fundamental \n     human right to reproductive health care for Latinas, their \n     families, and their communities, we cannot support the \n     proposed legislation which would drastically inhibit a \n     woman's right to choose, as well as prohibit medically safe \n     procedures which are often necessary to protect and save the \n     life of the woman.\n       NLIRH supports the right of every Latina to be in charge of \n     her own life, to determine if and when to have children, and \n     to seek the full range of reproductive health options \n     available. These health options include access to quality \n     gynecological care, family planning and contraception, \n     fertility treatment, and all abortion services. Contrary to \n     popular belief, Latinas do access abortion services, and 51% \n     of Latinas actively identify as pro-choice. While abortion \n     may not be an option for every Latina, we support the right \n     of every Latina to make her own personal and private decision \n     about abortion and we also support efforts to restore public \n     funding for abortion. For Latinas, accessing abortion \n     services is often difficult already, due to cultural, \n     linguistic, legal, and economic barriers, and banning safe \n     abortion procedures would only further impede upon our rights \n     to choose what is medically and personally appropriate for \n     us.\n       Restricting and criminalizing any abortion procedure would \n     undermine the fundamental human right to self-determination, \n     and would endanger the lives of women for whom abortion may \n     be medically necessary. Decisions regarding when to have \n     children are often difficult, personal, and morally \n     complicated, and should be made only by the woman.\n       We appreciate your attention to our concerns, and strongly \n     urge you to vote against the so-called ``Partial-Birth \n     Abortion Ban of 2003.''\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Silvia Henriquez,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            National Black Women's\n\n\n                                         Health Project, Inc.,\n\n                                                 October 20, 2003.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the Black Women's \n     Health Imperative (formerly National Black Women's health \n     Project), I am writing to convey our opposition to H.R. 760, \n     the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003.\n       As the only national organization that is solely dedicated \n     to the health of the nation's 19 million Black women and \n     girls, the Black Women's Health Imperative (the Imperative), \n     has focused on issues that disproportionately affect Black \n     women from access to healthcare, inclusive of reproductive \n     health care. The Imperative has been in the forefront \n     advocating for a comprehensive agenda that includes the full \n     range of medical and socially available technologies and \n     services for fertility management.\n       We believe that H.R. 760 would restrict safe, medically \n     acceptable abortion procedures that would severely endanger \n     women's health and well-being, disproportionately affecting \n     low-income African American women. Moreover, we feel that \n     this legislation fails to include adequate health exception \n     language in instances where certain procedures may be \n     determined by a physician to be the most appropriate to \n     preserve the health of the woman.\n       For the past 20 years, the Black Women's Health Imperative \n     has been instrumental in highlighting disparities in health \n     and will continue to play an essential role in helping to \n     shape policies that seek to improve African American women's \n     overall health. On behalf of our constituency, we urge the \n     United\n\n[[Page S12940]]\n\n     States Senate to oppose H.R. 760, the Partial-Birth Abortion \n     Ban Act of 2003.\n           Sincerely,\n     Lorraine Cole, PhD.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From Medscape General Medicine, June 25, 2003]\n\nThe Federal Ban on So-called ``Partial-Birth Abortion'' Is a Dangerous \n                    Intrusion Into Medical Practice\n\n                    (By Paul D. Blumenthal, MD, MPH)\n\n       Congress has passed the ``Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of \n     2003,'' the first federal legislation ever enacted that bans \n     abortion procedures. This unprecedented intrusion by Congress \n     into medical practice will reduce access to second-trimester \n     abortions and defines the doctors who perform them as \n     criminals. Moreover, by undermining a woman's right to select \n     the reproductive healthcare most appropriate for her and \n     interfering with a physician's ability to make medical \n     decisions, Congress derogates the physician-patient \n     relationship.\n       Proponents of this law claim that it bans only a particular \n     procedure. However, the legislation does not define what is \n     being banned in such a way that a physician can know exactly \n     what is prohibited. There is no formally recognized medical \n     procedure to which the term ``partial-birth abortion'' used \n     in this legislation applies; it is therefore vague and \n     medically incorrect. None of my colleagues know or could \n     state whether the abortion procedures they now perform are \n     covered under this law. Indeed, as I read the definition of \n     the banned procedures, any of the safest, most common \n     abortion methods used throughout the second trimester of \n     pregnancy could proceed in such a manner as to be outlawed. \n     One can only assume that by intimidating medical providers \n     with the constant threat of criminal accusations, the intent \n     of this law is to frighten the medical community--the same \n     community that swears an ancient oath to use its knowledge \n     and skills to serve and protect the lives of its patients--\n     from performing pregnancy terminations at all.\n       The practice of high-quality medicine requires that \n     physicians be knowledgeable about and able to perform variety \n     of procedures to accomplish a given treatment or therapy. \n     Planning any procedure is done in consultation with the \n     patient, and it is based on the medical judgment, experience, \n     and training of the provider, and the individual \n     circumstances of the patient's condition. Sometimes, as a \n     result of developments during a surgery or in a patient's \n     condition, it becomes necessary to adapt and choose a \n     different course or modify the procedure as it progresses. \n     These decisions are often quite complex and mandate that \n     physicians use their best professional and clinical judgment, \n     most often right on the spot. These are decisions that should \n     be made by physicians and their patients stone. Indeed, when \n     performing surgery, there is not time for a call to Congress, \n     the Supreme Court, or anyone else in order to obtain \n     clarification of the statutory intent or to request a waiver. \n     This law evokes a preposterous image of physicians with their \n     attorneys present in the operating room advising and \n     counseling them at each step, and perhaps even in the middle \n     of surgery suggesting a physician alter a technique deemed \n     best for the patient to avoid committing a federal crime. \n     Physicians and surgeons should be allowed to practice their \n     art in accordance with time-honored peer-reviewed standards \n     and with only the interests of the patient at . . . .\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. President, I have listened to this debate on both sides, and I \ncontinue to hear a lot of the same things. I just think it is important \nto set the record straight with respect to what many have heard today.\n  First, the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, has objected to my \nusing the term ``killing'' the child when describing the diagrams of \nthe partial-birth abortion. So I wanted to make sure I was not using \nterms that were inflammatory or inaccurate. She said I was referring to \nthe fetus as a child instead of the fetus. I looked up the definition \nof fetus: ``An unborn child.'' So I don't think referring to a fetus as \na child is incorrect when the definition of a fetus is ``an unborn \nchild, from the third month until birth.'' This child is obviously in \nexcess of 3 months into gestation, so it is obvious I am using a \ncorrect term.\n  She objected to me using the term ``killing.'' I will quote some \npeople in the abortion movement to justify my using of this term. This \nis from Faye Wattleton, former president of Planned Parenthood:\n\n       I think we have deluded ourselves into believing that \n     people don't know that abortion is killing. So any pretense \n     that abortion is not killing is a signal of our ambivalence, \n     a signal that we cannot say, yes, it kills a fetus, but it is \n     a woman's body and ultimately her choice.\n\n  So say even those in the abortion movement.\n  Judy Arcana, a pro-choice author and educator, said:\n\n       Sometimes a woman has to decide to kill her baby. That is \n     what abortion is.\n\n  I understand how people want to avoid talking about the baby, the \nchild, the fetus, or whatever term you feel most comfortable using. It \nis what it is. It is a human being. I understand we like to use terms \nthat don't refer to the human being. In fact, in all the debate we have \nheard today on the other side, we hear this concentration and talk \nabout the woman and the right to choose. We hear very little discussion \nabout what the choice is all about. I know most Americans like choices \nand they like the right to choose. But I think it is important that \npeople know what the choice is all about, what we are choosing.\n  What we are choosing here is to kill a human being. Yet many on the \nother side just don't want to consider what is being chosen here. What \nmany on that side like to think is that we are choosing a medical \nprocedure. The Senator from New Jersey earlier referred to it being \nsimilar to the removal of a cancerous intestine. Maybe some people look \nat babies as this sort of cancer or this thing that they don't want \nanymore, that somehow affects them in some way. But I think it is \nimportant for us, if we are going to make decisions that impact \nmillions of lives, to face up to what we are doing and we don't try to \ncouch it in terms that sound nice, that sound American--words such as \n``freedom'' and ``choice'' and words such as that.\n  What we are choosing is to take away a fundamental right of every \nperson in America, and that is the right to life. So, yes, I will use \nthe term ``killing'' because that is exactly what it is, the \nextinguishing of a life. It is a child, it is a baby, an infant, a \nfetus, a living human being.\n  Second, the Senator from California has suggested that this is not a \nmedical term. Well, I had my staff run and look it up in Webster's \nMedical Dictionary. In Webster's, the term ``partial-birth abortion'' \nis in fact defined:\n\n       Abortion in the second or third trimester in which the \n     death of the fetus is induced after it is passed part way \n     through the birth canal.\n\n  As to this idea that it is not a term used, it is in the dictionary. \nIt is interesting that the Senator from California would say that this \nis not a medical term, that this doesn't exist. Yet she has repeated \nmany times that this thing that doesn't exist is a great threat to \nwomen. If we abolish something that doesn't exist, somehow or another \nthis is a horrible thing we are doing to women. That doesn't \nnecessarily make sense to me. Then she goes on and says this thing that \ndoesn't exist--she claims it doesn't exist--is medically necessary at \ntimes. I have a hard time grappling with this argument in the \nalternative. First you argue it doesn't exist, and then it does exist \nand it is medically necessary.\n  The Senator from California, last month, put in the Record statements \nfrom Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health, and in this letter \nin the Congressional Record, they say:\n\n       So-called partial-birth abortion does not exist. There is \n     no mention of the term partial-birth abortion in any medical \n     literature.\n\n  That is not true.\n\n       Physicians are never taught a technique called partial-\n     birth abortion; therefore, they are medically unable to \n     define the procedure. We know that there is no such technique \n     as partial-birth abortion.\n\n  She makes the argument that it doesn't exist, and then she argues \nthat it is necessary. I don't know how you can have it both ways. It \neither does exist and it is necessary or it doesn't exist and it is not \nnecessary. We find interesting arguments that don't seem to hold up \nupon closer examination.\n  Another thing that doesn't hold up under examination is the repeated \nattempts by those who oppose this legislation to misinform the public \nas to what it does. I am not only going to go through the most recent \nexample of this, but the chronology of events around this legislation, \nwhich started with Charles Canady in the House of Representatives and \nBob Smith in the Senate, who did an outstanding job.\n  I remember when Bob first came to the Senate floor. He was ridiculed \nas being this extreme person who would bring this medical procedure to \nthe floor and it was an outrageous thing for a Senator to do. He had \nthe courage to stand up for his convictions and follow through. But I \nremember at hearings, they were saying this procedure\n\n[[Page S12941]]\n\ndidn't exist, first, and, second, the anesthesia given to the mother \nwould kill the baby, and that this was only done on mothers who were in \na position where the baby was badly deformed or the mother's health was \nin danger, and it was only done a few dozen times a year.\n  Every one of those things I have mentioned has been debunked. They \nare simply not true. Yet here we are just days away from passing this \nbill again in the Senate for the third time, but the fourth time we \nhave debated, and we see a statement by Planned Parenthood last month \nthat says:\n\n       S. 3 is a bill to outlaw the medical procedure used \n     primarily in emergency abortions.\n\n  ``Primarily in emergency abortions.'' Let me, again, without reading \nthe comment below, state this is a 3-day procedure. This is a procedure \nwhere the woman presents herself to the abortionist, and I say \nabortionist because this procedure is only done in abortion clinics. It \nis not done in hospitals, as this organization that Senator Boxer \nsubmitted for the Record said. They don't teach this procedure in \nmedical school. It was designed by an abortionist for the convenience \nof the abortionist.\n  She presents herself to an abortionist who gives her something to \nhelp dilate her cervix and tells her to return 2 days later.\n  Can you possibly imagine someone in an emergency situation presenting \nthemselves to a health care professional who is in an emergency \nsituation because of her pregnancy, who is given something to dilate \nher cervix and sent home for 2 days?\n  On the face of it, it makes no sense. But yet they persist in spite \nof the fact that Ron Fitzsimmons, the executive director of the \nNational Coalition of Abortion Providers, is quoted in the New York \nTimes on February 26, 1997--1997, not February 26, 2003, 2002--6\\1/2\\ \nyears ago:\n\n       Mr. Fitzsimmons recalled the night in November 1995, when \n     he appeared on ``Nightline'' on ABC and ``lied through my \n     teeth'' when he said the procedure was used rarely and only \n     on women whose lives were in danger or whose fetuses were \n     damaged.\n\n  ``Lied through my teeth'' in 1995, he said, on ``Nightline.'' But in \n1997, he came clean. He said:\n\n       In the vast majority of cases, the procedure is performed \n     on a healthy mother with a healthy fetus that is 20 weeks or \n     more along, Mr. Fitzsimmons said. The abortion rights folks \n     know it, the antiabortion folks know it, and so probably does \n     everyone else, he said in the article in the Medical News, an \n     American Medical Association publication.\n\n  They knew it. In 1997, they knew this. A month ago they were still \nsaying it.\n  I don't mind having a good honest debate, and the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Feinstein, brought up legitimate legal issues, a \nproper, good debate, but when the organization that is principally \nbehind the stopping of this bill a month before this bill gets \npresented continues to try to misinform the American public, I think \nyou have to ask yourself a question as to the credibility of that \norganization and the credibility of their case.\n  There are a couple other comments that were made on which I have to \nset the record straight. The Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, said \nthis abortion procedure needs to remain legal out of respect for women \nand ``because it gives the fetus dignity.''\n  Anyone who looks at this abortion procedure and suggests that pulling \na child feet first through the birth canal at 20 weeks of gestation, \nwho otherwise would have been born alive, and have a pair of scissors \nthrust in the base of their skull and have their brains suctioned out \nis an act of dignity I think has to rethink what the word ``dignity'' \nmeans. To treat any human being, to treat any living thing in that \nfashion is insulting to that life. It certainly is not an act that I \nwould call a dignified act or an act that shows respect for that child.\n  A lot has been made by both Senators from California and others about \nthe need for a health exception. This gets in to the meat of this \ndebate with respect to its constitutionality. The Court did state that \nthere were two reasons for the Nebraska law on partial-birth abortion \nto be overturned. One was that it did not have a health exception that \nwas required by Roe v. Wade.\n\n  Step back and think about this debate in a larger context. I don't \nthink most Americans, if I can put up the last chart of the diagram of \nthe procedure--I don't think most Americans contemplate that Roe v. \nWade covers abortions done late in pregnancy by healthy mothers with \nhealthy babies who would otherwise be born alive being treated in such \na brutal and barbaric fashion. I don't think most Americans see the \nscope of Roe v. Wade as including that type of abortion but it does.\n  That is really the wake-up call for America here: That Roe v. Wade is \nnot what they claim it to be. If it is later in pregnancy, it is \nmothers who have health issues or the child has health issues. No, that \nis not what we are talking about here. We are talking about there needs \nto be a health exception, according to this court, for a procedure done \nlate in pregnancy on healthy mothers with healthy babies treated in a \nbrutal fashion such as this. I don't think most Americans would have \nsaid: Gee, we need a health exception here or Roe v. Wade covers this \nissue, but that is what they say; that based on the evidence they \ncompiled in the Federal district court in Nebraska, the court examined \nthe evidence and determined that a health exception was necessary, \nbased on the evidence that was submitted at trial.\n  We believe strongly the evidence submitted at trial was incomplete; \nthat there has been a lot of evidence submitted to the Congress and in \npublications that is counter to what the Nebraska district court found, \nand that the overwhelming weight, and I would argue the dispositive \nweight, of evidence presented to this Congress, which is a finder of \nfact just as the district court is, is that it is never medically \nnecessary.\n  The Senator from California has said the American College of \nObstetrics and Gynecology has written a letter saying that it may be \nmedically--that is the term, ``may be medically necessary.'' Yet in the \nletter she has entered into the Record, which she has entered many \ntimes before, they do not present one example of a case in which it \nwould be medically necessary.\n  For 8 years I have stood on the floor of the Senate and have asked \nfor such a case from the American College. To date, the American \nCollege has never replied to my request. They have not sent one case to \nbe submitted into this Record as to where this may be medically \nnecessary actually is medically necessary.\n  One has to wonder the validity of the statement that it may be \nmedically necessary if they can't find a case in fact where it is. \nCases have been submitted by both Senators from California where some \nobstetricians have said this was medically indicated in this case. For \nevery 1 letter that has been submitted, we have had 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 \nletters from maternal fetal medicine specialists--they are specialists \nin high-risk pregnancies--perinatologists who say not only aren't those \ncases good cases but they are contraindicated.\n  It is bad medicine. So we do not really have any uncontrovertible \ncase where it is medically necessary. I think that is important for the \nCourt to consider. I think it is also important for the Court to \nconsider that the Congress, which has had multiple hearings of fact, \nunlike the Court, was able to make a determination and have a vote \noverwhelmingly in both the House and Senate that these facts are as we \nsay they are. I believe we have a right as a body to make that \ndetermination.\n  We hope, just as we listen to the Court in matters of law because \nthat is their responsibility, that as finders of fact they would listen \nto what we come up with. I know many on the Court think it is a one-way \nstreet. They just tell us what they think and we have to do whatever \nthey tell us and we have no input into what the Court decision is.\n  That is not the way our Framers envisioned it. I found it sort of \nhumorous that the Senator from California said the Framers did not \nenvision the Congress amending the Constitution by legislative \nfindings. I will assure the Senator from California that our Framers \ndid not envision the Supreme Court amending the Constitution by \njudicial fiat but they do. Roe v. Wade is a case in point.\n  So there are lots of things our Framers did not envision, I say the \nmost\n\n[[Page S12942]]\n\ngrotesque of which is the Court activism that we have seen across the \nstreet.\n  With respect to this health exception, it is overwhelmingly clear \nthat it is never medically necessary.\n  Why do we go to such length in saying that a health exception is not \nmedically necessary? Well, because if we had a health exception to this \nbill--and many have suggested, just put in a health exception. I mean, \nare you not concerned about women's health?\n  Well, I do not think anyone is not concerned about women's health. In \nfact, the evidence presented is overwhelming that this procedure is a \nriskier procedure than other abortion procedures and is never medically \nindicated. So if one looks at the overwhelming body of evidence and \nthey are concerned about women's health, they would be for banning this \nprocedure because it is never medically indicated. It is done only for \nthe convenience of abortionists and is, in fact, unhealthy. So if one's \nconcern is women's health, then they would be for banning this \nprocedure.\n  The interesting point is, why are they pushing so hard for this \nhealth exception and why are we resisting it so much? Well, what does \nthe health exception mean? This is the little secret that to those who \nhave not followed the abortion debate may say, what is the big deal? \nWhy do you not put in a health exception? That sounds reasonable.\n  The problem with the health exception is that it is so broad an \nexception it swallows up the bill because a health exception--when Roe \nv. Wade was decided, there was a companion case decided called Doe v. \nBolton, and in that case health was defined as: Medical judgment may be \nexercised in the light of all factors: physical, emotional, \npsychological, familial, and the woman's age relevant to the well-being \nof the patient. All of these factors may relate to health. This allows \nthe attending physician the room he needs to make the best medical \njudgment.\n  So over time what this has been interpreted to mean is health means \nanything: emotional, physical, spiritual, psychological, whatever it \nis, stress, anxiety. Some have even brought it to economic concerns.\n  Health is an exception that swallows the rule. So as long as the \ndoctor says the woman obviously exhibited anxiety, stress, discomfort, \nshe had a headache or whatever, it does not matter. It does not say \nsevere. It just says anything. So what this provision did, and that is \nwhat the Court wanted to do, was to give absolute latitude to the \ndoctor to do whatever the doctor wanted to do in consultation with the \npatient. So the health exception is no exception at all. It is a barred \nantiprohibition. So understand that the health exception bars the bill, \nstops the bill from having any effect. So that is why we resist.\n  In our case, we think we are outside this health exception because it \nis actually unhealthy for the woman and it is never medically \nnecessary.\n  Before I move on to the next topic, I want to go through some of the \nhealth risks as outlined--we have a series of letters which I will \nsubmit for the Record--that partial-birth abortion poses serious health \nrisks for women.\n  First, as I mentioned before, the physician has to dilate the cervix \na couple of days before the abortion is performed, creating a risk, \naccording to several physicians, to an incompetent cervix, a leading \ncause of future premature deliveries or infection, and is the main \ncause of subsequent infertility.\n  As we can see, the baby is brought in feet first through the birth \ncanal. When they reach in to pull the baby out of the uterus--reaching \ninto the uterus to pull the baby's feet through the cervix is a \ndangerous procedure, risking the tearing of the uterus. It poses an \nincreased risk of uterine rupture, abruption, amniotic fluid embolus \nand trauma to the uterus as a result of converting the child into a \nfootling breech position. Grabbing the baby's legs could perforate the \nuterus, which could result in severe hemorrhage and possibly a \nhysterectomy. Then the procedure that follows where the Metzenbaum \nscissors are placed in the base of the baby's skull to kill the baby \nand puncture the baby's skull, putting the scissors into the baby's \nbrain is a partially blind procedure. As we can see, the physician has \nno way of seeing where those scissors are entering the baby or if they \nare even entering the baby.\n  This blind procedure with a sharp instrument may expose the uterus to \nsharp bone shards, bone shards from the baby's skull upon the puncture. \nThey may lacerate different parts of the woman's body and cause \nhemorrhaging and could necessitate a hysterectomy to save the mother's \nlife. This is not a riskless procedure. This is a risky procedure.\n  I reiterate, this is not taught in medical schools. There are no peer \nreview journals published that suggest this is a superior way, much \nless an appropriate way, to deal with an abortion. There are no studies \nthat have been done, that are controlled in nature, to show that this \nis a proper procedure. This is a rogue procedure. It is medically \nunhealthy and it is medically unnecessary.\n  Both Senators from California talked about their recollection of the \npre-Roe v. Wade days. The Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, \nsuggested the debate we had a month ago with respect to the number of \nmaternal deaths as a result of abortion prior to Roe v. Wade were women \nin all States--in some States, abortion was legal, not in all States--\nthat women as a result of that had higher incidents of maternal death. \nThe Senator from California continued to indicate that there were some \n5,000 deaths per year as a result of abortion not being legal \neverywhere in the United States.\n  I entered information in the Record from the Bureau of Vital \nStatistics, including more recently the Centers for Disease Control, \nsuggesting at the time of 1972, prior to the decision being made, there \nwere 83 maternal deaths. The Senator from California suggested that is \nonly because the only reported deaths were States in which abortion was \nlegal.\n  That is not the case from the statistics. Had that been the case--it \nis not, according to the information we have gathered, but had it been \nthe case, then why were there 1,231 reported deaths from abortion in \n1942, where abortion was not legal in any State in the country?\n  So if her information was correct, if they were only reporting cases \nin States in which abortion was legal in 1942, there would have been no \ndeaths because there were no States in which abortion was legal. But in \nfact they were reporting from States where abortion was legal and \nillegal.\n  What you saw from 1942 down to 1972 was a decrease, from 1,231, \nalmost straight line down to 83 deaths in 1972. Why? Because medicine \nimproved. Antibiotics, first and foremost, is probably the principal \nreason, because of infection, but there were a whole variety of \nreasons. The improvement of medical science is why those numbers \ncontinued to decrease. So the idea that somehow or another there were \nthousands of women dying prior to Roe v. Wade is just not backed up by \nthe facts.\n  We have an obligation; as much as we would like to paint a picture \nfor the eyes particularly of young people who didn't live then, as much \nas we would like to paint this picture to young people to convince them \nof the justice or righteousness of the right to abortion, that things \nwere really bad, that women were dying in droves, there was a horrible \nsituation prior to Roe v. Wade, we cannot. You have to deal with the \nfact that was not the case with respect to the amount of maternal \ndeaths.\n  There may be other factors that you consider and you are welcome to \nmake the arguments about how people felt at the time. That is fine. But \nyou cannot play with the facts to present a case that is not true.\n  I want to quote Bernard Nathanson who was, at the time of 1972, an \nabortionist. He says:\n\n       How many deaths were we talking about when abortion was \n     illegal? In N.A.R.A.L.--\n\n  A group he helped found, the National Abortion Rights Action League--\n\n     we generally emphasized the drama of the individual case, not \n     the mass statistics, but when we spoke of the latter it was \n     always ``5,000 to 10,000 deaths a year.'' I confess that I \n     knew the figures were totally false, and I suppose the others \n     did too, if they stopped to think about it. But in the \n     ``morality'' of our revolution, it was a useful figure, \n     widely accepted, so why go out of our way to correct it with \n     honest statistics?\n\n  This is a very serious issue. I would argue it is the greatest moral \nissue of\n\n[[Page S12943]]\n\nour time. I think we have an obligation to use honest statistics, at \nleast honest statistics--honest statistics, honest cases. The Senator \nfrom California brought up the case of Vicki Wilson, as she has \nrepeatedly throughout this debate over the past several years. She said \nVicki Wilson needed a partial-birth abortion because of a medical \ncondition she and the baby had. Let me quote from Vicki Wilson's own \ntestimony to Congress.\n\n       My daughter died with dignity inside my womb, after which \n     the baby's body was delivered head first.\n\n  Not feet first. Vicky Wilson did not have a partial-birth abortion. \nYet it is a case that is continually used here to justify a partial-\nbirth abortion being kept legal.\n  The case was also made she needed to have one done. Quoting Vicki \nWilson:\n\n       I knew I could go ahead and carry the baby until full term \n     but knowing, you know, that this was futile, you know, that \n     she was going to die, I felt like I needed to be a little bit \n     more in control in terms of her life and my life.\n\n  Vicki Wilson did not have a medical emergency or a health need, from \nthe standpoint of what most people would consider to be a health need, \nwhich is physical health.\n  I caution, when people listen to this debate, that they listen to the \ndebate of what is real, what the facts are, and what the consequences \nare. There is no question in my mind that the consequences of this \ndebate are the most profound consequences we face as a country and more \nspecifically as a culture as to who we are. Because ultimately what \nthis is about, banning this procedure, is about who we are going to \naccept in our human family. Do we accept this little baby? You can pull \nout the photo Senator Brownback showed earlier. If we can accept this \nlittle baby at 20 weeks or 21 weeks into our human family, or do we say \nno, no, you may look like us, you may have hands and feet and you may \nhave a heartbeat, you may be perfectly normal, you may have looked like \nus when we were that age, but we are not going to include you in the \nhuman family. We are not going to call you an American. We are not \ngoing to give you the rights provided to you under the Constitution.\n  It really is about who we accept. I would argue it is about who we \nare going to love, who we are going to nurture, who we are going to \nsupport.\n  Today in the Senate we have a chance to say in some very small way--\nand I admit, I will agree with the Senators from California and others \nthat this will do very little to limit the number of abortions. I agree \nwith that. But in some small way we are acknowledging this little \nchild, this little child is a member of our family.\n  The Senator from Iowa, Senator Harkin, as well as the Senator from \nCalifornia, Senator Feinstein, talked at length about the striking of \nthe Roe v. Wade language from this bill that passed the Senate. The \nlanguage stated Roe v. Wade was the law of the land and should continue \nto be the law of the land. It passed by a couple of votes here in the \nSenate.\n  I think many of us found that to be somewhat in contrast with the \nunderlying purpose of this bill, in the sense that this was a very \nsmall tip of the hat, recognition of the humanity of this child, we \nwere not going to treat this child in this grotesque fashion. That is \nall.\n  It doesn't say that child couldn't be killed in some other fashion \nthat was medically safer for the woman. But it says when it comes to \ndelivering a child and having that child just inches away from being \nborn, we were not going to go that far. This, really, was too close. So \nwe gave a small nod, a small nod to the humanity of that child in the \nprocess of being born.\n  So many of us thought, sort of restating this sense of the Senate \nabout the primacy of Roe v. Wade was an insult to even this little nod \nthat I would argue is outside of Roe v. Wade. Unnecessary, is what it \nis. Roe v. Wade is, according to the Court, how they will decide \nabortion cases.\n  I vehemently disagree with them and I will continue to fight on this \nfloor and anywhere else I can to make sure that law, that Court \ndecision taking the decision away from the American public--which is \nwhere it was prior to Roe v. Wade--taking the decision of great moral \nimport away from the American public, is returned to the people.\n  We just saw an election in California where the people rose up and \nsaid they wanted to take back control of their State. We don't have \nsuch a process here. The Court is insulated from the public rising up \nand saying no, we don't like your decision--or even from the Congress. \nIt takes a huge amount of effort. It is a very difficult process to \namend the Constitution, pass both Houses of Congress by a \nconstitutional majority, 67 percent; plus get three-quarters of the \nStates to ratify a constitutional amendment. Yet this Court by a whim \ncan amend the Constitution with five votes, and did so. They amended \nthe Constitution like that.\n  I don't think that is the way the Framers wanted it. I think they set \nforth a constitutional amendment process because that is the way they \nwanted to create new rights or change the Constitution, not to allow \nthe Court to do it.\n  I have likened the Roe v. Wade decision--I was fortunate enough \nSunday to be in St. Louis, MO and had the opportunity to walk by the \ncourthouse, which is right in downtown St. Louis, where the Dred Scott \ncase was initially decided. That is where the district court was.\n  You look back, and people in St. Louis have great pride in the fact \nthat case was there, and many Missourians stood up and fought against \nwhat that case was all about. I would argue that Roe v. Wade is exact \nin kind as the Dred Scott decision. Like the Dred Scott decision, Roe \nv. Wade--unlike, if you think back, and think of any other major \nSupreme Court decision, where rights, individual rights were dealt \nwith--almost every other Supreme Court decision in which individual \nconstitutional rights were dealt with, over time the public grew to \naccept. That is because over time, the public grew to understand the \njustice of that decision.\n\n  The most recent one is civil rights decisions. But in Dred Scott the \nabolitionist and so many others knew of the injustice--yes, it was the \nlaw; that is what the court said. They decided the case. There were too \nmany in this country who said, no, I don't believe that is right.\n  It is amazing if you see the polling of young people in America, \nthere is actually a higher pro-life sentiment among young people than \nolder people, but you would think people who grew up, knowing this was \nthe law--because when people hear the law they think, if it is the law, \nit must be right; it must be just; it must be ethical; it must be \nmoral; otherwise, it would not be the law. The law is a great teacher. \nIt is the greatest teacher to young people as to what is right and what \nis wrong. Young people, knowing the law, still say there is something \ninside me that says this is not right. Just like young people in the \n1850s and 1860s, who said there is something inside me that tells me \nthis is not right.\n  Abraham Lincoln said a house divided against itself cannot stand. So \nhere we are today, with the American public deeply divided on this \nissue, deeply divided because so many people for 30 years have only \nknown the law and the popular culture. Does the popular culture depart \nat all from what the law is? Is there anything you see coming out of \nHollywood or New York that at all disagrees with this, the Supreme \nCourt notion of what the law should be? Of course not. Yet this feeling \nis out there, this sentiment, like the abolitionists of the 1860s who \nsaid it may be the law, but in this case that does not make it right. \nThat does not make it just. So while we had a great debate on Roe v. \nWade, this will have no impact. It is just a debate that will continue \nto go on.\n  The final point I make about this is one I have made before. Why are \nDred Scott and Roe v. Wade alike? Because the Dred Scott decision put \nthe rights, the property rights, the liberty rights of the slaveholder \nabove the life rights of the slave. In our founding document, the \nDeclaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote: We are endowed by \nour creator with certain inalienable rights. Then he listed them: The \nright to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. In that order--life, \nliberty, pursuit of happiness.\n  In Dred Scott, we took the fundamental right, life--for without life \nyou cannot have liberty; without liberty you cannot pursue happiness. \nSo they are put in order for a reason. What\n\n[[Page S12944]]\n\nDred Scott did was take the life rights of a slave and put them under \nthe liberty rights of someone else.\n  And Roe v. Wade, the reason I compare it to Dred Scott, does the same \nthing. It puts the life right of this little human being that we have \ndecided not to accept in our society as a person and subjugates them to \nthe liberty rights, the choice of someone else, in this case the baby's \nmother.\n  The Senator from California says why don't we trust women more? I do. \nBut you cannot ignore the fact that one-third of all pregnancies in \nAmerica end in abortion. This is a very small piece of legislation, I \nwill admit that. But it is important just for a brief moment, just for \nsome rather small piece of legislation that affects, if you consider \n1.3 million abortions, less than 1 percent of all abortions, far less, \n.1 of all abortions, but in some small way it begins to recognize the \nhumanity that we have to display toward this child and not treat this \nchild in such a brutal fashion.\n  I conclude by thanking my colleague from California and all those who \nhave been involved in this debate over the years. We have had a \nvigorous debate. That is important in the Senate that we debate these \nvery important issues. I thank all those on both sides of the aisle who \nhave engaged in that. I thank Senator Smith for his courage in bringing \nthis bill up; Senator DeWine, in particular, who has been a tremendous \nchampion on this issue; along with Senator Brownback, Senator Ensign, \nSenator Voinovich, and so many others who have come to the Senate and \ntaken on this issue.\n  I thank my staff: Heather MacLean, for the tremendous work she has \ndone in supporting me in every way possible in getting the information \nI need when I need it, to carry this debate forward; and Michelle \nKitchen; prior to her, Wayne Palmer, my legislative director; and all \nthe members of my staff.\n  Finally, I thank all who have been sending your prayers to \nWashington, DC, through this debate. They have made a difference.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I rise today to support adoption of \nthe conference report to accompany the ``Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act \nof 2003.'' I compliment the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, \nMr. Santorum. He has carried this bill and I offer him my \ncongratulations for his efforts in this regard.\n  I have always been a supporter of the rights of the unborn. And, \nafter many years of debate on this issue, I am very pleased that this \nbody is going to pass this measure, and that the President has said he \nwill sign it.\n  In March, I came to the floor and I discussed this very issue. At \nthat time, I quoted one of our very distinguished former colleagues, \nMr. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Senator Moynihan described the Partial \nBirth Abortion procedure as follows:\n\n       I think this is just too close to infanticide. A child has \n     been born and it has exited the uterus. What on Earth is this \n     procedure?\n\n  That is what the distinguished Senator from New York said.\n  And, the Senator was right. This debate is not about Roe v. Wade; \nthis is not a pro-life or pro-choice vote. This debate is about \nhumanity and necessity. The procedure of partial- birth abortion, to \nput it candidly, is cruel and inhumane. The issue here today is whether \nwe should prohibit a form of abortion that borders on infanticide. As \nSenator Moynihan said, ``what on Earth is this procedure?''\n  By now, many Americans are uncomfortably aware of the details of a \npartial-birth abortion. They have heard the testimony of doctors who \nperform this procedure and nurses who witness it. They have also most \nlikely seen information ads or read descriptions of the procedure. \nMaybe they have even watched us debate the issue on prior occasions. I \nwill not go through the details of the procedure. I will only say that \nat a minimum it is cruel and inhumane, and when this debate is \ncompleted, I hope that the Senate will take a stand and ban a procedure \nthat diminishes the life of a child that has been born and has exited \nthe uterus.\n  This debate today is about protecting a fetus, a baby, a life that is \nnow destroyed in a cruel and inhumane way. It is about a life that is \nunnecessarily destroyed and it need not happen. We are not really \ntalking about banning abortion here, we are talking about banning a \nform of infanticide and it is for this reason that I will gladly vote \nin favor of the ``Partial Birth Abortion Act of 2003.''\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, today is a glorious day. Today is the \nday that we finally send the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act to the \nPresident for his signature, and we can now begin to save human lives. \nToday's vote is only marred by the fact that it took us so long to get \nhere. Just imagine the number of lives we could have saved if we had \nsent this bill to the President 8 months ago, when we first passed it.\n  The subject of partial-birth abortion is not a new one for me. Eight \nyears ago, when I was Governor of Ohio, we were the first State to pass \na partial-birth abortion ban, which was unfortunately struck down by \nthe courts. Subsequent to that, I watched the partial birth abortion \nban make its way through the 104th and 105th Congresses, only to be \nvetoed by President Clinton. After I arrived in the Senate in the 106th \nCongress, I gave a speech in support of a partial birth abortion ban \nthat passed both chambers but never made it to Conference. I am \noverjoyed that we finally got this done in the 108th Congress!\n  During debate on this bill, I listened to my colleagues quote \nstatistics and spout off facts about medical necessity and the health \nof the mother. Well, we can all quote different statistics, but the \nbottom line is that there is no need for this procedure. Most of these \npartial birth abortions are elective. They take 3 days to complete and \nare never medically necessary.\n  The victims of the partial-birth abortions are human beings. I find \nit interesting that they are sometimes called living fetuses. Whether \nthey are called babies or fetuses, no one seems to dispute the fact \nthat they are living. In fact, they are human babies and they can feel \npain.\n  I would like to thank all of my colleagues who voted for this very \nimportant legislation. We can certainly be proud of what we have \naccomplished today!\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, today I come to the floor with joy in \nmy heart knowing we will finally put an end to the death of unborn \nchildren through partial-birth abortions. I am joyful that our efforts \nwill not go in vain this year because President Bush is eager to sign \nthis bill.\n  But my heart is also heavy knowing that this procedure has gone on \ntoo long. Too many children have died in this horrific way. The vast \nmajority of Congress has been trying for the better part of a decade to \nban partial-birth abortions but has been stymied by President Clinton \nand the current minority party in the Senate. I am glad the days of \nobstruction and vetoes have come to an end and this bill will become \nlaw.\n  I can think of no more clear-cut case between right and wrong. All \none needs to know is a description of the process to understand how \nwrong partial-birth abortions are. First, an abortionist induces \ndilation of the mother so the baby can be almost fully delivered. Next, \nthe baby is delivered to the point that only its head remains inside \nthe mother. Third, the child is stabbed in the back of the skull with \nscissors or some other sharp object. Finally, a tube is used to suck \nthe child's brains out of the hole left by the stabbing.\n  There is no gray area or middle ground when it comes to this \nprocedure and there are no justifications for it. The child is \ndelivered to within inches of breathing its first breath. If the doctor \nlets the head of the baby slip just an inch or two, the child would be \nborn and the doctor would be prosecuted for murder. Nevertheless, some \nabortion supporters cannot see through the fog of their fervor to \nrealize just how wrong that is.\n  I do not mean to suggest that there is widespread support for \npartial-birth abortions. There is not. The vast majority of the \nAmerican people want the procedure to end. Congress has voted \noverwhelmingly many times in the last few years to enact a ban like the \none before the Senate today. Most doctors oppose the procedure \nincluding quite a few who perform other forms of abortion.\n  There is no evidence that this procedure is ever necessary to \npreserve the health of the mother. In fact, it is quite dangerous. \nBabies being killed in this manner can feel the pain of its skull being \npierced and have been seen\n\n[[Page S12945]]\n\nwrithing in pain, flailing tiny arms and legs until its skull collapses \nafter its brains have been vacuumed out. I do not understand how anyone \ncan believe this should go on.\n  Doctors and medical researchers have made great progress in fetal \nhealth care. Babies can be operated on while still in the womb. \nPremature babies can survive outside their mother at younger and \nyounger ages. With those and other advancements Americans are \ncontinually placing a greater value of life. By passing this law \nCongress will further advance the cause of life and send an \nunmistakable message that ours is a just society that values every \nhuman being and believes in the sanctity of life.\n  I look forward to President Bush signing this bill into law. I am \nproud of his support of this bill and for life.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, as I am sure all of my colleagues know \nby now, the procedure banned by this bill--the partial-birth abortion \nprocedure--defies description. I am not going to go into the terrible \ndetails of this procedure which is performed on a living child late in \npregnancy.\n  This is a truly shocking procedure--absolutely indefensible. The term \n``partial-birth'' is perfectly accurate. Some prominent defenders of \npartial-birth abortions insist that anesthesia kills the babies before \nthey are removed from the womb. This myth has been refuted by \nprofessional societies of anesthesiologists. In reality, the babies are \nalive and experience great pain when subjected to a partial-birth \nabortion.\n  It has been asserted that this procedure is the only way to prevent \nserious health damage. However, partial-birth abortions are performed \nthousands of times annually on healthy babies of healthy mothers.\n  Hundreds of ob-gyns and fetal/maternal specialists, along with former \nSurgeon General Koop have come forward to unequivocally state that \n``partial-birth abortion is never medically necessary to protect \nanother's health or her future fertility.'' Thus, the first section of \nS. 3 contains Congress' factual findings that, based upon extensive \nmedical evidence compiled during congressional hearings, a partial-\nbirth abortion is never necessary to preserve the health of a woman.\n  In January 2003, even the Alan Guttmacher Institute--an affiliate of \nPlanned Parenthood--published a survey of abortion providers that \nestimated that 2,200 abortions were performed by the method in the year \n2000. While that figure is surely low, it is more than triple the \nnumber that AGI estimated in its most recent previous survey, for 1996.\n  The stark fact is that unless this bill becomes law, more innocent \nunborn children will have their lives brutally ended by the inhumane \npartial-birth procedure.\n  It is unbelievable to me that this unspeakable abortion procedure \neven exists in this country, much less that we are having to take \nlegislative action to ban such a procedure. It is further unbelievable \nto me that anyone in good conscience can even defend the partial-birth \nabortion procedure. It is a fiction to believe that it is all right to \nend the life of a baby whose body, except the head, is fully delivered. \nIn order to engage in such a fiction, one has to take the position that \ncurling fingers and kicking legs have no life in them. Those who \nsubscribe to such a fiction, are at best, terribly misguided.\n  As Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop stated: ``. . . in no way \ncan I twist my mind to see that the late-term abortion as described--\nyou know, partial birth and then destruction of the unborn child before \nthe head is born--is a medical necessity for the mother. It certainly \ncan't be a necessity for the baby.'' American Medical News, August 19, \n1996.\n  Now it is time for the Senate to approve a ban on partial-birth \nabortions. It is time to end this injustice and the practice of this \ninhumane procedure. I urge my colleagues to join me in ending this \natrocity.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I rise today in support of the conference \nreport to the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. I am pleased to be a \ncosponsor of this legislation, and I look forward to the day when \npartial-birth abortion is banned once and for all.\n  Medical experts agree, partial-birth abortion is not good medicine. \nThe Physicians Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth, PHACT, a group of over 500 \ndoctors, mostly specialists in OB/GYN, maternal and fetal medicine, and \npediatrics, have stated that partial-birth abortion is never medically \nnecessary to protect a woman's health or her fertility. In fact, the \nexact opposite is true; the procedure can pose a significant threat to \nboth the pregnant woman's health and her fertility.\n  Today we move one step closer to putting an end to this brutal \nprocedure. One of life's greatest gifts is our children, and we cannot \nallow them to be victims of this heinous and cruel procedure.\n  I have cosponsored this legislation in the past three Congresses, and \nI am a cosponsor of the bill before us today. I am pleased to rise once \nagain in support of protecting human life. I hope that Congress will \ndeliver this bill to the President, who is eager to sign this bill into \nlaw.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise today in support of the Roe v. \nWade decision that was made by the Supreme Court over 30 years ago, and \nin opposition to the late term abortion conference report before the \nSenate.\n  The Supreme Court's acknowledgement of the fundamental ``right to \nprivacy'' in our Constitution gave every woman the right to decide what \nto do with her own body. Since that historic day, women all across the \ncountry and the world have had improved access to reproductive health \ncare and services. However, Congress is on the brink of turning back \nthe clock.\n  Last month, my colleague from California, Senator Boxer, led a fight \non the Senate floor to keep Senate passed language in support of Roe v. \nWade in the late term abortion bill, S. 3. I was disheartened to hear \nthat the conference committee stripped the Senate passed Roe v. Wade \nlanguage. The Roe v. Wade decision is important to women's rights, \nwomen's health, and public health.\n  I believe that this bill is the first step in a plan by the \nleadership of this Congress to overturn Roe v. Wade. When President \nBush signs this bill, he will become the first President since Roe V. \nWade to recriminalize abortion procedures.\n  As I have stated previously on the Senate floor, the bill before us \nis unconstitutional. Just 3 years ago the Supreme Court ruled in \nStenberg v. Carhart that a Nebraska State law that bans certain \nabortion procedures is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court ruled it was \nunconstitutional for two reasons. First, it did not include an \nexception for a woman's health. Second, it does not clearly define the \nprocedure it aims to prohibit and would ban other procedures, sometimes \nused early in pregnancy.\n  S. 3 is nearly identical to the Nebraska law the Supreme Court struck \ndown. The proponents of this legislation say they have made changes to \nthe bill to address the Supreme Court's ruling. They have not. It still \ndoes not include an exception to protect the health of the woman. It \nstill does not clearly define the procedure it claims to prohibit. Let \nme be clear about this. S. 3 is unconstitutional. That is why I \nsupported the Durbin substitute when the Senate considered this \nlegislation.\n  I supported the Durbin amendment because it was consistent with my \nfour principles. These are my principles: It respects the \nconstitutional underpinnings of Roe v. Wade. It prohibits all post-\nviability abortions, regardless of the procedure used. It provides an \nexception for the life and health of a woman, which is both \nintellectually rigorous and compassionate. And it leaves medical \ndecisions in the hands of physicians--not politicians. The Durbin \nalternative addressed this difficult issue with the intellectual rigor \nand seriousness of purpose it deserves.\n  I strongly support a woman's right to choose and have fought to \nimprove women's health during the more than two decades I have served \nin Congress. Whether it is establishing offices of women's health, \nfighting for coverage of contraceptives, or requiring federal quality \nstandards for mammography, I will continue the fight to improve women's \nhealth.\n  Congress must protect a woman's freedom of choice that was handed \ndown by the Supreme Court over 30 years ago. This Congress must not \nturn back the clock on reproductive choice for women. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against the conference report for the late term \nabortion bill.\n\n[[Page S12946]]\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, today the Senate considers \nthe conference report to accompany S. 3, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban \nAct, and I want to take this opportunity to explain my vote. I am \nopposed to the procedure known as partial-birth abortion, except in \ncases where the life or physical health of the mother is in jeopardy. \nThis legislation does not include an exception to provide for the \nphysical health. That means that a physician could determine that a \nwoman could be paralyzed for life, and it would not be considered an \nadequate exception under this legislation. Therefore, I must \nrespectfully vote against this bill.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record)\n Mr. EDWARDS. Madam President, I rise today to express my \nopposition to the conference report to accompany S. 3, the late term \nabortion ban bill.\n  As we know, the Supreme Court has ruled on this issue. The Court said \nthat a ban on later-term abortion procedures must protect a woman's \nhealth. In Stenberg V. Carhart, the Court ruled that an abortion ban \nmust include a health exception when ``necessary, in appropriate \nmedical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the \nmother.''\n  The bill before us today does not include an exception for a woman's \nhealth. If this bill becomes law, a woman would be refused this \nprocedure even if other procedures would cause her grave harm. While \nlate-term abortions should occur only in rare circumstances, this bill \nbans them in all circumstances. That is not constitutional and it is \nnot fair to the women who are in the rare circumstances where this \nprocedure is required. For this reason, I cannot support this \nbill.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, earlier this year, the Senate passed \nS. 3, the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act. I opposed that bill and \ninstead supported a constitutionally sound alternative offered by my \ncolleague, Senator Durbin. The Durbin alternative would ban post \nviability abortions unless the woman's life is at risk or the procedure \nis necessary to protect the woman from grievous injury to her physical \nhealth.\n  I understand that people on all sides of this issue hold sincere \nviews. I respect those who oppose abortion on principle. Like most \nAmericans, I would prefer to live in a world where abortion is \nunnecessary. I support efforts to reduce the number of abortions \nthrough family planning and counseling to avoid unintended pregnancies. \nI have always believed that decisions in this area are best handled by \nthe individuals involved, in consultation with their doctors and guided \nby their own beliefs and unique circumstances, rather than by \ngovernment mandates.\n  I support Roe v. Wade, which means that I agree that the government \ncan restrict abortions only when there is a compelling state interest \nat stake. I feel very strongly that Congress should seek to regulate \nabortions only within the constitutional parameters set forth by the \nU.S. Supreme Court.\n  Unfortunately, the conference report fails to cure the flaws in the \nbill that make it unconstitutional on its face. The conference report's \ndescription of the procedure that it would ban is so vague and \noverbroad that it could place an undue burden on a women's right to \nchoose by encompassing safe and common abortion procedures used prior \nto viability.\n  I am also disappointed that the conference report failed to adopt the \nSenate's language in S. 3 reaffirming the Senate's commitment to Roe \nand its belief that Roe should not be overturned. The Senate had a \nstraight up-or-down vote on this language, which was offered by my \ncolleague Senator Harkin. A majority of the Senate agreed to support \nthe Harkin amendment. The House was wrong to remove this language \nduring its consideration of the bill, and I am disappointed that the \nconference report failed to adopt the Senate's position on this issue.\n  The Senate should only legislate in this area in a way that is \nconstitutionally sound. This conference report does not meet that test \nand I cannot support it.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam. President, I rise today to express my opposition \nto the conference report to S. 3 the so-called Partial-Birth Abortion \nBan Act of 2003. This is an unconstitutional piece of legislation that \nputs women's lives in jeopardy.\n  Supporters of this bill will argue that this legislation bans only \none procedure but this is not the case. Make no mistake about it. This \nbill puts us on a path outlawing abortion. The language in this bill is \nvague, and this law could be used to ban other safe and legal \nprocedures. Moreover, this legislation imposes an undue burden on a \nwoman's ability to choose by banning abortion procedures at any stage \nin a woman's pregnancy. This bill does not only ban post-viability \nabortions, it unconstitutionally restricts women's rights regardless of \nwhere the woman is in her pregnancy.\n  In 1973, in Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court found that women have a \nconstitutional right to choose. However, after the point of viability--\nthe point at which a baby can live outside its mother's body--States \nmay ban abortions as long as they allow exceptions when a woman's life \nor health is in danger. The bill before us, however, restricts \nabortions before viability and it does not include a health exception. \nLet me repeat that. This bill is fundamentally flawed because it does \nnot protect the women when her health is in danger.\n  In June 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court reinforced the importance of \nthis health exception in Stenberg v. Carhart, which determined that a \nNebraska law banning the performance of so-called ``partial birth'' \nabortions was unconstitutional under Roe v. Wade.\n  The Supreme Court has stated unequivocally that every abortion \nrestriction, including bans on so-called ``partial-birth abortion,'' \nmust contain a health exception. The Court emphasized that, by failing \nto provide a health exception, the Nebraska law would place a woman's \nlife in danger. That is exactly what the legislation before us today \ndoes as well: it places a woman's life in danger.\n  Despite the Supreme Court's very clear mandate, this underlying \nlegislation does not provide an exception for the health of the mother. \nFor this reason, this legislation, like the measure that was struck \ndown in Stenberg, is unconstitutional.\n  I am very disappointed that this conference report does not include \nlanguage passed by the Senate that abortion has been a legal and \nconstitutionally protected medical procedure throughout the United \nStates since the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade; and that the \n1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade established constitutionally \nbased limits on the power of states to restrict the right of a woman to \nchoose to terminate a pregnancy.\n  Furthermore, the amendment firmly laid out the sense of the Senate \nthat the decision of the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade was appropriate \nand secures an important constitutional right and that the decision \nshould not be overturned.\n  I fundamentally believe that private medical decisions should be made \nby women in consultation with their doctors--not politicians. These \ndecisions include the methods by which a physician chooses to treat his \nor her patients. Why should we decide that here on the Senate floor? \nCongressional findings cannot possibly make up for medical consultation \nbetween a patient and her doctor. This bill, however, would undermine a \nphysician's ability to determine the best course of treatment for a \npatient.\n  Physicians must be free to make clinical determinations, in \naccordance with medical standards of care, that best safeguard a \nwoman's life and health. Women and their families, along with their \ndoctors, are simply better than politicians at making decisions about \ntheir medical care. And I don't want to make those decisions for other \nwomen.\n  During the course of this debate we heard painful stories about women \nwho were anxiously awaiting the birth of a child when something went \nhorribly wrong. We heard true stories of women who were devastated when \nthey discovered that their child had severe health problems and would \nnot survive. We heard stories about women who wanted to complete their \npregnancy and were told by their physicians that, should they do so, \nthey would put their health at risk. The truth is that this is a\n\n[[Page S12947]]\n\nheartbreaking, painful, personal decision that should be made by solely \na woman with the advice of her doctor.\n  I trust the health care providers and organizations like the American \nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Medical \nWomen's Association who oppose this ban. These physicians know their \npatients, they know their stories, and the painful choices that many \nmake, and they know that this ban is wrong. Most importantly, I trust \nthe women in my State and around this country to make the decision that \nis right for them. During such a difficult, private time, women should \nbe surrounded by those who love and support them. Women should not have \nto listen to rhetoric that demonizes their heartbreak, but should be \nable to receive medically accurate information from a trusted health \ncare professional.\n  Three States, including my home State of Washington, have considered \nsimilar bans by referendum. All three failed. We considered this debate \nin my home State in 1998. The referendum failed decisively--by a vote \nof 57 to 43 percent.\n  These so-called ``partial-birth'' abortion bans--whether the \nproposals that have been before the Senate in the past or the one \nbefore us today--are deliberately designed to erode the protections of \nRoe v. Wade, at the expense of women's health and at the expense of a \nwoman's right to privacy.\n  The Supreme Court, during the 30 years since it recognized the right \nto choose, has consistently required that, when a State restricts \naccess to abortion, a woman's health must be the absolute \nconsideration. This legislation does not only disavow the Supreme \nCourt's explicit directive, but the advice of the medical community, \nand the will of the American people. We must continue to ensure that \nthe women of America have the right to privacy and receive the best \nmedical attention available.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I understand I have a minute, 51 seconds remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I understand Senator Frist will take some leader time and \nSenator Daschle has given me 4 minutes of his leadership time, so I \nwill speak for about 6 minutes if that is all right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). Without objection, the Senator may \nuse the leader's time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I, too, thank everyone involved in this \ndebate on both sides because I think it has been a very enlightening \ndebate. I have been on the Senate floor about this bill many times. \nThis particular debate brought out so many issues.\n  I also thank the many women who experienced this procedure, who were \nable to come to Washington on many occasions to tell us what their \nworld was like when they found out late in the pregnancy that something \nhad gone horribly wrong and the doctor told them that their baby could \nnever live outside of their womb and the doctor told them if they did \nnot have the procedure that is being banned in this bill, they could \nsuffer a stroke, they could suffer paralysis, they could lose their \nfertility. These women came out and put a face on this issue, a real, \nhuman face; many of them very religious, many anti-choice, who said \nthis was an excruciatingly difficult choice, but they knew it was right \nfor themselves and their baby.\n  What we are about to do today--and I have no illusions; I know this \nbill will pass--we are about to ban a procedure that doctors say is \nneeded to save the life and health of a woman. If I went up to you on \nthe street and I said, I know there is a medical procedure that is \nsometimes necessary to save the life and health of a woman, would you \nwant to ban it or would you be willing to ban it except for those \noccasions when it is necessary. I think and I know most Americans would \ndo the humane thing and say absolutely, we want to make an exception \nfor life and health. That is not what is done in this bill.\n  The doctors tell us this is a dangerous piece of legislation. The \ndoctors tell us this is an unconscionable piece of legislation. The \ndoctors tell us that women's lives and health will be put at risk if we \npass this. I happen to believe, on issues such as these, we have to \nturn to the women themselves who have faced this agonizing decision, \nand to the doctors, the OB/GYMs whose job it is to bring life into the \nworld.\n  Well, when we have done that, they have told us not to go this route, \nthat if we are going to ban the procedure, always to have an exception, \nalways for the life and health of the woman. Yet this Senate is going \nto turn its back on the women of this country, turn its collective back \non the doctors of this country, and basically outlaw a procedure they \nsay is necessary.\n  When the President signs this bill--and he will do so--it will be the \nfirst time in history any President of either party has banned a \nmedical procedure that is necessary to save the life and health of the \npeople of this country. I think that is a historic moment, and I think \nthe people of this country will understand all of the ramifications. \nThere is no question about that.\n  To make it clear, I will reiterate what many of my colleagues who are \npro-choice have said. We believe Roe v. Wade was rightly decided. We \nbelieve it balanced all the interests that were before the Court. We \nbelieve when the Court said, in the very early stages of a pregnancy, \nSenators, Congress people, stay out of this decision, they were right. \nWhen the Court said, in the late stages of a pregnancy, the State can \ncontrol what occurs in an abortion, but always with an exception for \nthe life and health of a woman, we believe that is right.\n  Now the other side tells us: Oh, well, this bill has nothing to do \nwith Roe v. Wade. It does not in any way challenge Roe v. Wade. Well, \nthat is just untrue on its face. The Court has already ruled in the \nNebraska case that when you do not make an exception for health, when \nyou have vague definitions, that is violative of Roe.\n  What we are doing is passing a piece of legislation that will be \nsigned with great fanfare, and it will be declared unconstitutional \nacross the street. Instead, we could have joined hands across party \nlines, we could have joined hands across ideological lines, we could \nhave banned every single late-term abortion with an exception for life \nand health, but the other side refuses to do this--refuses to do this. \nI do not understand how you can stand here and say you are doing the \nright thing by the women in this country and not make an exception to \nprotect the health of a mother.\n  I hope many of us will vote this down. I have no illusions in the \nfinal vote, but it has been an excellent debate. I hope America was \nlistening.\n  I thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I know I just have a few seconds, but \nI do want to recognize the tremendous effort and work the majority \nleader has made over the years on this issue. His presentation, when he \nfirst came to the Senate, as the only physician in the Senate, was \ncompelling, persuasive, and I think one of the things that allowed us \nto get the 60-plus votes we needed to have this bill passed on previous \noccasions and now gives us the margin we have today. He is to share a \nsignificant amount of credit for today's victory.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, on leader time, I will use just a \nremaining few minutes.\n  The partial-birth abortion ban is finally at the finishing line. I \nexpect today the Senate will vote for the last time to end this morally \nreprehensible procedure. We will have a bill on the President's desk, \nand this President will sign the ban into law.\n  As a physician and as a board-certified surgeon, I can say without \nequivocation that partial-birth abortion is brutal, it is barbaric, it \nis morally offensive, and it is outside of the mainstream practice of \nmedicine.\n  Contrary to the claims of its supporters, partial-birth abortion is a \nfringe procedure outside of the mainstream. It is not performed by \npeople who are board-certified surgeons. It is not found in common \nmedical textbooks. It is not taught in our surgical residency programs.\n  The sole purpose of this partial-birth abortion is to deliver a dead \nbaby. It is not, as some insist, to protect the life of the mother. In \nfact, partial-birth\n\n[[Page S12948]]\n\nabortion, as we have heard again and again, is dangerous to the health \nof the mother, more dangerous than other alternatives. We could go on \nand on with these undeniable medical facts in greater detail, but \nsomething larger is at stake, and we speak to that powerfully with this \nvote today.\n  Beyond even the ethical practice of medicine, our Nation's charter, \nthe Declaration of Independence, asserts our Creator has blessed us \nwith certain rights--rights from which we, as beings made in God's \nimage and likeness, cannot be alienated.\n  In destroying the body of a mature, unborn child, we are alienating \nthat child from his or her most essential right; and that is, the right \nto life.\n  In doing so, we are violating the very premise of our Republic--that \nour rights are enduring gifts of God, not privileges to be revoked by \nhuman whim.\n  In Evangelium vitae, Pope John Paul II tells us true human freedom is \nrooted in a ``culture of life.''\n  We will reaffirm in this Chamber that human personhood is precious, \nthat doing no harm is still the bedrock of medical morality, and that \nwe have the will to stop a practice we know is evil and morally \nreprehensible.\n  I yield back the remainder of the time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for 2 minutes from Senator Daschle's leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you.\n  Madam President, I want to reply to what the good Senator has said, \nwith great respect, when he says this procedure is outside the \nmainstream. I want to point out, I respect his opinion, but I think \ndoctors who have gone into OB/GYN, if that is their field--I do not \nbelieve the American College of OB/GYNs--45,000 doctors--are out of the \nmainstream. I do not believe the American Medical Women's Association--\n10,000 female doctors--are outside the mainstream. Nor do I believe the \nAmerican Public Health Association--thousands of doctors--are outside \nthe mainstream.\n  So although I totally respect the opinion of my colleague, and I \nwould fight for his right to have it, and his right to believe what he \ndoes, I think it is a bit dismissive of the mainstream OB/GYN doctors \nin this country, all of whom have told us, please do not pass this ban \nthat they have said is dangerous to women. They have said, to use their \nwords, it is risky to women, and they are very upset about it.\n  I did not want the Senate to believe these organizations back this \nbill, because they do not. We have put those letters into the Record.\n  I thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, obviously we have a strong disagreement \nin the statements that were just made. Let me finally close by saying \nthis is a brutal procedure. It is a barbaric procedure. It offends the \nsensibilities of 90 percent or more of Americans. It is outside of \nmainstream medicine as practiced in the United States of America today.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the conference report. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Texas (Mrs. \nHutchison) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: Is it in order at \nthis point in time for the Senator to speak as in morning business for \nabout 10 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator should seek consent for that \npurpose.\n  Mr. REID. I could not hear the Senator's request. I am sorry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator from Virginia simply asked the parliamentary \nsituation, could I proceed as in morning business for 15 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                       Remarks by Service Members\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, the press have reported comments made by \na general officer, General Boykin, and those remarks have been the \nsubject of considerable concern. They are also regrettably a subject of \ngreat discussion in the Arab press.\n  I also am concerned, and I rise to advise my colleagues and others of \na recommended course of action. I do so by first reading a letter \nsigned by Senator Levin and myself dated last Friday. We wrote this \nletter jointly in the course of the debate on this floor in response to \nthe request by the Commander in Chief, the President, for some $87 \nbillion to support our military and to support our reconstruction \nefforts in Iraq and elsewhere. I was a strong supporter and was happy \nto vote for it. Fortunately, the measure has passed and is now subject \nto the conferees.\n  It is interesting, at the very time that we were passing this \nlegislation, which are taxpayer funds in considerable amounts, the \nobject was to provide freedom and quality of life for the people of \nIraq. The people of Iraq largely follow the Muslim religion in \nteaching, in tenets, and it is dear to their hearts. At the same time, \nthe coverage in the United States is about comments made by a \ndistinguished officer, a man who has shown great personal courage in \nthe profession as a soldier.\n  Nevertheless, there are allegations with regard to these remarks that \nhave been reported in the press. Senator Levin and I felt it was our \nduty, as chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, \nto make a recommendation to the Secretary of Defense.\n  I am about to read that letter we sent on Friday, because I think it \nis a very responsible way to deal with a high-profile situation.\n  Dear Mr. Secretary:\n  Enclosed are copies of articles that have appeared in the press \nrecently about public statements allegedly made in uniform by LTG \nWilliam G. Boykin, U.S. Army, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for \nIntelligence. In matters pertaining to religious beliefs, the practice \nand expression, the Armed Forces have traditionally permitted as much \nlatitude as possible,\n\n[[Page S12949]]\n\nconsistent with the requirement of good order and discipline in the \nmilitary's ability to accomplish its mission. We recognize the right of \nevery American to free speech. However, as is well established, in \npart--I add, part in law--there are limits on the right of expression \nfor service members. Public statements by a senior military official of \nan inflammatory, offensive nature that would denigrate another religion \nand which could be construed as bigotry may easily be exploited by \nenemies of the United States and contribute to an erosion of support \nwithin the Arab world and perhaps--I underline perhaps--increased risk \nfor members of the U.S. Armed Forces serving in Muslim nations. It is \nthe responsibility of the United States Senate to render constitutional \n``advice and consent'' with respect to the officer corps. Implicit in \nthis confirmation process is our judgment that officers, especially \nthose of flag and general rank, are persons possessing sound judgment \nand respect for the rights and beliefs of others. We recommend, \ntherefore, that you refer this matter to the Department of Defense \nInspector General for a thorough review of the facts and a \ndetermination as to whether or not there has been any inappropriate \nbehavior by Lieutenant General Boykin. Please advise the committee of \nthe results of this review.\n\n  I now read from a press account of today, which purportedly carries--\nand I have to rely on the authenticity of the press reports. I have no \nreason to disagree with them--an exchange between Secretary of Defense \nRumsfeld and members of the press corps. The question: Mr. Secretary, \nlast week here you were referring to Lieutenant General Boykin, you and \nGeneral Myers said in effect he has the right to freedom of speech and \nthe freedom of expression and yet, as we all know, we are responsible \nfor what we say. How can you keep a man in a senior position on your \nstaff whose views are so diametrically opposed to those of the \nPresident and to yours? End of question.\n  Response by Secretary Rumsfeld: Let me make several hopefully \nprecisely put sentences on this subject. First of all, I appreciate \nyour question because it correctly indicated that the President's views \nand my views, or the President's views are that this is not a war \nagainst a religion. And all I did, despite the columnists and the press \nreports to the contrary, all I did was precisely state what the \nPresident and what I think are--I am having some difficulty reading \nthis but I just have to literally read it as printed. I have not seen \nGeneral Boykin's comments. I have since seen one of the network tapes \nand it had a lot of very difficult to understand words and subtitles \nwhich I was not able to verify. So I remain inexpert on precisely what \nhe said and I was told he used notes and not text. And so I will stop \nthere.\n  General Boykin has requested an Inspector General review of this \nmatter, and I have indicated if that is his request, I think it \nappropriate.\n  I know that General Pace, who was apparently with the Secretary, has \ntalked to him more recently. You may want to comment as well.\n  General Pace: Yesterday, Jerry and I were just waiting for a meeting \nto begin and he just mentioned to me how sad he was that his comments \nhave caused the furor that they have. There is no doubt in my mind, in \ntalking to him, that if he could pick his words more carefully he \nwould. There is also no doubt in my mind that he does not see this \nbattle as a battle between religions. He sees it as a battle between \ngood and evil. He sees it as the evil being the acts of individuals, \nnot the acts of any religion or affiliation with religion. So clearly, \nin my very short conversation with Jerry, which he instigated, he is \nsad that this is the way that it is, but he is anxious to have the \ninvestigator do the investigator's job.\n  I commend the Secretary of Defense, and I commend General Boykin. I \nthink Senator Levin and I took the proper step. We had the option to \nput this letter into the public domain on Friday, but purposely I said \nto my colleague and to others--by the way, there were a number of \nothers, as Senator Levin and I just discussed, on his side of the aisle \nand on my side of the aisle who expressed concern and asked of us, as \nthe chairman and the ranking member, what we intended to do. Well, we \nmade this recommendation and we purposely withheld it from public \ndelivery, public release, as a consideration to the Secretary, such \nthat he might take it into consideration as he dealt with this \nmatter. I just presume he saw it and that he did take it into \nconsideration. But I think at this point in time, while we have young \nmen and women patrolling the streets in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other \nareas of the world, it is best we try to take this matter, hopefully, \noff the front pages, with the representation to the American public and \nothers that the proper authorities are reviewing it--the Inspector \nGeneral of the Department of Defense, and I anticipate my committee and \nindeed perhaps others here in the Senate will review the matter. But in \nfairness to this distinguished officer, such that he can devote his \nfull time and attention to dealing with this issue, I am recommending--\nnot calling for, not demanding but recommending, having spent some time \nin the Department of Defense myself--that without any prejudice this \nofficer be detailed from his present position, a position that deals \nwith the war on terrorism throughout the world, that he be detailed \nelsewhere temporarily until such time as the Inspector General comes \nback with his report, at which time we can have further deliberations.\n\n  That is in fairness to so many people who are deeply concerned about \nthis issue, and indeed the men and women of the Armed Forces, and \nindeed the integrity of the military itself. When an officer wears that \nuniform and he stands before the people of the United States, or \nwherever he may be, and he makes remarks, people see in that uniform \nthat he has been appointed to that position by the President of the \nUnited States of America and confirmed by the Senate of the United \nStates. In that confirmation process we look at the professional \ncredentials, we examine all the material that comes before us, but \nimplicit in our confirmation by this body, the Senate, pursuant to the \nConstitution, implicit therein is that we feel this individual should \nbe promoted and given the rank to which the President has appointed him \nbecause we have confidence in him that he has good, sound judgment--I \nrepeat that: good, sound judgment--in the exercise of his freedom to \nspeak.\n  That is the question that remains to be answered. He is in a very \nhigh-profile position with global responsibilities on the war on \nterrorism. I think temporarily, without any prejudice whatsoever, \nasking him to take on another assignment until this matter is fully \nexamined and studied and a report made to the Secretary of Defense and \nthe Senate is in the interests of all concerned and indeed this \nofficer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I want to express my appreciation for \nthe thoughtfulness of Senator Warner. He has served his country for \nmany years as a marine, a naval officer, as a Secretary of the Navy, \nand now the Senate chairman of the Armed Services Committee. I know he \ntakes this issue very seriously.\n  I do believe this officer should be entitled to a hearing, have an \ninspector general look at these very delicate matters. When we talk \nabout people's personal religious beliefs as to whether one theology is \nvalid and another one is not, we wouldn't expect a person of the \nIslamic faith to ratify the Christian faith or other faiths to say they \nvalidate the faith of someone else. That is just the way we see things, \nas we deal with matters of personal faith.\n  But I think it is a delicate matter, particularly when a person is in \nuniform. I think going forward with a look at this and some thoughtful \nanalysis as to what would be the right procedure would be appropriate. \nI thank our chairman of the Armed Services Committee for his comments.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague because you formerly served as \nattorney general. You have full comprehension of the importance of \nbeing fair to everyone. This recommendation I have is in the sense of \nfairness. I think it is in the interest of all, and I thank the Senator \nfor his remarks.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think it would be good for all of us to think a bit \nabout the subject and what would be appropriate to ask of an officer in \na church proceeding and whether uniforms make a difference and those \nkinds of things.\n\n[[Page S12950]]\n\n  I was going to speak about the class action reform. Did the Senator \nfrom Illinois have some comments?\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from Alabama would yield for a moment, I \nwould like to address the same issue and then yield back to him to \ndiscuss class action reform.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Would 5 minutes be sufficient? I am pleased to yield to \nthe Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I commend the Senator from Virginia. \nThere are times when he and I have come together and I think good \nthings have happened. I think this may be such a moment. I hope it is. \nI came to the floor to address this issue involving General Boykin, \nfully cognizant of the great contribution which he has made to this \ncountry in his military capacity over many years, risking his life and \nserving our Nation well, but feeling at this moment in time important \nquestions need to be asked and answered about the things he said and \ndid. I believe the Senator from Virginia--I do not want to \nmischaracterize his remarks--has suggested he be detailed to another \nposition while these important questions are asked and considered and \nanswers are brought forward. Am I correct in that conclusion?\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, the Senator is correct, to simply give \nfull and complete opportunity and have him temporarily detailed \nelsewhere. I think until such time as this thing is resolved \nfactually--what did happen, what didn't happen--as the Secretary of \nDefense said, he didn't fully have all the facts at his command at this \npoint in time and was asked a question. Although I must say I have read \npress accounts where the general was trying to explain what he did say, \nyou and I know from experience in public life, when you try to explain \nwhat you tried to say, you need time out to do a little study.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Virginia. I do say that is a \nvery judicious and thoughtful approach. We want to be fair to this man \nwho served his country well, but we also understand his remarks were \nviewed by many in a very negative light at a very critical moment in \nour history. I think what we should ask of everyone in the service of \nour country is what the President has asked, and that is to keep it \nvery clear ours is a war against terrorism and not a war against the \nIslamic faith or people who adhere to it. We could no more expect \nGeneral Boykin to embrace the Islamic faith and its principles than we \nwould expect someone of the Islamic faith to accept Christian \nprinciples or Jewish principles and values. But we can expect every \nmember of our Government to be tolerant and sensitive of other people's \nvalues and principles. I think that is a standard we should all live by \nin public life, whether appointed or elected.\n  I think what the Senator from Virginia has done today is an important \nstep forward. I would say his extraordinary service to this country in \nthe military and as Secretary of the Navy and in the Senate I think \nmeans his recommendation will be understood as a heartfelt \nrecommendation and taken seriously by the administration. I hope they \ndo. I hope they follow his counsel and follow it quickly. The sooner we \ncan defuse this matter the better for all, including the general, and I \nthink the sooner it will be that we can bring some stability and \nperhaps some coherence to our position so we can fight this war on \nterrorism in terms all Americans, including the President, agree with.\n  I thank the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague.\n  Muslims and Christians and people of other faiths all over this world \nare united in this fight against terrorism. We must make it very clear \nof our mutual respect for one another's faith.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senators for their comments. I fail, but I \nattempt to take my faith seriously. I respect followers of the Islamic \nfaith who take their faith seriously, who study the scriptures and act \nin accordance therewith. We may disagree, but we respect one another. \nThat is the way I was raised as an American, to respect one another's \nfaith. I think respect for one another's faith makes me somewhat \nsympathetic to General Boykin, who goes to a church and shares some of \nhis insights and beliefs. But then again he is an officer of the United \nStates and has a position in a time of conflict, in a sensitive period, \nand maybe at one point apparently he may have worn the uniform while he \nmade those remarks.\n  I think it is appropriate for us to take some time out and look at \nthis. I thank the chairman for that.\n  Madam President, we are now to undertake and begin debate on the \nmotion to proceed to the Class Action Fairness bill, S. 1751.\n  Unfortunately, we are seeing a trend in which there are more and more \npieces of legislation that deserve an up-or-down vote being subjected \nto a filibuster and 60-vote procedural hurdles. That is unfortunate. We \nshould proceed with this legislation and discuss it and not be \nobstructive about going forward with it.\n  The Class Action Fairness Act represents modest reform. It is a \nrestrained bill that will address a number of very serious problems \nwith the current status of class action lawsuits such as the plaintiff \nreceiving coupons while trial lawyers pocket millions of dollars in \nfees.\n  This body has a duty to address problems with the legal system. It is \nsomething we are required to do and should not have to overcome 60-vote \nhurdles. I am disappointed we may have to overcome another filibuster \nas we move forward.\n  Obstructionism is always available, but I don't believe there is \nstrong opposition to this bill. There is bipartisan support. If we let \nthe debate go forward and people honestly consider whether it ought to \nbe law or not, we would be willing to accept an up-or-down vote. That \nis a concern I express.\n  The distinguished Senator from Delaware is here. He is very \nthoughtful on these matters. I know he would like to speak for \napproximately 15 minutes. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. I express my thanks to the Senator from Alabama for his \nkind words. I appreciate the opportunity to work with him on these and \nother issues. Tomorrow morning around 11 o'clock, an important vote \nwill occur in the Senate. At the heart of this vote, for me, is to \ndetermine whether or not we go forward, Democrats and Republicans, to \nactually take up and debate the way we allow people who are harmed, \nhurt, or injured--in many cases, by business--to be compensated.\n  Most would agree that if you or I, as individuals, are damaged by the \nactions of another or by the actions of a business, we should be made \nwhole. I believe the same protection should inure to a group of people \nor a class of people who may be harmed or damaged in some way by the \nactions or products of some business.\n  Over time we seem to have lost our sense of balance in the way we \nlitigate class actions. When our Founding Fathers came up with our \nFederal courts, we did not have class actions. We did not have mass \nactions. We did not have private attorneys general actions. We did not \nhave any of that. We had a concern on the part of our Founding Fathers \nthat if a group of people in one State were harmed by a business or \nperson in another State, maybe we ought to have a Federal court system, \nto ensure that the case is not heard by the potentially biased judges \nin the injured party's home state.\n  The trial bar gets a bad rap in a lot of quarters, but I believe they \nplay a very helpful and constructive role in this country. They \nsometimes do not get credit for that. One of the things they do is try \nto make sure, where people are harmed, they get compensated.\n  Our system has lost the right kind of balance. Too often today--not \nalways but too often--we end up debating national class action not in a \nFederal court but in a local court--in some cases, in a court where the \njudges are locally elected and the defendant is placed at a \nreal disadvantage. I will give an example because this does not make \nmuch sense to me.\n\n  Say I were poisoned by food we bought from a fast food restaurant. \nSay I decided to sue. If the amount in dispute were less than $75,000, \nmy case could be heard in State court. If I sue for more than $75,000; \nit would be heard in a Federal court.\n  On the other hand, if thousands of people, or tens of thousands of \npeople,\n\n[[Page S12951]]\n\nbring a class action against that same restaurant for some alleged sin \nthey have committed--and it may involve tens of millions of dollars--it \nmay well end up in a State court, not in a Federal court. That does not \nseem right to me.\n  There has been an effort to try to establish or reestablish the sense \nof balance in these kinds of cases. It started about 5 years ago, in \nthe 105th Congress. Over time, I believe a more thoughtful approach has \nevolved and has led to the introduction of a bill this year, S. 274, \ncalled the Class Action Fairness Act. That bill has gone through \nhearings, I think in the last Congress, and hearings in this Congress. \nIt has been through regular order. The Senate Judiciary Committee has \nhad an opportunity to hold hearings, to debate the bill, to vote on \namendments to the bill and ultimately to report the bill out.\n  There are a number of aspects of the legislation that recommend it to \nme. I am a cosponsor of the legislation, and it enjoys bipartisan \nsupport. Among the original cosponsors are Senator Grassley and Senator \nKohl of Wisconsin. The bill was reported out on a bipartisan vote. More \nRepublicans voted for it than Democrats, but it had some bipartisan \nsupport.\n  I will discuss how the class action system will work in our country \nif this legislation or something akin to it becomes law. First, it is \nnot a perfect bill. I have an amendment or two that I want to offer to \nperfect the legislation. I noticed Senator Lieberman does as well. I \nhave talked to other colleagues, including Senator Landrieu, who have \nideas for amendments they want to offer. It is a work in progress. It \nis one that can be improved and should be improved.\n  In order for us to be able to offer our amendments to the bill to \nperfect and improve it, we have to go through a vote tomorrow at 11 \no'clock on the motion to proceed, which, understandably but \nunfortunately, is opposed by leadership on my side. The fear, the \nconcern, is we will get on to the bill and the opportunity for those \nwho would like to offer amendments may not end up to be realized; the \nopportunity for us to offer amendments, to be fairly heard and vote \nwill not occur. Therefore, they are reluctant to go to the bill without \nsome further assurance.\n  In the end, the only way we know for sure if our amendments are going \nto get a fair hearing, and have the opportunity to be debated and \nadopted, is to go to the bill, to take it up. I hope tomorrow, when we \nvote, that is what we will vote to do.\n\n  Let me talk briefly about how I understand our legal system would \nwork a little differently if this were to become the law of the land.\n  First, the question is, Is this litigation going to be heard in State \ncourt or Federal court? Under the legislation, for a matter to be heard \nin Federal court or for the defendant in the case to be able to argue \nsuccessfully that a case ought to be in Federal court as opposed to a \nState court, there would have to be a certain dollar amount at stake, \nand it would be $5 million. If it is under $5 million, it will be in \nState court.\n  Second is the number of people in the plaintiff class. If you have \nless than 100 people in your plaintiff class, this litigation is going \nto be heard in a State court.\n  Third, if a case is filed in a State court, and the defendant says, \nno, this ought to be in a Federal court, and they go to Federal court \nto try to get it removed to the Federal court, and the Federal court \nsays, no, this remains in the State court, then it goes back to the \nState court. And unless the plaintiffs change the plaintiff class, or \nunless the plaintiffs somehow change their complaint, it is going to \nstay in State court.\n  There are no caps on pain and suffering, no caps on punitive damages, \nno caps on noneconomic damages, no caps on attorney fees. We leave \njoint and several alone.\n  In some States they apparently do not have class actions; they have \nmass actions--a few States such as West Virginia, Mississippi--where \nthey aggregate a number of individual claims. The question is whether \nthose are more properly heard in a Federal court or a State court.\n  I think Senator Specter has negotiated a pretty good compromise in \nthose instances. In some cases, if it were a major incident, such as an \nexplosion or a fire or a catastrophic incident that involves people in \none State, then it would basically be handled in State court; if not, \nit would be in a Federal court.\n  Senator Feinstein had an issue on these private attorneys general \ncases, which apparently you or I could stand up or any citizen can \nstand up and say they represent a group of people on a particular wrong \nthat has been committed. In some cases that is the way they really go \nabout class action. Her amendment was adopted as part of the final \nagreement. If the bill comes to the floor, the private attorneys \ngeneral agreement would be within the purview of State courts, not the \nFederal court.\n  Senator Feinstein also offered I think quite a thoughtful amendment \nand one that addresses a concern raised by the Judicial Conference that \nwe heard discussed earlier. My colleagues will recall the Judicial \nConference is actually headed up by the Chief Justice of the United \nStates, Chief Justice Rehnquist. But they, from time to time, will \nopine on things that are before us and maybe share their opinions with \nus. They suggested, when asked back in March, that there were some real \nconcerns that they had with S. 274, and that it would cause a lot of \ncases that are now heard in State courts to end up flooding the Federal \ncourts. They suggested that we ought to do something about it, that the \nJudiciary Committee ought to do something about it.\n  Well, the Judiciary Committee did something about it. What they did \nis they adopted the Feinstein amendment in their markup back in April. \nThe Feinstein amendment says basically this. It says: The plaintiff \nclass, the people who are bringing the grievance, if two-thirds or more \nare from the same State of the defendant, automatically that case is \nheard in the State court. It says, if fewer than one-third of the \nplaintiff class are from the same State as the defendant, automatically \nit is heard in a Federal court. If the percentage of the plaintiff \nclass is somewhere between one-third and two-thirds who are from the \nsame State as the defendant, then it is up to a Federal judge in that \narea to make the final decision based on criteria. There are five \npieces of criteria spelled out in the bill.\n  So, again, if there are more than two-thirds of the plaintiff class \nin the same State as the defendant, it is a State matter; if fewer than \na third of the plaintiffs from the same State as the defendant, it is \nin the Federal court; and between one-third and two-thirds are from the \nsame State as the defendant, it is kind of a jump ball. The Federal \njudge in the area is asked to make the decision based on the criteria \nspelled out in the bill.\n\n  Interestingly, the Judicial Conference came back after this amendment \nwas adopted and the legislation was about to be reported out and they \nseemed to suggest, in a letter that they sent to the ranking Democrat \non the Judiciary Committee, that their earlier concerns had been \naddressed. I think the Judicial Conference sent a similar letter to the \nfolks in the House of Representatives suggesting the same thing in the \nmonth of May.\n  A concern has been raised, a legitimate concern, about what \npercentage of cases are now going to end up in Federal court as opposed \nto State court under this bill. Some pretty smart people actually took \nthe data from the last 5 years in States where they collected this data \nto look to see--in States such as New York, Massachusetts, Maine, where \ndata is available--what percentage of cases in those States over the \nlast 5 years would have ended up in a Federal court as opposed to a \nState court. Sixty percent or more of the cases in those states in the \nlast 5 years would still have ended up in a State court. I think that \nis a good point to be mindful of.\n  I do not know if any of us going forward could say what the future is \ngoing to be, but we should sure look back over the last 5 years and say \nif this were the law of the land, again, 60 percent or more of the \ncases would have stayed in State court.\n  Let me close with this thought, if I could. Senator Lieberman is \nprepared to offer an amendment, I think a real good amendment, to the \nbill that addresses an issue for Connecticut. It is\n\n[[Page S12952]]\n\nsimilar to an issued raised for Indiana, and similar to an issue I have \nheard raised, I think, for New Mexico.\n  This is the issue that was raised. Let's say in Connecticut you have \na river that has been polluted by a plant that damages people in \nConnecticut under Connecticut law. The plant is in Connecticut but \nowned by a company in another State. Again, the people who are damaged, \nthe plaintiff class, if you will, are in Connecticut. The damage was in \nConnecticut and there are two defendants, one in Connecticut--the plant \nthat did the pollution--and the owner of the plant that is in another \nState.\n  What Senator Lieberman has come forth with and said is, in a case \nsuch as that, it ought to really be in a Connecticut court. I think he \nis right.\n  Senator Lieberman will offer an amendment that says in those cases \nState law should prevail. They should not be moved someplace else. \nState law should prevail. He will offer that amendment if we have the \nopportunity--if we have the opportunity--to actually go to the bill, \ntake it up, and debate it. In order to do that, we have to vote \ntomorrow for the motion to proceed.\n  There is a real test that is going to take place here. If we actually \nvote for the motion to proceed and go to the bill, there is a burden of \nproof that rests on our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. They \nneed to act in good faith. We need to actually have the opportunity to \noffer our amendments. We need to have the opportunity for a fair and \nopen debate on reasonable perfecting amendments. If we do, then I think \nit may act as a confidence builder and maybe establish a measure of \ntrust around here where, frankly, there is not too much. On the other \nhand, if our Republican colleagues take a different course and seek to \ncut off debate and reasonable amendments and not support reasonable \namendments, perfecting amendments, then that sends a different message.\n  I think there is more at stake for this body than just whether or not \nwe are going to take up a class action bill. There is a whole lot more \nat stake. My hope is tomorrow, when we vote, if we vote to proceed, \nthat our colleagues on the other side will keep that in mind and that \ntheir actions in the days or week or so ahead will reflect as much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the \nClass Action Fairness Act, a bill to stop unfair and abusive class \naction settlements that ignore the best interests of injured \nplaintiffs. It tickles the cockles of my heart that this is the first \ntime I can recall that my colleague from the State of Delaware and I \nhave spoken out on the same position on a bill before the Senate. \nSenator Carper and I have worked together for many years in the \nNational Governors Association. We have been looking for an opportunity \nto collaborate and support legislation on the floor of the Senate. It \nis a particular pleasure for me to follow the Senator from Delaware. We \nboth believe this is good legislation for the people in our districts \nand for our country.\n  This legislation is sorely needed to help people understand their \nrights in class action lawsuits and protect them from unfair \nsettlements. It is also needed to reform the class action process which \nhas been so manipulated in recent years that U.S. companies are being \ndriven into bankruptcy to escape a rising tide of frivolous lawsuits \nand has resulted in the loss of countless numbers of jobs, especially \nin the manufacturing sector.\n  I believe that for the system to work, we must strike a delicate \nbalance between the rights of the aggrieved parties to bring lawsuits \nand the rights of society to be protected against frivolous lawsuits \nand outrageous judgments that are disproportionate to compensating the \ninjured and made at the expense of society as a whole. I believe that \nis what this legislation does, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of it.\n  Since my days as Governor of Ohio, I have been very concerned with \nwhat I call the ``litigation tornado'' that has been sweeping through \nthe economy of my State and throughout the United States. Ohio's civil \njustice system is in a state of crisis. Ohio doctors are leaving the \nState, and too many have stopped delivering babies because they cannot \nafford liability insurance. Ohio businesses are going bankrupt as a \nresult of runaway asbestos litigation. Today, one of my fellow Ohioans \ncan be a plaintiff in a class action lawsuit that she doesn't even know \nabout that is taking place in a State she has never visited.\n  In 1996, as Governor of Ohio, I was proud to sign H.B. 350, strong \ntort reform legislation that became law in Ohio for a while. It might \nhave helped today's liability crisis, but it never got a chance. In \n1999, the Supreme Court of Ohio, in a politically motivated decision, \nstruck down Ohio's civil justice reform law, even though the only \nplaintiff in the case was the Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers, the \npersonal injury bar's trade group. Their reason for challenging the \nlaw: They claimed their association would lose members and lose money \ndue to the civil justice reform laws that were enacted. That is how \nthey got standing in court. It was an incredible situation that I hope \nwe never see again.\n  While we were frustrated at the State level, I am proud to have \ncontinued my fight for a fair, strong civil justice system in the U.S. \nSenate. To this end, I worked with the American Tort Reform Association \nto produce a study titled ``Lawsuit Abuse in Ohio'' that captured the \nimpact of this rampant litigation on Ohio's economy with a goal of \neducating the public on the issue and sparking change. Can you imagine \nwhat this study found? In Ohio, the litigation crisis costs every \nOhioan $636 per year, and every Ohio family of four $2,500 per year. \nThese are alarming numbers. This study was released on August 8, 2002. \nImagine how these numbers have risen in 1 year. In tough economic \ntimes, families cannot afford to pay over $2,500 to cover other \npeople's litigation costs. Something needs to be done, and the passage \nof this bill will help.\n\n  This legislation is intended to amend the Federal judicial code to \nstreamline and curb abuse of class action lawsuits, a procedural device \nthrough which people with identical claims are permitted to merge them \nand be heard at one time in court. In particular, this legislation \ncontains safeguards that provide for judicial scrutiny of the terms of \nthe class action settlements in order to eliminate unfair and \ndiscriminatory distribution of awards for damages and prevent class \nmembers from suffering a net loss as a result of a court victory.\n  This bill is designed to improve the handling of massive U.S. class \naction lawsuits while preserving the rights of citizens to bring such \nactions. Class action lawsuits have spiraled out of control with the \nthreat of large overreaching verdicts holding corporations hostage for \nyears and years. In fact, America's civil justice system had a direct \ncost in 2001 of $205.4 billion or almost 2.5 percent of GDP. That is a \n14.3-percent jump from the year before, the largest percentage increase \nsince 1986. Thousands of jobs have been impacted by that litigation.\n  I emphasize to my colleagues that this is not a bill to end all class \naction lawsuits. It is a bill to identify those lawsuits with merit and \nto ensure that plaintiffs in legitimate lawsuits are treated fairly \nthrough the litigation process. It is a bill to protect class members \nfrom settlements that give their lawyers millions while they only see \npennies. It is a bill to rectify the fact that over the past decade, \nState court class action filings increased over 1,000 percent. It is a \nbill to fix a broken judicial system.\n  I am a strong supporter of this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Illinois \nwould like to speak on this subject. First, I ask unanimous consent \nthat Senator Voinovich be added as a cosponsor to S. 1751, the Class \nAction Fairness Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask the Senator from Illinois how much time he thinks \nhe might need?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Twenty minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this is an important debate. The average \nperson listening to it may wonder why.\n\n[[Page S12953]]\n\nFirst you have to understand what a class action lawsuit is. I will try \nto define it in the simplest of terms. It is when not just one person \nbut a group of people believe that they have been wronged, either \nfinancially or otherwise, and go to court and bring a lawsuit against a \ncorporation, for example. So you have a large group of plaintiffs \nbringing the lawsuit, usually suing one defendant, a corporation. And \noftentimes, this large group of people who have been harmed don't live \nin the same State. They may be from across the Nation. And so they have \nto decide where they are going to file the lawsuit. And that is what \nthis comes down to.\n  You say to yourself: Why is it so important to understand where you \nare going to file a lawsuit? Well, when I explain it from my point of \nview, perhaps you will understand why so much time and so much lobbying \nis going on behind this whole question about where you can file your \nlawsuit.\n  First understand this: In my State of Illinois and virtually every \nother State in the Union, if you are a business and you want to do \nbusiness in Tennessee or Illinois or Alabama or South Carolina, you \ncan't just start up your business. The laws of your State will require \nyou to register in that State that you are going to do business in. In \nmy State of Illinois you register so they know you are there, who you \nare, what your home headquarters happens to be, and where it is \nlocated. Then you also have to do something in my State and most other \nStates: You have to say where you can be served process. In other \nwords, if you are sued by someone in the State of Illinois, and you are \na registered corporation, you have already told the State of Illinois \nwhere they can find you.\n  Why is that? Because the understanding is, if you want to have the \nadvantage of selling your product in Illinois to Illinois citizens, you \nalso have to submit yourself to the jurisdiction of Illinois law. That \nlaw will govern your business in the State of Illinois.\n  It is very basic. If, in fact, someone believes that your product is \ndefective, or you have done something wrong, they have to know where to \nfind you. You don't want a situation where the corporation is \nunidentifiable, unapproachable. So every company--major companies in \nparticular--understands the rules. If you want to do business in \nIllinois, you submit yourself to the jurisdiction of Illinois law.\n  Now let's go back to the earlier example. This group of plaintiffs, \nthis class, decides they are going to sue XYZ Corporation for something \nwrong. Where will they sue them? The corporation has already said, by \nvirtue of doing business in Illinois, that we are prepared to be served \nprocess. We are prepared to submit ourselves to Illinois laws. We are \nprepared to go before Illinois courts. That is a pretty simple outcome. \nIf you do your business in Illinois, you submit to that jurisdiction. \nYou submit to those courts. And if people want to sue you, they know \nexactly where to find you to bring you into an Illinois court and let \nthe court decide whether the plaintiff recovers or doesn't recover.\n  Now, that is the simplest explanation of jurisdiction that I can \nremember from law school so many years ago and how it applies to \nStates. In Federal courts it is a little different. If you have a \ndefendant from one State and a plaintiff from another State, if you \nhave a certain amount in controversy--I think it is $75,000--you have \ndiversity of jurisdiction, so you can go into the Federal courts.\n  In this case, this whole bill is about in which court you can file a \nclass action lawsuit. You say to yourself, why does it make any \ndifference if you are going to go into a State court in Illinois or \ninto the Federal court in Illinois for your class action lawsuit? Why \nwould it make any difference? The substantive law is supposed to be the \nsame Illinois law. Why do you want to go to Federal court?\n  Therein lies the reason for the bill. The people who are pushing this \nlegislation understand that Federal courts are more conservative, less \nlikely to let people have a lawsuit, to certify a class. When it comes \nto liability, Federal courts are more restrictive in liability than \nState courts.\n  Don't take my word for that. I will tell you about several cases. \nThis one is Birchler v. Gehl. Federal law discourages Federal judges \nfrom providing remedies for violation of State law. The Seventh \nCircuit--where Illinois sits--stated:\n\n       When we are faced with opposing plausible interpretations \n     of State law, we generally choose the narrower interpretation \n     which restricts liability, rather than the more expansive \n     interpretation which creates substantially more liability.\n\n  That was a 1996 case. Go to Federal court and it is less likely your \nclass will be certified and you will receive any damages.\n  Another case is Accord Werwinski v. Ford Motor Company, a 2002 case. \nA class action was brought by purchasers of Ford vehicles. The cars \nFord sold had defective transmissions that cracked prematurely and \ninadequately lubricated gears that caused numerous car failures such as \nsudden acceleration or shifts into reverse. Plaintiffs who bought the \ncars presented evidence that Ford knew about this defect long before it \nwas corrected but continued selling the cars. The case was originally \nfiled in State court, but Ford Motor Company removed it to Federal \ncourt which dismissed the claims of the people who bought the Fords. In \naffirming the court's decision to dismiss the class action, the Third \nCircuit stated that when faced with two competing interpretations of \nState law, a Federal court ``should opt for the interpretation that \nrestricts liability, rather than expands it. . . .''\n  Those are two cases in the Federal law that explain why we are here \ntoday. The idea is to move the cases out of State court in the hopes \nthat the defendant corporation that has been sued will have the case \ndismissed or, if there are damages, they will be reduced. It is not a \nquestion of whether they are liable or guilty; it is a question of \nwhere they are going to get the best deal.\n  So the bill before us is an effort on behalf of the corporation \ndefendants across America to push these cases into the Federal court. \nSo for all the good reasons given for this class action reform, the \nreal reason is that defendant corporations don't want to be held \nresponsible for their misconduct. If held responsible, they want to pay \nless money. That is what it comes down to. That is what this is all \nabout. They want to protect themselves and limit their liability.\n\n  Under current law, Federal diversity jurisdiction for a class action \ndoesn't exist unless every member of the class is a citizen of a \ndifferent State from every defendant, and every member of the class is \nseeking damages in excess of $75,000.\n  This bill would create a ``minimal diversity'' standard in two ways. \nIn other words, you can get into Federal court. First, the amount-in-\ncontroversy requirement is met if the total amount of the damages at \nstake exceeds $5 million, notwithstanding the amount of damage suffered \nby each individual plaintiff.\n  Second, diversity can be achieved one of three ways: any member of a \nclass of plaintiffs is a citizen of a State different from any \ndefendant; two, any member of a class of plaintiffs is a foreign state \nor a citizen or a subject of a foreign state and any defendant is a \ncitizen of a State; three, any member of a class of plaintiffs is a \ncitizen of a State and any defendant is a foreign state or a citizen or \nsubject of a foreign state.\n  This is what it gets down to. We are trying to find, through this \nbill, ways to move more cases into Federal court. So what does the \nFederal court system think of this idea?\n  Well, the man who is at the top of the Federal court system, Chief \nJustice William Rehnquist, in a rare, rare occurrence, sent a letter to \nCongress saying: Don't do this; don't push these cases into Federal \ncourt. We don't have the expertise, the judges, or the time to consider \nthe class action cases coming out of State courts into Federal court. \nIt is understandable.\n  The Federal court's first responsibility is in criminal cases, such \nas on the war on terrorism, and all the concerns we have about criminal \nprocedure and criminal prosecution. That is their first responsibility.\n  Then they have their own civil docket, where you have individuals \nsuing one another, and companies suing one another. Chief Justice \nRehnquist says: Do me no favors, U.S. Senate; don't push all these \nclass action cases into the Federal courts; we cannot handle them.\n\n[[Page S12954]]\n\n  You would think, would you not, that some of the Members of the \nSenate, when coaxed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court not to \npush all these cases into Federal court, might stop. But they will not. \nThe reason they are pushing this bill is they have their eye on the \nprize. The prize is that the corporate defendants found guilty and \nliable want to be protected from liability or want their liability \nreduced. They don't care what the Chief Justice has to say. They \ncertainly don't care what the consumers have to say.\n  I have some examples of class action cases so you can understand for \na minute why these cases should be of concern to everybody. These are \nnot cases that involve large corporations alone; they involve a lot of \nordinary citizens.\n  To give you an example, do you remember the Jack-in-the-Box \nrestaurant scandal a few years back? In that scandal, it was found that \nJack-in-the-Box restaurants were selling products which had been \nundercooked and, because of this, they were adulterated, dangerous, and \nthere were children dying as a result. So a class action lawsuit was \nbrought against the company that owned Jack-in-the-Box, Foodmaker, \nInc., on behalf of some 500 victims--mainly children who had been to \nJack-in-the-Box and got sick. Those 500 victims came together to hold \nJack-in-the-Box, a Washington State corporation, liable. The court \ndecided, yes, it should be held liable to the tune of $14 million for \n500 plaintiffs.\n\n  Now, what this bill tries to do is to move that case out of the State \ncourt in Washington and into a Federal court so the amount of the \nverdict--if there was one--would be considerably less. That is good for \nthe bottom line of that corporation. Is it fair to the families who \nwent to the Jack-in-the-Box restaurants in States across America and \nthought they were going to get a wholesome product, safe for their \nchildren to eat, and then the parents watched their children die from \nE. coli, and not have their day in State court, where Jack-in-the-Box \nsaid they were submitting to the jurisdiction? I don't think so.\n  There was a class action lawsuit in California against Beech-Nut \nCorporation and its parent company, Nestle. They were guilty of selling \nsomething they called apple juice which, after being examined, turned \nout to be nothing more than sugar water. Parents were buying what they \nthought was nutritious apple juice for their infants, and the company \nwas selling them fraudulently a product marked apple juice but was \nliterally sugar water and a little coloration. Blame went back and \nforth between companies and suppliers, and the court ultimately decided \nthese two companies, Beech-Nut and Nestle, were liable to the tune of \n$3.5 million to be reimbursed to consumers across America.\n  What companies such as Nestle are trying to do with this bill is \nreduce their liability and make it even more difficult for parents, \neach of which may have been out only $10 or $20, but each had given a \nproduct to their children that was misrepresented and fraudulently \nlabeled. This is designed to help those powerful special interest \ngroups and corporations at the expense of consumers such as those \nparents whose children were receiving this adulterated product.\n  Ford Motor Company had a class action to replace defective ignition \nsystems in millions of cars that stalled often on the highways.\n  Mobil Corporation entered into a $14 million settlement agreement in \na class action suit because a fire at a refinery in New Orleans \nresulted in sending volatile and hazardous compounds into the air and \nit caused great health damage to the people living around them.\n  Blue Cross and Blue Shield paid a $14.6 million settlement in a class \naction suit because they fraudulently billed individuals and failed to \npass on savings to consumers. They ended up paying for it.\n  American Airlines breached a contract with frequent fliers when it \nretroactively changed rules for redeeming mileage awards.\n  The point is that each and every one of these lawsuits, for each \nplaintiff, may seem small. But compounded, they represent a large \namount of liability for the corporation and they represent, in fact, a \nlarge number of people, each with a small recovery.\n\n  Frankly, I think there are things we can and should do to make class \naction suits better in this country. John Breaux of Louisiana, who has \nbeen a friend of business and has worked with them over the years, has \na good substitute bill. Many who have called me from the business \ncommunity say I urge you, for goodness' sake, to take a look at the \nBreaux substitute. It is a sensible bill. It will clean up some of the \nworst abuses in class action lawsuits. But it is not going to get into \nthis game-playing that is suggested in this bill that allows defendant \ncorporations to literally pick the Federal court they want to go into \nin the hopes they will have reduced liability or no liability. That is \nwhat it comes down to.\n  I think this debate before us is a lot more important than some lead \nto believe. Some suggest we are merely modifying and reforming tort law \nin America. It is much more. It is a question of whether the courthouse \ndoor is open for the average citizen. It is a question of whether those \npeople, wronged by giant corporations, have an opportunity for a day in \ncourt. Those who back this bill want to close that courthouse door and \nmake it difficult to open. They want these plaintiffs to end up in a \nFederal court where they are less likely to succeed, and if they do \nsucceed, they will have less in compensation. That to me is unjust and \nthat is the reason we should oppose this legislation.\n  I hope my colleagues will think long and hard before they sign on to \nthis bill thinking it has no impact. It has a great impact on a lot of \ninnocent people who deserve a day in court. Justice is at stake here. I \nurge my colleagues not to accept the easy argument that this is a \nsimple reform. It goes to the heart of justice in this country, and it \ndoes not affect the real abuses in the system which I believe the \nBreaux bill does.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to make one thing crystal clear: \nI am not here to provide any unfair benefit to any corporation or any \ndefendant. We want fairness and justice in the legal system. But in a \nmajor class action case, under the current state of the law, a \nplaintiff lawyer who represents perhaps potential plaintiffs all over \nAmerica--let's say it is a national case--can virtually choose any \ncounty in America to file the lawsuit. He can choose some counties that \nhave only one judge, and perhaps he knows precisely what that judge \nthinks about plaintiff lawsuits. Or maybe he thinks that county has a \nmost favorable jury.\n  Let me state what the Constitution says about it. Sure, a corporation \nhas to register to do business in a State, but the Constitution, in \narticle III, section 2 of the courts' power says this:\n\n       The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and \n     Equity . . . between Citizens of different States. . . .\n\n  And corporations are considered domiciled in that place of domicile. \nFundamentally, what has happened over the years is we have eroded the \nconstitutional protection of diversity by rulings that allow plaintiffs \nto sue not only the foreign corporation from another State, but to sue \nsome entity also as a defendant in that State, and the courts have \nconcluded you have to have total diversity before you can remove it to \nFederal court. That has been a problem, allowing the real payor, the \nreal target to be subject to jurisdiction in virtually any county in \nthe country.\n  I am not here for any injustice. I think we have a pattern of \ninjustice going on in class action lawsuits. We can make them better. \nThey would be better in a more objective tribunal of Federal court \nwhere judges have lifetime appointments. They are not so tied to the \nplaintiff lawyer who may go to church with them or have contributed to \ntheir campaign or the jurors might not be buddies with some of the \nfolks, and you have a more objective court. That is just a fact. That \nis why the Founding Fathers said what they said.\n  In sports we talk about home cooking. I know the hometown the \nPresiding Officer is from in Tennessee. It is such a wonderful place. \nIt would treat foreigners just as fairly as local people, but most \ncommunities tend to favor the local guy from somebody\n\n[[Page S12955]]\n\nfrom out of town. That is why we have it set up so Federal judges hear \nthese cases and give a little more objectivity, although the judge is \nfrom the local community, at least from the State, and the jurors are \nfrom the region. That is what we are about.\n  This bill would also fix some other situations. It would eliminate \nthe coupon settlements. It would eliminate class notices that cannot be \nunderstood. The letter goes out to all the class members in language so \ncomplex nobody can understand. It eliminates negative awards. We have \nactually had cases in which the so-called plaintiffs, not even knowing \nthey are plaintiffs, get a bill for attorneys fees and costs. It would \nprotect against high awards for one group because they are from one \narea of the country, and it would eliminate the payment of bounties for \nlawsuits and help knock down some of the blackmail that has been going \non: Filing these huge lawsuits costing so much money and embarrassing a \ndefendant so they feel forced to pay rather than litigate for years at \na very high cost.\n  Mr. President, those are the remarks I wish to make at this time. I \nwill have some more later. I see the distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina is here, Senator Graham, who is an experienced litigator in \nhis own right. I know he wants to speak on this subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I will be brief. I wish \nto speak about class actions and echo what my friend from Alabama said. \nI have tried very hard during my time being a legislator at the State \nand Federal level to make sure when legal reform is accomplished it is \ndone so in a balanced way.\n  I am not a big fan--I think many of my colleagues know this--of the \nFederal Government taking over State legal systems. If you can do it at \nhome, it is better to do it at home. I am not a big fan of deciding \nwhat is fair before the jury meets. We have honest differences on some \nof those issues.\n  Having said all that, there is a huge need for legal reform. I cannot \ntell you one system in America that really doesn't need to be reformed, \nthe legal system included. My friend from Alabama is absolutely right. \nWhat we are trying to do today is correct an abuse. The Constitution, \nas he read to us, envisioned a dynamic where we would have two people \nfrom different States and we would not want to put one person in the \nother person's backyard. The Constitution has survived so long and so \nwell, and it spoke to that and said: Let's take that into Federal \ncourt, a neutral side.\n  As the diversity clause of the Constitution has been interpreted, it \nrequires complete diversity of all plaintiffs and all defendants. About \n100 years later, maybe 200 years later--I don't know when class action \nlawsuits came into being--there is another way of suing people. It has \nits place in our society to bring a bunch of people affected by a \nsimilar event in different places to try as a unit rather than doing \nhundreds or thousands of individual cases. But this class action \nconcept flies in the face of why the Constitution speaks about \ndiversity.\n  My friend from Alabama is exactly right. It is being abused. We have \na situation where you may have many plaintiffs throughout the country \nwith a single defendant, and it allows people to go into an area that \nis equivalent to home cooking. It really destroys the purpose of the \ndiversity provisions in the Constitution. What we are trying to do is \ncorrect that. There are no damage limitations. There are no limitations \non anybody making a claim at all. If you buy the idea this is unfair, \nthen you buy the idea that the Federal court is unfair; that you can't \nget a good hearing by a Federal judge. I think that is absolutely \nwrong.\n  Justice Rehnquist has a problem on his hands. He has a lot of cases. \nHe has a lot of overworked judges, and I am going to get to that in a \nminute. I have a way to help Justice Rehnquist. There are a bunch of \npeople who need to help him, and I will talk about that in a moment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Yes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Is the Senator aware that the letter I believe the \nSenator from Illinois was referring to is actually a letter from the \nJudicial Conference, not from the Chief Justice and, in fact, they have \nwritten another letter on March 26 of this year in which they actually \nwarm up to this idea, and that the legislation, as we are now \nproceeding, answers a number of the questions they had originally?\n  Frankly, I know they don't want any more work. Nobody does, I guess. \nBut I think many of these problems may have been solved.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I am more informed than \nwhen I began this debate. That is good for me and good for the public. \nI did not know that. It makes a lot of sense. I find it a little odd \nthat people would be opposed to the level that was being portrayed.\n  The idea that we should not do this in Federal court, I think we can \naccommodate it. I am all for having more Federal judges, and we will \ntalk about that in just a moment, but the bottom line, and the reason I \nam voting for this particular legislation is I think it corrects an \nabuse. It gets us back to the constitutional model that everyone \nenvisioned where if you have a diversity--and this is what class action \nis all about, bringing a lot of people together from disparate places \nand groups to try it at one time, in a place that is convenient to \neverybody and in a logical way, that one would want a fair forum. I \nthink Senator Feinstein's amendment was perfect. If there are two-\nthirds of the plaintiffs in any one State, it stays in State court. If \nthere are half the people in one State, the judge can decide whether to \nremove it. If less than a third are in a particular State, then it goes \nto Federal court. To me, that is a perfect compromise. It makes a lot \nof sense.\n  I have no problem voting for this because we are correcting abuses. \nThis is one way to reform our State legal system.\n  Let me give a quick statement about home cooking. I am sure, as the \nPresiding Officer said, in Tennessee people will treat you fairly. I am \nsure that is true in Alabama, and in South Carolina I am sure that is \ntrue. But there are places that one does need to know who they are up \nin front of. I can remember very well one of the first cases I had as a \nyoung lawyer getting out of law school. It involved a speeding ticket \nof a friend of mine. We were going to go to magistrate's court. I was \ngoing to be Perry Mason, and we were going to make this great injustice \nright.\n  The highway patrolman was getting ready to testify and he said: \nHello. And then he said: How are you doing, uncle?\n  So the judge was the uncle of the police officer. That struck me as \nnot being quite right, and I said: Your Honor, nothing personal, but do \nyou mind if we have a jury trial?\n  He said: Well, Lord, no.\n  He called his wife out, the aunt of the police officer, and she \ncalled up some of the cousins and we had a jury trial.\n  The point is, that was not a good experience. Part of it is true and \npart of it is embellished, but I do not want anybody to go into a \nsituation, businesspeople or otherwise, where they believe they are \nbeing dragged to a place that is unfair, and that is what is going on.\n  There is a group of plaintiffs attorneys out there and they have a \nright to use the law to their benefit, and they are using it very \ncleverly to their benefit but in a way that is unfair and is hurting \nour economy. I am glad and proud to support this reform measure because \nI believe it does more good than harm, and that is what we in the \nSenate are all up here to do.\n  I ask unanimous consent to go into morning business or speak as if I \nwas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. I am trying to change subjects. May I \nmake an inquiry to the Presiding Officer? Can I speak about Mr. Pryor's \nnomination as a judge now? Is that appropriate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is free to speak on any subject he \nwishes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I am liking these rules.\n\n\n                      Nomination of William Pryor\n\n  When we are speaking about judges and whether or not we need judges, \nwe\n\n[[Page S12956]]\n\nreally do. There is a backlog in this country in certain courts, and \none of the people being nominated by President Bush is William Pryor \nfrom Alabama. He has been nominated to a seat that has been declared a \njudicial emergency by the Judicial Conference of the United States.\n  All I can say about this case is that my friend from Alabama should \nbe very proud of the nominee who has been put forward by President \nBush. Bill Pryor is the attorney general of Alabama. That is a \npolitical job, and ofttimes the hardest thing for lawyers to do is to \nbe a good lawyer when politics are involved because the thing I love \nmost about the law is that it is a place to go to where polling does \nnot matter and where the popular cause does not always win out.\n  Sometimes the unpopular cause has its day and would win in a forum it \ncould never win otherwise. Our Founding Fathers were brilliant in \ncreating a system where popularity meant a lot in the area that we \nlive, but a courtroom is a place where it should be quiet, and there \nare good men and women who are listening to the facts of one's case and \nno matter whether someone is rich, poor, regardless of their \nbackground, it is a place they can go to be listened to, where maybe \nthe crowd would not listen to them. That is what I love so much about \nthe law. It is a place where people who could not get a fair shake in \nthe popularity world of politics could get a fair shake where people \nwould actually listen to their individual claim, where the unpopular \nmay have its day.\n  When one is attorney general, they get elected by their people, but \nthey are also required to enforce the law, and the concept of the law \nis to give people who are not popular their day in court. What I am \nlooking for in a judicial nominee is someone who can be very passionate \nabout life's issues and questions but can also be very fair. President \nBush has done us a great favor to send Bill Pryor forward. I have met \nhim. I have talked to him. He is the kind of young man I think most of \nus would want our child to grow up to be, the son we would love to \nhave. He is academically qualified, rated by the American Bar \nAssociation as extremely qualified. People from all walks of life who \nknow him like him. If my colleagues met him, they would find he is a \ncharming young man. He seems to be somebody who is sure of who he is \nand what he believes.\n\n  A lot of this filibustering that is going on now has behind it the \nissue of abortion. Special interest politics is very strong in America, \nand it has its place. Groups need to ban together and speak out about \nthings they have in common. I think our job as Senators, when it comes \ntime to look at judges, is not to judge somebody on whether they are \njust pro-choice or pro-life. I am a pro-life person, and I agree with \nBill Pryor. He is a very passionate man. He is a very honest man about \nhis pro-life beliefs.\n  There will come a day when there will be a Democratic President and \nmaybe I will be in the Senate and that Democratic President may send up \na pro-choice person. I think my job is to see whether or not they can \ntake their beliefs on that issue and put them aside when it comes time \nto be a judge.\n  All I can say about Bill Pryor is that when he was attorney general \nhe had the obligation to review a statute that the State of Alabama \npassed--the Senator may correct me if I am wrong--about partial-birth \nabortion, something we just did today. This is an emotional area. \nPeople are very emotional about partial-birth abortion. We are evenly \ndivided on early-stage abortions, abortions in the early stages of \npregnancy. It is about 50/50. But when it gets to the seventh, eighth, \nand ninth month, about 75 to 80 percent of Americans say we should not \nbe having abortions on unborn children at that stage in pregnancy \nunless the mother's life is at stake.\n  We had about 60 Senators today vote for that. For 8 years now, we \nhave been voting on that concept. So it is an extremely popular \nconcept. A lot of people buy into it who are not strictly pro-life. \nThere are some pro-choice people today who voted to ban partial-birth \nabortion. So that is an issue that has a lot of emotion and a lot of \nmomentum behind it.\n  He read the statute and he issued an opinion that had to make him the \nskunk of the garden party. He issued an opinion that said: I read the \nstatute and I do not think it will meet constitutional muster.\n  If anyone has talked to him at all, they know he is a very serious, \npro-life person. So I argue to my colleagues, this is exactly the kind \nof young man or woman they would be looking for to promote, to be able \nto take the politically popular event, put a good legal analysis on the \nevent, and make a decision that is not going to sell well. That is \nexactly what I am looking for in somebody to be a judge, and the \nSenators from Alabama should be very proud they have sent a very noble \nperson forward.\n  There are other examples of doing things that just are tough. My \nState of South Carolina had in our constitution for the longest time a \nban on interracial marriage. One does not have to be a rocket scientist \nto figure out how that all came about. Those of us in the South who \nhave grown up in the South have had tremendous struggles to be fair to \nAfrican-American citizens. There is a legacy there that no one should \nbe proud of, but things are getting better, thank God. When we look \ninto the past--and it is in other parts of the country, but it is \nparticularly true in the South--when that is put into a State \nconstitution, one can only imagine the passion that went into placing \nsomething like that in the constitution.\n  Well, now, later on in life, all of us realize that is unfair, that \nshould never happen, but who wants to be the person to step forward and \nget that argument started all over again because it really was never \nused?\n  Well, Bill Pryor, as attorney general, had the courage to tell \neveryone, whether they agreed with him or not, that there is no place \nin our constitution for this kind of prohibition, and he led a charge \nto get rid of it, something I think tells a lot about the young man.\n  The bottom line is, we are going to have a lot of time to talk about \nBill Pryor because there is a movement to keep him from being on the \nFederal bench, a movement that is driven by politics, a movement that, \nif it continues, will change over 200 years of how the Senate and the \nexecutive branch work.\n  The worst thing we could do, in my opinion, is to take the political \ndisagreements we have in the early part of the 21st century and change \nthe constitutional process, probably forever, the consequence being \nthat good young men and women such as Bill Pryor can't become judges \nbecause a few special interest groups don't like them.\n  If Bill Pryor can't be a Federal judge, given his academic \nbackground, the way he has lived his life, and the qualifications he \nbrings to the job, then America is hurting because we have let politics \nget into the judicial process in an unhealthy way.\n  There will be many more days and many more hours to talk about this. \nI look forward to talking to anybody who will listen about why I \nbelieve so strongly that we should allow the nomination of this young \nman to be voted on on the Senate floor--he has come out of committee--\nand why he would make a fine Federal judge.\n  I, again, let the Senator from Alabama know I am sorry that he and \nhis colleagues from Alabama have to go through this. I am sorry for Mr. \nPryor's family, that they have to go through this. But there will be \nsome fighting back going on. I urge my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle, if you continue to do this, inevitably here is what will \nhappen.\n  The next time there is a Democratic President there will be special \ninterest pressure placed on our party over here on the Republican side \nto do exactly the same thing to some other nominee who may be equally \nqualified. The next thing you know, we are going to have a situation \nwhere good men and women will not put themselves through this. They are \ngoing to say it is not worth it.\n  One of the things that came up in the hearing about Bill Pryor was \nthat he and his wife were going to take their daughters, I believe, to \nDisney World. Disney World had Gay Pride Day that day, and they made a \ndecision not to go on that particular day.\n  It is uncomfortable for me to talk about that. I imagine it is very \nuncomfortable for Bill Pryor to have to talk about things like that. \nThat has no\n\n[[Page S12957]]\n\nplace in the evaluation process, because what is the purpose of that? \n``Yes, we got you now. You must hate gay people because you and your \nwife decided not to go to Disney World on a particular day.''\n  His answer was: It was a family decision that my wife and myself \nmade. But I promise you that if anybody comes before me as a judge, \nthat I will honestly and fairly deal with him.\n  We are getting into areas of people's personal beliefs and family \ndecisions that are unhealthy, that will drive good men and women away \nif that is what you are going to have to put up with to try to serve \nyour country.\n  The bottom line is, we are going to have some fussing and fighting \nabout what is right for Bill Pryor and others, but if we don't wake up \nwe are going to ruin 200 years of history that has worked and we are \ngoing to drive good men and women away from wanting to serve their \ncountry as a judge and all of us lose then.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Carolina. \nI, too, have some very strong feelings about Bill Pryor. He is one of \nthe finest nominees ever to be submitted to this body. I have no doubt \nabout that. He needs an up-or-down vote. If he receives one, he will be \nconfirmed.\n  We started out the debate tonight talking about the class action \nreform bill that is before us. We are seeking to consider the bill, but \nwe are still debating the motion to proceed to the class action bill. I \nsee the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee is here, \nSenator Grassley, to speak on that legislation. I will be speaking on \nit further tonight, also.\n  I am pleased to yield to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to address my colleagues, \nas I did last night, on a bill of which I am the sponsor. It came out \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee on which I serve with very broad \nbipartisan support. It is called the class action lawsuit reform \nlegislation. There has been a lot said about that legislation today \nthat I would like to address.\n  I did listen with great interest, yesterday and today, to speeches \nmade by my colleagues across the aisle, and I fear they greatly \nmisrepresent the bill and the problems facing the class action system, \nso I will spend a few minutes setting the record straight.\n  First, my colleagues are trying to characterize this bill as special \ninterest legislation and are suggesting that the President is pushing \nthis as part of some rightwing agenda.\n  Given that I introduced this bill with my Democratic colleague from \nWisconsin 6 years ago, I am surprised that my colleagues think that \nthis President Bush's idea is bad and part of some rightwing special \ninterest agenda because Senator Kohl, a Democrat from Wisconsin, would \nnot be interested in participating in any effort of a rightwing \nconspiracy.\n  Anyway, Senator Kohl and I put this bill together because there is \nunfairness in the current class action system. Lawyers are getting rich \nwhile consumers and plaintiffs are getting worthless certificates and \ncoupons. The current system has select State county courts deciding \npolicies and interpreting laws for people that ought to be decided on \nthe Federal level, in the Federal court, when they affect all 50 \nStates. Some county judge in Illinois should not be making a decision \nthat is going to affect consumer law of 49 other States.\n  That flips, as you know, the Federal system on its head, and it needs \nto be fixed. Our legislation fixes it. I think that wanting to fix this \nproblem makes sense. It is not part of some rightwing agenda. It is a \nvery key economic issue in our country.\n  This term ``special interest legislation'' is amusing in several \nother ways. The real special interest here is the plaintiffs bar; they \nare fighting this bill with everything they have. Crafty class action \nlawyers who are making out like bandits by bringing frivolous class \naction lawsuits and settling cases where they get all the money are the \nones with the big special interest in this legislation because, if this \nbill passes, judges will have to scrutinize settlements to make sure \nthat lawyers are not unfairly getting more money for their professional \nservices than they ought to get.\n  Also, if this legislation passes, these very same lawyers will not be \nable to do what we call forum shopping--finding the best county judge \nsomeplace in the country who is sympathetic to their cause, before whom \nthey can go and win for sure.\n  Of course, we have the Judicial Conference. In this bill, it would be \nrequired to figure out a way to make attorney's fees more reasonable \nand settlements more fair. So it looks like the biggest special \ninterest with a dog in this fight is the plaintiffs bar.\n  I heard a lot of talk on the floor about how critical class actions \nare, and I would be the first to suggest that there is a place in our \nlegal system for class action suits. They are a great, important tool \nto help injured people collectively recover for their injuries in cases \nwhere it might not be worthwhile for an individual to do that by \nhimself or herself.\n  Somehow, my Democratic colleagues think this bill is the end of class \naction suits, and that is entirely wrong. Our bill leaves the important \ntool of class actions right where it is, in rule 23 of the Federal \nRules of Procedure, and similar rules in most of the individual States. \nBut the bill just allows more class actions, those that ought to be \nnationally viewed and obviously national in scope, to be heard in the \nFederal courts. In-state class actions will continue right along in \nState courts and large national class actions will continue right along \nin the Federal courts. Consumers will still have their day in court. \nThat is very important. Our bill does not take away their ability to \nsue as an individual or to sue as a class.\n\n  Another claim I heard yesterday was that our bill allows defendants \nto remove a case to Federal court at any time, even on the eve of a \ntrial. Senator Breaux says he is worried about this problem and his \nalternative would fix it. The claim is just plain wrong. Our bill does \nnot change the current removal rule. Under that rule, a defendant can \nremove a case within 30 days of receiving notice that a case is \nremovable. That is a good rule and one we do not need to change. I do \nnot appreciate people saying we are changing it when we are not \nchanging it. Our bill will function under that rule so a defendant can \nmove only a case within 30 days of receiving a complaint or an amended \ncomplaint. To say a defendant under our bill can willy-nilly remove a \ncase at any time or even while a jury is deliberating a case is just \nnot true. That is not the case under the current rule. It is not the \ncase with this bill which does not change the current rule.\n  There are some other potential problems with the proposal by my \nfriend Senator Breaux that he talked about yesterday, but I will be \nhappy to look at any amendments he has available. One thing he said \nsticks out in my mind. Senator Breaux suggested if a class of \nplaintiffs is all from Louisiana and a class is injured by an out-of-\nstate meatpacker--that was the example he used--they should be able to \nsue the meatpacker in the State court. He describes a pure diversity \ncase which under the Constitution belongs in the Federal court. He is \nproposing to turn constitutional diversity jurisdiction on its very \nhead. That does not sound like a very good idea to me. His approach \nwould allow the same rampant forum shopping we currently see in the \nsystem. Senator Breaux's alternative would not fix any of these abuses \nand, in fact, his alternative plan makes things much worse.\n  Another misstatement that concerned me is this claim that the bill \nbefore the Senate is not the same bill that came out of committee; that \nthe mass action language materialized out of thin air; that we are \ntrying to pull the wool over our colleagues' eyes. Not true, again.\n  First, the Class Action Fairness Act--the bill before the Senate, the \nbill I am sponsoring--included a provision dealing with mass actions \nwhen it was first introduced. If my colleagues look at the transcript \nof the committee markup, they would find, and I think they would \nprobably remember this, that Chairman Hatch of the Judiciary Committee \nagreed to strip the mass action provision in committee on the condition \nthat Senator Specter and Senator Feinstein worked on compromise \nlanguage to be included in the\n\n[[Page S12958]]\n\nbill when it got to the Senate floor. It is in the Record. Nobody is \npulling any wool over anybody's eyes.\n  Chairman Hatch, Senator Specter, and I collaboratively reworked the \nmass action language, had Senator Feinstein look it over and sign off \non it. In fact, we made modifications she requested and then we ran it \nby all of the original cosponsors of the Class Action Fairness Act. So \nthe claim this bill is somehow unexpected and that we are hiding the \nball is an unfair, untrue statement.\n  I also heard opponents of the bill claim this bill will hurt \nconsumers, will hurt civil rights litigants, will hurt tobacco \nplaintiffs, and will hurt gun victims. The reality is these class \nactions will continue to be brought in both Federal and State court \nafter this bill becomes law. I don't understand what the big fear is \nabout the Federal courts deciding some of these cases. In fact, I \nremind my colleagues many of these cases against tobacco plaintiffs and \ngun manufacturers and civil rights violations have for years been \nroutinely filed in the Federal courts of America. The claim that \nsomehow taking a big national class action out of State court will hurt \nthese folks just does not hold water.\n  Another claim we heard yesterday was Chief Justice Rehnquist opposes \nthis bill. For months we have been hearing this claim, that the Chief \nJustice opposes the bill, and for months we have asked for proof of the \nclaim. There is no proof. Why continue to quote him? Maybe this claim \ncomes from a letter the Judicial Conference sent to the last Congress \ncriticizing certain aspects of the older version of the bill. Justice \nRehnquist is the de facto chair of the Judicial Conference. They must \nbe making a gigantic leap to claim he had problems with parts of that \nold bill. The fact of the matter is, currently the Judicial Conference, \nwhich Chief Justice Rehnquist chairs, supports many things about this \nbill and has publicly thanked the Congress for taking up this issue. It \noffered a few ideas last spring for determining which cases should stay \nin the State courts and which ones should go to the Federal courts, and \nour Feinstein compromise addressed some of those very ideas suggested \nby the Judicial Conference Chief Justice Rehnquist chairs.\n  We are going to hear a lot about class actions during this debate. \nMany of them will be important cases. Two things I ask my colleagues to \nremember regarding a good, necessary class action: First, it is very \npossible our bill will not have any effect whatever on the case. \nSecond, the only effect our bill might have is just to make the case \neligible for Federal court where the case was filed. In fact, many of \nthe cases discussed yesterday sounded to me as if they would either be \nunaffected by the bill or could be proceeded to in Federal court.\n  I know there are Members of this body who will not ever support this \nbill. They will never go up against the plaintiffs bar. They will never \ngo up against those personal injury lawyers. They would say the present \nsystem, even though it gives lawyers millions of dollars and little old \nconsumers a coupon for some product they will never want to buy, or for \nsome part of an airplane ticket for some place they are never going to \ngo, somehow is OK. I hope they will check their facts before they make \nstatements against this bill even though they may never vote for it. \nThey ought to be intellectually correct as they make their points.\n  I have taken this opportunity to set the record straight. That ought \nto give us the number of votes it takes to get beyond a Democrat \nfilibuster and move forward on a bill that has passed the House three \ntimes in 6 years and ought to pass the Senate and ought to go to the \nPresident. We ought to have fairness in our court system. When \nconsumers need to be protected, we ought to have consumers getting the \nbenefit of winning the case, not their lawyer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, for his \nleadership on this legislation for quite a number of years. He is a \nchampion of commonsense fairness in the legal system. That is all we \nare talking about.\n  I agree with Senator Grassley. I cannot imagine why somebody thinks \nthat Federal courts, which have been the champion of liberties for \nAmericans for years and years, are somehow now not fit to handle \ncomplex interstate class action lawsuits. It just boggles the mind. It \nis not sound logic. That argument is driven by the objections being \nmade by the plaintiff lawyers who are interested in these cases. They \nwant to be able to file them where they choose. They want no erosion of \ntheir ability to do so, and they are calling in their friends on the \nother side of the aisle, and some of them are responding.\n  It was referred to earlier that these are big corporations that need \nto be dealt with and we ought to be able to sue them, presumably, in \nany county in America you choose to sue them in. I do not believe that \nis what was contemplated by our Founding Fathers.\n  Let me tell you about another major industry in this country, the \nindustry that is driving the objections to this bill; the plaintiff \ntrial lawyer industry. A recent Tillinghast--I believe is the name of \nit--study showed their income last year was $37 billion. The income of \nthe ``Trial Lawyers, Inc.'' is larger than that of Microsoft, Coca-\nCola, and other companies of that size. It is a huge industry. They \ncontribute aggressively to political campaigns, and they promote their \nagenda aggressively. It is a free country, and they have every right to \ndo so. But I would just suggest that those who would argue that the \nonly wonderful people in this deal are the plaintiff lawsuits may not \nbe so correct.\n  Another study has shown 2 percent of the gross domestic product of \nthis country goes to litigation costs. That is double what the other \ncountries in the industrialized world are paying for litigation costs, \nand it is an extraordinary figure. It is a figure that is paid for not \nby just big corporations, it is paid for by every single American when \nthey take out insurance.\n  I wish it were not so. If someone makes an error in America today, \nand you sue them, and then you seek punitive damages to punish them, \nthe unfortunate reality is, probably they have insurance or the case \nwould not have even gone forward. The lawyer would not proceed, \nprobably, if they did not have money to pay and did not have insurance. \nThey have insurance, so the punitive damage verdict gets rendered, and \nthe insurance company pays it. What does the insurance company do? They \nraise the rates on everybody who is paying premiums. Innocent people \nare paying the penalty imposed by the litigation.\n  So we really need to think about how this system is working. I want \nit to work better. This is a modest step. As I noted earlier, the \nConstitution contemplates that lawsuits between people from two \ndifferent States would be in Federal court. That is the diversity \nclause in the Constitution which has been the way things work for a \nlong time. But the way things are working now, if you can name one \ndefendant to be an in-State defendant, then in many instances you can \nmake the case stay in State court. This process is allows a plaintiff \nto essentially pick the forum they want to pick.\n  If you are suing McDonald's for a problem in their entire system that \naffects people all over America, then that case ought to be in Federal \ncourt, unless you are located in the State where McDonald's is \nheadquartered. That is what I think clearly was contemplated by the \nFounders. But by using the device of naming in-State plaintiffs for \nsuing a defendant in the state he does business in, plaintiff lawyers \nhave been able to break the diversity and keep it in State court.\n  We want people who have been injured to be compensated, and we want \nto make sure they are adequately compensated and that their \ncompensation is legitimate and fair, and that the attorneys get paid a \nlegitimate fee, and not get a huge fee and little or no compensation to \nthe victims. The ugly truth is, in a lot of these cases, the \ncorporations really just want the lawsuit to go away and have to take \nthe plaintiff lawyer's word for what the plaintiff class wants in a \nsettlement agreement. If the plaintiffs' lawyer says his clients--many \nof whom, virtually all of whom, he may never have met--would accept a \ncoupon for a Blockbuster video, as long as the defendant pays the \nplaintiff lawyer's fees totaling $10 million, the defendant may be \nwilling to pay that to get rid of the lawsuit.\n\n[[Page S12959]]\n\n  So the clients get paid little and the attorney gets paid a lot. \nThere is a conflict of interest and a tension there for people who are \nsensitive to it. We are seeing that in these cases. That is what \nSenator Grassley was talking about. We are seeing that as a pattern. \nThis legislation will help deal with that problem, help bring more \nintegrity to the system, allow the courts to monitor it more closely, \nand ensure more fairness for the victims of wrongdoing.\n  Don't misunderstand me, class actions can be an effective and \nlegitimate tool. Some people are so frustrated by the abuses that they \njust want to attack all class actions. That is not what we are doing \nwith this bill. Class actions are effective tools for a large number of \npeople who may have been wronged by a single defendant or by defendants \nacting in concert. This can happen in a bank. Banks have been known to \novercharge people. For example, a bank does not pay proper interest on \nan escrow account, and they owe each depositor $2 in interest. But \nthere are 1 million depositors, and it has been going on for 5 years. \nThe calculations get worked out. It is appropriate that those people \nget the interest they are entitled to and often a class action is the \nappropriate way to get this done. They ought to be paid fully what the \nlaw says you ought to be paid on the escrow account. The question is, \nhowever, are those plaintiffs always getting the money, and are these \ncases being handled in a way that is fair and just? How it works is \nwhat we are talking about. Certainly, 100,000 lawsuits--and they can be \nbrought that way--each brought individually for a $2 misappropriation \nin an escrow account is not an efficient way for lawsuits to be \nsettled. That is why we allow them all to be brought in one court. Then \nall plaintiffs are bound by the result as well as the defendant.\n  Too often, in recent years, however, these lawsuits have become a \nvehicle by which some trial lawyers are cashing in at the expense of \nthe plaintiff class. The most troublesome aspect is that in many of \nthese class actions the lawyer does not even know the clients, and in \nsome cases does not even have a client. In these situations a lawyer \nfirst discovers a potential claim he or she thinks is a good one, and \nthen runs around and finds a client to be the named client as a vehicle \nfor the lawsuit. The end result is often not justice for the \nplaintiffs, and enrichment for the attorney. I know of a case in which \nthe client--the named plaintiff--in the case died, and the lawsuit went \non with no real party there for months before the attorney discovered \nhis client had died. The attorneys were running the lawsuit, proceeding \nas they chose, with so little communication with their supposed client \nthat they did not even know the person had died.\n  Not always. This is not always the case. A lot of these lawsuits are \nhandled fairly and objectively, but we are seeing abuses there on a \nregular basis.\n  For some cases they have not even been able to show any damages, yet \nthe lawyers have still received huge amounts of money. For example, the \nToshiba case. In this case, a class action suit was filed in Texas. It \ncomplained of an entirely theoretical defect in the ``floppy disk \ncontrollers'' of Toshiba laptops. There were no allegations that the \nasserted defect had resulted in injury to any user, and not one \ncustomer had ever reported a problem attributable to the defect. Facing \npotential liability of $10 billion, Toshiba decided they needed to \nsettle this claim. They were willing to pay. The class members received \nas their payment between $200 and $400 off any future purchases of \nToshiba products. In other words, they got a settlement--a discount on \nfuture purchases of a Toshiba product--only if they bought products \nfrom the defendant again in the future. The two named plaintiffs, the \nones who were working with the attorneys, presumably, got $25,000, and \nthe plaintiffs' attorneys received $147 million. That is a lot of \nmoney. The fact that most class members only benefitted from the \nlawsuit if did business with the defendant in the future is not good. \nIt seems to me the company was wanting the lawsuit to be over, they \nwere willing to pay the lawyers whatever fee they asked for, and give \nsome sort of token settlement to the class members, and get out of this \nthing, just to make the suit go away, even though no real damages had \nhappened to the class members as of that date.\n  Lawyers are supposed to represent real clients who have been truly \nharmed. They are ethically bound to represent the clients' interests \nforemost, far above their own interests.\n  Class action lawsuits are designed to be available when lawyers \nrealize that an entire class of people have been harmed in the same way \nthat his client has been harmed. However, class actions should not \nbecome a feeding trough for attorneys. Class actions should not be a \nsituation where good advocates figure out a way, by adding unrelated \ndefendants, to file actions in friendly circuits or to use other \nmethods to utterly maximize the benefit from their side of the \nlitigation, while ignoring the fairness overall.\n  I respect lawyers. I believe in them. I have litigated, many cases. I \nbelieve lawyers should maximize the ability to protect their clients. \nIn my comments about some of these lawyers that say they are protecting \ntheir client's interests but are really protecting their own pockets, I \nmean to be critical. Some of the lawyers, in fact, deserve no real \ncriticism because they are simply choose to file the lawsuit in the \nforum most favorable to their client, and they are not supposed to look \nat whether that forum is fair to the defendant or not. You have to \nadmire lawyers that are genuinely seeking to protect their client's \nbest interests.\n  But we must, as a legislative body, monitor these cases. We must, as \na legislative body, work to make sure that fairness is occurring in our \ncourts.\n  Let me cite the Bank of Boston case filed in my State of Alabama. I \nwas attorney general of Alabama during part of this time and I heard \nabout some of these complaints. It is a good example of the class \naction system and how it is broken.\n  In this case a class action was filed by a Chicago attorney in the \ncircuit court, the county court of Mobile, AL. A Chicago attorney \nlooked all over the country, and decided to file the lawsuit in Mobile. \nThe case alleged that the Bank of Boston, MA, did not promptly post \ninterest to the escrow accounts of its members. The settlement that was \nagreed to limited the maximum recovery for each individual class member \nto $9 each. However the class action attorneys received over $8 million \nin legal fees, an amount approved by the State court. It is shocking \nthat the legal fees the class action attorneys received, were debited \nfrom the plaintiff class' bank accounts, averaging 5.3 percent of the \nbalance in each account. Many of the bank members did not even know \nthey were members of the plaintiff class, did not even know that \nattorneys were representing them, and most of all, had no idea that \nmoney would come out of their accounts to pay those attorneys. Imagine \nnot even knowing you were involved in a class action until you realize \nthat money has been taken out of your bank account to pay their legal \nfees.\n  What is even worse is that for a number of the accounts, the debit to \nthe account exceeded the credit they obtained from the settlement, \nmeaning that after the settlement, more money came out of their account \nthan went back in.\n  Dexter Kamowitz of Maine--a plaintiff in Maine that is being bound by \na county judge in Alabama--was one of those plaintiffs. He did not \ninitiate the class action against the Bank of Boston. However, he \nreceived a credit of $2.19 to his account after the settlement. At the \nsame time, the class action attorney debited Mr. Kamowitz's account for \n$91.33 in legal fees, producing a net loss of $89.14. Such results, as \nmight be expected, produced outrage from class members in other States.\n  Judge Frank Easterbrook, reviewing the case as a Federal judge on the \nSeventh Circuit Court of Appeals asked: What right does Alabama have to \ninstruct financial institutions [headquartered] in Florida to debit the \naccounts of citizens in Maine and other States?\n  I do believe that we need to be careful about expanding Federal \njurisdiction. We don't want to do this willy-nilly. But we also need to \nbe careful to ensure that State courts cannot unfairly include class \nmembers from all over the country and bind them by the verdict they \nrender.\n  Federal jurisdiction is currently allowed in cases where there is a \nde minimis interstate commerce nexus. We\n\n[[Page S12960]]\n\nknow that from civil rights cases and plaintiffs cases and civil cases. \nIf there is a Federal nexus, you can file it in certain cases in \nFederal court. I believe it is certainly appropriate, when we are \ndealing with a national corporation, dealing with clients in every \nState in America.\n  The bill offered by Senators Grassley and Kohl would help eliminate \nsome of these class action abuses. We have talked about class action \nproblems for a very long time. I believe it is time to stop talking and \nget moving and pass a bill that will help class action plaintiffs be \ntreated fairly in this entire process. I hope we can have a healthy \ndebate and move this legislation that reforms class action forward.\n  I am also pleased to see, as I conclude these remarks, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Orrin \nHatch. He has wrestled with the class actions issues from the \nbeginning. As a skilled lawyer himself, he understands the issues ably. \nHe is able to discuss them in a very intelligent way. He understands \nthe history of this entire proceeding. It is a pleasure for me to serve \nwith him on the Judiciary Committee. I know at this time he would like \nto share some remarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am sorry to keep the body a little bit \nlater, but I do think we need to make some points that really need to \nbe made. We should be debating the Class Action Fairness Act of 2003 \nrather than squandering away the Senate's time debating a motion to \nproceed to the bill. That has become typical around here. Anything that \ncan delay, anything that can make it miserable, anything that can make \nit difficult to pass legislation or even consider legislation, we are \nfinding the other side is doing to us.\n  Yesterday, my colleague from Vermont, the ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee, observed accurately that the days remaining in \nthis session are numbered and that floor time is indeed precious. But \nwhat puzzles me is if there is such a premium for time, then why in the \nworld are we faced with a Democrat filibuster on the motion to proceed \nto a bill? Usually, if you are going to filibuster, you filibuster the \nbill. So we all know what is going on here.\n  From what I know, based on the remarks yesterday from the ranking \nmember and others, I understand that there is an objection to \nproceeding to S. 1751 because it has been characterized by some as \n``special interest legislation.'' What ``special interest'' are we \ntalking about? Are we talking about the ``special interest'' of \nmillions of consumers throughout the country who are affected every day \nby class action abuses, or are we talking about the ``special \ninterest'' of the everyday American worker who stands to lose because \nhis or her employer can't increase wages or offer better health \nbenefits because of the commercial uncertainties created by \nuncontrolled class action litigation, or are we talking about the \n``special interest'' of the general American public that is losing \nfaith in the American civil justice system because of the outrageous \nclass action coupon settlements that only benefit the attorneys?\n  On this whole special interest point, I would like to direct your \nattention to a recent poll showing that the overwhelming majority of \nAmericans believe that class action lawsuits benefit lawyers at the \nexpense of their clients.\n  Look at this chart. ``Opinions on class action lawsuits; who benefits \nmost from class action lawsuits.'' Lawyers for the plaintiffs, the \npublic says--47 percent believe the lawyers benefit the most. They are \nright, especially in these frivolous suits we have been referring to. \nBuyers of products, 5 percent; companies being sued, 7 percent; 9 \npercent of the American people think the plaintiffs benefit the most \nfrom class action lawsuits--the ones they are bringing the suits for. \nOnly 9 percent of the American public think the injured parties, the \nso-called victims, are the ones who benefit; 12 percent don't know; 20 \npercent say the lawyers for companies. So of the total opinion of the \nAmerican people in a poll conducted, with an error margin of plus or \nminus 3.5 percentage points, a total 67 percent of the American people \nbelieve the lawyers are the ones who benefit from these class action \nsuits; 67 percent believe class action lawsuits are a virtual bonanza \nfor lawyers. The public is not too dumb; they are right.\n  In stark contrast, the poll shows only 9 percent of Americans believe \nthe class action lawsuits benefit the victims or the plaintiffs \nthemselves. When the public perception of class action lawsuits in our \ncivil justice system is so negatively skewed, I find it difficult to \nsay with a straight face this bill somehow advances ``a special \ninterest.''\n  Perhaps the ``special interest'' we are really talking about is that \nbelonging to one Hilda Bankston. Who is Hilda Bankston? This is Hilda \nin the photo. A beautiful woman, a decent person. I can tell you with \ncertainty she is not a tobacco company. She is not a gun manufacturer \nor somebody who pollutes the environment. Hilda Bankston and her \nhusband Mitch owned Bankston Drugstore in Fayette, MS, a small local \npharmacy where Mitch worked as a pharmacist. The Bankstons were dragged \ninto hundreds of lawsuits filed by class action attorneys in the State \nof Mississippi by virtue of owning the only drugstore in Jefferson \nCounty. Their small business became a prime target for forum-shopping \nclass action attorneys in pharmaceutical cases.\n  The Bankstons' nightmare began in 1999 when Bankston Drugstore was \nnamed a defendant in the fen-phen diet drug class action lawsuit simply \nfor filling a prescription written by a doctor--something they were \nsupposed to do. Since then, plaintiffs lawyers have filed hundreds of \npharmaceutical lawsuits against Bankston Drugstore. Every time a big \ndrug maker was sued, even if the company was located in New York, or \nCalifornia, the plaintiffs' lawyers added Hilda Bankston and her \nhusband as defendants--this hard-working owner of a single drugstore--\njust because she sold that drug from her neighborhood drugstore, which \nwas her obligation to do.\n  Even though Mrs. Bankston no longer owns the drugstore, she continues \nto be named a defendant in these lawsuits today and is buried under a \nmountain of discovery requests because of the litigation. On a more \npersonal level, Mrs. Bankston describes to us the toll this ordeal has \ntaken on her both personally and professionally. She testified that, \n``no small business should have to endure the nightmares I have \nexperienced. . . . I have spent many sleepless nights wondering if my \nbusiness would survive the tidal wave of lawsuits cresting over it.''\n  Mrs. Bankston also suffered the loss of her husband when, within \nthree weeks of being named as a defendant in the fen-phen case, her \nhusband died of a heart attack. It is stories like Mrs. Bankston's--an \nevery-day citizen just trying to fulfill the American dream--that makes \nthis bill so compelling. I think to characterize this bill as appeasing \n``special interests'' is not only disingenuous but it ignores the \nextensive mountain of evidence showing otherwise. It is pure, \nunmitigated bunk and they know it.\n\n  I also understand the ranking member expressed surprise and concern \nover the lone difference between S. 274 as reported out of the \ncommittee and the rule XIV version of the bill, S. 1751, that we are \nnow trying to move forward. To set the record straight, we are simply \ninvoking Senate rule XIV, which is procedurally proper, to simply \naccommodate the revised mass actions provision the committee had \nremoved from the bill during markup on the condition that it would be \nmodified and replaced in the bill before floor consideration. That is \nwhat we agreed to do. That is all we did. The rule XIV version of the \nbill, which is numbered S. 1751, is the identical bill we voted \nfavorably out of committee, except for the return of the revised mass \nactions provision the members on the Judiciary Committee knew or should \nhave known would be restored into the bill before floor consideration.\n  Just on Friday, the majority leader asked unanimous consent to bring \nup S. 274, substituting with the text of what is now S. 1751. There was \nan objection from the other side of the aisle which forced the majority \nleader to bring up S. 1751 under rule XIV. To now hear we are somehow \nnot acting in\n\n[[Page S12961]]\n\ngood faith is, at best, a misunderstanding and at worst a deliberate \nattempt to mislead. You make the decision, you make the judgment on \nthat. I know what I think.\n  By way of background, I want to explain what happened with this \nprovision. When the original bill, S. 274, was marked up during \ncommittee last April, the committee members agreed to an amendment \noffered by Senators Feinstein and Specter striking two provisions from \nthe bill only with the understanding that the language would be \nmodified and replaced before floor consideration. The first provision \ndefined private State attorneys general actions as class actions within \nthe meaning of the bill. These are statutory actions a private citizen \ncan bring on behalf of the general public. My colleague from \nCalifornia, Senator Feinstein, expressed specific concern over this \nprovision because she believed it would interfere with an existing \nCalifornia statute permitting such representative actions. This \nprovision has remained out of the bill.\n  It is the second provision that necessitated the rule XIV \nalternative. This second provision is what we commonly refer to now as \nthe mass actions provision. A mass action is a civil action seeking to \ntry the claims en masse of all plaintiffs and defendants in a single \ntrial, but pursued without the procedural due process prerequisites for \nlitigating such a matter as a class action. Mass actions are used \nheavily in certain States such as West Virginia and have been used to \nunfairly consolidate for trial diverse claims of as many as 8,000 \nplaintiffs from over 35 States against over 250 defendants. These \nactions are especially problematic because they proceed without \nsatisfying any of the standard class action prerequisites, such as \ncommonality and typicality of claims.\n  Although the original bill contained a provision that defined mass \nactions to qualify as class actions, my colleague Senator Specter \nraised a specific concern over the scope of the provision and moved it \nbe stricken. Because the committee didn't have a meaningful opportunity \nto evaluate the Senator's concerns before markup, I, as chairman, \nagreed to strike this provision, but only with the understanding that \nwe would modify the provision and replace it before the bill reached \nthe floor, which is exactly what we did.\n  After the extensive post-markup negotiations and other discussions \namong my staff and the staff of Senators Specter, Feinstein, Kohl, and \nGrassley, we were able to reach consensus on a revised mass actions \nprovision in early September.\n  Let me stress there are no surprises here on what we were going to do \nwith the mass actions provision. Everybody who appeared that day in the \nJudiciary Committee markup was aware the bill sponsors would work with \nthe sponsors of the amendment, Senators Specter and Feinstein, to \ndevelop compromise language. Indeed, we called specific attention to \nthis understanding in our committee report on S. 274, which has been \nwidely and publicly available since last July.\n  As for using rule XIV, which is an effective rule in the Senate, a \nrule that can be legitimately used, and has been used in this case, we \ngave advance notice to our Democratic counterparts, Senators Feinstein \nand Kohl, over a month ago that there was a possibility we would have \nto use this procedural device to ensure the operative text reflected \nthe understanding when the bill was reported out of committee.\n  I also understand from my staff that these offices then informed, \namong others, the ranking member on our committee about the potential \nuse of the rule when we introduced S. 1751 last week. Simply put, we \nwere open and above board. We didn't have to be, but we were. We didn't \nhave to be because the rule is the rule. We are entitled to use it. The \nDemocrats have used it time after time, as have Republicans. There are \nno surprises here. I was the most shocked to find claims that something \nsomehow or another was askew and not properly handled. Again, that is \npure bunk, and everybody knows it. But I suppose when we have \ntelevision in the Senate, we are going to see that type of argument \nmade from time to time, even though it doesn't hold water and can't \nstand the light of day.\n  We provided advance notice and opportunity to review the text to our \nDemocratic sponsors and the sponsors of the amendment so they could all \nverify that no other changes were made. That is good faith, in my view. \nWe gave advance notice of our intended use of this device for a \nprovision we made clear to everyone we intended to modify. So I am \nparticularly baffled as to why the ranking member of our committee is \ncalling this a mystery. This is no mystery. We did exactly what we said \nwe would do when we marked up this bill in committee, and the bill was \nvoted out with a partisan vote of 12 to 7, but, of course, the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont didn't vote for the bill in \ncommittee. That may be what is behind these types of comments. He never \nhas been for this bill.\n  I suspect all is fair in love and war. This being war, they can say \nwhatever they want on the floor of the Senate, even though it is \ntotally wrong.\n  I believe rule XIV is the most appropriate way of handling the unique \nset of circumstances leading to the revision of the class action \nprovisions, especially in light of the limited number of days remaining \nin this session. Given the number of pressing appropriations issues \nfacing the Senate in the coming months, I think it makes little sense \nto waste valuable floor time debating as a separate amendment a \nprovision that the key Republican and Democratic members have already \nworked out in good faith. It is even more absurd to be forced to debate \na motion to proceed to this bill.\n  There is only one reason for that. That is to delay, delay, delay, \nand hopefully bollix up everything at the end of this session so \nnothing good gets done. I ask my colleagues to support the motion to \nproceed to S. 1751, the rule XIV version, the Class Action Fairness Act \nof 2003.\n  A Senator got on the floor and made a number of what I thought were \noutrageous comments as well pertaining to this being a special interest \npiece of legislation. This is a people's bill. The biggest losers under \nthe current system are the people. Lawyers sue companies and negotiate \nsettlements in which they get all the money. So consumers get ripped \noff twice: Their lawyers rip them off by taking the settlement money \nthat is supposed to go to them, and then they have to pay for the \npayoff to the lawyers at higher prices.\n  How about tax cuts for the wealthy? That was an argument made \nyesterday. The class action bill would not protect the wealthy. It is \nthe opponents of the bill who are trying to protect the wealthy--the \nwealthy trial lawyers in this case. Although not all class action \nlawyers are to be criticized, some actually are good lawyers who \nactually do what is right within the law in fair class actions that \nreally are brought to help people. We are talking about the ones who \nneed to be reformed. Some of these wealthy lawyers who need reform \namass their riches by ripping off consumers in bad settlements. We have \nshown that throughout this debate.\n\n  Senators raised the issue of defective products, protecting gun \nmanufacturers. The only successful class action against gun \nmanufacturers, the only case in which any relief was awarded was in \nFederal court. That is what we are trying to do here, and they act as \nif the Federal courts are not capable of handling these cases? This \ndoesn't stop legitimate class actions. It just says there is no longer \ngoing to be these phony forum-shopped cases in corrupt jurisdictions \nwhere there are corrupt judges and where jurors don't realize they are \nsaddling all of America with these outrageous verdicts that pay off the \nattorneys but do very little for consumers or for the plaintiffs who \nare supposedly the real victims.\n  We heard the argument yesterday that Justice Rehnquist is opposed to \nthis bill. Opponents keep saying Chief Justice Rehnquist opposes the \nbill, but whenever we ask for a citation to that opposition, we get \nabsolutely nothing. They talk about the Judicial Conference letters, \nbut those letters do not express opposition to the bill that was \nreported out of committee.\n  How about forum shopping? Defendants cannot forum shop. The plaintiff \nalways gets to choose where to file the lawsuit. If they file in State \ncourt, they can often choose precisely the judge who will hear the \ncase. All the defendant can do is remove to Federal\n\n[[Page S12962]]\n\ncourt where the case will be heard by a randomly selected judge, not a \nstacked, forum-shopped deal with a corrupt judge or maybe not even a \ncorrupt judge, but one who just believes the plaintiffs should win no \nmatter what the facts are. Again, I think that is corruption. It is \nnonsense to say defendants can forum shop or that forum shopping is the \npurpose of this bill. That is nonsense. Yet that is what one of our \ndistinguished Senators was saying yesterday.\n  How about the scalpel argument? Any suggestion that this class action \nproblem is concentrated in a handful of State courts is wrong. It is a \nproblem in many places, and if you fix it in one place, the party moves \nto some other court in some other town.\n  How about Madison County, IL, by the way? We had the two Senators \nfrom Illinois speak: One just found Madison County to be the most \ncircumspect county in the world. The other basically called the judges \nand the lawyers, many of whom never practiced law in Madison County, \npeople who were abusing the system. He even implied some of them were \ncorrupt.\n  The figures in Madison County do indicate a problem. Look at the \ndramatic increase in the number of class actions, virtually all of \nwhich were nationwide class actions over a short period, an increase \nfrom 2 in 1998 up to over 75 last year. Why are all these people, all \nthese attorneys from other States flocking to the middle of nowhere to \nfile lawsuits in which none of the claimants and none of the defendants \nare from the area? Do we really need to ask why? We know why. Because \nof corruption--corrupt judges, or should we say misconceived judges, to \nbe nice about it, or judges who always find for the plaintiffs or steer \neverything in favor of the plaintiffs or always find class actions to \nexist when they really shouldn't. That is corruption.\n\n  We hear statistics indicating half of the class actions have been \ncertified, but what the distinguished Senator from Illinois should have \nsaid was ``certified so far.''\n  What I find curious is that the distinguished Senator from Illinois \ndidn't give the number of class actions that were denied. What happens \nin Madison County is that the case is filed, and when the lawyer \ndecides he wants to put the squeeze on the defendant to settle, he \nstarts moving toward getting a class certified, but sometimes it takes \na while.\n  By the way, just moving to get a class certified in Madison County \nwhere it is almost granted at will is enough to scare any corporation \nbecause once that happens, that corporation is in real trouble, and so \nare that corporation's employees who are likely to lose their jobs, \ntheir income, their health care, and their pensions if the company gets \nthrown into bankruptcy.\n  We have heard allegations that under the class action bill, a \ndefendant can remove a case at any time, even on the eve of trial. The \ncurrent removal statute, 28 USC section 1446(b), provides that a case \nmust be removed to Federal court ``within 30 days after the defendant's \nreceipt . . . of a copy of the [complaint] in the action.''\n  This class action bill would not change that rule. The allegation \nthat a class action bill would allow a case to be removed to Federal \ncourt at any time is ridiculous. But that is what we are getting used \nto from those who argue against this issue.\n  Now why do they do that? Why can they not see these simple, easy to \nsee facts of life? Well, I hate to say it but I think it comes down to \nthe fact these trial lawyers are the biggest hard money funders of many \nof these people who will vote against this bill. They get whatever they \npay for. They can rely on their friends in the Congress to ignore what \nreally should be ethical and good changes in the law and to stand in \nthe way of those changes. That is what is happening here.\n  That is taking the sugar coat off, but that is what is happening. The \nfact is that we have people in this body who will vote for the trial \nlawyers no matter how wrong they may be.\n  Now, when I say trial lawyers, I am speaking about this select group \nof trial lawyers who really are giving the legal profession a bad name, \nwho are in it for the money so they can support their own political \ncandidates, live in high style, be influential in their respective \ncommunities, most all of which are outside of Madison County, by the \nway, and who can just about afford to do anything they want to do and \nare used to doing anything they want to do.\n  I happen to know a lot of good trial lawyers who are honest and \ndecent, who really fight hard for their plaintiffs, for people who were \nwronged, for victims, and who are disgusted with these trial lawyers \nwho are taking procedural advantage, monetary advantage, of forum \nshopping in this country. It is coming to the point where even the \nAmerican Trial Lawyers Association is starting to get split on these \ntypes of issues because they realize that some of these people are \ngiving trial lawyers who are good, honest, decent, hard-working trial \nlawyers a bad name, because they are getting lumped into the term \n``trial lawyers'' all the time with these people who are bad actors, \nwho are in it for the money.\n  Now, they paint a very big picture about how they are in it for the \nlittle consumers, but look at the coupon settlements. Look at the \namount of money they are getting in fees. Look at the way the consumers \nhave been ripped off. Look at the cost to society. Look at the \ncompanies that are in shambles and can no longer employ people. Look at \nthe unfairness of forum shopping. Look at the unfairness of corruption.\n  I commend trial lawyers who are honest and decent and who bring \ndecent class actions. They know they can win in Federal court just as \nmuch as they can win in State court, but they also know they cannot \nforum shop as well in Federal courts.\n  Now, one can still forum shop but not nearly like they can in a \nnumber of jurisdictions in this country in certain counties where, as I \nsay, judges are owned lock, stock, and barrel by various political \ninterests.\n  Well, I have kept us long enough, but this is an important bill and \nto filibuster even the motion to proceed to the bill, at this late \ndate, leads only to one conclusion and that is unfairness, delay, win \nat any cost, fear to debate this bill straight up and down, fear to \nhave votes straight up and down. The reason they are afraid is because \nthey know if Senators were permitted to vote their consciences this \nbill would pass overwhelmingly, if it were not for the untold influence \nof big class action money.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If the Senator will yield, based on his experience, it \nis indeed an unusual thing that we have a filibuster of a motion to \nproceed to a bill that has this kind of bipartisan support. Is it not?\n  Mr. HATCH. No question that we usually do not have a filibuster on a \nmotion to proceed, because if any of my colleagues are going to \nfilibuster, they should filibuster the bill. By filibustering the \nmotion to proceed, they can delay a vote on that for 3 days. Then they \ncan filibuster the bill and delay that for another 3 days, which eats \nup 6 days at a crucial time of the year when we are trying to do all of \nthe appropriations bills, a prescription drug benefit and Medicare \nreform, asbestos reform, judges, a whole raft of other very important \nissues, including the Energy bill. So by eating up all this time it \nmakes it difficult to pass any of these matters, and it makes one \nwonder what in the world is behind all of this.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think it is particularly telling, I say to the \nSenator, because this is not like the circumstances we had when the \nDemocrats were in the majority and Senator Daschle called up the entire \nAgriculture bill, or the entire Energy bill, which were huge bills, \nunder rule XIV, that had not been addressed in the committee. This bill \nhad hearings in committee and we voted for it 12 to 7. There was only \none basic change to the bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. It was a bipartisan supported bill. Democrats and \nRepublicans support this bill. It will pass if Senators are permitted \nto vote their consciences and are permitted to vote up or down without \nthe phony delays of a filibuster, especially a filibuster on the motion \nto proceed.\n  By the way, rule XIV is an effective rule of the Senate. Both sides \nhave\n\n[[Page S12963]]\n\nused that in order to expedite consideration of matters and everybody \nunderstands that, and everybody can then debate.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I just recall when Senator Daschle was the majority \nleader, he brought up huge legislation outside of the committee that \ncould not have been passed in the committee. We were forced to debate \nthat legislation on the floor under rule XIV. To say there is some \nprocedural problem here, when Senator Hatch has managed the bill \nthrough the committee process, when we have debated the bill, and when \nwe have voted on the bill in committee, it came out 12 to 7, is \nbaffling. As far as rule XIV is concerned, everybody was given notice \nof what would happen, this is just pure obstructionism. This is just an \nexcuse to delay, delay, obstruct, obstruct.\n  We are coming to the end of this legislative session. We have a lot \nof things to do. One of the things we absolutely ought to do is to move \nthis bipartisan bill to fix class action litigation in America. It is \nthe right thing to do. It has the overwhelming majority support of the \nMembers of this body. Yes, it has the opposition of a small but \npowerful little group of trial lawyers who put a lot of money in the \npolitical campaigns, but it is the right thing to do, and we ought to \nmove forward with it.\n  I think there is every reason for those who believe in improving the \nlegal system to be upset at the obstructionism that we are facing by a \nmajority leader who has approved this. I think if we had some \nleadership on the other side by Senator Daschle, we could move this \nbill. To lay back is to allow the trial lawyers to control this matter.\n  There are a lot of reasons why we ought not have a single state judge \nin Madison County, as the Senator said, trying cases that have impact \nall over America. That is not good. A Federal court, with a Federal \njudge, with a quality group of law clerks, a fine staff, and by far a \nsmaller caseload than most State judges have--I would say on the \naverage, in my experience, that the State judges would carry maybe 10 \ntimes as many cases on their docket as a Federal judge has on the \nFederal court docket. The Federal judges give more attention to the \ncases and they have more ability to focus on a case. There is the \nability to issue subpoenas nationwide and make things happen in ways \nthat are more difficult in State court. So a major class action \ninvolving millions of dollars and thousands of plaintiffs from \ndifferent states ought to be tried in Federal court when there is a \nmajority of the people involved who are out of State.\n  This reform fixes some of the problems associated with class actions. \nIt sets up legislation that gives special scrutiny for those abused \ncoupon-related settlements, where the victims get coupons and lawyers \nget big fees.\n  It guarantees that notifications to class Members to be in plain \nEnglish. It scrutinizes against a negative awards, where plaintiffs who \nmay not have even known they were plaintiffs end up having to pay \nattorney's fees in a case they never authorized to go forward. It \nprovides protection against unwarranted higher awards for certain class \nmembers, just because they are in a certain area of the country. And \nthere are prohibitions on the payment of bounties.\n  It makes it more difficult, when you are facing a fair judge who you \nbelieve will rule on the law and give you a fair shake, not in a county \nthat has a reputation of just hammering defendants in favor of the \nattorneys who file the cases. That allows defendants to litigate with \nintegrity, and not feel they must just pay up, almost in the form of \nblackmail, to get the matter away so they can go on about their \nbusiness. This is not a fair way to do business.\n  This bill has a lot of good things in it that will make this area of \nthe law, class actions, better, more fair, and more objective.\n  I thank the chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/21/senate-section/article/S12963-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my congratulations \nand best wishes to my longtime friend and fellow Nevadan, Mr. Breck \nWall.\n  Born in Jacksonville, FL in 1934, Mr. Wall has lived an interesting \nand exciting life. As an entertainer, he has known many talented and \nfamous people in the world of show business. He has also crossed paths \nwith well-known people in other walks of life. In the early 60s, he \nperformed in the Dallas nightclub owned by Jack Ruby, the man who shot \nLee Harvey Oswald.\n  The Las Vegas Sun has called Breck ``one of the most durable \nperformers in Las Vegas,'' and that is no exaggeration. This year he is \ncelebrating the 45th anniversary of a show called ``Bottoms Up,'' which \nhe created in 1959 at the old Adolphus Hotel in Dallas.\n  Breck based this show upon slapstick vaudeville comedy, which \nexplains its long-running appeal. The show is very Las Vegas, \ntherefore, is enjoyed all over America.\n  After producing ``Bottoms Up'' in Dallas and Houston for several \nyears, Breck brought the show to Las Vegas in 1964 . . . and he has \nnever left.\n  The show is now a Las Vegas institution. It has played at many of the \nfinest hotels in town, including Ceasar's Palace and the old \nInternational Hotel where Elvis used to perform--now the Las Vegas \nHilton. It is currently enjoying a run of several years at the \nFlamingo.\n  Breck has done more than 15,000 performances of this show, but he \nnever gets tired of it . . . and neither do the audiences. The secrets \nof his longevity are a strong work ethic, and the kind of good nature \nthat brings a smile and laughter to everyone who meets him.\n  I first met Breck in 1977 when I was chairman of the Nevada Gaming \nCommission. We were introduced by some mutual friends at an event, and \nwe exchanged a few jokes. I could immediately sense Breck's warmth and \nhis sharp wit.\n  We really became good friends a few years later, when I ran for \nCongress and Breck helped me with my campaign. Breck has produced shows \nfor my campaign that have been exciting, entertaining and fun.\n  Helping other is typical of Breck Wall. Despite the demands of his \ntravels and his work, he always finds time to contribute something to \nhis community.\n  Most recently, he participated in the Golden Rainbow's 17th annual \n``Ribbon of Life'' AIDS benefit at the Paris hotel in Las Vegas. This \nsummer show helped raise more than a quarter of a million dollars for \nan organization dedicated to helping the men, women, and children \nliving with HIV and AIDS.\n  I ask all my colleagues to join me in sending our good wishes to Mr. \nBreck Wall as he celebrates the 45th anniversary of ``Bottoms Up,'' a \nLas Vegas entertainment tradition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/21/senate-section/article/S12963-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12963-S12964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a horrific crime that occurred in West \nHollywood, CA. After hugging a male friend outside of his home in \nSeptember 2002, actor Treve Brody was beaten with a baseball bat. Mr. \nBrody was in a coma, and spent 10 weeks in the hospital after being \nstruck in the back of his head. He suffered memory loss and impaired \nvision that prevents him from reading or driving.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement\n\n[[Page S12964]]\n\nEnhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that \nby passing this legislation and changing current law, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/21/senate-section/article/S12964-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12964-S12965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE IN MEXICO\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as one Member of Congress who believes that \nwe have a strong interest in broadcasting and strengthening our \nrelations with Mexico, I was appalled to read a recent Washington Post \narticle entitled ``Three Americans Jailed in Bizarre Mexican Land \nDispute.''\n  Mexico is a country of 100 million people. We share a border. We \nshare a wide range of cultural, economic, political, and other \ninterests. Yet our history has been a troubled one, and the election of \nVicente Fox offered an historic opportunity to begin to build a new \nrelationship based on trust, mutual understanding, and shared goals.\n  Regrettably, President Bush, who shortly after his inauguration spoke \nconvincingly of his intention to give a high priority to U.S.-Mexican \nrelations, has failed to turn those words into action. Little has been \naccomplished. I am afraid that once again, the hopes and aspirations of \nboth Mexicans and Americans will be for naught.\n  The President needs to recognize that as important as the Middle East \nand the Persian Gulf are to U.S. and global security, we have vital \ninterests right here in our own hemisphere. I remember how during the \n1980s we spent billions of dollars to wage proxy wars in Central \nAmerica. Yet when those wars were over, we turned our back. Today, with \nthe exception of our counter-drug programs in the Andes, which as we \nhave seen recently in Bolivia are of dubious merit, we spend a pittance \nto support economic and political development in these countries the \nmajority of whose people remain impoverished and without meaningful \npolitical or legal rights. Our policy is short sighted and it will cost \nus in the long run.\n  Of all countries in the hemisphere, none is more important to U.S. \ninterests than Mexico. it would be difficult to think of any issue--\nimmigration, tourism, trade, infectious disease, water security, \nenvironmental pollution, democracy and the rule of law, organized \ncrime--that does not cry out for broader cooperation. I hope President \nBush, and his capable new Assistant Secretary of State for Western \nHemisphere Affairs, Roger Noriega, will give renewed attention to these \nissues during the remaining years of President Fox's term.\n  I mention this because earlier this year, I sponsored, with Senator \nReid, Senator Daschle and others, an amendment which authorized $100 \nmillion to be spent in Mexico to promote micro credit programs, small \nbusiness entrepreneurship, private property ownership, and support for \nsmall farmers who have been affected by adverse economic conditions. I \nfelt it was important to make a strong statement, through legislation, \nthat we need to devote significant resources to help address these \nproblems. Our amendment was adopted, and it is my hope that we can \ninclude a portion of those funds for Mexico in the fiscal year 2004 \nForeign Operations Act.\n  But my support for providing those funds will depend on whether the \ncase which is the subject of the Washington Post article I mentioned is \nsatisfactorily resolved. The three Americans who have been arrested are \nthe victims of an absurd miscarriage of justice. Fortunately, according \nto the article, the American Embassy in Mexico is following the case \nclosely, and recognizes that these three people have done nothing \nwrong. To the contrary, they have generously cared for an ailing, \nelderly American, Russell Ames, who lost his wife Jean Ames three years \nago. Jean Ames was a wonderful woman, and her death was a great blow to \nRussell Ames. Ames, already in his late eighties at the time of his \nwife's death, would never have been able to continue to live in his \nhome in a small village near Oaxaca, Mexico, without the around-the-\nclock care of Mary Ellen Sanger and the other Americans who lived on \nthe property.\n\n  My office has conveyed my concern about the unlawful arrests and \ndetentions of these three Americans to the Mexican Embassy in \nWashington. These people should be immediately released and the cases \nagainst them dismissed. And, just as important, President Fox, who has \nrepeatedly said that his presidency stands for the rule of law, should \ndetermine whether the Mexican official who is responsible for this \ntravesty should be removed from his position.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the aforementioned article in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 18, 2003]\n\n         Three Americans Jailed in Bizarre Mexican Land Dispute\n\n\ncaretakers of man, 91, held in standoff involving a member of president \n                             fox's cabinet\n\n                          (By Kevin Sullivan)\n\n       Oaxaca, Mexico--Three U.S. citizens, including a man dying \n     of cancer, have been jailed here and face up to 14 years in \n     prison in a land dispute involving a member of President \n     Vicente Fox's cabinet.\n       The Americans, two men and a woman, are long-term friends \n     and caretakers for a former U.S. college professor, Russell \n     Ames, 91, who has lived in Oaxaca since 1959. Ames and his \n     late wife sold their land to the University of the Americas \n     in Mexico City in 1988 in exchange for lifetime rights to \n     remain on the property. But now the university, whose \n     president, Alejandro Gertz Manero, is on leave serving as \n     Fox's minister of public security, is trying to force Ames \n     off the land.\n       A municipal judge and a squad of state police officers \n     arrived at Ames's property on Friday in an attempt to evict \n     him. Neighbors said about 60 people who live in a nearby \n     village, including the mayor and police chief, came to \n     support Ames, blocking his removal.\n       Ames said that arresting his three friends on charges of \n     trying to take over the land for themselves was a \n     ``ridiculous'' attempt to intimidate him into leaving.\n       ``These three Americans are innocent bystanders and the \n     embassy feels what has happened to them is an outrage,'' said \n     Laura Clerici, consul general at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico \n     City, which has sent officials to monitor the case.\n       U.S. Ambassador Tony Garza has complained about the case to \n     Gertz, who is also a university trustee. Gertz said the \n     arrests were legal and that he has not improperly used his \n     influence in the case.\n       The case is one of a number of land disputes involving \n     Americans who live or own property in Mexico. Earlier this \n     year an American couple was forced off land they owned in the \n     southern state of Chiapas by local residents wielding \n     machetes. Three years ago scores of U.S. citizens lost \n     millions of dollars in investments when they were evicted \n     from oceanfront homes they bought in Ensenada in the western \n     state of Baja, California. U.S. officials at the time blamed \n     the losses on a lack of consistency and transparency in \n     Mexican property laws. At least half a dozen more major \n     disputes are pending over property owned by Americans along \n     the Caribbean coast.\n       ``We are being held hostage,'' Mary Ellen Sanger, one of \n     the three jailed Americans, said in an interview in a state \n     prison here. Sanger, 45, a native of Schenectady, N.Y., said \n     she had been assigned latrine-cleaning duty in the prison and \n     slept on a concrete floor with 44 other women in a communal \n     cell.\n       Sanger has been a caretaker, feeding, dressing and walking \n     with Ames for almost three years. Joseph Simpson, widower who \n     is about 72 and suffering from late-stage terminal throat \n     cancer, has been a caretaker on the property for more than \n     a decade. He is now under police guard at a Oaxaca \n     hospital, where U.S. Embassy officials who visited him \n     said he was in grave condition. John Barbato, 58, from \n     Nevada City, Calif., a poet and artist who has known Ames \n     since 1985, rents a small house on the property and is in \n     prison with Sanger.\n       Despite their longstanding ties to Ames and the property, \n     the three were arrested on Oct. 6 and charged with violently \n     taking possession of the land on May 1. U.S. officials said \n     the arrest warrant claimed the three Americans moved onto the \n     property that day in a conspiracy to take the land for \n     themselves, charges that carry a penalty of three to 14 years \n     in prison.\n       ``That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard,'' said Ames, \n     who was being fed dinner and ice cream by Sanger when a squad \n     of police arrived at his house to make the arrests. ``They \n     took care of me for several years. I felt enormously lucky to \n     be taken care of by them. Most people my age don't have \n     anybody, or are just miserable.''\n       The underlying issue behind the arrests is the dispute over \n     the land where Ames lives, a parcel worth an estimated \n     $250,000 in one of Mexico's most popular tourist \n     destinations.\n       Ames said the sale of his land to the university was part \n     of a charitable donation. Records show that the property was \n     in the name of his wife, Jean Ames, who transferred ownership \n     to the university for $60,000, half of its assessed value at \n     the time. Ames said he and his wife never received that \n     money; the listed purchase price was simply a legal formality \n     for tax purposes. In return, Ames said the university agreed \n     to allow him and his wife to live on the land for the rest of \n     their lives, and to pay them up to $4,000 a year.\n\n[[Page S12965]]\n\n       Gertz, who became president of the university in 1995, said \n     in an interview that the land deal was made with Jean Ames \n     only. The notarized sale agreement specifies that only she \n     would have lifetime rights to the land. But numerous letters \n     contained in Ames' files show that his wife intended that \n     both of them be allowed to live out their lives there.\n       ``If he's saying that I have no rights here at all, that's \n     ridiculous,'' Ames said. ``We were dealing with splendid \n     people at the university back then. And they made a provision \n     for me that I could live here for the rest of my life.''\n       Ames and his wife lived together on the land until Jean \n     Ames died in 2000 at age 92. Then, in May of this year, Ames \n     was served with an eviction notice by the university, giving \n     him nine days to vacate the property and ordering him to pay \n     nearly $40,000 in back rent--$1,000 a month since the death \n     of his wife. Ames said he was stunned and angry. He hired a \n     lawyer and filed a civil suit against the university, saying \n     he no longer wanted it to have his land. That case is \n     pending.\n       Gertz said that following the death of Jean Ames, Russell \n     Ames should have sent the university a letter asking \n     permission to remain on the property. However, despite the \n     eviction notice, Gertz said Ames would ``of course'' be \n     allowed to stay on the property until he dies if he seeks \n     university permission now.\n       Gertz said Sanger, Simpson and Barbato never asked the \n     university's permission to live on the land, so they were \n     trespassing and deserved to be arrested. But Ames said he \n     believes the three Americans were jailed on trumped-up \n     charges to intimidate him into leaving his property and \n     dropping his civil suit.\n       ``I hope this is a big bluff, but I'm scared,'' Barbato \n     said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/21/senate-section/article/S12965-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MAKING AMERICA STRONGER\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, in September I issued a major report on \nrestoring U.S. manufacturing. I commend this report to my colleagues. \nIt can be found at www.Lieberman.Senate.gov.\n  The collapse of our manufacturing sector is heart breaking. We have \nlost 14,00 manufacturing jobs in the last 3 months and 2.8 million \nsince July of 2000. And this is during what is supposed to be an \neconomic recovery. In terms of jobs, the U.S. manufacturing sector has \nslipped every month for the last 38 months. In my own State of \nConnecticut we have lost more than 14 out of every 100 manufacturing \njobs in the past 3 years, and it is cold comfort that we are not the \nworst.\n  Our manufacturing sector is hemorrhaging jobs at a dismaying rate. \nAnd not just jobs but industries. Economists at the Federal Reserve \nBank of New York recently published an analysis of the current \n``jobless recovery.'' Their conclusion is stark:\n\n       ``Our inquiry into the reasons for the current labor market \n     slump suggests that structural change has played an important \n     role. Industries that lost jobs during the recession have \n     continued to shrink during the recovery, and permanent job \n     losses have eclipsed temporary layoffs.''--``Has Structural \n     Change Contributed to a Jobless Recovery?'' (Erica L. Groshen \n     and Simon Potter)\n\n  As the report highlights, there are many reasons behind these closed \nplants, these lost jobs, these devastated families. Fierce competition \nfrom overseas competitors--some of them playing on fields tilted \ndistinctly in their favor--has played a major role. So did the severe \nrecessions we are only now climbing out of. The collapse of the telecom \nindustry had severe consequences for manufacturers that served the \nelectronics and information technology industries. This report \ndiscusses a number of challenges and problems facing American industry.\n  But the most imperative question remains, ``What does the Bush \nadministration intend to do about it?'' Its recent acknowledgment of \nforeign country manipulation of their currencies is welcome, but the \nAdministration is not utilizing its current authority to remedy this \nabuse; this is the key point of my legislation, S. 1592, the Fair \nCurrency Enforcement Act of 2003, discussed in depth in this report. \nCreating an Assistant Secretary for Manufacturing and Office of \nIndustry Analysis simply rearranges existing boxes, and submerges them \ndeep in the Commerce Department. This report recommends making the \nCommerce and Defense Secretaries themselves responsible. Their plan \nremains lacking in content and vision. It is all about gestures, not \nactions.\n  Forgive me, but the time has come to be blunt. Every sector of the \nAmerican economy plays a role in the strength and security of our \nnation, but the role played by manufacturing is unique, and uniquely \nimportant. To do nothing, to roll over and play dead, is not the \nAmerican way. Sadly, it seems to be the approach favored by the current \nAdministration.\n  The problems we face are complex, the response needs to be thorough, \nbroad-based, and coordinated. That is what this report is really about. \nHere we present the broadest, most comprehensive and insightful plan to \nrevitalize U.S. manufacturing yet proposed.\n  We need to understand that trade is not the problem, it is part of \nthe solution. And we need to deal with the obstacles raised in some \ncountries to a free and fair trade in American goods. We need to invest \nin the future of manufacturing, in the research and development of new, \npath-breaking manufacturing processes. We need to invest in our \nworkforce, in the training and education needed to excel and prosper in \na world labor market. We need to reinvigorate partnerships between \nstate and Federal Government, and between government and industry.\n  Indeed, this is not a task for government alone. The proposals \noutlined in this report call upon industry and academia, upon labor and \nmanagement, upon the private and public sectors to contribute to the \nsolutions we need.\n  It will require all of us, pulling together.\n  I want to thank Michael Baum, along with William Bonvillian and Chuck \nLudlam of my staff, for their efforts in preparing what I believe will \nbe a useful and timely report.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/21/senate-section/article/S12965-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12965-S12966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE AND TAX SHELTERS ACT\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator Levin's \nbill, S. 1767, the Auditor Independence and Tax Shelters Act. I am \npleased to be an original cosponsor. The Auditor Independence and Tax \nShelters Act compliments the legislation that I introduced last year, \nthe Tax Shelter Transparency Act.\n  Just this year, the Tax Shelter Transparency Act has been passed by \nthe Senate Finance Committee four times--in the Energy bill, the CARE \nAct, the Jobs and Growth bill, and most recently as part of the \nJumpstart Our Business Strength Act. The same legislation has passed \nthe full Senate three times--in the Energy bill, the CARE Act, and in \nthe Jobs and Growth bill.\n  Senator Levin's legislation shuts down tax shelter promotion from the \naudit and financial statement side of the equation. Specifically, S. \n1767 would strengthen auditor independence by prohibiting them from \nproviding tax shelter services to their audit clients. The legislation \nwould also reduce potential auditor conflicts of interest by codifying \nfour auditor independence principles to guide the audit committees of \nthe Board of Directors of a publicly traded company, when that \ncommittee is required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to decide whether the \ncompany may provide certain non-audit services to the corporation.\n  The proliferation of abusive tax shelters has been referred to as our \nnation's most significant tax compliance problem. The development, \nselling, and buying of tax shelters has also been characterized as a \n``race to the bottom.'' The New York State Bar Association said ``the \nconstant promotion of these frequently artificial transactions breeds \nsignificant disrespect for the tax system, encouraging responsible \ncorporate taxpayers to expect this type of activity to be the norm, and \nto follow the lead of other taxpayers who have engaged in tax \nadvantaged transactions.''\n  Simply put, this is unacceptable. It has been 2 years since the \ncollapse of Enron. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act took significant steps to \nrestore confidence in corporate America. But, when it comes to ensuring \nauditor independence, Sarbanes-Oxley did not go far enough. The passage \nof the Auditor Independence and Tax Shelters Act will help ensure that \nlast year's corporate reform efforts have their intended effect of \nrestoring real independence to the ``independent audit.''\n  This morning, the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing on tax \nshelters. We learned that the tax shelter problem is widespread. Tax \nshelter schemes are not just an Enron and Arthur Andersen phenomenon. \nThey are\n\n[[Page S12966]]\n\ndeveloped and promoted by accounting firms, law firms, and investment \nbanks. Many corporations and individuals purchase tax shelters.\n  To give you an idea of the burden they are placing on these honest \ntaxpayers--during the 1990s alone--actions taken to shut down the tax \nshelters that we knew about saved the American taxpayer $80 billion. \nMore recently, a study commissioned by the IRS estimates the current \ncost to honest taxpayers ranges from $14 billion to $18 billion a year. \nThat is up to $180 billion over ten years. I am simply unwilling to \ntell the schoolteacher in Montana that he needs to pony up a little \nmore because Congress is unwilling to shut down a loophole that is \ncosting tens of billions every year.\n  However, since the collapse of Enron, the Congress has failed to \nenact a single piece of tax legislation to curb tax shelter abuses. The \ntime has come to shut down these abusive practices. I urge all of my \ncongressional colleagues in the House and the Senate--to support the \nAuditor Independence and Tax Shelters Act and the Tax Shelter \nTransparency Act and send both of these pieces of tax shelter \nlegislation to the President for his signature by the end of the year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/21/senate-section/article/S12966-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO LUIS FERRE\n\n  Mr. CORZINE.

After graduation, Greg served as a Naval Officer aboard the USS \nKitty Hawk, U.S. Pacific Fleet, and then went to work at the Pentagon.\n  Following his distinguished career in the military, Greg continued to \nserve his country as an outstanding staff member of the United States \nSenate. For 18 years, Greg was Legislative Director and later Chief of \nStaff to our friend and colleague, Senator J. James Exon of Nebraska \nwhere Greg was instrumental in managing the work of the Senate Budget \nCommittee.\n  When Senator Exon retired in 1996, Greg left the Senate and became \nthe Director of Congressional Liaison and Business Development at ITT \nIndustries, Defense in McLean, VA.\n  Greg was a member of Emanuel Lutheran Church, the American Legion \nPost 199, the Military Order of the Carabao, the U.S. Navy Public \nAffairs Alumni Association and the Navy League.\n  Greg is survived by his loving and devoted wife, Diane McRee, one of \nmy own dear friends and herself a longtime staff member to the United \nStates Congress, and his cousin, Connie Traver.\n  I admired Greg.

The group sews in the morning, \nbreaks for lunch, and then returns to the quilting work in the \nafternoon.

The Vermont Standard is \nthe hometown weekly newspaper of Woodstock, VT, which sits alongside \nthe Ottauquechee River in Windsor County.\n  Every Thursday, residents of Windsor County can catch up on local \nsports scores, learn about their students' recent achievements, and \nread columns written by their neighbors about wildlife, the outdoors, \nand other community goings-on. Advertisements for area stores and \nbusinesses and photographs of neighbors at area events line the pages \nof the paper's sections. News from each town in the ``Town News'' \nsection is written by people who live in each town and who understand \neach town. Everybody receives The Vermont Standard and everybody reads \nit.\n  The Vermont Standard traces its origins back to April 29, 1853, when \nowner Louis Pratt, Jr. and editor Dr. Thomas Powers began publishing \nThe Vermont Temperance Standard with the goal of stopping the \nconsumption of alcohol and spreading the ideals of temperance. In \nJanuary 1857, Wilber P. Davis and Luther O. Greene bought the \nnewspaper, removed the word ``temperance'' from the title, and \nrededicated its influence through its circulation to the abolition of \nAmerican slavery. Following Greene's death, the newspaper enjoyed a \nlong line of respected owners, including W. H. Brown, W. H. Moore, \nRobert H. Matteson, Benton Dryden, Edward J. Bennett, and its current \npublisher, Phillip Cabot Camp.\n  As The Vermont Standard and its community celebrate this milestone, a \ngroup of local historians have been assembled as advisors during its \nanniversary. I congratulate the members of this executive board, \nincluding Publisher Phillip Camp, General Manager Jon Estey, Editor \nKevin Forrest, Howard Coffin, David Donath, Peter Jennison, Corwin \nSharp, Kathy Wendling, and Don Wickman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/21/senate-section/article/S12966-5", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12966-S12967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:07 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed S. 1591, an act to redesignate the facility of the United States \nPostal Service located at 48 South Broadway, Nyack, New York, as the \n``Edward O'Grady, Waverly Brown, Peter Paige Post Office Building'' \nwithout amendment.\n  The message further announced that the House has agreed to S.

A bill to amend the Food Security Act of 1985 to prohibit \nthe use of certain conservation funding to provide technical assistance \nunder the conservation reserve program; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce bipartisan \nlegislation with Senators Snowe, Burns, Jeffords, Lautenberg and Dodd \nto restore the conservation funding commitment Congress and the \nadministration made to farmers and ranchers in the 2002 farm bill.\n  Despite the historic conservation funding levels in the 2002 farm \nbill, family farmers and ranchers offering to restore wetlands, or \noffering to change the way they farm to improve air and water quality, \ncontinue to be rejected when they seek U.S. Department of Agriculture \n(USDA) conservation assistance. Producers are being turned away due to \nUSDA's decision earlier this year to divert $158.7 million from working \nlands conservation programs to pay for the cost of administering the \nConservation Reserve Program (CRP) and the Wetlands Reserve Program \n(WRP) despite a clear directive in the 2002 farm bill that the USDA use \nmandatory funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) to pay for \nCRP and WRP technical assistance. In particular, USDA diverted $107.9 \nmillion from the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), $27.6 \nfrom the Farmland and Ranchland Protection Program (FRPP), $14.6 \nmillion from the Grasslands Reserve Program, and $8.6 million from the \nWildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP) to pay for CRP and WRP \ntechnical assistance.\n  Although the 2002 farm bill clearly intended USDA to use CCC funds to \npay for CRP and WRP technical assistance, USDA continues to ignore \nCongress's intent. The plain language of the statute and the \nlegislative history, including a relevant colloquy, support this \ninterpretation of the farm bill, and the General Accounting Office \n(GAO) concurred in a recent memo. I ask unanimous consent the GAO's \nmemo be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  Our legislation would override USDA's decision and prevent funds from \nworking lands incentive programs like EQIP and WHIP from being diverted \nto pay for the technical assistance costs of CRP. The House Agriculture \nSubcommittee on Conservation has already approved similar legislation, \nH.R. 1907, requiring each program to pay for its own technical \nassistance needs. Our legislation parallels that effort, by requiring \nCRP to pay for its own technical assistance needs. Simply put, our \namendment would require the Administration to honor the 2002 Farm Bill \nand mandate that technical assistance for each program is derived from \nfunds provided for that program.\n  By providing more than $6.5 billion for working lands programs like \nEQIP and WHIP in the 2002 farm bill, Congress dramatically increased \nfunds to help farmers manage working lands to produce food and fiber \nand simultaneously enhance water quality and wildlife habitat. For \nexample, EQIP helps share the cost of a broad range of land management \npractices that help the environment, include more efficient use of \nfertilizers and pesticides, and innovative technologies to store and \nreuse animal waste. In combination, these working lands programs will \nprovide farmers the tools and incentives they need to help meet our \nmajor environmental challenges.\n\n  Full funding for working lands incentive programs like EQIP and WHIP \nis vital to helping farmers and ranchers improve their farm management \nand meeting America's most pressing environmental challenges. Because \n70 percent of the American landscape is private land, farming \ndramatically affects the health of America's rivers, lakes and bays and \nthe fate of America's rare species. Most rare species depend upon \nprivate lands for their survival, and many will become extinct without \nhelp from private landowners. When farmers and ranchers take steps to \nhelp improve air and water quality or assist rare species, they can \nface new costs, new risks, or loss of income. Conservation programs \nhelp share these costs, underwrite these risks, or offset these losses \nof income. Unless Congress provides adequate resources for these \nprograms, there is little reason to hope that our farmers and ranchers \nwill be able to help to meet these environmental challenges.\n  In addition, USDA conservation programs promote regional equity in \nfarm spending. More than 90 percent of USDA spending flows to a handful \nof large farmers in 15 midwestern and southern States. As a result, \nmany farmers and ranchers who are not eligible for traditional \nsubsidies--including dairy farmers, ranchers, and fruit and vegetable \nfarmers--rely upon conservation programs to boost farm and ranch income \nand to ease the cost of environmental compliance. Unlike commodity \nsubsidies, conservation payments flow to all farmers and all regions. \nBut the farmers and ranchers who depend upon these programs--farmers \nand ranchers who already receive a disproportionately small share of \nUSDA funds--have faced a disproportionately large cut in spending this \nyear.\n  It is time for Congress and the administration to honor the intent of \nthe 2002 farm bill, by fully funding working lands conservation \nprograms. The failure to adequately fund these working lands \nconservation programs is having a dramatic impact on both farmers and \nthe farm economy and could become worse in future years if Congress \ndoes not address this matter. I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S12972]]\n\n Funding for Technical Assistance for Conservation Programs Enumerated \n            in Section 2701 of the 2002 Farm Bill, B-291241\n\n                                                  October 8, 2002.\n     Hon. Herb Kohl,\n     Chairman.\n     Hon.

Henry Bonilla,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, FDA \n         & Related Agencies, Committee on Appropriations, House of \n         Representatives.\n       Subject: Funding for Technical Assistance for Conservation \n     Programs Enumerated in Section 2701 of the 2002 Farm Bill\n       This responds to your letters of August 30, 2002 (form \n     Chairman Bonilla) and September 16, 2002 (from Chairman Kohl \n     and Ranking Minority Member Cochran) requesting our opinion \n     on several issues relating to funding technical assistance \n     for the wetlands reserve program (WRP) and the farmland \n     protection program (FPP). You asked for our views on the \n     following issues:\n       (1) Does the annual limit on fund transfers imposed by 15 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 714i (known as the section 11 cap) apply to \n     Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) funds used for technical \n     assistance provided the WRP and FPP as authorized by the Farm \n     Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (2002 Farm Bill)?\n       (2) Is the Department of Agriculture's Conservation \n     Operations appropriation available for technical assistance \n     for the WRP and the FPP? and\n       (3) Did the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) July \n     18, 2002, decision not to apportion funds for technical \n     assistance for the WRP and the FPP violate the Impoundment \n     Control Act. [1]\n       For the reasons given below, we conclude that:\n       (1) the section 11 cap does not apply to funds for \n     technical assistance provided for the conservation \n     programs enumerated in section 3841, title 16, U.S.C., as \n     amended by section 2701 of the 2002 Farm Bill;\n       (2) the Conservation Operations appropriations is not an \n     available funding source for the WRP and the FPP operations \n     and associated technical assistance; and\n       (3) OMB's failure to initially apportion WRP and FPP funds \n     was a programmatic delay and did not constitute an \n     impoundment under the Impoundment Control Act. Further, since \n     OMB has approved recently submitted apportionments for these \n     two programs, and since budget authority for both the WRP and \n     the FPP was made available for obligation, there was no \n     impoundment of funds in fiscal year 2002.\n\n\n                               background\n\n       Section 2701 of the 2002 Farm Bill, Pub. L. No. 107-171, \n     116 Stat. 278, 279 (enacted on May 13, 2002) (codified at 16 \n     U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 3841 and 3842) amended section 1241 of the \n     Food Security Act of 1985, 16 U.S.C. Sec. 3841, to provide \n     that the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) shall use the \n     funds of the CCC to carry out seven conservation programs, \n     including the provision of technical assistance to, or on \n     behalf of, producers. The WRP and the FPP are among the \n     conservation programs named in the 2002 Farm Bill that are to \n     be funded with CCC funds.\n       In its June 19, 2002, apportionment request, the Department \n     of Agriculture (Agriculture) asked OMB to apportion a total \n     of $587,905,000 in CCC funds to the Natural Resources \n     Conservation Service (NRCS) for both financial and technical \n     assistance related to section 3841 conservation programs. SF \n     132, Apportionment and Reapportionment Schedule for Farms \n     Security and Rural Investment Programs, Account No. 1221004, \n     July 18, 2002. Of the amount requested, Agriculture \n     designated $68.7 million for technical assistance to be \n     provided under the conservation programs. In its July 18, \n     2002, apportionment, OMB apportioned all of the funds for \n     financial and technical assistance requested for the \n     conservation programs, except $22.7 million designated for \n     WRP and FPP technical assistance. Id. OMB reports that it did \n     not apportion funds for WRP and FPP technical assistance at \n     that time, because OMB believed that the section 11 cap, 15 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 714i, limited the amount of funds that could be \n     transferred from CCC to other government agencies for \n     technical assistance associated with the section 3841 \n     conservation programs, and that CCC funding of WRP and FPP \n     technical assistance would exceed the section 11 cap. Letter \n     from Philip J. Perry, General Counsel, OMB, to Susan A. \n     Poling, Managing Associate General Counsel, GAO, September \n     16, 2002. In discussions with Agriculture regarding the use \n     of CCC funds in excess of the section 11 cap for section 3841 \n     technical assistance, OMB indicated to Agriculture that \n     either CCC funds subject to the section 11 cap or \n     Agriculture's Conservation Operations appropriation could be \n     used to fund this technical assistance. Id.[2]\n       OMB reports that Agriculture recently submitted a new \n     apportionment request for $5.95 million for WRP technical \n     assistance (as well as the Conservation Reserve Program) \n     which OMB approved on September 3, 2002. Id. OMB also reports \n     that Agriculture submitted a new apportionment request for an \n     additional $2 million in FPP financial assistance, which OMB \n     approved on September 11, 2002, bringing the total \n     apportionment for the FPP to the $50 million authorized by \n     section 381. Id.\n\n\n                               discussion\n\n                           1. Section 11 Cap\n\n       The question whether the section 11 cap (15 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 714i) applies to technical assistance provided through \n     the conservation programs authorized by 16 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 3481, 3482, is one of statutory construction. It is \n     a well-established rule of statutory construction that \n     statutes should be construed harmoniously so as to give \n     maximum effect to both whenever possible. B-259975, Sept. 18, \n     1995, 96-1 CPD para. 124; B-258163, Sept. 29, 1994. Based \n     upon the language of the relevant statutes, we can read the \n     statutes in a harmonious manner, and, in doing so, we \n     conclude that the section 11 cap does not apply to technical \n     assistance provided under the section 3841 conservation \n     programs.\n       The section 11 cap is set forth in 15 U.S.C. Sec. 714i, \n     which states, in pertinent part:\n       ``The Corporation may, with the consent of the agency \n     concerned, accept and utilize, on a compensated or \n     uncompensated basis, the officers, employees, services, \n     facilities, and information of any agency of the Federal \n     Government, including any bureau, office, administration, or \n     other agency of the Department of Agriculture . . . . The \n     Corporation may allot to any bureau, office, administration, \n     or other agency of the Department of Agriculture or transfer \n     to such other agencies as it may request to assist it in the \n     conduct of its business any of the funds available to it for \n     administrative expenses. . . . After September 30, 1996, the \n     total amount of all allotments and fund transfers from the \n     Corporation under this section (including allotments and \n     transfers for automated data processing or information \n     resource management activities) for a fiscal year may not \n     exceed the total amount of the allotments and transfers made \n     under this section in fiscal year 1995.''\n       (Emphasis added.) We note that the section 11 funding \n     limitation applies only to funds transferred by the CCC to \n     other agencies under the authority of section 11.\n       The 2002 Farm Bill, which amended subsection (a) of section \n     3841, directs the Secretary to use CCC funds to carry out the \n     WRP and the FPP and five other conservation programs, \n     including the provision of technical assistance as part of \n     these programs. As amended, 16 U.S.C. Sec. 3841 provides, in \n     pertinent part, as follows:\n       ``For each of fiscal years 2002 through 2007, the Secretary \n     shall use the funds, facilities, and authorities of the \n     Commodity Credit Corporation to carry out the following \n     programs under subtitle D (including the provision of \n     technical assistance):\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       (2) The wetlands reserve program under subchapter C of \n     chapter 1.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       (4) The farmland protection program under subchapter B of \n     chapter 2, using, to the maximum extent practicable--(A) \n     $50,000,000 in fiscal year 2002 * * * ''\n       16 U.S.C. Sec. 3841(a) (emphasis added). Section 3841 \n     provides independent authority for the provision of technical \n     services to these programs.\n       The 2002 Farm Bill also added a new subsection (b) to \n     section 3841. It is this provision that has generated the \n     current dilemma: ``Nothing in this section affects the limit \n     on expenditures for technical assistance imposed by section \n     11 of the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act (15 U.S.C. \n     714i).'' 16 U.S.C. Sec. 3841(b). When read in the context of \n     section 11, section 3841(b) makes clear that the section 11 \n     cap applies only to funds transferred under section 11. \n     Section 11 specifically imposes the cap on ``fund transfers . \n     . . . under this section.'' Section 11 by its terms clearly \n     does not apply to amounts transferred under other authority, \n     such as section 3841(a). And we read section 3841(b) to make \n     plain that, while the section 11 cap continues to apply to \n     amounts transferred under section 11, it does not apply to \n     amounts transferred by section 3841(a).\n       Accordingly, reading the above provisions harmoniously, we \n     conclude that: (1) the section 11 cap by its own terms \n     applies only to CCC funds transferred to other agencies under \n     section 11; (2) 16 U.S.C. Sec. 3841(a) provides independent \n     authority for the Secretary to fund the seven conservation \n     programs named in that section out of CCC funds; and (3) 16 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 3841(b) makes it clear that, while the section 11 \n     cap still applies to funds transferred by the CCC to other \n     government agencies for work performed pursuant to the \n     authority of section 11, the section 11 cap does not apply to \n     the seven conservation programs that are funded with CCC \n     funds under the authority of 16 U.S.C. Sec. 3841(a).\n       Our conclusion that the section 11 cap does not apply to \n     the seven conservation programs of section 384(a) is \n     confirmed by a review of the legislative history of the 2002 \n     Farm Bill, which shows that the Congress was attempting to \n     make clear that section 3841 technical assistance was not \n     affected by the section 11 cap. The legislative history to \n     the 2002 Farm Bill unambiguously supports the view that the \n     Congress did not intend the section 11 cap to limit the \n     funding for technical assistance provided under the section \n     3841 conservation programs. In discussing the cap the \n     Conference Committee stated: ``The Managers understand the \n     critical nature of providing adequate funding for technical \n     assistance. For that reason, technical assistance should come \n     from individual program funds.'' H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 107-424 \n     at 497 (May 1, 2002) (emphasis added). In discussing \n     administration and funding of these\n\n[[Page S12973]]\n\n     conservation programs, the Conference Committee further \n     explained that:\n       The Managers provide that funds for technical assistance \n     shall come directly from the mandatory money provide for \n     conservation programs under Subtitle D. (Section 2701).\n       In order to ensure implementation, the Managers believe \n     that technical assistance must be an integral part of all \n     conservation programs authorized for mandatory funding. \n     Accordingly, the Managers have provided for the payment of \n     technical assistance from program accounts, The Managers \n     expect technical assistance for all conservation programs to \n     follow the model currently used for the EQIP whereby the \n     Secretary determines, on an annual basis, the amount of \n     funding for technical assistance. Furthermore, the Managers \n     intend that the funding will cover costs associated with \n     technical assistance, such as administrative and overhead \n     costs.''\n       H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 107-424 at 48-499 (2002) (Emphasis \n     added).\n       The ``EQIP model'' that the conferees referred to was \n     established in the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform \n     Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-127, Subtitle E, Sec. 341, 110 \n     Stat. 888, 1007 (1996) (1996 Farm Bill). For fiscal years \n     1996 through 2002, the Secretary was to use CCC funds to \n     carry out the CRP, WRP and the Environmental Quality \n     Incentives programs (EQIP). [3] Id. (Former 16 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3841(a)). More specifically, the 1996 Farm Bill \n     authorized the Secretary to use CCC funds for technical \n     assistance (as well as cost-share payments, incentive \n     payments, and education) under the EQIP program. 16 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3841(b). Id. [4] While the 1996 Farm Bill authorized the \n     use of CCC funds to carry out the CRP and WRP programs, it \n     did not specifically authorize the funding of technical \n     assistance out of program funds as it did for EQIP.\n       Importantly, five days before enactment of the 2002 Farm \n     Bill when the Senate was considering the Conference Report on \n     the Farm Bill, a colloquy among Senators Harkin, Chairman, \n     Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, Lugar, \n     its Ranking Republican Member, and Cochran, an Agriculture \n     Committee member, [5] makes it unmistakably clear that the \n     section 11 cap was not meant to apply to the provision of \n     technical assistance with respect to any of the conservation \n     programs named in 16 U.S.C. Sec. 3841(a):\n       ``Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I wish to engage in a colloquy \n     with the distinguished Senators from Iowa and Mississippi. \n     Mr. President, the 1996 farm bill contained a provision which \n     led to serious disruption in the delivery of conservation \n     programs. Specifically, the 1996 act placed a cap on the \n     transfers of Commodity Credit Corporation funds to other \n     government entities. Is the distinguished Senator from Iowa \n     aware of the so-called ``section 11 cap?''\n       Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Indiana for raising \n     this issue, because it is an important one. The Section 11 \n     cap prohibited expenditures by the Commodity Credit \n     Corporation beyond the Fiscal Year 1995 level to reimburse \n     other government entities for services. Unfortunately, in the \n     1996 farm bill, many conservation programs were \n     unintentionally caught under the section 11 cap. As a result, \n     during the past 8 years, conservation programs have had \n     serious shortfalls in technical assistance. There was at \n     least one stoppage of work on the Conservation Reserve \n     Program. The Appropriations Committees have had to respond to \n     the problem ad hoc by redirecting resources and providing \n     emergency spending to deal with the problem. This has been a \n     problem not just in my state of Iowa or in your states of \n     Indiana and Mississippi; it has been a nationwide constraint \n     on conservation.\n       Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Chairman for the clarification, \n     and I would inquire whether the legislation under \n     consideration here today will fix the problem of the section \n     11 cap for conservation programs.\n       Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Mississippi for his \n     attention to this important issue. Section 2701 [16 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3841] of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of \n     2002 recognizes that technical assistance is an integral part \n     of each conservation program. Therefore, technical assistance \n     will be funded through the mandatory funding for each program \n     provided by the bill. As a result, for directly funded \n     programs, such as the Conservation Security Program (CSP) and \n     the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), funding \n     for technical assistance will come from the borrowing \n     authority of the Commodity Credit Corporation, and will no \n     longer be affected by section 11 of the CCC Charter Act.\n       For those programs such as the CRP, WRP, and the Grasslands \n     Reserve Program (GRP), which involve enrollment based on \n     acreage, the technical assistance funding will come from the \n     annual program outlays apportioned by OMB again, from the \n     borrowing authority of the CCC. These programs, too, will no \n     longer be affected by section 11 of the CCC Charter Act. This \n     legislation will provide the level of funding necessary to \n     cover all technical assistance costs, including training; \n     equipment; travel; education, evaluation and assessment, and \n     whatever else is necessary to get the programs implemented.\n       Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chairman for that clarification. \n     With the level of new resources and new workload that we are \n     requiring from the Department, and specifically the Natural \n     Resources Conservation Service, I hear concerns back in my \n     state that program delivery should not be disrupted, and the \n     gentleman has reassured me that it will not.''\n       148 Cong. Rec. S3979, 4020 (daily ed. May 8, 2002) \n     (emphasis added). In our view, the Congress intended all \n     funding for the seven conservation programs authorized in \n     section 3841 (Sec. 2701 of the 2002 Farm Bill), including \n     funding for technical assistance, to be mandatory funding \n     drawn from individual program funds, rather than from CCC's \n     administrative funds that are subject to the section 11 cap. \n     Accordingly, based on the language of 3841, we conclude that \n     the section 11 cap does not apply to funds for technical \n     assistance provided under the conservation programs \n     enumerated in section 3841.\n       2. Availability of the Conservation Operations \n     Appropriation. The next issue is whether the Department of \n     Agriculture's Conservation Operations appropriation is \n     available for technical assistance for the WRP and the FPP. \n     As noted above, this issue arose when OMB advised Agriculture \n     that its Conservation Operations appropriation could be used \n     to fund this technical assistance. For the reasons that \n     follow, we conclude that Agriculture may not use its \n     Conservation Operations appropriation to fund the WRP and \n     FPP.\n       The fiscal year 2002 Appropriation for the Conservation \n     Operations account provides in pertinent part:\n\n\n     Natural Resources Conservation Service Conservation Operations\n\n       ``For necessary expenses for carrying out the provisions of \n     the Act of April 27, 1935 (16 U.S.C. 590a-f), including \n     preparation of conservation plans and establishment of \n     measures to conserve soil and water (including farm \n     irrigation and land drainage and such special measures for \n     soil and water management as may be necessary to prevent \n     floods and the siltation of reservoirs and to control \n     agricultural related pollutants); operation of conservation \n     plant materials centers; classification and mapping of soil; \n     dissemination of information; acquisition of lands, water, \n     and interests therein for use in the plant materials program \n     by donation, exchange, or purchase. . . .''\n       Pub. L. No. 107-76, 115 Stat. 704 at 717, 718 (2001). In \n     addition to its availability to carry out the provisions of \n     the Act of April 27, 1935 (16 U.S.C. Sec. 590a-f), the fiscal \n     year 2002 Conservation Operations appropriation is also \n     available to carry out a variety of other specified programs \n     such as those authorized by 7 U.S.C. Sec. 428a, 7 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2209b, 7 U.S.C. Sec. 2250a, Sec. 202(c) of title II of \n     the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act of 1974 (43 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1592(c)): section 706(a) of the Organic Act of \n     1944 (7 U.S.C. Sec. 2225), for employment under 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3109 and 16 U.S.C. Sec. 590e-2.\n       OMB asserts that the language of the Conservation \n     Operations appropriation and the Act of April 27, 1935 cited \n     therein are broad enough to encompass the technical \n     assistance that Agriculture will provide under the WRP, the \n     FPP and the other section 3841 conservation programs. Since \n     the technical services provided by Agriculture under the WRP \n     and the FPP (and other section 3841 conservation programs) \n     fall within the general purposes articulated in the fiscal \n     year 2002 Conservation Operations appropriation, OMB \n     considers the Conservation Operations appropriation as an \n     additional available source of funding for technical \n     assistance provided as part of the section 3841 \n     conservation programs. In other words, the Conservation \n     Operations appropriation is available to continue \n     financing for the FPP and the WRP, when, in OMB's view, \n     the section 11 cap limits the availability of CCC funds \n     for those programs. We do not agree.\n       First, the Conservation Operations appropriation identifies \n     specific programs that it is available to fund, including the \n     authority to carry out the provisions of the Act of April 27, \n     1935 (16 U.S.C. Sec. 590a-f) cited by OMB above. However, \n     none of the specific statutory programs identified in the \n     Conservation Operations appropriation include the FPP or the \n     WRP found in 16 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 3838h-3838i and 3837-3737f, \n     respectively. The FPP and the WRP were authorized by Title \n     XII of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, and the \n     provisions of the Food Security Act of 1985 are not among the \n     statutes listed in the Conservation Operations appropriation \n     as an object of that appropriation. Thus, the Conservation \n     Operations appropriation by its own terms does not finance \n     Agriculture programs and activities under the Food Security \n     Act. [6] [7]\n       Second, even if the language of the Conservation Operations \n     appropriation could reasonably be read to include the WRP and \n     the FPP, section 3841, as amended by the 2002 Farm Bill, very \n     specifically requires that funding for technical assistance \n     will come from the ``funds, facilities, and authorities'' of \n     the CCC. Indeed, the statute is unequivocal--the Secretary \n     ``shall use the funds'' of the CCC to carry out the seven \n     conservation programs, including associated technical \n     assistance. It is well settled that even an expenditure that \n     may be reasonably related to a general appropriation may not \n     be paid out of that appropriation where the expenditure falls \n     specifically within the scope of another appropriation. 63 \n     Comp. Gen. 422, 427-28, 432 (1984); B-290005, July 1, \n     2002.[8]\n       Third, this view is supported by the Senate colloquy on the \n     2002 Farm Bill Conference report:\n       ``Mr. COCHRAN. It is then my understanding that, under the \n     provisions of this bill, the technical assistance necessary \n     to implement the conservation programs will not come at the \n     expense of the good work already going on in the countryside \n     in conservation planning, assistance to grazing\n\n[[Page S12974]]\n\n     lands, and other activities supported within the NRCS \n     conservation operations account. And, further, this action \n     will relieve the appropriators of an often reoccurring \n     problem.\n       Mr. HARKIN. Both gentlemen are correct. The programs \n     directly funded by the CCC-EQIP, FPP, WHIP, and the CSP--as \n     well as the acreage programs--CRP, WRP, and the GRP--include \n     funding for technical assistance that comes out of the \n     program funds. And this mandatory funding in no way affects \n     the ongoing work of the NRCS Conservations Operations \n     Program.''\n       148 Cong. Rec. S3979, 4020 (daily ed. May 8, 2002) \n     (emphasis added). This colloquy underscores the understanding \n     that the 2002 Farm Bill specifically requires that funding \n     for technical assistance will come from the borrowing \n     authority of the CCC and will not interfere with other \n     activities supported by the Conservation Operations \n     appropriation.\n       Furthermore, before passage of the 1996 Farm Bill, which \n     made a number of conservation programs, including the WRP, \n     mandatory spending programs, the WRP received a separate \n     appropriation for that purpose. In other words, before the \n     1996 farm bill provided CCC funding to run the program, the \n     WRP was not funded out of the Conservation Operations \n     appropriation. Pub. L. No. 103-330, 108 Stat. 2453 (1994); \n     Pub. L. No. 102-142, 105 Stat. 897 (1991). Moreover, \n     Agriculture has previously concluded that the Conservation \n     Operations appropriation is not available to fund technical \n     assistance with respect to programs authorized under \n     provisions of the Food Security Act. Their reasoning tracks \n     ours--the provisions of the Food Security Act are not among \n     the statutes cited in the Conservation Operations \n     appropriation. Memorandum from Stuart Shelton, Natural \n     Resources Division to Larry E. Clark, Deputy Chief for \n     Programs, Natural Resources Conservation Service and P. \n     Dwight Holman, Deputy Chief for Management, Natural Resources \n     Conservation Service, October 7, 1998 (Conservation \n     Operations appropriation is not available to fund technical \n     assistance for the Conservation Reserve Program); GAO/RCED-\n     99-247R, Conservation Reserve Program Technical Assistance, \n     at 9 (Aug. 5, 1999).\n       Thus, the Conservation Operations appropriation is not an \n     available funding source for WRP and FPP operations and \n     associated technical assistance. To the extent that \n     Agriculture might have used the Conservation Operations \n     appropriation for WRP, Agriculture would need to adjust its \n     accounts accordingly, deobligating amounts it had charged to \n     the Conservation Operations appropriation and charging those \n     amounts to the CCC funds. We note that in this event OMB \n     would need to apportion additional amounts from CCC funds to \n     cover such obligations.\n       3. Impoundment Control Act\n       The last question is whether OMB's July 18, 2002, decision \n     not to apportion funds for technical assistance for the WRP \n     and the FPP constitutes an impoundment under the Impoundment \n     Control Act of 1974. Based upon the most recent information \n     provided by OMB, to the extent OMB did not initially \n     apportion funds for the FPP or the WRP, the delay was \n     programmatic and did not constitute an impoundment of funds. \n     Also, based on information recently provided by OMB, no \n     impoundment of funds is occurring with respect to the FPP or \n     the WRP.\n       We generally define an impoundment as any action or \n     inaction by the President, the Director of OMB or any federal \n     agency that delays the obligation or expenditure of budget \n     authority provided in law. Glossary or Terms Used in the \n     Federal Budget Process, Exposure Draft, GAO/AFMD-2.1.1, Page \n     52 (1993).[9] However, our decisions distinguish between \n     programmatic withholdings outside the reach of the \n     Impoundment Control Act and withholdings of budget authority \n     that qualify as impoundments subject to the Act's \n     requirements. B-290659, July 24, 2002. Sometimes delays are \n     due to legitimate program reasons. Programmatic delays \n     typically occur when an agency is taking necessary steps to \n     implement a program even if funds temporarily go unobligated. \n     Id. Such delays do not constitute impoundments and do not \n     require the sending of a special message to the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate under 2 U.S.C. Sec. 684(a). \n     Id.\n       Here, OMB initially did not apportion funds for WRP and FPP \n     technical assistance because it believed the section 11 cap \n     was applicable and would be exceeded. OMB's General Counsel \n     states that OMB reserved apportioning budget authority to \n     discuss its funding concerns with Agriculture. These funding \n     concerns generated a ``vigorous and healthy internal legal \n     discussion'' between the Department of Agriculture and OMB. \n     Letter from Nancy Bryson, General Counsel, Department of \n     Agriculture to the Honorable Tom Harkin, Chairman, Senate \n     Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, September \n     24, 2002. Since OMB delayed apportionment of technical \n     assistance funds because of uncertainty concerning the \n     applicability of statutory restrictions and since OMB \n     approved Agriculture's subsequent apportionment requests, we \n     conclude that OMB did not impound funds under the Impoundment \n     Control Act. See B-290659, July 24, 2002 (delay in obligating \n     funds because of uncertainty whether statutory conditions \n     were met did not constitute an impoundment).\n       As noted above, according to OMB, Agriculture recently \n     submitted revised apportionment requests for technical \n     assistance for both the FPP and the WRP, and OMB has approved \n     the revised apportionments. For the FPP, Agriculture \n     requested an additional apportionment for financial \n     assistance of $2 million, bringing the total amount available \n     for obligation to $50 million. Thus, the entire $50 million \n     in FPP funds authorized by section 3841 have been \n     apportioned. Since OMB advises that it has apportioned the \n     full funding amount and that is available for obligation, \n     these funds were not impounded for the FPP.\n       As for the WRP funding, as noted above, on June 19, 2002, \n     Agriculture asked OMB to apportion a total of $20,655,000 for \n     WRP technical assistance. OMB did not apportion this amount. \n     SF 132, Apportionment and Reapportionment Schedule for Farms \n     Security and Rural Investment Programs, Account No. 1221004, \n     July 18, 2002. On August 30, 2002, Agriculture requested an \n     apportionment of WRP (and CRP) technical assistance for \n     totaling $5,950,000. SF 132, Apportionment and \n     Reapportionment Schedule for Commodity Credit Corporation \n     Reimbursable Agreements and Transfers to State and Federal \n     Agencies, Account No. 12X4336. On September 3, 2002, OMB \n     approved this request and apportioned $5,950,000. Id. Since \n     OMB apportioned the budget authority for the WRP and it was \n     made available for obligation, there was no impoundment of \n     funds in fiscal year 2002.\n       While the present record does not establish an impoundment \n     of the fiscal year 2002 funds appropriated for the WRP and \n     the FPP, we will continue to monitor this situation to ensure \n     that any impoundment that might occur in fiscal year 2003 for \n     conservation programs is timely reported.\n       We hope you find this information useful.

We are sending copies of this \n     letter to the Secretary of Agriculture, Director of the \n     Office of Management and Budget, the Chairman and Ranking \n     Minority Members of the House and Senate Agriculture \n     Committees and other interested Congressional Committees. \n     This letter will also be available on GAO's home page at \n     http://www.gao.gov.\n                                                Anthony H. Gamboa,\n                                                  General Counsel.\n\n                            B-291241 Digests\n\n       1. 15 U.S.C. Sec. 724i authorizes the Commercial Credit \n     Corporation (CCC) to use employees from other agencies, and, \n     subject to a maximum limitation set at the fiscal year 1995 \n     level (the ``section 11 cap''), CCC may make transfers from \n     its funds available for administrative purposes to those \n     agencies to reimburse them for their assistance to CCC in the \n     conduct of its business. 16 U.S.C. Sec. 3841 (as amended by \n     section 2701 of the 2002 Farm Bill, enacted May 13, 2002) \n     specifically provides that the Secretary of Agriculture \n     ``shall use the funds'' of the CCC to carry out seven \n     conservation programs (including the wetlands reserve program \n     and the farm protection program) named therein, including \n     technical assistance. Based upon the language of the \n     statutes, we conclude that the section 11 cap does not apply \n     to technical assistance provided under the section 3841 \n     conservation programs.\n       2. 16 U.S.C. Sec. 3841 specifically provides that the \n     Secretary of Agriculture ``shall use the funds'' of the \n     Commercial Credit Corporation (CCC) to carry out seven \n     conservation programs (including the wetlands reserve program \n     and the farm protection program) named therein, including \n     technical assistance. Therefore, the Secretary is required to \n     see CCC funds for the conservation programs named in section \n     3841, including for technical assistance, rather than funds \n     from the Department of Agriculture's more general \n     Conservation Operations appropriation.\n       3. Where the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) \n     initially did not apportion funds for technical assistance \n     for the wetlands reserve program (WRP) and the farm \n     protection program (FPP) because of OMB's uncertainty \n     concerning applicability of statutory funding restrictions, \n     and where OMB subsequently approved the Department of \n     Agriculture's revised apportionment requests for the WRP and \n     the FPP, the delay in apportioning funds was programmatic and \n     did not constitute an impoundment of funds.\n\n\n                                 notes\n\n       [1] In addition to the WRP and the FPP, Chairman Kohl and \n     Senator Cochran asked about the Conservation Reserve Program \n     (CRP) as one of the programs for which OMB had failed to \n     apportion funds. The letter arrived after we had already \n     received a response to a detailed set of inquiries sent to \n     OMB and Agriculture regarding the WRP and the FPP. In the \n     interest of time, we did not send a second letter asking OMB \n     to address the CRP program. However, the CRP is covered by \n     the same general authorities applicable to the WRP and \n     the FPP. The CRP is also a program authorized by the Food \n     Security Act of 1985, as amended. Therefore, to the extent \n     funds were not apportioned for the CRP under the same \n     circumstances as the FPP and the WRP, the same legal \n     principles outlined herein should apply.\n       [2] The Department of Agriculture concurred with OMB's \n     responses to our substantive questions regarding these \n     issues. Letter from Nancy Bryson, General Counsel, Department \n     of Agriculture to Susan A. Poling, Managing Associate General \n     Counsel, GAO, September 16, 2002.\n       [3] EQIP is a voluntary conservation program for farmers \n     and ranchers that promotes agricultural production and \n     environmental quality as compatible national goals.

The language \n     was not included in the final version of the Agriculture \n     Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1999.\n       [8] OMB cites language in the legislative history of the \n     Fiscal Year 2002 appropriations act that appears to support \n     the use of the Conservation Operations appropriation for \n     conservation technical assistance, and in particular WRP and \n     CRP assistance. Our own review of the legislative history \n     finds language that indicates a congressional intent that \n     technical assistance for the conservation programs in \n     question must be funded from CCC funds. However, in view of \n     the subsequent enactment of the 2002 Farm Bill, which \n     specifically and unequivocally requires that funding for \n     technical assistance for conservation programs named in 16 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 3841 shall come from CCC funds, we do not \n     consider the legislative history controlling.\n       [9] There are two types of impoundment actions--deferrals \n     and rescissions. A deferral is a temporary withholding or \n     delay in obligating or any other type of executive action \n     which effectively precludes the obligation or expenditure of \n     budget authority. Glossary of Terms Used in the Federal \n     Budget Process, Exposure Draft, GAO/AFMD-2.1.1, Page 38 \n     (1993). Deferrals are authorized only to provide for \n     contingencies, to achieve savings made possible by changes in \n     requirements or greater efficiency of operations, or as \n     otherwise specifically provided by law. See 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 684. A rescission involves the cancellation of budget \n     authority previously provided by Congress (before that \n     authority would otherwise expire) and can be accomplished \n     only through legislation enacted by Congress that cancels the \n     availability of budgetary resources previously provided by \n     law. See Glossary of Terms Used in the Federal Budget \n     Process, Exposure Draft, GAO/AFMD-2.1.1, Page 70 (1993).\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 1766\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PROHIBITION ON USE OF CERTAIN CONSERVATION FUNDING \n                   FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR CONSERVATION \n                   RESERVE PROGRAM.\n\n       Section 1241(b)(1) of the Food Security Act of 1985 (16 \n     U.S.C. 3841(b)(1)) is amended by inserting before the period \n     at the end the following: ``(other than the conservation \n     reserve program under subchapter B of chapter 1)''.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, Senator \nLeahy and Senator Burns, in cosponsoring the Conservation Technical \nAssistance Act to preserve funding for our Nation's working lands \nconservation programs. Through these valuable programs, farmers across \nthe country are able to participate in voluntary farmland, grassland, \nenvironmental and wildlife conservation programs that balance \nstewardship goals with on-farm production. For many States that do not \nreceive large crop subsidies, including Maine, conservation programs \nare the principal source of Federal assistance and are a valuable tool \nfor helping small and specialty crop growers enhance their production \nwhile caring for the land.\n  This legislation does not set new policy, rather it reinforces the \nmandates Congress made in the 2002 farm bill. Congress recognized the \nimportance of conservation in agriculture by significantly increasing \nfunding for the working lands conservation programs in the 2002 farm \nbill. Under the new farm law, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) \nshould have expanded the opportunity for farmers to practice \nenvironmental stewardship.\n  Unfortunately, the USDA has not followed through on congressional \nintent. Over the past year, the USDA has diverted $158 million from the \nEnvironmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), the Farm and Ranchland \nProtection Program (FRPP), the Wildlife Habitat Improvement Program \n(WHIP), and the Grassland Reserve Program (GRP) to pay for technical \nassistance of the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). As a result of \nthese actions, countless numbers of farmers were prevented from \nparticipating in working lands conservation programs.\n  Without corrective action, farmers' conservation options will be \ncurtailed even more severely as the USDA transfers funding to other \nprograms in the Department. I join my distinguished colleagues today \nbecause I believe it is high time that Congress intervene with a \nsolution.\n\n  The northeast is home to an incredible array of agricultural products \ngrown by producers both large and small, and, in some cases, sold \nlocally or nationally. In northern Maine, fields of potatoes stretch \nfor miles along the rolling hills of Aroostook County. Along the \neastern coast, wild blueberry barrens dot the maritime horizon. Diary \nfarms populate much of inland Maine, and nearly every other type of \nspeciality crop is grown in farms across the State. Despite the unique \nneeds of each grower, the one common thread between these farmers is \ntheir nearly unanimous support for the additional commitment Congress \nmade to working lands conservation programs in the 2002 farm bill.\n  These programs are the State's most effective and substantial source \nof Federal agricultural support. EQIP, FRPP, WHIP, and GRP make up the \nlion's share of funding for many States that do not grow traditionally \nsubsidized row crops. Maine, with its diverse agricultural sector, is a \nprime example of a State that relies on working lands conservation \nprograms to both enhance production and conserve our natural resources. \nFunds from these programs can be used for projects such as irrigation \nassistance, water quality, soil erosion control, crop rotation, and \nother practices. Yet, we are finding these very programs and the \nbenefit they provide being cut by the very department that is tasked \nwith funding them, the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n  In fiscal year 2003, the USDA diverted over $158 million from key \nworking lands conservation programs to pay for technical assistance for \nCRP. The funding shortfall created by this diversion has dramatically \nreduced the available resources for EQIP, FRPP, WHIP, and GRP and led \nour States to have to deny assistance to countless willing farmers. As \nmore acres become available to be enrolled in CRP in future years and \nthe program's technical assistance costs rise, the impact on working \nlands conservation programs will become more severe.\n  It would have been unnecessary to raid working lands conservation \nprograms to pay for CRP had the Department adhered to the specific \nlanguage in the 2002 farm bill. In fact, Congress anticipated the need \nto fund technical assistance for CRP and provided specific language in \nthe 2002 farm bill directing the Department to use mandatory funding to \npay for CRP technical assistance.\n  Until we can reach a broader agreement on implementation of the 2002 \nfarm bill provision on conservation technical assistance, it is \nimperative that we take steps to hold our working lands conservation \nprograms harmless. This legislation does this by simply, but \nexplicitly, stating that the USDA may not take funding from working \nlands conservation programs to pay for CRP technical assistance. This \nclarification will allow EQIP, FRPP, WHIP, and GRP to retain the \nfunding that Congress provides. It does not add or subtract funding \nfrom an account, rather it makes sure that the funds are used by the \nprogram for which Congress intended.\n  Maine's farmers and our farm community cannot afford to be short \nchanged for another year. In fiscal year 2003, my state received a \nlittle more than $8 million in conservation funding compared with the \npromise for $12 million as required by the regional equity provision of \nthe 2002 farm bill. This short-fall in funding not only meant less \ndirect assistance to farmers, but it led the USDA to propose cutting 20 \nNatural Resource Conservation Service staff positions throughout Maine. \nWhile I am pleased that the USDA decided against laying off these NRCS \nworkers, the specter of further conservation shortfalls in the future \ndoes not bode well for my State. I cannot allow both farmers and the \nprofessionals who support them to suffer because of USDA's actions.\n\n[[Page S12976]]\n\n  In closing, I would like to again thank the Senator from Vermont and \nthe Senator from Montana for working to craft a temporary solution to \nthe conservation technical assistance problem. I believe that this is \nthe right step to take and I hope to continue working with my \ncolleagues to address the problem down the road. I urge my colleagues \nto support this measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 1767. A bill to prevent corporate auditors from providing tax \nshelter services to their audit clients; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing with the \ncosponsorship of Senator McCain and Senator Baucus the Auditor \nIndependence and Tax Shelters Act, a bill designed to strengthen \nauditor independence by prohibiting audit companies from selling tax \nshelter services to the publicly traded companies they audit and to the \nofficers and directors of those companies.\n  Last year, Senators McCain, Baucus and I each participated in \ninvestigations conducted by our respective Committees, the Committees \non Commerce, Finance, and Governmental Affairs, into corporate \nmisconduct by Enron and other major U.S. companies, including \nparticipation in misleading accounting and tax practices. These \ninvestigations led each of us to focus on the role of accounting firms \nin, not only going along with publicly traded companies' using abusive \ntax shelters, but also selling them the very tax shelters they used to \noverstate their earnings on their financial statements.\n  In fact, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, on which I am \nthe Ranking Minority Member, has spent the last year investigating the \nroles played by accounting firms and other professional organizations \nsuch as banks, investment advisors and law firms, in developing, \nmarketing and implementing abusive tax shelters. The Finance Committee \nheld a hearing today on this same topic.\n  Tax shelters have become a huge business in this country. An 1998 \narticle in Forbes magazine--five years ago--described how tax shelter \nuse was growing even then:\n\n       Pay attention. These letters are prime evidence of a \n     thriving industry that has received scant public notice: the \n     hustling of corporate tax shelters. These shelters are being \n     peddled, sometimes in cold-call pitches, to thousands of \n     companies. Will the shelters hold up in court? Maybe yes, \n     maybe no, but many schemes capitalize on the fact that \n     neither the tax code nor the IRS can keep up with the exotica \n     of modern corporate finance. Hesitant at first to \n     participate, respectable accounting firms, law offices and \n     public corporations have lately succumbed to competitive \n     pressures and joined the loophole frenzy.\n\n  A March 2003 article in BusinessWeek magazine states that U.S. \ncorporations are some of the biggest players in the tax shelter game:\n\n       The federal tax rate for corporations is 35%, but few pay \n     that much. . . . Many have achieved the Holy Grail of \n     corporate finance: steadily growing profits coupled with a \n     dramatically shrinking tax burden. . . . [I]n the late 1990s, \n     the hunt for tax breaks became a much bigger business. . . . \n     Tax avoidance became a competitive sport, with even blue-chip \n     companies aggressively benchmarking their effective tax rates \n     against those of rivals. According to a recent Harvard \n     University study, U.S. companies avoided paying tax on nearly \n     $300 billion in income in 1998.\n\n  Recently, the New York Times reported that a consultant's report \nprepared for the IRS but not released to the public until now will show \nthat ``corporate tax cheating in 2000 cost the government $14 billion \nto $18 billion'' in revenues during that one year alone.\n  Accounting firms are in the thick of the tax shelter activity, \nearning tens of millions of dollars in fees. According to Bowman's \nAccounting Report, the Big Four accounting firms, \nPricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte & Touche, KPMG, and Ernst & Young, \nbrought in $5.6 billion of U.S. tax practice revenues in 2001, more \nthan twice the tax-related revenues these companies posted in 1995. \nWhile some of these fees are the result of tax return preparation work, \nour Subcommittee investigation indicates that significant fees were \ngenerated by tax shelter services provided to wealthy individuals and \ncorporations.\n  Increased tax shelter activity has not only led to substantial U.S. \ntax revenue loss, it has complicated U.S. tax enforcement efforts and \nundermined taxpayer confidence in the federal tax compliance system, \nleading the IRS to designate abusive tax shelters as an enforcement \npriority.\n  The IRS has accordingly begun a major effort to combat this form of \ntax avoidance. In 2002, for example, the IRS issued about 200 summonses \nseeking tax shelter related information from 30 accounting firms and \nother tax shelter promoters, and filed suit against two major \naccounting firms, KPMG and BDO Seidman, and two major law firms, \nJenkens & Gilchrist and Sidley Austin Brown & Wood, to obtain \ninformation about their tax shelter activities. In addition, the \nSecurities Exchange Commission and the new Public Company Accounting \nOversight Board have expressed serious concerns about accounting firms \nthat audit publicly traded companies while wearing two hats: those of \nthe tax shelter promoter and those of the auditor auditing the same tax \nshelters it has promoted.\n  That issue is the focus of our legislation.\n  Auditors of publicly traded companies are supposed to be independent \nwatchdogs charged with determining whether a company's financial \nstatements are accurate and fairly report the company's finances. But \nmultiple accounting scandals involving billions of dollars at companies \nlike Enron, Tyco, Healthsouth, Aldelphia, and MCI-WorldCom have rocked \ninvestor confidence in auditors and severely damaged the reputation of \nthe U.S. accounting profession. These accounting scandals showed again \nand again that our laws and financial systems were insufficient to \nensure that U.S. auditors were doing their jobs.\n  In response, Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. A \nprimary purpose of that law was to strengthen auditor independence and \nrestore investor confidence in U.S. financial statements. Among other \nmeasures, it established the new Public Company Accounting Oversight \nBoard to strengthen auditing standards, investigate and discipline \nauditor wrongdoing, and oversee auditing practices to ensure adequate \nfinancial statement reviews. While the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is a landmark \npiece of legislation--replacing decades of self-policing in the \naccounting industry with independent oversight--a number of reform \nissues remain unresolved.\n  One key, longstanding issue that continues to compromise auditor \nindependence is the role played by accounting firms in developing and \nselling tax shelters to public companies they audit.\n  As part of their review of public company financial statements, \nauditors are supposed to review the company's tax practices to ensure \nthat the company is not understating its tax liability and overstating \nits earnings. But in some cases, the same accounting firm is also \npitching tax shelters to that client, many of which rely on aggressive \nand novel interpretations of tax law. If a company buys one of these \ntax shelters from its accounting firm, the unacceptable result is that \nthe accounting firm can then turn around and audit the company's \nfinancial statements and, in effect, audit its own work, a situation \nthat strikes at the heart of auditor independence.\n  In some cases, the accounting firm may have even negotiated ``success \nfees'' which are contingent upon a tax shelter's success in reducing a \nclient's tax burden. In such cases, accounting firms will audit tax \ntransactions in which they have a direct financial interest, creating a \nconflict of interest between the firm's income and auditing \nresponsibilities, and making it highly unlikely that questions will be \nraised about a tax shelter that the firm itself sold to its client.\n  Similar conflicts may arise when accounting firms offer tax shelter \nservices to the officers and directors of the companies they audit. One \ncase extensively discussed in the media involves a major accounting \nfirm which not only audited Sprint Corporation, a publicly traded \ncompany, but also sold tax shelters to the Sprint CEO and other Sprint \nexecutives. These tax shelters supposedly eliminated taxes owed on \nmillions of dollars in personal compensation from stock options given \nby Sprint to its executives. When the value of the stock options later \nfell,\n\n[[Page S12977]]\n\nthe accounting firm apparently analyzed strategies that could have \nlowered the individuals' taxes but increased the company's taxes, \npitting the individual against the company, with the same accountant on \nboth sides of the equation. Sprint eventually fired several of the \nexecutives and recently announced it was also changing auditors. In \naddition, Sprint has instituted a new policy barring its auditor from \nproviding any financial services to its executives.\n  Investors, our markets, and the American public deserve better. The \nlegislation we are introducing today would end these auditor conflicts \nby prohibiting auditors from providing tax shelter services to both the \npublicly traded companies they audit and to those companies' officers \nand directors. In addition, the bill would codify four common-sense \nprinciples of auditor independence that would assist public companies \nin analyzing what services may compromise auditor independence.\n  Our bill would build upon the Sarbanes-Oxley Act which took the first \nstep last year to address the conflict of interest problems that arise \nwhen accounting firms provide tax services to the companies they audit. \nSeeking to limit a wide range of possible conflicts of interest, the \nAct broadly prohibited auditors from providing any tax service to an \naudit client without first obtaining the approval of the audit \ncommittee of the company's board of directors.\n  The SEC took the next step when it proposed regulations to implement \nthe Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The SEC issued a draft proposal that \nessentially would have prohibited auditors from selling any tax \nshelters to their audit clients. The draft SEC proposal also contained \nthe four principles that would have helped company audit committees \nevaluate whether other tax services proffered by auditors would impair \nauditor independence. Unfortunately, under heavy lobbying pressure from \naccounting firms in the tax shelter business, the SEC dropped both of \nthese important provisions from the final regulation.\n  So we need to legislate. Our bill would, first, prohibit accounting \nfirms that audit publicly held companies in the United States from \nproviding tax shelter services either to the companies they audit or to \nthe companies' officers and directors. The bill defines tax shelter \nservices by referring to existing law, using language in an existing \ndefinition of tax shelters in section 6111(d) of the tax code. The bill \nwould prohibit auditors from providing to their audit clients those \nservices related to designing, promoting or executing tax transactions \nwhich have tax avoidance or evasion as a significant purpose and which \ngenerate fees for the auditing firm exceeding $100,000. It is intended \nthat questions about whether particular tax-related services fall \nwithin this definition would be resolved by corporate audit committees \nwhen asked by their accounting firm to approve the company's paying for \nthe particular services. The audit committee could consult with the \nIRS, SEC, or other experts in reaching its decision.\n  If an audit committee were to approve tax shelter services that \nshould have been barred, the bill does not provide new penalties or \nenforcement authority, but makes use of the existing oversight \nauthority of the SEC and Public Company Accounting Oversight Board to \nenforce compliance with federal law. That means, for example, if an \naudit committee were to allow its auditor to provide prohibited tax \nshelter services, the SEC or Public Company Accounting Oversight Board \ncould use their existing oversight authority to require the company to \n``cease and desist'' paying for the services or to prohibit the \naccounting firm from providing the services. If appropriate, the SEC \ncould also order the public company, the accounting firm, or both, to \npay a monetary penalty for violating the tax shelter services \nprohibition.\n  The legislation would further reduce potential conflicts by codifying \nfour principles of auditor independence that public company audit \ncommittees would be required to apply when determining what non-audit \nservices an auditor can provide. These principles have been repeatedly \ncited in SEC efforts to strengthen auditor independence and were also \ncited during debate on the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. They provide that \nauditor independence is compromised when auditors: 1. audit their own \nwork; 2. perform management functions for their clients; 3. act as \nadvocates on behalf of their clients; or 4. act as promoters of their \nclients' stock or other financial interests.\n\n  To better ensure auditor independence, our bill would require audit \ncommittees to apply these four principles when considering what \nservices, not otherwise prohibited, an auditor may provide to their \ncompany. If an audit committee were to find that the proposed auditor \nservice would reasonably result in a violation of one of the above \nprinciples, the audit committee would have to disallow the proffered \nservice.\n  Experts in the financial and accounting industries agree that \nauditors should not be permitted to provide tax shelter services to \ntheir audit clients. In January of this year, The Conference Board's \nblue-ribbon Commission on Public Trust and Private Enterprise, co-\nchaired by John Snow before he became Secretary of the Treasury, \nconcluded the following:\n\n       [P]ublic accounting firms should limit their services to \n     their clients to performing audits and to providing closely \n     related services that do not put the auditor in an advocacy \n     position, such as novel and debatable tax strategies and \n     products that involve income tax shelters and extensive off-\n     shore partnerships or affiliates. . . . The Commission \n     believes that any work performed by the company's outside \n     auditors [should] be closely related to the audit. Auditors' \n     development and recommendations of new tax strategies for \n     their clients is not closely related to the audit, and, in \n     our opinion, removes focus from their audit work and poses a \n     potential conflict of interest. Furthermore, the development \n     and recommendations of these strategies have often been \n     accompanied by ``success fees.'' In turn these strategies, if \n     implemented, were often then subject to an audit by the firm. \n     This practice, in our opinion, is highly undesirable. The \n     firm's need for impartiality in conduct of the audit is in \n     direct conflict with the financial incentives to provide tax \n     strategies which themselves must be audited.\n\n  William McDonough, Chairman of the Public Company Accounting \nOversight Board, has indicated that the Board is also considering \nwhether to ban auditors from providing tax shelter services to their \naudit clients and will be closely monitoring how accounting firms audit \na company's tax liabilities and any company use of tax shelters. In \ntestimony before the Finance Committee earlier today, Mr. McDonough \nstated:\n\n       While the SEC made clear that it did not consider \n     conventional tax compliance and planning to be a threat to \n     auditor independence, it distinguished such traditional \n     services from the marketing of novel, tax-driven, financial \n     products, which the SEC noted raise some serious issues. . . \n     . [T]he AICPA has also suggested that ``advice on tax \n     strategies having no business purpose other than tax \n     avoidance is an appropriate dividing line for activities that \n     should be prohibited to auditing firms registered under the \n     Sarbanes-Oxley Act.'' Thus, there appears to be consensus \n     that auditors ought not to be selling abusive tax shelters to \n     audit clients.\n\n  In an unrelated Wall Street Journal interview, Mr. McDonough was \ndescribed as saying that ``[w]hat he finds problematic is `very \ncreative tax work' . . . . `There is no way you can do that and claim \nto be independent,' he said.''\n  The Sarbanes-Oxley Task Force formed by the American Bar \nAssociation's Section of Taxation, has also expressed support for \nbarring auditors from providing tax shelter services to their audit \nclients. In a comment letter supporting the proposed ban in the SEC \nregulations on auditor independence, the Task Force wrote:\n\n       We believe that tax shelter products raise particular \n     auditor independence concerns. Companies purchasing tax \n     shelter products are exposed to a variety of risks over and \n     above the calculation of tax liability. An accounting firm \n     that markets a tax shelter product to a registrant should be \n     prohibited from conducting the audit of the registrant \n     because it cannot be expected to fairly evaluate the risks \n     inherent in the tax shelter product.\n\n  Our legislation has been endorsed by a number of public interest \ngroups working to strengthen auditor integrity, renew investor and \nconsumer confidence in the financial statements of U.S. publicly traded \ncompanies, and curb abusive tax shelters. The Consumer Federation of \nAmerica, Consumers Union, Consumer Action, U.S. Public Interest \nResearch Group, and Common Cause have stated in a letter of \nendorsement: ``Passage of this bill is one of the most important steps \nCongress could take to ensure that last\n\n[[Page S12978]]\n\nyear's corporate reform efforts have their intended effect of restoring \nreal independence to the 'independent' audit and, with it, a reasonable \nlevel of reliability to public companies' financial disclosures.''\n  Our bill's reforms are straightforward. Auditors should not audit \ntheir own work, including evaluating a tax shelter that the auditor \nitself sold to its audit client. Auditors should not sell personal tax \nshelters to the officers and directors of its audit clients, due to the \nconflicts of interest that can arise. Publicly traded companies ought \nto have explicit guidance to help them avoid auditor conflicts of \ninterest, and the best guidance we can give them is the four auditor \nindependence principles that have long guided SEC and Congressional \naction in this area.\n  Together, a ban on auditors providing tax shelter services to their \naudit clients and a codification of the four auditor independence \nprinciples to guide public companies away from auditor conflicts of \ninterest could go a long way to restoring the confidence of investors \nin the U.S. auditing profession, financial reporting system, and \ncapital markets. I urge my colleagues to support this common-sense and \nmuch-needed legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1767\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nMichigan, Senator Levin, in sponsoring the Auditor Independence and Tax \nShelters Act.\n  While the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and Securities and Exchange Commission \nrules rightly prohibit accounting firms from providing certain non-\nauditing services to the publicly traded companies they audit, auditors \nare not prohibited from providing tax shelter services to their audit \nclients.\n  The Auditor Independence and Tax Shelters Act is intended to address \nthis gap in the law by prohibiting audit firms from providing such \nservices to their audit clients. It would thereby significantly \nstrengthen auditor independence and eliminate a fundamental conflict of \ninterest that is adverse to the best interest of investors.\n  Although I believe that any firm that serves as an auditor of a \ncompany should generally be prohibited from providing any non-audit \nservice to that company, I strongly support this bill because it is a \nsignificant step toward achieving true auditor independence.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important bill to further \nprotect investor confidence in our capital markets.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself, Mr. Inouye, and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 1770. A bill to establish a voluntary alternative claims \nresolution process to reach a settlement of pending class action \nlitigation, to the Committee of Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by \nSenators Inouye, Domenici and Stabenow in submitting a Senate \nResolution urging settlement of the 8-year old Indian trust funds \nlawsuit, and by Senators Inouye and Domenici in introducing a bill that \nI hope and believe will accomplish that goal, the ``Indian Money Claims \nSatisfaction Act of 2003''.\n  The saga of Cobell v. Norton did not start in 1996 with the filing of \nthe lawsuit, it began long before any of us were born. In 1887 Congress \nenacted the General Allotment Act to break up the tribal landmass and \nteach Indians to be ``civilized''.\n  The legacy of that failed policy is still with us in the form of \nhorribly fractionated Indian lands and the class action case filed in \n1996 that is still ongoing.\n  The remedy the plaintiffs in the Cobell case are seeking is an \naccounting by the United States of funds that are or should be in the \nhundreds of thousands of individual Indian money accounts (IIMs) \nmanaged and maintained by the Federal Government.\n  Eight long years have passed without an accounting, and without a \nsingle penny being paid to an account holder. Last month, Judge \nLamberth issued a 400-page decision and order that guarantees at least \n5 more years of litigation, hundreds of millions and maybe billions \nmore spent, with no end in sight to the lawsuit.\n  Those who insist that a decision by the Judge would mean the \nbeginning of the end of this case are wrong: with likely appeals, \nCongressional squabbling over money spent on this effort, and \nadditional lawsuits aimed at securing money damages, this case is just \nbeginning.\n  The U.S. claims that pennies on the dollar are owed the plaintiffs \nbut, without billions more spent on accounting activity, it cannot say \nfor sure how much is in the accounts or should be in the accounts.\n  Preliminary cost estimates from the Interior Department suggest that \nit will take $10 billion or more to comply with Judge Lamberth's order \non historic accounting. This money will be spent year after year \nthrough Fiscal Year 2008 at least.\n  I believe this money is better spent on re-constituting the Indian \nland base and building a forward-looking, state-of-the-art trust \nmanagement system, and providing more dollars to Indian health care and \neducation, which we know are underfunded.\n  The plaintiffs claim more than $175 billion dollars should be in \nthese accounts, a number the Department has vigorously contested.\n  Today I am introducing a bill that I believe will end this lawsuit in \na way to provide justice to individual Indian account holders and \nrestore some sense of normalcy to the Interior Department.\n  Just as the Indian Claims Commission, the Trust Resolution \nCorporation,\n\n[[Page S12979]]\n\nand the Volcker Committee on Swiss Bank Accounts helped resolve cases \nof highly complex, historical-based litigation, the bill I am \nintroducing will establish a 9-member, expert-filled ``Indian Money \nClaims Satisfaction Task Force'' to develop alternative methodologies \nto arrive at account balances.\n  The bill also establishes the ``Indian Money Claims Tribunal'' to \nprovide binding arbitration for any IIM holder that contests the \naccount balance provided by the Task Force.\n  I look forward to the swift enactment of this bill and with it, an \nhonorable conclusion to this sad and destructive chapter of Federal-\nIndian relations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1770\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) since the 19th century, the United States has held \n     Indian funds and resources in trust for the benefit of \n     Indians;\n       (2) in 1996, a class action was brought against the United \n     States seeking a historical accounting of balances of \n     individual Indian money accounts;\n       (3) after 8 years of litigation and the expenditure of \n     hundreds of millions of dollars of Federal funds, it is clear \n     that the court-ordered historical accounting will require \n     significant additional resources and years to accomplish and \n     will not result in significant benefits to the members of the \n     class; and\n       (4) resolving the litigation in a full, fair, and final \n     manner will best serve the interests of the members of the \n     class and the United States.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide a \n     voluntary alternative claims process to reach settlement of \n     the class action litigation in Cobell v.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \npermit States to obtain reimbursement under the Medicaid program for \ncare or services required under the Emergency Medical Treatment and \nActive Labor Act that are provided in a nonpublicly owned or operated \ninstitution for mental diseases; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medicaid \nPsychiatric Fairness Act of 2003, which will serve to improve access to \nmental health treatment and remove an unfunded mandate on our private \nmental health treatment centers. I am particularly pleased to introduce \nthis bill with my good friend and colleague, Senator Conrad, who like \nme believes we must improve access to treatment for many of the 18.5 \nmillion Americans who are afflicted with a mental health disorder.\n  Moving one step closer to achieving this laudable goal, our bill will \nrequire the Medicaid program to provide reimbursement to private mental \nhealth facilities that receive patients under the Emergency Medical \nTreatment and Labor Act, known as EMTALA. EMTALA requires hospitals to \nprovide emergency care to patients, regardless of their ability to pay. \nHowever, this stands in conflict with Medicaid law, which in most cases \nprohibits payment for psychiatric treatment for people between the age \nof 21 to 65 years. Our bill takes the critically important step to \nprovide Medicaid coverage for emergency treatment, which will expand \naccess for acute care and will ensure that Americans receive the \nassistance they vitally need in a timely fashion.\n  Under current law, Medicaid payment for psychiatric treatment for \npatients between the age of 21 and 65 years is restricted to hospitals \nthat have an in-house psychiatric ward. If a patient seeks care from a \nprivate psychiatric hospital or is transferred to a private facility \nfrom a community hospital that does not have a psychiatric treatment \nward, Medicaid payment is not provided. In comparison, if that same \npatient seeks care under EMTALA from a hospital because of a physical \nailment, Medicaid provides coverage regardless of the type of facility \nthat provides the treatment. By introducing this bill, we are taking a \nvitally important step toward removing an unfunded mandate on private \nproviders that has served to limit access to care for millions of \nMedicaid recipients.\n  It also is important to note that the current situation is \njeopardizing Medicaid recipients' access to emergency treatment, and \nultimately is overwhelming our emergency rooms and in many cases the \ncriminal justice system. The U.S. Department of Justice estimates that \non average 16 percent of inmates in local jails suffer from a mental \nillness and in Maine, NAMI, a state advocacy group for persons with \nmental illness, estimates that figure is as high as 50 percent. This is \nthe result of a severe shortage of psychiatric beds in Maine, and as a \nresult many people go without treatment. Action must be taken to \nprovide access to care and we must start by ensuring that Medicaid \nreimburses facilities that provide treatment.\n  Senator Conrad and I have joined together in introducing our \nlegislation that will require Medicaid to pay for the cost of care \nassociated with psychiatric treatment necessary to comply with EMTALA. \nNo longer will private entities be required to shoulder the burden of \nthis federal mandate, and no longer will Medicaid eligible \nbeneficiaries go without access to necessary emergency treatments.\n\n  In my home State of Maine, 65,000 people have a severe mental illness \nand could benefit from this bill. Ensuring that our community treatment \nfacilities are appropriately paid, we will be able to open access to \nvitally important treatment options.\n  This bill has been carefully crafted with input from both the \nprovider and beneficiary communities to ensure assistance is directed \nto those who are most in need and to ensure that the coverage only \nextends to people who require emergency treatment. We have tied the \nlegislation to the EMTALA statute to ensure that this new requirement \ncannot be exploited.\n  Demonstrating the importance of this legislation, we have received \nsupport from a number of leading national mental health and medical \nassociations, including NAMI, the National Association of County \nBehavioral Health Directors, the American Psychiatric Association, the \nAmerican Hospital Association and the National Association of \nPsychiatric Health Systems. I am especially pleased to have\n\n[[Page S12981]]\n\nalso received endorsements from a number of Maine organizations, \nincluding the Maine Hospital Association, Maine chapter of NAMI, the \nState Department of Behavioral and Development Services and the Spring \nHarbor Hospital.\n  This legislative change is vitally important to ensure Medicaid \npatients have access to emergency mental health treatment. I want to \nthank Senator Conrad for his help in crafting this policy and urge my \ncolleagues to join us as cosponsors.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                 National Alliance\n\n\n                                         for the Mentally Ill,\n\n                                 Arlington, VA, September 8, 2003.\n     Hon. Olympia Snowe,\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Snowe & Conrad: On behalf of the 210,000 \n     members and 1,200 affiliates of the National Alliance for the \n     Mentally Ill (NAMI), I am writing to express support for your \n     legislation to addressing the growing crisis in access to \n     acute care services for non-elderly adults living with severe \n     mental illness. As the nation's largest organization \n     representing individuals with severe mental illness and their \n     families, NAMI is pleased to support this important measure.\n       As NAMI's consumer and family membership knows first-hand, \n     the acute care crisis for inpatient psychiatric care is \n     growing in this country. This disturbing trend was identified \n     in the recently released Bush Administration New Freedom \n     Initiative Mental Health Commission report. Over the past 15-\n     20 years, states have closed inpatient units and drastically \n     reduced the number of acute care beds. Also, general \n     hospitals, due to severe budget constraints, have had to \n     close psychiatric units or reduce the number of beds. This \n     has resulted in a growing shortage of acute inpatient \n     psychiatric beds in many communities.\n       Your proposed legislation would address an important \n     conflict in federal policy that has contributed to restricted \n     access to needed inpatient services--the Medicaid Institution \n     for Mental Disease (IMD) Exclusion and the Emergency Medical \n     and Labor Treatment Act (EMTALA). EMTALA requires hospitals \n     to stabilize patients in an emergency medical condition, \n     while the IMD exclusion prevents certain hospitals \n     (psychiatric hospitals) from receiving Medicaid reimbursement \n     for Medicaid beneficiaries between the ages of 21-64 in these \n     circumstances.\n       Your legislation would allow Medicaid funding to be \n     directed to non-publicly owned and operated psychiatric \n     hospitals (IMDs) for Medicaid beneficiaries between the ages \n     of 21-64 who require stabilization in these settings as \n     required by EMTALA. Today, these hospitals are denied payment \n     for care required under the EMTALA rules. The result is that \n     psychiatric hospitals are forced to absorb these added costs \n     of care to their already growing un-reimbursed care even \n     though these patients have insurance through Medicaid.\n       This legislation will go a long way in addressing the \n     growing psychiatric acute inpatient crisis, while creating \n     fairness in the reimbursement structure for psychiatric \n     hospitals under the limited circumstances required by the \n     EMTALA law. Your leadership in carefully crafting and \n     introducing this targeted legislation addressing a critical \n     problem for persons with serious mental illnesses is much \n     appreciated. NAMI looks forward to working with you and your \n     Senate colleagues to ensure passage of this important \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Richard E. Birkel,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n         The National Association of County Behavioral Health \n           Directors,\n                                Washington, DC, September 5, 2003.\n     Hon. Olympia Snowe,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: The National Association of County \n     Behavioral Health Directors (NACBHD), which is the behavioral \n     health affiliate of the National Association of Counties \n     (NACo), is writing to strongly support the legislation you \n     are introducing to alleviate the crisis in access to acute \n     hospital inpatient psychiatric services. A lack of acute \n     inpatient services was recently highlighted in President \n     Bush's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health report and is \n     a problem in many counties. In twenty of the most populous \n     States, counties have the designated responsibility to plan \n     and implement mental health services.\n       Over the past 20 years most states have closed many of \n     their state hospitals and returned these patients to the \n     community for care. General hospitals have over the past 10-\n     15 years begun to close psychiatric inpatient units due to \n     cost restraints and the fact that general medical/surgical \n     beds are more profitable. Freestanding psychiatric hospitals \n     have been significantly reduced due to the reduction in \n     reimbursements brought about with the advent of managed care. \n     Over all, the availability of acute psychiatric beds, in many \n     states, has decreased dramatically in the last 10 years. \n     Given the shortage of inpatient acute beds, many individuals \n     with serious psychiatric disorders end up in county jails or \n     homeless rather than receiving basic psychiatric services in \n     hospital.\n        Your legislation specially addresses the conflict in \n     Federal between the Medicaid Institution for Mental Disease \n     Exclusion (IMD) and the Emergency Medical and Labor Treatment \n     Act (EMTALA). EMTALA requires hospitals to stabilize patients \n     with emergency medical conditions. However, if freestanding \n     psychiatric hospitals receive direct admissions of Medicaid \n     eligible patients or if receive transfers from general \n     hospitals whose psychiatric units are full under EMTALA \n     regulations, they can't receive reimbursement under Medicaid \n     because of the IMD exclusion.\n        The Snowe-Conrad legislation would allow Medicaid funding \n     to non-publicly owned and operated psychiatric hospitals \n     (IMD's) for Medicaid beneficiaries between the ages of 21-64 \n     who require medical stabilization in these settings as \n     required by EMTALA. Currently, these hospitals are denied \n     payment for care required under the EMTALA rules and clearly \n     represents an unfunded mandate to these hospitals.\n       The IMD exclusion also prevents counties from contracting \n     with psychiatric hospitals, which are considerably less \n     expensive, for care for the seriously mentally ill. This \n     legislation would assist in creating fairness in the \n     reimbursement structure for psychiatric hospitals under the \n     current EMTALA law.\n        The National Association of County Behavioral Health \n     Directors appreciates your leadership in introducing this \n     specific legislation that will address this inherent conflict \n     in Federal requirements and will assist in promoting access \n     to acute psychiatric inpatient services. We look forward to \n     working with you and your colleagues in getting this \n     legislation passed through this Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Thomas E.

Olympia Snowe,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: On behalf of the 38,000 physician \n     members of the American Psychiatric Association (APA), and \n     most particularly on behalf of the patients they treat, \n     please accept my thanks for your Senate sponsorship of the \n     Medicaid Psychiatric Hospital Fairness Act of 2003.\n       The Emergency Medical and Labor Treatment Act, which \n     requires hospitals to stabilize patients in an emergency \n     medical condition, directly conflicts with the Medicaid \n     Institution for Mental Diseases (IMD) exclusion. The IMD \n     exclusion prevents non-public psychiatric hospitals from \n     receiving Medicaid reimbursement for Medicaid patients \n     between the ages of 21-64 that have required stabilization as \n     a result of EMTALA regulations.\n       Your legislation will allow non-public psychiatric \n     hospitals to receive appropriate reimbursement for Medicaid \n     beneficiaries between the ages of 21-64 who require emergency \n     treatment and stabilization as required by EMTALA.\n       Thank you for your foresight and leadership in your \n     sponsorship of the Medicaid Psychiatric Hospital Fairness Act \n     of 2003. Thanks are also due to the outstanding work by \n     Catherine Finley, who ably represents you. The APA looks \n     forward to working with you to make your bill a reality this \n     year.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Marcia Goin,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                American Hospital Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 17, 2003.\n     Hon. Olympia Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: On behalf of the American Hospital \n     Association's (AHA) nearly 5,000 member hospitals, health \n     care systems, networks and other providers of care, I am \n     writing to express our support for your bill, the Medicaid \n     Psychiatric Hospital Fairness Act of 2003.\n       The Emergency Medical and Labor Treatment Act (EMTALA) \n     requires hospitals to stabilize patients in an emergency \n     medical condition including psychiatric hospitals. At the \n     same time the Medicaid program, through the Institution for \n     Mental Diseases (IMD) exclusion, prevents non-public \n     psychiatric hospitals from receiving Medicaid reimbursement \n     for Medicaid patients between the ages of 21-64 that require \n     stabilization. These hospitals are burdened with an unfunded \n     mandate in fulfilling their EMTALA obligations for this \n     patient population.\n       Your legislation will allow non-public psychiatric \n     hospitals to receive appropriate reimbursement for Medicaid \n     beneficiaries between the ages of 21-64 who require emergency \n     treatment and stabilization as required by EMTALA. This will \n     relieve overcrowding in emergency departments and provide the \n     appropriate care these patients deserve in a more timely \n     manner.\n       Thank you for addressing this important issue. We support \n     the Medicaid Psychiatric Fairness Act of 2003 and look \n     forward to\n\n[[Page S12982]]\n\n     working with you and your colleagues to ensure swift passage \n     of this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Rick Pollack,\n     Executive Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                    Psychiatric Health Systems\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 10, 2003.\n     Hon. Olympia Snowe,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: The National Association of Psychiatric \n     Health Systems (NAPHS) strongly supports your legislation to \n     alleviate the crisis in acute hospital services for persons \n     with mental illnesses. NAPHS represents provider systems that \n     are committed to the delivery of responsive, accountable, and \n     clinical effective prevention, treatment, and care for \n     children, adolescents, adults, and older adults with mental \n     and substance use disorders. Members are behavioral \n     healthcare provider organizations, including 300 specialty \n     hospitals, general hospital psychiatric and addiction \n     treatment units, residential treatment centers, youth \n     services organizations, partial hospital services, behavioral \n     group practices, and other providers of a full continuum of \n     care.\n       Mental illness ranks first among all illnesses that cause \n     disability in the United States, with about 5% to 7% of \n     adults suffering from a severe mental illness in any given \n     year. For those who are acutely ill, short-term psychiatric \n     care provides stabilization and is a critical component of \n     community-based care.\n       After reviewing reports and listening to testimony over the \n     past year, the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental \n     Health identified the lack of acute care as a serious \n     concern. The Commission noted that many communities are \n     experiencing severe problems with access to short-term \n     inpatient care--with some areas reporting that the shortage \n     has risen to crisis proportions. the result is that many \n     emergency rooms are overwhelmed with patients in extreme \n     psychiatric distress who have nowhere to go. I am attaching a \n     report prepared by NAPHS on acute care that provides \n     additional details on this issue for your review.\n       Your legislation will resolve an unintended and unfair \n     conflict in federal law that has negatively impacted access \n     to acute care. Currently, the Emergency Medical Treatment and \n     Labor Act (EMTALA) provides that hospitals stabilize patients \n     in an emergency medical condition, while Medicaid's \n     Institution for Mental Disease (IMD) provision prohibits \n     psychiatric hospitals from seeking reimbursement for services \n     for beneficiaries between the ages of 21 to 64. General \n     hospitals with psychiatric beds are not subject to the IMD \n     exclusion.\n       The Snowe-Conrad legislation would increase access to acute \n     care by allowing psychiatric hospitals to bill Medicaid for \n     reimbursement just as general hospitals do for EMTALA \n     patients who are Medicaid-eligible. We look forward to \n     working with you and your colleagues on this important and \n     timely piece of legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Mark Covall,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Maine Hospital Association,\n\n                                    Augusta, ME, October 20, 2003.\n     Hon. Olympia Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: On behalf of the Maine Hospital \n     Association's 28 acute-care and specialty hospitals, I am \n     writing in support of your bill, the Medicaid Psychiatric \n     Hospital Fairness Act of 2003.\n       As you know, the Medicaid program, through the Institution \n     for Mental Diseases (IMD) exclusion, prevents non-public \n     psychiatric hospitals from receiving Medicaid reimbursement \n     for Medicaid patients between the ages of 21-64 who require \n     stabilization. When the Federal Government created Medicaid \n     they prohibited Medicaid funding for services at IMDs because \n     Washington viewed mental health services to be the \n     responsibility of the State--particularly since at that time \n     most psychiatric hospitals were State-owned hospitals. The \n     Federal Government did provide funding through the DSH-IMD \n     (Disproportionate Share Hospital Fund for Institutes for \n     Mental Disease). Initially these funds were used solely by \n     the private IMDs, however, in 1991, Maine, in response to a \n     severe budget shortfall, began to shift costs associated with \n     Augusta Mental Health Institute (AMHI) and Bangor Mental \n     Health Institute (BMHI) into the Federal DSH-IMD pool rather \n     than funding those costs with all general fund dollars.\n       In the mid-1990s the State passed a rule that entitled AMHI \n     and BMHI to be paid first out of the DSH-IMD pool leaving the \n     remainder for the two private hospitals. With a declining \n     Federal cap on the DSH-IMD pool and increasing hospital \n     expenses, there was less and less money with which to \n     reimburse the two private psychiatric hospitals for services \n     provided to this indigent population.\n       Maine has two private psychiatric hospitals: Spring Harbor \n     Hospital in South Portland and The Acadia Hospital in Bangor. \n     For fiscal year 2000, Acadia had inpatient admissions of \n     1,731 and Spring Harbor had 2,047. Both hospitals also \n     provide a significant amount of outpatient services.\n       The two private hospitals play a pivotal role in the \n     delivery of mental health services especially for low-income \n     individuals. As the State has desired to encourage greater \n     behavior services within communities, the Department of \n     Behavioral and Developmental Services worked with both of \n     these hospitals to increase the number of beds and services \n     available to allow for certain patients to be placed in these \n     hospitals rather than the State institutes. The inability of \n     these two hospitals to effectively meet these patient needs \n     would have a detrimental impact throughout the State \n     especially because communities are already stressed \n     attempting to develop needed community-based services.\n       Your legislation will allow non-public psychiatric \n     hospitals to receive appropriate reimbursement for Medicaid \n     beneficiaries between the ages of 21-64 who require emergency \n     treatment and stabilization as required by EMTALA. This will \n     relieve overcrowding in emergency departments and provide the \n     appropriate care these patients deserve in a more timely \n     manner.\n       Thank you for addressing this important issue. We support \n     the Medicaid Psychiatric Hospital Fairness Act of 2003 and \n     look forward to working with you and your colleagues to \n     ensure swift passage of this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Steven Michaud,\n     President, Maine Hospital Association.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                   NAMI Maine,\n\n                                     August 29, 2003. Augusta, ME,\n     Senator Olympia Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Portland, ME\n       Dear Senator Snowe: I am pleased to write this letter in \n     support of legislation that would allow Spring Harbor \n     Hospital to receive reimbursement for emergency psychiatric \n     stabilization services to Medicaid-eligible patients between \n     the ages of 21 and 64 under the Emergency Medical Treatment \n     and Labor Act (EMTALA).\n       Chronic metal illness is a disease of impoverishment. \n     Chronic mental health patients who need psychiatric \n     stabilization within an acute-care setting usually are \n     eligible for either charity care of Medicaid funding. Since \n     Spring Harbor Hospital serves a population that by virtue of \n     its illness is financially challenged, it strikes me as \n     inequitable that they should also be denied reimbursement for \n     acute stabilization services provided to Medicaid-eligible \n     adults under EMTALA. Often during the last three years, I \n     have trained Maine's jails to understand EMTALA laws and send \n     suicide inmates to the hospital, rather than admit them to \n     jail. With 30-50% of Maine's jail inmates having mental \n     illness, this places an additional burden on hospitals like \n     Spring Harbor Hospital.\n       I understand that care for this population in 2002 \n     represented nearly 30% of Spring Harbor's adult psychiatric \n     treatment at a cost of close to $7 million. I also know that \n     Spring Harbor is increasingly viewed by the community as the \n     place where Medicaid-eligible adults who cannot afford to pay \n     for their acute psychiatric stabilization can referred--no \n     question asked. And this is where the benefits of EMTALA turn \n     problematic.\n       No business--and certainly not a nonprofit organization--\n     can provide $7 million in non-reimbursable services without \n     eventually jeopardizing its financial viability. And this is \n     what concerns NAMI the most: that there will be an even \n     greater lack of acute impatient stabilization services in \n     Maine for the chronic and severely mentally ill individuals \n     who most need-but can least afford--them.\n       I am hopeful that a legislative solution can be passed that \n     will support Spring Harbor's ability to continue serving \n     people with mental illness, both in keeping with EMTALA and \n     yet without the inequitable financial burden that threatens \n     the long term availability of these services in Maine. Please \n     let me know what more I can do to support this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Carol Carothers,\n     Executive Director,\n                                  ____\n\n         State of Maine, Department of Behavioral and \n           Developmental Services,\n                                     Augusta, ME, August 29, 2003.\n     Senator Olympia J. Snowe, \n     Russell Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: I would like to thank you for your \n     insight and understanding of one of the problems confronting \n     Maine's Mental Health System, reflected in your drafting \n     legislation to amend Title XIX of the Social Security Act \n     permitting Medicaid reimbursement to IMD's for services \n     required under EMTALA.\n       Currently, as you know, non-public community hospitals, \n     designated as Institutes for Mental Disease (IMD), cannot \n     receive Medicaid reimbursement if a patient (age 22-64) is \n     admitted under the EMTALA Laws. This prohibition is, I \n     believe, inconsistent with the intent of the EMTALA \n     regulations, places the IMD's in some financial jeopardy, and \n     fails to recognize the critical role the non-public IMDs play \n     in Maine's Mental Health System of care.\n       The State of Maine has 2 non-public designated IMD \n     facilities; Spring Harbor Hospital located in South Portland; \n     and Acadia Hospital, located in Bangor. These two facilities \n     in partnership with the 2 State Psychiatric facilities, \n     contain most of the high acuity psychiatric inpatient beds in \n     Maine and as such, provide the safety net for Maine's \n     Community mental health system. These 4 IMDs are constantly \n     being called\n\n[[Page S12983]]\n\n     upon to take clients who can no longer be stabilized within \n     the existing network of community hospitals. Yet those \n     community hospitals, under current EMTALA law, get reimbursed \n     (rightfully) for services under Medicaid. The IMD's however, \n     cannot access Medicaid reimbursement for that same service \n     and hence a financial inequity and burden is placed on these \n     non-public IMD's. Your proposed draft legislation, which I \n     have had the opportunity to review, alleviates that \n     unfairness and will provide some financial support for \n     Maine's 2 IMD hospitals.\n       I want to offer you my support in helping pass this bill. \n     Please let me know if there is something I can do or \n     information I can provide that would be helpful to get this \n     bill passed.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Sabra C. Burdick,\n     Acting Commissioner.\n                                  ____\n\n         Spring Harbor Hospital, Maine's Comprehensive Mental \n           Health Network,\n                              South Portland, ME, August 26, 2003.\n     Hon. Olympia J. Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: On behalf of both Spring Harbor \n     Hospital in Maine and the National Association for \n     Psychiatric Healthcare Systems, I would like to thank you for \n     supporting legislation to enable freestanding private \n     psychiatric hospitals in the US to receive payment for the \n     emergency stabilization services they provide each year to \n     thousands of Medicaid-eligible adult clients under the \n     Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA).\n       As you know, it is becoming increasingly difficult for \n     freestanding private psychiatric facilities to absorb the \n     cost of treating Medicaid-eligible adults between the ages of \n     21 and 64 who are referred to them for emergency \n     stabilization under EMTALA. At Spring Harbor alone, the cost \n     of serving this population last year was close to $7 million.\n       Faced with both diminishing reimbursement streams and a \n     concurrent rise in demand for inpatient stabilization \n     services from overflowing emergency rooms across the country, \n     private freestanding psychiatric facilities are quite \n     literally caught between a rock and a hard place. In Maine \n     and in many other places, freestanding private psychiatric \n     hospitals are protecting their financial health by offering \n     fewer and fewer adult psychiatric services in the inpatient \n     setting. This tactic simply skirts the issue and creates a \n     further void of services for individuals with acute mental \n     illness, precisely at a time when it is widely accepted that \n     the availability of mental health services in this country is \n     substandard.\n       When all is said and done, these financial figures pale in \n     comparison to the ultimate cost to our society when these \n     adults fail to receive the treatment they deserve. It has \n     been estimated that the lifetime cost of providing for an \n     individual with an untreated serious mental illness is $10 \n     million. Though this figure includes the financial impact of \n     lost work days and the cost of providing Social Security \n     disability benefits, it does not even begin to speak to the \n     emotional toll of mental illness on friends or the scars \n     mental illness can have on loved ones for generations to \n     come. If we could quantify these numbers adequately, I am \n     certain that I would not need to be writing to you today.\n       In closing, I would like to acknowledge the receptiveness \n     of your office and that of Senator Collins to issues \n     concerning the plight of the one in four adults and one in \n     ten children in the US who will experience a mental illness \n     this year. It is high time that the issues surrounding this \n     illness were addressed with understanding, compassion, and a \n     concern for our country's long-term mental health. I am both \n     pleased and proud that the Maine congressional delegation is \n     leading the way on these critical issues.\n           Best regards,\n\n                                               Dennis P.
