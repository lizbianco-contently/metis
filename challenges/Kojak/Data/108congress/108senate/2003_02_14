Estrada, of \nVirginia, to be United States Circuit Judge for the District of \nColumbia.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished acting majority \nleader.\n\n[[Page S2506]]\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, like every Senator, I am sure, I have had \nthe experience this last week and a half of listening to the arguments \nboth for and against Miguel Estrada as we have gone through the first \nfilibuster of this particular session. When we come back on February \n24, we will undoubtedly be back into the filibuster. At that time, I \nwould expect the focus perhaps to shift from a discussion of Miguel \nEstrada's shortcomings or qualifications to a discussion of the \nobstruction of the business of the Senate by members of the minority.\n  As I have listened to this debate, I have realized something in what \nI would consider a larger context than the fight over Miguel Estrada. \nThere is something going on about which, as Members of this \ninstitution, we need to stop and think. It is something that is quite \nsignificant and potentially a major sea change in the way the Senate \ndoes its business--and I hope I am not overdramatizing it--perhaps a \nmajor sea change in the institution itself. Like most major changes, it \nhas crept up on us. It is not something that anyone sat down, thought \nthrough, proposed, and adopted.\n  Going back in the Senate's history, I will outline what I see \nhappening. I hope I can put it in context. There was a time--and it was \nnot that long ago--when nominees, be they to executive positions or to \nthe bench, were almost automatically approved by the Senate unless, in \nthe course of the confirmation hearings, something truly disabling was \ndiscovered.\n  The President has the right to nominate. The Senate has the right to \nconsent, or advise and consent, in the language of the Constitution. \nThat meant, historically, that the Senate automatically would approve \nthe nominee unless they found something significantly disabling. Along \nthe way--and I cannot put my finger on who started it or when it \nstarted or which party was involved--the idea came: Well, maybe there \nis nothing disqualifying about this nominee, but for one reason or \nanother--usually partisan considerations or ideological ideas--we just \ndo not like him. So let's start to use our power to examine his record \nin the confirmation process as a means to blacken his record, as a \nmeans to denigrate this individual, in the hope that we can change some \nvotes and perhaps deny this President the opportunity to put in place \nthe people he wants.\n  As one party would do it and then the power in the Senate would shift \nwith the next election, the other party would say: Well, let's do it, \ntoo. Let's do what we can to make this individual look far less \nqualified. Even though we know he is qualified, let's find something we \ncan argue about, let's find something we can quibble over, and maybe in \nthe process, even though it is damaging to him personally, we can \nsucceed in preventing this President from being able to have his \nnominee confirmed.\n  It reached such a point in the nomination of Robert Bork to the \nSupreme Court that a new verb entered the political vocabulary. There \nare not very many political leaders who have verbs named after them. \nOne of them is Joe McCarthy, and we now have the phrase \n``McCarthyism.'' Everybody knows what it means, even if they have never \nheard of Joe McCarthy.\n  When I was an intern in the Senate in the early 1950s, I used to \nfollow Senator McCarthy around. That was my assignment, to follow him \naround. I would take notes and see how he was really performing as \nopposed to how the press reported his performance.\n  I attended every session of the Governmental Affairs Committee, then \nknown as the Government Operations Committee, where Senator McCarthy \nwas presiding as chairman and paid attention to his methods as a \nchairman. I reported back to my Senator that Senator McCarthy is \nsmarter than the press gives him credit for; he is, when he is not on \nthe issue of communism, a competent chairman, and runs his committee in \na legitimate kind of a way.\n  My Senator wanted to get that flavor because he knew McCarthy \npersonally in other ways but he was not a member of the committee and \nhe just wanted some eyes and ears in the committee to see what was \ngoing on.\n  I have that view of Senator McCarthy, but if I use the term \n``McCarthyism'' now, everyone knows what I mean. Senator McCarthy's \nmethods with respect to communism became so extreme that his name \nentered the world as part of the political lexicon.\n  Robert Bork, like Senator McCarthy, has been forgotten by anyone who \ndoes not have experience with him or with the circumstance, but the \nword ``Bork'' has entered the political lexicon as a verb. It comes \nfrom those who were opposed to Robert Bork's appointment to the Supreme \nCourt, who then said, after they had savaged his reputation, savaged \nhim and his privacy to the point where we actually have what is known \nas the Bork law, which makes it illegal to check out one's record at a \nvideo store. In other words, it is now against the law because of the \nBork law to monitor which videos one might check out at Blockbuster \nvideo because it is considered an invasion of your privacy. Prior to \nthe Bork law, those who ``Borked'' Robert Bork went so far into his \nlife as to determine which videos he checked out and then made those \npublic and said that any man who would watch these particular videos is \nobviously not qualified to sit on the Supreme Court.\n  When we had other nominations come up, those who savaged Robert \nBork's reputation used his name as a verb and spoke prospectively of \nthese nominees and said ``we will Bork him'' or ``we will Bork her,'' \nand everyone knew what they meant. We saw that in the confirmation \nprocess of Clarence Thomas.\n  I suggest to all of my colleagues they read the biography of our \ncolleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter. He played a pivotal role \nin both the confirmation fight over Robert Bork and the confirmation \nfight over Clarence Thomas. He was against Mr. Bork. He was for Justice \nThomas. He describes in his book the reasons why. Once you read his \nbook, you find that his reasons for voting against Robert Bork had \nnothing to do with any videos that Mr. Bork may have checked out, \nnothing to do with the character assassination campaign that was raised \nagainst him, but a genuine concern on the part of Senator Specter as to \nwhat kind of a Justice Robert Bork would make. When it came to Clarence \nThomas, Senator Specter applied the same standard and came to the \nconclusion that Clarence Thomas was qualified to sit on the Supreme \nCourt.\n  I hope I don't embarrass my colleague from Pennsylvania when I quote \none of the lines out of his book, the White House called him and asked \nhim how he felt about Clarence Thomas, and he said: Well, he is no \nBrandeis, but he will do. And he has subsequently said in his writing--\nhe, Senator Specter--that he is satisfied with the job Clarence Thomas \nis doing on the Supreme Court and feels that Clarence Thomas has grown \nas a Supreme Court Justice and has a clear understanding of the law and \nis performing more than adequately in his present assignment.\n  Clarence Thomas used a phrase that may have been forgotten now but \nthat struck me with great power at the time. He referred to the way he \nwas being treated as a ``high-tech lynching.'' That was very emotional \nlanguage for many people who come out of the portion of the country \nwhere lynchings regrettably used to be a part of the culture. He said \nthis is a high-tech lynching because he was being ``Borked'' on \ntelevision, he was being ``Borked'' on the cable channels, he was being \n``Borked'' on National Public Radio by those journalists who decided \nbecause, we do not like his ideology, we will destroy his reputation, \nbesmirch his integrity and turn him into a caricature of the man he \nreally is. An escalation, if you will, once again, of this trend that \nmoved from the old attitude, if he is not incompetent we will \nautomatically vote to confirm him, to the new attitude, if we disagree \nwith him, we will savage him in some way.\n  After the Clarence Thomas affair, things continued to go forward and \nescalate. I remember in my campaign when I spoke out against this \ntendency to savage people. Republicans would come up to me and say we \nagree with you. You are right. We are going to elect you to the Senate \nbecause that is the way you stand on it. And then one Republican said \nto me, what if Governor Clinton is elected and you are in the Senate \nand he nominates Mario Cuomo to the Supreme Court, what will you do? \nThis was a question asked of four of us who were running for the \nRepublican nomination. The other three all said: I will fight Mario \nCuomo\n\n[[Page S2507]]\n\nto the last ounce of my strength. I will use every sinew in my body to \nsee that Mario Cuomo does not get on the Court. I said: I am sorry, I \njust told you that I deplore this process of savaging individuals. \nMario Cuomo is not the person I would appoint to the Supreme Court if I \nwere to be President. Mario Cuomo does not represent the judicial \nphilosophy that I think is right for a member of the Supreme Court, but \nMario Cuomo is qualified to be a Supreme Court Justice and if Bill \nClinton is elected President and he nominates Mario Cuomo, unless \nsomething comes out in the hearings that we do not know, I would vote \nto confirm him.\n  Many of my conservative friends were horrified I would say that. But \nI said: Look, we have to do something to get back to the historic \npattern of civility and trust and acceptance of difference of opinions \nand get away from the process of Borking people, be they Republicans or \nDemocrats.\n  I was very interested to have an individual come up to me and say: I \ndon't agree with you on a whole series of things but I am going to vote \nfor you for one reason only. And I said: Well, that is fine, I am \nalways glad to get your vote; what's the reason? He said: You are \nconsistent. Your answer, with respect to Mario Cuomo, convinced me that \neven if I don't agree with you, I can depend on you to do what you will \nsay, even if it is not for your political benefit.\n  Fortunately in my view, President Clinton never nominated Mario Cuomo \nfor the Supreme Court. But if he had, unless something disqualifying \nhad come out in the confirmation process, I would have voted for him.\n  We were in a very close Senate, 50-50, with the Vice President \nbreaking the tie with what the voters left us with in the last Senate. \nNow it is 51-48-1, which is what the voters have left us with in this \nSenate, a barely workable majority.\n  We were in the last years of President Clinton's Presidency; in the \nweekly policy luncheons that we Republicans hold during the same time \nthe Democrats are in their weekly policy lunches, members of our \nconference would stand up and rail at Orrin Hatch and say you've got to \nstop this judge or that judge from going forward. We have to make sure \nthis person doesn't go on the bench.\n\n  And Orrin said:\n\n       I can't hold him up any longer. Fairness requires that they \n     get a hearing and that they get a vote.\n       Well let's filibuster them. If they get on the floor we can \n     prevent them from passing, we can prevent them from getting \n     60 votes.\n\n  To his credit, Senator Hatch said:\n\n       Let's not even think of going there. Let us not escalate \n     this process to the point where 60 votes are routinely \n     required to put anybody on the bench.\n\n  Senator Lott, the majority leader, said exactly the same thing when \nBill Clinton was President, and some of those, perhaps a little more \npassionate in their ideological purity than the rest of us, were \ndemanding a Republican filibuster against some Democratic judges. \n``No,'' said Senator Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee; \n``no,'' said Senator Lott, the majority leader, ``we will not get \nthere. We should not escalate this to that point.''\n  Now the decision has been made to escalate it to that point. Miguel \nEstrada is fully qualified by the standards of everybody who has \nexamined him, from an objective point of view.\n  We hear that one of his past supervisors has written a letter: I \nthink he was something of an ideologue--no. I made the point before and \nrepeat it here. If that is what he thought, why did he continue to \nemploy him and why did he leave a paper trail of glowing \nrecommendations?\n  I have been the CEO of a company. I have done annual performance \nappraisals. I know what you put down on paper, in writing, as to the \nperformance appraisal of that individual is what you have to live with. \nYou better be honest in that appraisal because if you decide to puff \nthat appraisal up and put that in writing just so you don't offend \nsomebody, and then later on you say he is not qualified and you are \ngoing to fire him, the lawyer who represents that somebody is going to \npull out the file and the record and say:\n\n       If he really wasn't any good, why did you put this down on \n     paper at the time he had his appraisal? You are the one who \n     is not honest, not him, if that is what you have done.\n\n  I have that same attitude towards--I believe it is Professor Bender, \nwho now is saying Miguel Estrada is not qualified; that when he had the \nresponsibility, not in a political setting, to lay down Miguel \nEstrada's qualifications and performance, he in writing said he was \nabsolutely outstanding in every way. So I have little or no sympathy \nfor the current verbal statements of Professor Bender.\n  I don't know why the Democrats have decided to escalate this historic \nfight, that has been escalating all these years, to the new level of \nsaying it will now take 60 votes to confirm any judge. They could have \npicked somebody, I think, a little more sympathetic to their cause as \ntheir poster child for this particular decision. But for whatever \nreason, they have decided they are going to escalate the whole process, \nset a new standard and a new requirement for the Senate on the issue of \nMiguel Estrada.\n  Senators have stood here and held up the copy of the Constitution and \ntold us how much they revere and admire it, and have taken an oath to \nuphold and defend the Constitution, and they say we are only doing our \nconstitutional duty. The Senate has a constitutional duty which we \nwould abrogate if we do not filibuster this nomination.\n\n  There is nothing in the Constitution with respect to a filibuster. \nThe filibuster comes out of the Senate rules, not the Constitution. \nFurthermore, the Constitution does clearly and specifically assume some \ncircumstances so important that they do, in fact, require a \nsupermajority. The Constitution clearly and specifically says you \ncannot consent to a treaty without 67 votes. The Constitution clearly \nand directly says you cannot convict a Federal official, be it the \nPresident or a Federal judge who has been impeached by the House, \nunless you have 67 votes. The Constitution very clearly lays out those \nareas that are so important that what we refer to as a supermajority is \nrequired. Confirming a judge is clearly and specifically not one of \nthose situations. To argue that we have a constitutional duty to change \nthe rules with respect to judges is, in my view, to misunderstand the \nConstitution. In my view, the Founding Fathers clearly intended the \nSenate to consent to the President's choices on a majority vote.\n  I hope over this recess, as we go out and meet our constituents, we \ndiscover that they have issues on their mind other than the Senate \nrules; they are concerned with something different than supermajorities \nand cloture votes and filibusters. We are going to hear today what the \ninspectors will say after their latest trip to Iraq. We don't know \nabsolutely what they will say but the preliminary press reports tell us \nthat the inspectors are going to tell us that Iraq remains in material \nbreach of the United Nations resolution and continues to violate all of \nthe instructions the United Nations have given.\n  Our President has told us on this issue that time is running out. The \npapers are suggesting that military action in Iraq is not months but \nperhaps only weeks or maybe even days away. Our constituents are \nconcerned about al-Qaida and the possibility of attacks from the \nterrorist organization to which the Iraqis have given refuge and \nsignificant aid. They are concerned about what will happen to their \nsons, their daughters, their wives, their nieces and nephews who are in \nuniform.\n  When we come back on the 24th of February, I hope we can look at this \nwhole fight over Miguel Estrada in the historical context I have tried \nto lay down here this morning and say to ourselves it is time to step \nback a little from what President Clinton called the politics of \npersonal destruction. It is time to step back a little from the \nescalation that has been going on in both parties for decades over the \nconfirmation fight. It is time, in my view, to accept the historic \npattern that somehow got this country through the first 200 years of \nits existence, that says the Senate does not require a supermajority to \nconfirm a circuit judge and, under those circumstances, be in a more \nsober and efficient situation that allows us to focus on the concerns \non which our constituents and the rest of the world are focused.\n  I hope after a week of reflection and experience with our \nconstituents, we come to that conclusion and see this\n\n[[Page S2508]]\n\nnomination brought to a vote, and those who feel he was not responsive \nin his answers exercise their constitutional duty and vote against him, \nand those who think that they should, exercise your constitutional duty \nand vote for him, and the matter should be resolved in the manner that \nour Founding Fathers intended, which is by a majority vote on the floor \nof the Senate and not in the manner that has come as a result of the \nescalating partisanship of the past few decades.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nto speak as if in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first, let me say to my colleague from \nUtah, Senator Bennett, whom I respect and work with closely on a number \nof items, I thought he came to the floor of the Senate this week and \nmade a valuable suggestion. He came to the floor of the Senate and \nsaid: Let's break this impasse over Mr. Estrada. If he will produce the \nlegal documents, which Miguel Estrada has written as a member of staff \nof the Department of Justice, if he will produce those and if he will \nanswer the questions, we can finally bring this to a vote.\n  He challenged me personally on the floor. He said: What will you do \nif we produce these documents? My response to him was as honest as \ncould be. If he is honest and cooperate in producing the information \nand answering the questions, he deserves a vote. That is my personal \nfeeling. I don't speak for any other Senator.\n  Within hours of that exchange on the floor of the Senate, the White \nHouse sent a lengthy letter refusing to disclose any of the legal \nmemoranda of Miguel Estrada saying that, frankly, it was privileged \ninformation and that Members of the Senate should not read this man's \nwritings about the law. I was sorry to see that happen.\n  I thought Senator Bennett was on to something very good that would \nhave broken what appears to be a partisan impasse and finally put the \ninformation before the Senate and before the American people so Miguel \nEstrada would have moved to a vote.\n  Incidentally, having said on the floor what I thought about it, I \nwent to a number of Democrats and said: Do you feel as I do? If he will \ndisclose his legal memoranda, and if he will answer the questions that \nmight arise from that, and perhaps a few that he avoided in the course \nof the hearing, would you vote to give him a vote? The answer was \naffirmative to a person; because, frankly, then we would know for whom \nwe are voting.\n\n  But what we are dealing with here is a pattern of concealment by this \nnominee. He is not the first. In fact, it has become almost a tradition \nthat judicial nominees come before the Senate--and maybe it harkens \nback to the Senator's earlier reference to Robert Bork. They are afraid \nif they tell people what they think and who they are they will get into \ntrouble.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Going back to what happened the other night, as the \nSenator from Illinois understands, I am not burdened with a legal \neducation. So when I made my suggestion, it was in the spirit of a \nformer CEO trying to resolve a controversy with one of his competitors \nor suppliers. But I understand, and ask the Senator from Illinois if he \ncould confirm this understanding, I understand that Miguel Estrada is \nperfectly willing to allow that set of memoranda to which we have \nreferred be made public. But he acted as an attorney advising a client, \nand it is the client in this case that says for the client's reasons--\nin this case the Department of Justice--we will not allow the memoranda \nto come forward.\n  My question is, Under those circumstances, isn't it appropriate that \nthe attorney is bound not to release the memoranda by himself?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me say, in response to the Senator from Utah, that I \ndon't apologize for not being a lawyer. I am proud to be one. But when \nthe Senator came to the floor with a commonsense solution to this \nimpasse, there is a question about Miguel Estrada and what he believes, \nwho he is, and what his values are, for goodness' sake, let us put that \ninformation before the Senate and give the man a vote, which he \ndeserves, that is a commonsense response from everyone--I think lawyer \nor otherwise. Then the lawyers got involved. And as the Senator \nmentioned, Miguel Estrada said, I will turn over all of this \ninformation, and go ahead, read it; there is nothing I want to hide \nhere. Then the Department of Justice and the White House stepped in and \nsaid: No, no, no. We will not release it. This is privileged as \nattorney-client communication, which is one of the privileges under the \nlaw as I recall from law school.\n  But let me show you this chart.\n  Mr. BENNETT. If I might pursue just a moment----\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Is it not true that Miguel Estrada is under a \nprofessional requirement in those circumstances not to release this \ninformation; even though he may want to, his professional ethics \nprevent him from doing so? And, if I may, the second question is, If \nthat is, indeed, the case, is it fair to attack him for not being \nresponsive when all he is doing is upholding his professional \nresponsibilities?\n  Mr. DURBIN. In response to the question, let me say that it may be \narguable as to whether or not there is an attorney-client privilege \nwhich makes this a confidential communication--these legal memoranda \nthat he can't give to the public because his client is not giving \napproval--that may be the case. But let us argue for a moment that it \nis the case. Let's say, forget whether or not it is a \nquestionable position. Let's assume it is right; that is, what you say \nis correct. Under the law, the client can always waive the privilege. \nIf I have hired an attorney to represent me, and that attorney has \nwritten legal memoranda inserting a point of law, and then someone asks \nfor that legal memoranda, that client or the attorney says, sorry my \nclient, Durbin, hasn't given a waiver of this privilege, this is \nprivileged communication between the attorney and client, but I, the \nattorney, say, will you waive that privilege, will you disclose it, and \nif I say, yes, I affirmatively waive the privilege, at that point it \nbecomes public.\n\n  The obvious question here is, Who was Miguel Estrada's client when \nthese legal memoranda were written? His client was the Department of \nJustice. His client was the White House. His client was, in fact, the \ngroup that has now nominated him to this DC Circuit Court.\n  And so here you have a curious situation. Miguel Estrada says, I \nwould love to let you see this, but my client won't allow me and won't \nwaive the privilege, and, therefore, I can't.\n  The client--the White House--is saying, go ahead and approve this \nman. There is nothing to worry about. But we will not let you see what \nhe has written. He was our attorney. He wrote for us. We will not let \nyou see what he has written.\n  Would that raise a question in the Senator's mind, in all honesty and \ngood faith? If the Department of Justice won't waive this privilege so \nwe can read these documents, does it raise a question in the Senator's \nmind as to whether there is something in there that bothers them and \nworries them?\n  Mr. BENNETT. If I might respond to my friend from Illinois, it would \nraise the question that the Senator is concerned about, if indeed the \npapers were written just for this White House. But the historic fact is \nthat the papers were written for the first Bush administration and for \nthe Clinton administration--specifically for the Solicitors General in \nthose two administrations. The specific Solicitors General who were \ninvolved, Democrat as well as Republican, said, don't allow the \nmemoranda to come forward.\n  So it is not a case of George W. Bush's administration having hired \nthis fellow and gotten information from him and then sent him up here \nwhile refusing to allow anything he told them to be made public. It is \na different fact situation.\n  I am persuaded by the fact that every living Solicitor General--\nRepublican or\n\n[[Page S2509]]\n\nDemocrat, old or young, liberal or conservative, everyone who is still \nbreathing--has said, don't allow this information to come forward. \nUnder those circumstances, I find it difficult to hold Estrada to task \nfor his failure to let this come forward when, in fact, the decision \nhas been made and unanimously supported by every living person who has \never sat in the position of his client.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me respond in this way. If the Senator accepts what \nthe Senator has just argued--that every time we elect a new President \nevery lawsuit filed by the U.S. States Government would have to be \nrefiled because there is a new President, there is a new Attorney \nGeneral, there is a new Solicitor General--that isn't the case. There \nis a continuity of government. Presidents come and Presidents go. \nSenators come and Senators go. Attorneys General come and go. But the \nU.S. Government continues. For Miguel Estrada to argue that because \nPresident Bush's father did not waive the privilege then he can't waive \nthe privilege today, I think is just plain wrong. I think the \ncontinuity of government argues otherwise.\n  Let me show you this chart that might be helpful in understanding \nwhat is being asked for is not unusual.\n  Look at this chart. The Bush administration claims that the request \nfor Mr. Estrada's legal writings is unprecedented, it has never \nhappened, it is a matter of privilege. But the Department of Justice \nhas provided memos by attorneys during the following nominations: When \nWilliam Bradford Reynolds was nominated to be Associate Attorney \nGeneral, his legal memoranda were produced by the same Department of \nJustice which now argues they cannot do it. Robert Bork was nominated \nto be a Supreme Court Justice, and his legal memoranda were produced by \nthe same Department of Justice which now says we cannot read Miguel \nEstrada's memoranda.\n  For Benjamin Civiletti, when he was nominated to be Attorney General, \nthe same ruled applied. The Department of Justice said: Read those so \nyou understand who he is. Now they say: You cannot read what Miguel \nEstrada wrote when he worked for us. We also have Stephen Trott, for \nthe Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit; and Justice William \nRehnquist, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.\n  So for the Department of Justice to argue this just is never done, \nhere are five specific examples where the Department of Justice has \nwaived the privilege and produced the writings.\n  It comes down to the basic point and question before us, What is my \nresponsibility, what is your responsibility, and the responsibility of \nthe Senate when a person seeks a lifetime appointment to the second \nhighest court of the land? Do we have a responsibility to just nod \napproval, to stamp ``approved'' on them, and move them through or do we \nhave a responsibility to ask basic questions?\n  Some of them are obvious: Is this person a person of good character? \nDoes this person have a good legal education? Does this person have a \ngood mind and a good temperament?\n  I would tell you, in each and every one of those categories, I think \nthe answer is affirmative when it comes to Miguel Estrada. This is an \nimpressive man. What he has done with this life, what he has overcome \nby way of personal challenge and adversity is really inspiring. I say \nthat having met him and sat down with him and read his story. All those \nthings are true.\n  But we also have a responsibility to ask: What is in your mind? What \nare your values? What principles will you bring to this job--not next \nyear but 10 years from now if you are still sitting there as a Federal \ncircuit court judge? How will you be motivated to make a decision?\n  I am not going to ask any judicial nominee to tell me how they will \ndecide a specific case. That is not fair; that is not right. But to ask \na judicial nominee basic questions you would ask of a district court \njudge in Utah and I would in Illinois, that is not unreasonable because \nwe want to try to create a mental picture of who this person is and \nwhat they bring to the job.\n  Miguel Estrada did so well--straight A's--on all the things I \nmentioned before: honesty, character, personal background, academic \nachievement, legal achievement as well. All these things, straight A's.\n  Then we came to the basic question of: In your mind, who are you? How \ndo you view the law? And that is where he failed. That is why his \nnomination is stopped on the floor of the Senate.\n  I asked him a question. It is written down here, and I will not \nrecount it because I have already put it in the Record. Think about \nthis question for a minute. I said to him: Can you identify any Federal \njudge, living or dead, whom you admire, whom you would like to emulate \nif you were appointed to the Federal judiciary? End of question. Not a \ntrick question, no. He said: I would not want to answer that question. \nI would not want to name a single Federal judge whom I admire or would \nemulate from the bench.\n\n  That troubles me.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for one final \ncomment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I promise I will not interrupt the Senator further.\n  Mr. DURBIN. No, I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BENNETT. But before we get too far away from the items on his \nchart, I simply want to come back again to the fundamental point I am \ntrying to make.\n  The Senator from Illinois has, indeed, precedent on his side that \nthere are circumstances where the client is willing to waive the \nprivilege. Just because the client has been willing to waive the \nprivilege in other circumstances does not mean the present client is \nrequired to waive the privilege in the present circumstance.\n  Each one of those circumstances is different. They are tied together \nby the fact that they are nominations and that the Justice Department \nis involved, but the fact situation in every one of them would be \ndifferent from the fact situation here. The fact situation here is that \nMiguel Estrada worked for the Solicitor General, and every single \nliving Solicitor General has said, regardless of what happened with \nWilliam Rehnquist or Robert Bork, in this circumstance the memoranda \nshould not be disclosed.\n  Miguel Estrada has a professional responsibility not to disclose, and \nhe is being attacked for his decision to abide by his professional \nresponsibility. If the White House and the Justice Department should be \nattacked for their refusal to grant the waiver, go to it, but do not \ntake it out on the lawyer who is standing on the basis of his ethics.\n  That is the only point I wish to make. I shall not belabor it, and I \nshall not interrupt the Senator from Illinois further. I thank him for \nhis courtesy.\n  Mr. DURBIN. No. I am happy to have the statement from the Senator \nfrom Utah. I do not consider it an interruption.\n  Let me say as an aside, I think it is healthy for us to have this \nkind of dialog on the Senate floor, and I have made it a policy both in \nthe House and in the Senate to always yield for questions. I think if \nthis is truly a deliberative body, then opposing points should be \nexpressed on the floor, and there isn't enough of it, there isn't \nenough real debate on the floor.\n  I thank the Senator from Utah for coming here in good faith and \nstating his position. I may disagree with it, but for the sake of the \nRecord and for the sake of public debate, I am glad that he is here. I \nam glad that he asked the question. And I know he feels as I do, he \nopens himself to questions when he comes to the floor. And I think that \nis part of our responsibility.\n  I have been advised by my staff--I did not realize this--that when \nWhite House Counsel Alberto Gonzales replied to our request about the \ndocuments related to Miguel Estrada, they did not claim a privilege, \nwhich surprises me; I thought that was what they would say, that there \nwas some legal privilege here or some executive privilege. Instead, the \nWhite House Counsel's Office insists that we already have enough \ninformation about this nominee, that they don't need to provide this.\n\n  So we had a nice discussion about privilege and whether or not that \napplies. It appears the White House has said: We are not going to argue \nthat--because they know they have produced this kind of information in \nthe past.\n  But let me go on for a moment and try to get to the heart of why this \nis an important debate. This goes way beyond any particular nominee. As \nI said\n\n[[Page S2510]]\n\nearlier, I have no personal animus against this man, Miguel Estrada. I \nadmire him personally. He was an immigrant to the United States. My \nmother was an immigrant to the United States. I think immigrants bring \na great deal to this country. They bring an energy and creativity and a \ncourage that really makes this a great nation.\n  Miguel Estrada fits that category. He came here as a teenager from \nHonduras. He learned the English language, went on to be accepted, I \nbelieve, at Columbia University, where he distinguished himself as a \nstudent. And that is no mean feat for a person who is new to the \nEnglish language. Then he went on to Harvard Law School, where again he \ndistinguished himself as a law student. So in each and every one of \nthese categories, this is a man whom you would move toward as a good \npotential nominee for the Federal court.\n  But despite all of this knowledge and all of this experience, when it \ncame time to ask him who he was, legally what he believed, he just \nrefused to answer. And the question is, at that point, Should the \nSenate have said: Well, I guess we tried our best; let's put him on the \nbench for life; let's hope for the best?\n  We cannot do that. And I will tell you why we cannot do that. Because \nunder the Constitution, which we have sworn to uphold, and which we \ntake very seriously, in article II, section 2, it says:\n\n       The President. . . . shall nominate, and by and with the \n     Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . Judges \n     of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United \n     States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided \n     for. . . .\n\n  This tells those who are watching that what is at stake here is not \njust a discretionary decision by the Senate as to whether or not we \nwill investigate a judicial nominee. We have a constitutional \nobligation. And if we believe in that investigation that a nominee is \nwanting, might not be a person suited to serve in the Federal \njudiciary, I think we are duty bound to vote against him.\n  Let's look at the record with George W. Bush, a Republican President, \nand the Senate, which for 16 or 17 months was under Democratic control. \nWhat happened? Did the Democratic Senate say to the White House: You \ncannot have Federal judges? We are Democrats. You are a Republican. \nStop sending us Republican nominees? No. No. That did not happen.\n  In the course of that period of time, 100 judges, nominated by \nPresident Bush--Republican nominees--were approved by the Democratic \nSenate Judiciary Committee. I sat on that committee. I voted on \nvirtually every one of those nominees in committee and on the floor. \nThose nominees were approved, knowing full well that the President had \nhis right as the President to name his judges.\n  How many were rejected? If 100 nominees of the Bush White House were \napproved, how many were rejected by the Democrats when they were in \ncharge of the Judiciary Committee? Two. One hundred approved; two \ndisapproved--Judge Pickering of Mississippi and Judge Owens of Texas. \nOf the 100 that were approved, trust me, overwhelmingly, these were \npeople of a conservative political philosophy, people who reflected the \nPresident's political philosophy and probably his legal philosophy. We \nknew it going in. That is the name of the game. The President has that \nauthority. We asked the basic questions, were satisfied with the \nanswers; the nominee moves forward. Two were rejected.\n  Now Miguel Estrada comes before us. Last Monday three more of \nPresident Bush's nominees were approved unanimously by the Senate, but \nMiguel Estrada still is on the calendar.\n  The question that has been raised on the Republican side is, why are \nyou asking these difficult questions of Miguel Estrada? It is \ninteresting to look at statements made by Republican Senators who are \nnow arguing on behalf of Miguel Estrada. The first, of course, comes \nfrom Senator Orrin Hatch, a friend of mine, my colleague in the Senate, \nchairman of the committee. When he led the fight to oppose a Hispanic \nnominee, Rosemary Barkett, this is what he said:\n\n       I led the fight to oppose [Judge Rosemary Barkett's] \n     confirmation because . . . [her] judicial records indicated \n     that she would be an activist who would legislate from the \n     bench.\n\n  Senator Hatch is entitled to that decision whether she is Hispanic or \nnot. But when we ask similar questions today about Miguel Estrada, we \nare being called unfair. He could ask questions and have doubts in his \nmind about whether this judicial nominee by President Clinton would be \nan activist. We are not allowed to ask the same questions about Miguel \nEstrada without being accused of being unfair to Hispanics. This is by \nany measure a double standard.\n  Let me give you another quote from Senator Hatch, who quoted \nAlexander Hamilton when he said:\n\n       The Senate's task of advise and consent is to advise and to \n     query--ask questions--on the judiciousness and character of \n     nominees.\n\n  It isn't just the character, it is the judiciousness, the judicial \njudging of nominees. That is a reasonable thing to ask. I could see a \nperson with the most outstanding legal credentials, academic \ncredentials and personal integrity, bring a philosophy to the bench \nwhich I think would be damaging to the country and our Constitution. \nShould I ignore it? I can't. I am dutybound because I have sworn to \nuphold the Constitution, to put men and women on the bench who will \nuphold it as well, and make decisions which are consistent with our \nvalues. Senators may see those values differently, but at a minimum we \nshould be able to ask the questions of the nominees: What do you \nbelieve? What is important to you? When we asked those questions of \nMiguel Estrada, he evaded them completely.\n  Senator Schumer from the State of New York, on the Judiciary \nCommittee, asked him a question similar to the one I referred to \nearlier, when Miguel Estrada refused to name one single Federal judge \nliving or dead who he admired or would try to emulate. Senator Schumer \ndecided to take a different approach. He asked Miguel Estrada to name a \nSupreme Court decision with which he disagreed. First he asked within \nthe last 40 years and then he said, just in general, any Supreme Court \ndecision you would disagree with?\n  Miguel Estrada, having served as a law clerk at the Supreme Court, in \nthe Solicitor General's Office in the Department of Justice, with all \nof his background, having argued cases 15 times before the Supreme \nCourt, refused to name one case in the history of the Court with which \nhe disagreed.\n\n  What springs to mind? You don't need to be a lawyer. The Dred Scott \ndecision, decided by the Court in the 1850s, which institutionalized \nslavery and led to the Civil War. Was that a wrong decision by the \nSupreme Court? I don't know of anyone who argues it was not. Miguel \nEstrada, who wants to go to the second highest court in the land, \nwouldn't name Dred Scott as a wrong decision.\n  Let's take another, Plessy v. Ferguson. This was a case which said \nwhen it came to race relations in the United States, the standard would \nbe separate but equal, leading to a pattern of segregation in America \nfinally broken by Brown v. the Board of Education in the 1950s and the \ncivil rights laws. I don't know of a single person, other than some of \nthe strangest and most radical, who wouldn't argue that Plessy v. \nFerguson was a bad decision by the Supreme Court. Miguel Estrada, \ndespite all of his background, wouldn't name Plessy v. Ferguson as a \nbad decision.\n  So to those who say the Democrats are nitpicking, you are really \nholding this man to an impossible standard, think about that.\n  I failed to add this. The same question about Supreme Court decisions \nyou disagree with is a common question asked of judicial nominees. In \nfact, Republican Senator Sessions of Alabama asked that exact question \nof a Hispanic nominee, Richard Paez, nominated by President Clinton. \nWhen he asked the question, Democrats didn't stand up and say, that is \nunfair, that is a foul ball, you can't ask that question. Not at all. \nPaez answered the question, and for his forthrightness and candor \nbefore the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee, his \nnomination was held up over 4 years before finally a cloture motion was \nfiled and it was brought to the floor.\n  For those who are following this, the standard being applied to \nMiguel Estrada is one that has been time tested on both sides. His \nresponse, sadly,\n\n[[Page S2511]]\n\ndoes not meet the measure of what we should expect nominees for a \nlifetime appointment to the Federal bench.\n  Senator Larry Craig has also commented about this process. He is a \nconservative Republican. He would be proud of that description. He \nsaid:\n\n       Any notion that there is a rebuttable presumption on behalf \n     of a nomination--that the Senate ought to be basically pliant \n     in response to a nomination--is altogether unconstitutional, \n     even anticonstitutional.\n\n  These were arguments made by Republican Senators when the nominees \ncame from a Democratic White House. Now with this one nominee being \nquestioned as to whether he is going to answer the basic queries, we \nare being told we are unfair. Senator Craig said to do otherwise is to \navoid our constitutional responsibility.\n  What is this approach we are seeing by judicial nominees where they \nare unresponsive to questions? It is not new. If you followed the \ntelevised hearings involving Clarence Thomas, you can recall when he \nwas asked and replied that he had no opinion on the issue of abortion. \nClarence Thomas, no opinion on abortion, this man who had been a \nCatholic seminarian, who had been a law student when Roe v. Wade was \ndecided, said he had no opinion. He was allowed to get away with that \nanswer. I think we learned a lesson there. We have learned it over and \nover. If nominees won't be open and honest with us when it comes to \ntheir beliefs, it puts us at a disadvantage in terms of trying to \nunderstand what they will do on the bench. It was predictable what \nClarence Thomas was likely to do on the Supreme Court as a Justice. We \nhave seen that has been borne out in more cases than not. The fact he \nwould say to the Judiciary Committee with a straight face, I have no \nopinion on the issue of abortion, raises in my mind a question of his \ncandor and a question of the Judiciary Committee's meeting its \nresponsibility.\n  This is a statement or a quote from the Legal Times newspaper last \nyear. This was Larry Silberman, who is a DC Circuit Court judge. It \nsays:\n\n       President George W. Bush's judicial nominees received some \n     very specific confirmation advice last week: Keep your mouth \n     shut. Scalia called DC Circuit Judge Silberman at one point, \n     the latter recalled, and told him he was about to be \n     questioned about his views on Marbury v. Madison, the nearly \n     200-year-old case that established the principle of judicial \n     review. ``I told him that as a matter of principle, he \n     shouldn't answer that question either.''\n\n  When you start law school, if not the first day, the second day, we \nstudy Marbury v. Madison because unless you understand Marbury v. \nMadison, you don't understand why there is a Federal court system and \nwhy it has the power to review legislation passed by Congress. It is so \nbasic. It is like saying, read the Constitution before you come to \nconstitutional law class.\n  Here we have a man aspiring to sit on the Supreme Court who is being \ninstructed, don't say a word about Marbury v. Madison, a 200-year-old \ncourt case. So it is a tactical strategy, used by nominees as often as \nthey can get away with it, to say as little as possible.\n\n  Let me also go to the question of Hispanic nominees. Here we have a \nstatement made on the floor that Mr. Estrada should be approved because \nhe is of Hispanic origin. I am proud of the fact that, as a Senator \nfrom Illinois, I was able to appoint the second Hispanic district court \njudge in our district's history to the court in Chicago. He is from \nPuerto Rico. He has done a great job, and I am sure he will continue \nto. We have a growing Hispanic population in our Nation, and certainly \nin my home State. They bring great value to our country and to my \nState. I think it is reasonable--in fact, advisable--for us to bring to \nthe bench men and women of diverse backgrounds so that when defendants \nand plaintiffs and their lawyers come before that bench, they see \nrepresented in the court the diversity of our Nation. I think that is a \ngood thing to do.\n  When the White House has decided to act affirmatively to bring \nHispanics to the Federal bench, I think they are doing the right thing. \nI applaud that. I think we should bring as much diversity as we can \nwith qualified individuals to the bench. But the arguments being made \nthat because we have questioned Miguel Estrada in whether or not he has \nbeen forthright in his answers has something to do with the Democrats' \nview of Hispanics' contribution to America doesn't hold up.\n  One of the Republican Senators said in the Dallas Morning News \nearlier this year:\n\n       If we deny Estrada a position on the DC Circuit, it would \n     be to shut the door on the American dream of Hispanic \n     Americans everywhere.\n\n  But the reality is this. Until last week, Mr. Estrada was the only \nLatino nominated by President Bush to any of the 42 vacancies that have \nexisted on the 13 courts of appeal. In contrast, President Clinton \nnominated 11 Latinos to our appellate courts. He nominated 21 Latinos \nto the district courts. Sadly, when the Republicans controlled the \nJudiciary Committee, and President Clinton was in the White House, they \nblocked several well-qualified Latinos from getting hearings, including \nEnrique Moreno, Jorge Rangel, and Christina Arguello.\n  I recall the Moreno nomination. Enrique Moreno was born in Juarez, \nMexico, under the poorest of circumstances. His family emigrated to El \nPaso, TX, where they worked as blue-collar workers. He grew up under \nthe toughest of circumstances, but he went on to great distinction in \nlaw school. And he was sent before the Judiciary Committee and wasn't \neven given the dignity of a hearing--without being given a hearing and, \ncertainly, no vote. When asked on the floor, Senator Hatch said that is \nbecause the two Republican Senators from Texas didn't approve him. \nWell, that is their right. Under the blue slip process--an arcane, but \nimportant process we have followed in the past--they could stop him, \nand they did.\n  I don't recall the hue and cry then from any Republican leaders that \nsomehow it was discriminatory against Hispanics that two Anglo \nRepublican Senators from Texas would stop a well-qualified Hispanic \nnominee. But they did.\n  The same thing was true for Jorge Rangel, nominated to the circuit \ncourt of appeals, who finally, after waiting and not receiving the \napproval of the two Senators from Texas, said: I give up, I am throwing \nin the towel. This is all about politics, and no matter what I say or \ndo, they are not going to approve me.\n  He walked away from that process. That is an unfortunate example of \nwhat can happen.\n  Mr. Estrada was given a hearing and an opportunity to answer \nquestions, and he has been given repeated opportunities to provide \nlegal writings so we can make a decision on him. I stand before the \nSenate today, as I have in the past, to say if he is open and honest \nand cooperative with the committee, he deserves a vote. If we receive \nthe legal memoranda and writings and have a chance to ask questions \nrelated to those in some areas he has not answered in the past, and he \ngives open and honest answers, then his nomination should move forward.\n  I see my friend and colleague from Ohio, Senator DeWine, in the \nChamber. Not 2 or 3 weeks ago, several nominees from his State came \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee with Senator Hatch as chairman. \nTwo of them were fairly controversial. The hearing, I am sure Senator \nDeWine recalls, went on for 12 hours. It was one of the longest I have \never seen. One nominee, Mr. Sutton, was given a lot of questions by a \nlot of different members and he answered them. Though I didn't agree \nwith his answers, I have to say in all candor that he didn't avoid the \nquestions, as we have seen with Miguel Estrada under the circumstances. \nSo I think that is an important difference to be made.\n\n\n                         The Danger of Ephedra\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to touch on one other issue not \nrelated to the Estrada nomination before I yield the floor. It will \ntake me about 15 minutes to complete the presentation I am about to \nmake. Then I will be happy to yield the floor. It relates to a decision \nthat was made this week by a county in New York, Suffolk County. They \ntook a historic step to protect the residents of their county from \nharm, even the dangerous and deadly harm of dietary supplements. You \nknow about these dietary supplements. You cannot walk into any \ndrugstore or turn on the TV or go to a convenience store or a gas \nstation that you don't see someone trying to sell us a pill to make us \nthin. These dietary supplements, I guess, help some people to lose\n\n[[Page S2512]]\n\nweight. Doctors argue back and forth about that.\n  It turns out that some of these dietary supplements contain a \nchemical--a naturally occurring chemical--called ephedra, which is \ndangerous. Suffolk County in Long Island banned the sale of ephedra \nproducts because the Suffolk County Department of Health Services \ndetermined that ``dietary supplements containing ephedra alkaloid are \ntoo dangerous to be sold within the county of Suffolk.''\n  Last year, the U.S. Army moved to protect service men and women and \nthe employees who use the base by also banning the sale of ephedra \nproducts in commissaries across the United States.\n  Sadly, it would seem that despite these decisions by local and State \ngovernments and by some agencies of the Federal Government, our Federal \nGovernment, in general, and particularly our Department of Health and \nHuman Services, has consistently refused to take the necessary action \nto protect America's families and children from products containing \nephedra.\n\n  Since last August, I have repeatedly called on Secretary Tommy \nThompson, and I renew the call today, to ban ephedra products in the \nUnited States. The Secretary has the authority to do so. There is no \nexcuse for the delay. I have asked him to use his authority under DSHEA \nto declare ephedra an imminent hazard and take it off the market, in \nthe same way as it was done in Suffolk County and other cities and \ncounties, and in certain States it was done in our military posts. The \nSecretary has refused to respond. His responses have not been helpful.\n  As chairman of the Government Oversight Committee, last year, I held \ntwo hearings on this topic, challenging this administration to act. I \nam not the only one who has done so. Last year, the Canadian Government \nbanned products containing ephedra. They said you cannot sell them \nthere because they are too dangerous. They kill people.\n  What kind of products am I talking about? Are these weird, remote \nthings you never run across? No. Metabolife--have you ever heard of it? \nThey do a lot of advertising. Metabolife diet pills--an energy \nsupplement, they call it, to help you lose weight. They do sell a \nproduct that contains ephedra. This is what I am talking about. These \nare the drugs that can be a danger to certain people. There are others. \nOne is called Yellow Jackets. I will get to that in a moment because \nthere is a sad and tragic story about these. It says ``built as an \nextreme energizer.''\n  I recently went to a junior high school in Springfield, IL, and I \nasked the boys and girls: How many have heard of Yellow Jackets? Half \nof the kids raised their hands. Do you know why. You don't need a \nprescription. You can walk into any convenience store or gas station \nand you can buy them two or three at a time.\n  Sadly, these pills taken by kids can kill them--kill them. I will \ntell you of a sad story where it occurred near my home. I have given \nthis information to Secretary Thompson. He has ignored it. Nothing has \nhappened. There are no excuses now for what we presently face. The best \nhe can give us is, he says these products ought to have stronger \nwarning labels.\n  What would a warning label say if it was honest about the product \nephedra? It would have to say if you are going to take Metabolife, for \nexample, which is known as a dietary supplement and classified as a \nfood under our strange Federal laws, if you were going to take this \nproduct, here is the warning label you would have to put on it: Taking \nthis food product will increase your risk of heart attack, stroke, \nseizure, and death.\n  Can one think of another food product sold in America where we \nidentify on the label that it can be lethal if you take it? In most \ncases, in most civilized nations, we would not allow a product that \ncould kill you to be sold as a food product in any circumstance.\n  Some people argue, you can take enough aspirin to kill you. This is \nall true, but when it comes to this product, they are selling it to \nchildren--this Yellow Jacket product and this product, Metabolife--to \nvirtually anybody who can put money on the counter, with no warning as \nto the potential of harm.\n  In reality, how can the Secretary rely on warning labels for a \nproduct that is found to be so dangerous? Let me make it clear, the \nonly reasonable step to take is to take these products off the market. \nIf this administration, and particularly Secretary Thompson, continues \nto delay this decision, sadly he will have to answer the question of \nhow he can account for the numerous people who continue to lose their \nlives because of these dangerous products.\n  The Secretary has the power under existing law to take these products \noff the market. He has failed and refused to do so. As the Department \ndelays, terrible things occur.\n  I told you I would recount an incident involving this particular \nproduct, Yellow Jacket. Last September, in Lincoln, IL, a few miles \nfrom where I live, a young man 16 years old, a healthy, athletic, high \nschool student named Sean Riggins was getting ready for a football \ngame. He went to a local convenience store and bought Yellow Jackets, \nan extreme energizer. You will find them for sale. You are going to \nfind them in North Dakota. You are going to find them as well in Rhode \nIsland. You are going to find them in Ohio. They are everywhere.\n  This boy bought this product, grabbed a Mountain Dew, which contains \ncaffeine, washed it down, and died. He bought them at a convenience \nstore, washed them down, and died. It is incredible to think this could \nhappen, and the autopsy confirmed this was the reason for his death.\n  When we say to Secretary Thompson, for God's sake, protect the \nchildren from this happening again, he waits, he fails to respond. He \nsays he is thinking about it.\n  On September 6 last year, because of these Yellow Jackets, Sean \nRiggins, a healthy, athletic high school student had a massive heart \nattack and died. When you look around the Senate, you will see pages \nworking on the floor in the Senate. It is a time-honored tradition. \nThese are young men and women of high school age. When you look at \nthem, you are looking at a person of the age of Sean Riggins who \nthought he was doing the right thing to get ready for a football game. \nSadly, he was preparing for a funeral--his own.\n  He was the only child of Deb and Kevin Riggins from Lincoln, IL. His \nparents, thank God, have decided to go on a crusade to try to protect \nother kids. They turned their grief to positive action. They set up the \nSean Riggins Foundation for Substance-Free Schools. I commend them for \ntheir courage. They are going to coaches, teachers, and parents saying: \nFor goodness sake, talk to your kids about this. We know \nabout marijuana; we know about cocaine; we know about heroin; we have \nto do our part in telling them how dangerous it can be. We know how \ndangerous tobacco and alcohol are. We are ignoring the obvious. These \nare for sale everywhere. They are cheap and kids are buying them. Let \nme be honest with you; some kids buy these pills and drink beer with \nthem and think this is a brand new high and die as a result--\nMetabolife, Yellow Jackets, and a variety of other names.\n\n  The question before us now is, Should we act? And the answer is \nobviously yes. Mr. President, did you know the NCAA, the National \nFootball League, and the International Olympic Committee have all moved \nto protect their athletes by banning ephedra? And yet, Secretary \nThompson refuses to protect innocent children who buy this product.\n  The Rigginses are not alone in their grief. The Suffolk County, NY, \nban I mentioned was imposed this week was also as a result of a young \nperson's death. In 1996, Peter Schlendorf of Northport, Long Island, 20 \nyears old, died from taking ephedra. His parents have joined the \nRigginses in this sad alliance in the memory of their sons to try to \nwarn parents.\n  The 7-Eleven stores--we see them all around--used to be one of the \nstores that sold ephedra products. They decided it is not safe. They \nwill not carry ephedra products anymore.\n  Think about it; all this action is taking place without the Federal \nGovernment stepping in to protect us. That is hard to believe.\n  There are also lawsuits underway. The trial lawyers of America are \nconvenient whipping boys. People blame them for a lot of things--too \nmany frivolous lawsuits, high insurance rates, and the like. The fact \nis, if the trial lawyers of America were not suing this industry, \nchanges would not\n\n[[Page S2513]]\n\ntake place because this Government is not doing its job. This \nadministration is not doing its job.\n  If we look at the situation, Metabolife is now peddling a product \nthey say is free of ephedra. They want to make it clear you have a \nchoice. They are trying to figure a way to back off the thousands and \nthousands of bottles of this product they have already sold.\n  In October, a Federal jury found Metabolife 356, this dietary \nsupplement, containing ephedra that was ``unreasonably dangerous,'' \nalthough you can buy it over the counter without a prescription, and \nawarded four injured Americans $4.1 million to compensate them for \ntheir injuries and the wanton bad behavior of the Metabolife Company. \nMany other cases have been settled with large awards.\n  The action is in the courts because there is no action in Washington. \nSecretary Thompson and the Department of Health and Human Services \nrefuses to respond, refuses to act. People die, and their survivors go \nto court holding these companies responsible. Why isn't this Government \nholding these companies responsible? Why aren't we banning the sale of \nthese products now?\n  The medical evidence is overwhelming. In January of this year, \nresearchers from Yale, the University of Texas at Houston, the \nUniversity of Michigan, the University of Cincinnati, and Brown \nUniversity reported in the journal Neurology that those taking one-\nthird of the manufacturer's recommended daily dose of these ephedra \nproducts increase their risk of hemorrhagic stroke three times. In \nFebruary, an article in the Annals of Internal Medicine showed that \nephedra use associated with a greatly increased risk for adverse \nreactions compared with other herbs, and the authors suggested its use \nshould be restricted.\n  This study found ephedra use resulted in a 720-times increase in \nadverse reactions compared to ginkgo biloba use and in hundredfold more \nadverse reactions compared to other herbs that were used which they \nthink are safe. Secretary Thompson knows this. The medical evidence is \nthere.\n  Metabolife, when they were asked to produce information for \nCongressman Waxman and myself, said in 1999, for example, they did not \nhave any instance of anybody taking their pills and having a bad \nresult. But when Congressman Waxman and I, as well as the trial \nlawyers, put them on the spot and made them produce all the information \nsent to them, we found 100 people before 1999 with serious adverse \nreactions, including heart attack and stroke.\n  These companies selling these products have been irresponsible in the \nmarketing of this product. They sell them to children. They know they \ncause adverse health consequences, and they continue to do so because \nthis Government will not step in and stop them. The burden is on \nSecretary Thompson and the Bush administration. Do not look the other \nway. Do not ignore the deaths that are occurring. Do not ignore the \nfact that 23 States have now moved to restrict the sale of these \nproducts because the Federal Government refuses to accept its \nresponsibility.\n  It is time for us to act and to act now before there are more \ninnocent victims.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                          Tribute to Jim McKee\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a dear and \ncherished friend, a mentor and a role model, former Yellow Springs, OH, \nchief of police of 34 years, Jim McKee, who passed away on January 18 \nof this year at the age of 73.\n  Raised in Springfield, OH, Jim McKee moved to Yellow Springs when he \nwas 18 years old, fresh out of high school, in search of a job. During \nhis first year in Yellow Springs, Jim held a number of different \npositions, working in a shoe repair shop and later at Mills Lawn \nElementary School.\n  It was at Mills Lawn Elementary School that I first met my future \nwife Frances, in first grade, but it was also at Mills Lawn I first met \nJim McKee. Jim was the person who kept things going at Mills Lawn. I \nremember how much respect, love, and admiration the students had for \nJim.\n  I first saw in Jim the ability he had to connect with people. I saw \nit as a child. I remember he would gather the students together and \ntalk to them about how we needed to keep the place looking good and how \nimportant that was. I remember how we looked up to him and how much we \nrespected him.\n  Eventually, Jim McKee took a job at Wright Patterson Air Force Base \nnear my hometown of Yellow Springs. But by 1957, Jim decided he needed \nto move on. True to form, Jim saw this change not as a bad thing but \nreally as a new opportunity to do something he had always dreamed of \ndoing, and that was to get involved in law enforcement. This was his \nchance, his opportunity. Before long, he was realizing that dream. The \nvillage of Yellow Springs then hired him as a police officer. He joined \na department of two officers and a chief, a small department at the \ntime. Within 2 short years and the recognition of his talent and his \nhard work, Jim McKee was appointed chief of police.\n  In this new leadership position, Jim McKee soon found himself dealing \nwith issues he probably did not think he was going to be dealing with, \nissues of historic importance, because at that time the civil rights \nmovement was beginning to sweep our country. The civil rights movement \nhad reached Yellow Springs, a small community in southwest Ohio, my \nhometown. It reached Yellow Springs sooner than most other parts of the \ncountry.\n  Jim McKee was one of the few African-American chiefs of police in the \nState of Ohio. Jim McKee guided my hometown with great skill through a \nvery difficult period of time. As one of the few African-American \nchiefs of police in the State, really one of the few in the country at \nthe time, Jim McKee faced his own civil rights issues early on in the \nmovement. Everybody in Yellow Springs, a community then and now of \ngreat diversity and a community that then and now embodies a person's \nright to free speech, everybody in Yellow Springs respected and liked \nJim McKee. That made all the difference in the world.\n  Whether Jim realized it or not during this tumultuous era, Jim was in \nfact playing a part in our American history. Jim McKee kept the peace, \nmaintained order, and all the while respected people's freedom of \nspeech, their right to demonstrate, and their civil rights. He did it \nin a professional way.\n  I remember when Dr. Martin Luther King came to Yellow Springs to \ndeliver the commencement address at Antioch College. Chief McKee, of \ncourse, provided his security detail. Years later, recalling this \nexperience with Dr. King, Chief McKee had this to say:\n\n       At the time there were rumors they were out to get him. I \n     saw him do his nonviolent teachings. I drove around in the \n     car with him for 2 days. He was a perfect Christian gentleman \n     and I was frightened to death because I was providing his \n     security. We told people he was staying at the Antioch Inn, \n     but in fact he was right across the street from where I \n     live--in the home his wife, Coretta, lived in as a student at \n     Antioch years before. You would think they would have figured \n     it out, with all the police cruisers parked out front. I was \n     never so glad to see a plane take off.\n\n  Despite whatever concerns Jim McKee may have had, the chief performed \nhis duties with a great sense of professionalism, with honor and \ncourage. Though he dealt with significant issues on the national stage, \nChief McKee dedicated his career to Yellow Springs and to keeping the \ncommunity he loved so much safe and free from crime.\n  As Members of the Senate know--or may not know--Yellow Springs is not \na large city. It is a village. It is a small village where people know \ntheir neighbors and watch out for one another. Even today, I believe \nthere are probably only about eight or so police officers on the force. \nChief McKee, as the local police chief, was really an icon in his own \ncommunity. He was greatly admired and respected as an officer, as a \nprotector, but most of all as a friend.\n  Though I first met him as an elementary school student, actually in \nthe first grade, I had the opportunity later on to reconnect with him. \nOur lives came together again when I became assistant county \nprosecuting attorney and he was by that time the dean of the chiefs of \npolice in Greene County. I knew him then and later when I became the \nprosecutor of our home county. We worked on a number of cases that \narose out of Yellow Springs, several very difficult rape cases. We\n\n[[Page S2514]]\n\nworked on several of those cases together. During this time, I learned \na great deal about how Chief McKee treated people and how he dealt with \nsome of the most tense situations. Perhaps most importantly, though, I \nsaw his great sense of humanity toward both victims and suspects.\n  Chief Jim McKee taught me there is much more to police work than \narrests and convictions. He taught me about the human component in \npolice work. He taught me about people and about compassion.\n  I remember one instance in particular when I saw and learned about \nhow Jim McKee dealt with a man who had been in an auto accident. This \nman was involved in a horrible thing, as many accidents are, but he \ncame out of it. He walked out of the accident, but the other person in \nthe other vehicle did not and the other person died. This particular \nperson was actually a suspect, and he could have been charged. The \npolice were looking at and trying to decide whether to charge him. \nActually, later on there was a grand jury that was convened. The grand \njury had to make a decision whether this person was going to be charged \nand have to stand trial. Eventually they decided not to charge him, but \nJim did not know that at the time. I saw how Jim dealt with this man \nand showed this man, who was going through great anguish at the time, a \nman who was really a suspect, and I saw how Jim worked him through \nthis, talked to him and showed great kindness to him. That is how Jim \nMcKee treated everyone, with great kindness and with great compassion, \nall the time being a professional, all the time doing his job.\n\n  It was this compassion that set Jim McKee apart. He cared deeply \nabout people and just knew how to deal with them.\n  At the end of Chief McKee's distinguished 36-year career in law \nenforcement, I had the honor of attending his farewell banquet. I was \nlieutenant governor at the time and was there to pay tribute to the \nchief on behalf of the entire State of Ohio, and on behalf of Governor, \nthen-Governor George Voinovich. At this reception and this dinner, I \nwas struck by the sheer outpouring of respect and admiration and \nappreciation for Chief McKee's work and for his selfless contributions \nto our community. It was clear at this reception how important Chief \nMcKee was to the people, to the village of Yellow Springs, and to the \nentire law enforcement community across the State of Ohio. I was proud \nto be part of this memorable event.\n  Following his retirement from the force in 1993, Chief McKee remained \nactive in the community until the day he died. He was a key member of \nthe Yellow Springs Men's Group, an organization dedicated to studying \nissues important to the day-to-day lives of Yellow Springs residents. \nThrough this organization, the James A. McKee scholarship fund was \nestablished in 2002 as a tribute both to Jim and to his legacy of \ncommunity involvement.\n  In the recent days following Jim's death, a number of newspapers ran \narticles about his life and his legacy. As I read through these \ntributes, I was especially taken with a statement from my friend, Paul \nFord, who had known Chief McKee since 1949. This is what Mr. Ford said:\n\n       We've lost a good citizen, a good friend, and a \n     humanitarian. Once you met Jim, you were a friend.\n\n  Indeed, Jim McKee was my friend and someone for whom I had great \naffection and admiration. This quote really gets to why Chief McKee was \nso special to the community of Yellow Springs and to all of us who knew \nhim. He dedicated his life to serving the people of Yellow Springs. He \nworked to keep his community safe and free from crime.\n  When I think about Jim McKee and his life's work as a police officer, \nprotector of the community, I am reminded of a Bible passage from \nMatthew: Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the \nchildren of God.\n  Indeed, Chief Jim McKee was a peacemaker and a protector and just a \ngood and decent hard-working man. He was a kind person, a kind human \nbeing who always tried to do the right thing for his family, for his \ncommunity, and for his Nation.\n  My wife Fran and I extend our heartfelt sympathy and our prayers for \nthe entire McKee family, for his wife of 54 years, Naomi; his four \ndaughters, Bari McKee-Teamor, Karen McKee, Jean McKee, Sandra McKee-\nSmith; his son, Jimmy, his five grandchildren, and one great grandson. \nJim McKee loved his family. He cared deeply for them. I know they, like \nall of us, will miss him tremendously.\n  Thank you, Jim, for all you did for Yellow Springs and for our \nNation. You will be remembered always in our minds and in our hearts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                             Foreign Policy\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was reading a piece in a newspaper this \nmorning that misquoted remarks I made on the floor of the Senate \nrecently. The journalist got it plain wrong in this case. He indicated \nthat Senator Dorgan feels that Saddam Hussein is not dangerous.\n  Of course, I have never said that, would not say that, and whoever \nlistened to my remarks previously either chose to reinterpret them in a \nway that is not accurate or chose to ignore what I said. Let me \ndescribe what I said.\n  I talked about the dangers presented by North Korea. I talked about \nthe importance of prosecuting the war on terrorism, and protecting this \ncountry against terrorist attacks. And I said that while Iraq and \nSaddam Hussein are a problem, we have to face these other issues as \nwell.\n  If today trucks are backing up to a plant in North Korea and moving \nfuel rods that will become processed and become part of a nuclear \nbombmaking process, and a bomb could be sold by North Korea to other \ncountries, and to terrorists, that is a serious problem. That could \ncome back in a year and a half or 2 years into this country in the form \nof a nuclear bomb possessed by a terrorist. That is serious business.\n  We are told that the trucks are moving. We are told that is what is \nhappening in North Korea. And yet there does not seem to be the same \nkind of attention paid to it as is now paid to the country of Iraq.\n  We are told there is an orange level of alert in our country today, \nwhich suggests once again the threat posed by Osama bin Laden and his \nfellow terrorist, who have not yet been apprehended.\n  So we are facing terrorist groups, Osama bin Laden, Korea, Saddam \nHussein, and Iraq.\n  My point is not that Saddam Hussein is not dangerous; he indeed is \ndangerous. We ought to deal with him. Frankly, the credit of having \ninspectors in Iraq at this point belongs to the President; otherwise \nthey would not have been able to enter Iraq and begin the inspections. \nIf Saddam Hussein does not disarm, he will be disarmed either by this \ncountry or this country and other countries acting in concert. That is \njust a fact.\n  My point is that is not the only challenge we face and not \nnecessarily the greatest challenge we face. If trucks are moving spent \nfuel rods in North Korea today, then we better make a judgment to deal \nwith that.\n  If we have an orange alert in this country today because terrorist \ngroups have mobilized and intelligence suggests that an orange alert is \nwarranted, then we had better be concerned about that. And we had \nbetter prosecute that war against terrorism as aggressively as we \npursue Saddam Hussein. That is my point.\n  Now I have come to the floor today to speak about a related subject, \nand that is the subject of energy. We import oil in order to run our \ncountry's automobile fleets, stationary engines, and so on. We import \n20 million barrels a day. Saudi Arabia is our No. 1 importer--Mexico, \nCanada, Venezuela, Nigeria--Iraq is No. 6 at 289,000 barrels. Our \ncountry is very dependent on energy from a Middle East that is rocked \nby turmoil. If tonight, God forbid, terrorists were able to interrupt \nthe flow of energy, the flow of oil to our country from Saudi Arabia \nand Iraq, for example, our economy would be in trouble. That is just a \nplain fact.\n  Does it make sense for us to continue to be so dependent on oil \ncoming from that part of the world? I don't think so. So what will we \ndo about that? Let me describe a couple of things.\n  Yesterday my colleagues from South Dakota, Senator Daschle and \nothers, Senator Johnson, myself, and Senator\n\n[[Page S2515]]\n\nConrad, introduced a piece of legislation dealing with ethanol, \nrenewable fuels. Ethanol is a fuel in which you grow a crop in the \nfield, you harvest it, you take a kernel of corn, you extract from the \nkernel of corn the drop of alcohol and you have the protein feedstock \nleft. You extend America's energy supply, you still have something for \ncattle to eat, and you grow it year after year after year and you are \nnot dependent on Saudi Arabia or Iraq. It is a renewable fuel that you \nproduce year after year. Here is the way you produce ethanol. You grow \na crop such as corn, finely grind it, separate it into component \nsugars, distill the sugars to make ethanol, and you put it in a \nvehicle. It is very simple. You are growing crops to produce America's \nenergy. That is what ethanol is about. You can do it with barley. You \ncan do it with sugar beets, start with sugar beets. You can do it with \npotatoes. You grow your energy.\n\n  We import 55 percent of the oil we consume in this country. That is \nexpected to grow to 68 percent by 2025. Nearly all of our cars and \ntrucks run on gasoline. They are the main reasons our country imports \nso much oil.\n  I think this chart shows what is happening with respect to energy in \nour country. We have a demand line that is going up. You will see that \nthe reason for that, by and large, is transportation. Mostly that is \nvehicles--cars, trucks, other vehicles. This is where the demand is, \ntransportation.\n  Domestic production of oil, as you can see, is fairly flat. If we \nwere to go up to ANWR in Alaska, as some would like us to do--I don't \nhappen to support it--you would see what would happen as a result of \nANWR--almost nothing. Or if we go on into the Gulf of Mexico, which I \ndo support--that will not solve all of our energy needs. We are just \nnot going to solve our problems with those approaches. We have to \nproduce more, and we will produce more--produce more coal, produce more \noil, and natural gas. We will do it in ways that protect our \nenvironment as much as possible. But that is not enough. We need to do \nmuch more than that.\n  One of the answers, in my judgment, is to have much greater \nproduction of ethanol. And so we are introducing legislation, as my \ncolleague from South Dakota, Senator Daschle, said yesterday, with a \nrenewable fuels provision. It has been carefully negotiated over many \nmonths. Twenty groups--National Corn Growers, the Renewable Fuels \nAssociation, the American Farm Bureau, National Farmers Union--have all \nsent letters supporting this legislation that we have introduced.\n  We now produce 1.8 billion gallons of pure ethanol. This provision \nwill add 3.2 billion new gallons. So by 2012, we will be producing 5 \nbillion gallons of ethanol.\n  I think with this provision, the ethanol industry will continue to \ngrow. That translates to a new market, for example, for corn as the \nfeedstock for an ethanol plant--1.2 billion bushels. That is new \nopportunities to farmers to invest in value-added agriculture, new \nopportunities to extend America's energy supply, new opportunities to \nmake our country less dependent on Saudi Arabian oil, on oil from Iraq. \nAll of that makes good sense. There are substantial economic benefits \navailable with respect to this, and substantial security benefits for \nour country that will accrue from our passing this legislation.\n  So I rise today to say the introduction yesterday by myself, by \nSenator Daschle, and many others with respect to this major piece of \nlegislation dealing with ethanol is a significant step forward. My hope \nis, on a bipartisan basis, we will be able to move this legislation in \nthis Congress, recognizing that having less dependence on oil from the \nmost troubled region in the world is advisable for this country.\n  How do you do that? By extending America's energy supply through the \nproduction of ethanol, the production of something that is renewable, \nyear after year after year. It is not something that is depleting, it \nis renewable. That is why this legislation makes such good sense.\n  There is something else we can and should do. I am going to introduce \nlegislation the day we get back from next week's break. I intended to \nintroduce it yesterday, but for a couple of reasons I have held it, and \nwill continue to refine it just a bit.\n\n  I will propose a project that deals with the hydrogen economy and \nfuel cells. The President mentioned this in his State of the Union \nAddress to the Congress. I commend the President for it. It is exactly \nthe right idea. I have been working on this for some long while.\n  In fact, the bill that passed the Senate last year, the energy bill, \ncontained a provision I added that said by the year 2020 America should \naspire to have 2.5 million fuel cell cars that are using hydrogen--2.5 \nmillion fuel cell cars on the road.\n  Give or take, there are 700 million vehicles in the world. Give or \ntake, there are about 70 million vehicles produced each and every year. \nAlmost all of them are vehicles with carburetors through which you put \ngasoline and you create power for the engine and you drive off in the \nautomobile. Nothing has changed in a century--nothing at all.\n  My first car was an antique 1924 Model T Ford. I restored it, then \nsold it. I put gasoline in that little old antique Model T Ford the \nsame way you put gasoline in a 2003 Ford: You pull up to a pump, put \nthe hose in the tank, and start pumping gas. Nothing has changed in 100 \nyears--nothing.\n  The question is, Are we going to pole-vault over all these \ndiscussions and move to a new day and a new technology? Sure, we are \ngoing to discuss ANWR and CAFE standards and all the other issues that \ndominated debate last year. But if that is all we discuss, then every \n25 years we will come back and discuss the same thing, and our policies \nwill be known as ``yesterday forever.''\n  Why don't we begin discussing new technology and a new day, a new \ntype of energy for this country's future, a hydrogen future with fuel \ncells for vehicles?\n  I mentioned our energy security is threatened. We import 55 percent \nof the oil. That is going to go to 68 percent by 2025. Most of our cars \nand trucks run on gasoline. That is why we import so much oil. Two-\nthirds of the 20 million barrels of oil we use each day is used for \ntransportation.\n  Now let me describe a car that uses fuel cells. This chart shows a \nvehicle, a Ford Focus. It is a fuel cell vehicle, production-ready \nprototype, unveiled in autumn 2002. I drove one a couple days ago, \ndrove one last summer. In fact, we have had fuel cell vehicles that \ndrove all the way from Los Angeles to New York.\n  This is a picture of a hydrogen fueling station at Powertech Labs. \nFueling infrastructure is critically important to make hydrogen fuel \ncars a reality.\n  Hydrogen cars do not have to be compact. This is a picture of a fuel \ncell vehicle, a Nissan Xterra, fueled by compressed hydrogen, tested on \npublic roads in California in the year 2001.\n  Finally, a picture of a more futuristic looking vehicle, the General \nMotors Hy-Wire Fuel Cell Concept Car, unveiled in August of 2002.\n  Let me describe what Europe is doing in fuel cells. The European \nCommission has invested significantly in fuel cell cars, and industry \nis commending them for it. Herbert Kohler, director of Environmental \nAffairs at DaimlerChrysler, said political support was vital for the \ncar industry to move to fuel cells. They can do a lot for themselves, \nbut at a certain point they need fuel, and that means involving others.\n  It means the development of a supply of hydrogen, which is \nubiquitous, by the way. Through electrolysis, you can separate the \nhydrogen and oxygen in water, develop the hydrogen supply, and put \nwater vapor out the tailpipe of the car. You have the tailpipe of a \nvehicle that emits water vapor. What a great thing for the environment!\n  The European Commission, the executive body of the Europe Union, has \nearmarked more than 2.1 billion Euros, $2 billion, for research over 5 \nyears. A central focus will be hydrogen fuel cells.\n  Let me tell you what Japan is doing. Japanese carmakers are flooring \nit on fuel cells. Tokyo's fuel cell initiative has all the hallmarks of \na far-sighted strategy, Business Week says, and calls to mind Tokyo's \nblossoming success in hybrids. Americans are snapping up these fuel-\nefficient, environmentally friendly cars, and fuel cells could turn out \nto be a bigger, more important chapter in exactly the same book.\n  I don't think we ought to stand around here and continue to debate\n\n[[Page S2516]]\n\nsmall issues so that every 25 years we can have a repeat of the same \ndebate. I think we ought to debate big issues. I think we ought to have \na world view change here, with respect to how we want to power our \nvehicle fleet. I think we want to convert to hydrogen fuel.\n  That ought not scare those who produce oil, natural gas, and use \ncoal. In fact, those same companies are some of the companies in the \nlead, in the forefront of moving to a hydrogen economy.\n  You can produce hydrogen from fossil fuels. We are always going to \nneed and use fossil fuels. But wouldn't it be great to power our \nvehicle fleet with hydrogen and fuel cells so that we don't need Middle \nEast oil?\n  Wouldn't that be a wonderful future for this country and at the same \ntime improve our environment, because we are going to use hydrogen and \nfuel cells and put only water vapor out of the back of the car through \nthe tailpipe?\n  That is exactly what we ought to do. How you do you get that done? I \nhave met with representatives of the hydrogen and fuel cell industries. \nThey are anxious. They are engaged in substantial research. But the \nfact is they cannot do this alone.\n  The conversion of the vehicle fleet in our country to the big idea of \nthe hydrogen economy and fuel cells will not and cannot happen without \nthe support of the Government. I propose an Apollo-like program. When I \nsay Apollo program, I am talking about the program by which John F. \nKennedy said, ``We are going to go to the Moon by the end of the \ndecade.'' I think our country should decide to move to the hydrogen \neconomy and fuel cell vehicles with a big idea and in a big way to help \nmake it happen as public policy. The Europeans and the Japanese are \nmoving in that direction, and we should, too.\n  As I indicated, last year I put a piece in the energy bill that says \nwe aspire to have a goal of 2.5 million vehicles on the road in 2020 in \nthis country using fuel cells.\n  Now, the President proposed a $1.2 billion hydrogen fuel cell \nprogram. Only half of that is new money. That is not a big idea. It is \nthe right idea. But it is not big and bold.\n  I propose a $6.5 billion 10-year program that is really going to move \nthis country to say we want to enact change. We want to move to a \nhydrogen economy and develop fuel cell vehicles to help create the \ninfrastructure for the production of hydrogen and the storage and \ntransportation of hydrogen. We want to provide incentives for people to \nbuy the fuel cell vehicle.\n  This will be one of the best things this country has done. It will be \none of the big ideas of the century. That is why I think it is so \nimportant.\n  We talk about this with the backdrop of a troubled world--substantial \nproblems in the Middle East, Central and Southern Asia, terrorism, \nNorth Korea, and Iraq. When you think of the difficulties that exist \nand the small thread our economy hangs on, making sure that tonight, \ntomorrow, the next day, and every day of the week and every month we \nget enough oil into this country from places like Iraq, like Venezuela, \nlike Saudi Arabia, and Algeria in order to power our vehicle fleet, \nthen we ought to understand this economy is held hostage by forces we \ndon't control.\n  It is dangerous for this economy to be dependent on things we cannot \nand will not be able to control in the long term. But we can--as we \nhave in many other areas--create incentives and new technology and new \nopportunities to solve old problems.\n  That is exactly what I propose with this initiative. I intend to \nintroduce this the day we get back. I expect and hope it will be \nbipartisan. I have been talking to some Democrats and some Republicans.\n  The President has said this is a good idea. Good for him. I commend \nhim for it. I think he proposed a step in the right direction. And, \nfrankly, having the Bush administration be supportive of this kind of \ntechnology change is excellent. It is good for this country. But the \nAdministration's approach is more timid and less bold than it should \nbe.\n  I am going to propose an Apollo-type program that says let us really \nmove and get this accomplished. I hope to have substantial bipartisan \nsupport as we begin to write an energy bill this year in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/14/senate-section/article/S2516-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, in a few minutes I will be closing the \nSenate for our recess break, but I wanted to take this opportunity to \nspeak a few moments on an issue that is on my mind and on the mind of \nmy wife and family, and it is on the minds of most every American today \nin what I would consider very trying times, from an intellectual \nstandpoint, from an emotional standpoint, a spiritual standpoint. And \nindeed, this week has been a very trying week for the Nation.\n  There is much alarm about the increased threat of terrorism. We know \nwe are at a time that is closely approaching the possible use of force \nto ensure that Saddam Hussein is disarmed of weapons of mass \ndestruction, such as chemical agents and biological agents; and we all \nfeel the stress all across America--not just in this body in \nWashington, DC, and in New York, where the stress level is high because \nof the symbolic value of being a potential site for attack. We are \nconcerned for families, we are concerned for friends, we are concerned \nfor neighbors all over America, and we are concerned for the service \nmen and women overseas.\n  As elected officials in this body, we have taken the opportunity over \nthe last 3 or 4 days, coinciding with the increased alert, to talk \nabout the nature of our duties and responsibilities both to our \nconstituents, as well as to our families as we serve in this body. We, \nin the Senate, have a great honor to serve in this beautiful Chamber, \nin this beautiful Capitol Building, and it is indeed the symbol of our \nNation's strength and our Nation's purpose. Throughout this week, while \nfully aware that our enemies, as I speak now and as so many have \ndebated so many issues over the course of the week, are plotting their \nevil designs. We know that. Yet we continue to carry out our duties as \nSenators and as citizens. It is truly remarkable.\n  I could not be prouder of the many fine women and men who make up \nthis institution. Yes, I have mentioned the Senators, but I also \ninclude the thousands of individuals who come to this building and \nsurrounding buildings on Capitol Hill to support the activities of what \ngoes on in this body and in this room as we debate and amend and pass \nlegislation. Through very difficult, long, and hard hours so many have \ndemonstrated to this fine city and to the Nation that life must go on \nin times of threat and increased alert.\n  Terrorists will have won when they can so intimidate us that we stop \nperforming our most basic duties and responsibilities. Clearly, they \nhave not, nor will they.\n  Last week Secretary Tom Ridge of the Department of Homeland Security \nannounced the President had determined that the Nation should be moved \nto that next higher level of alert, a heightened threat level. Attorney \nGeneral John Ashcroft explained this was done in response to recent \nreporting that indicates an increased likelihood that al-Qaida may \nattempt to attack Americans in the United States and/or abroad around \nthe end of the Haj, the Muslim religious period ending mid-February, \n2003.\n  What does this mean? It is confusing to the American people. It is \nconfusing based on what one reads and sees on\n\n[[Page S2517]]\n\ntelevision. People see the imagery. It looks like a thermometer going \nto that orange level, with that orange beginning to pulse. It is \nconfusing to people as to what it means: What does it mean to my spouse \nand to my children? What does it mean when I drive to work and drive \nhome? What does it mean to my constituents back in Tennessee or the \nPresiding Officer's constituents in Utah? What does it mean? What \nshould our response be?\n  As was explained to us, I think very well, from a Government \nstandpoint, an increased threat level captures a response where all \nFederal agencies focus and work together to reduce the vulnerabilities \nand increase security, and this, in itself, serves as a deterrent to \nthe terrorist whose goal is to personally terrorize and strike fear. \nThe terrorist wants to kill, but the terrorist really wants to strike \nfear, to paralyze, and to bring pain and paralysis to America. We see a \nreduction in vulnerabilities and increased security in this deterrence.\n  Also, as was explained well, this heightened alert--that is, Federal \nagencies working together, but at the same time literally tens of \nthousands of intelligence agencies, public health agencies, hospitals, \nlaw enforcement at the State level, at the county level, at the city \nlevel, at the community level and, indeed, at the neighborhood level \nare all activated and begin communicating and coordinating--acts as a \ndeterrent to that would-be terrorist who all of a sudden says: My \naction--whatever it is--has less chance of being successful.\n  I wish to also mention the responsibility we have as citizens. I just \nspoke about government. That is law enforcement and public health. But \nwe also, as individuals, have responsibilities. That is what I think \nhas become confusing to American parents and families. What do we do? \nHow do we respond? What should our efforts be?\n  Indeed, Secretary Ridge, at the same time we have this activation \nfrom above coming down, integrated I think very well today--and that is \nwhy I am comfortable with where we are today. We can always do better, \nwe can always be better prepared, but I am very comfortable with where \nwe are today.\n  Secretary Ridge asked that individual Americans remain alert. We use \nthe words ``remain vigilant.'' All of a sudden, instead of having \ngovernment working, we have 250 million people out there being the eyes \nand ears of law enforcement, and that is where the real power is in \nterms of stopping a potential act of terrorism.\n  The recommendations that have come out over the last week were picked \nup and put on television such that, at the end of the week, we were \njust saying: Duct tape on doors and plastic sheets. All of what I just \nsaid, in terms of this huge coordination and communication network of \ndeterrence above and the power of 250 million people being vigilant and \npicking up on anybody whose behavior might be a little bit different in \none's neighborhood, all of a sudden gets symbolized by a piece of duct \ntape. That is where it gets confusing and vague. The reason I have come \nto the floor is to try to put that in some perspective.\n  From the information standpoint, we in Congress are aware of that \nconfusion and that confusing message. People want to go out and say the \nmessenger is not doing a good job. We are all in this together. It is \nimportant for us in Congress to make sure we have the very best \nintelligence coming in to make sure when we go to a threat level, it is \nmade on the best information, and that is the precision of information. \nBut we also have an obligation to help not just to educate but to share \nthe information we have with what individuals can do and families can \ndo, make it understandable and not as confusing or vague as it was \nafter anthrax hit, as it was after September 11, and even over the \ncourse of this week: What do we do as individuals?\n\n  It is important at this time of heightened awareness and vigilance \nthat we also maintain the right perspective. As I have talked to people \nthroughout Tennessee and family members who are not here in Washington, \nthey have watched on television gas masks being put on, duct tape being \nput up; they see artillery with the Capitol in the background. I am \nspeaking mainly to families at this standpoint. We have to be very \ncareful because with 24-hour news cycles 7 days a week, every 30 \nminutes the news cycle being repeated, with the potential use of germs, \nmicrobes, bacteria, chemical agents, all of which are new in this \narsenal of terrorism--new in terms of the weapons of mass destruction \nwe traditionally think about being nuclear 50, 40 years ago, now we are \nthinking about little viruses and bacteria--it is easy to overstate, \nand all of a sudden the pain and paralysis you begin to feel inside, if \nyou are mesmerized by that television set, seeing these images come \nagain and again, we have to be careful. We all know these visual images \nare put on television to capture your attention. We know this captures \nour emotion and attention because we have that inner fear that we do \nnot want that little virus to hit us.\n  Again, we have to be careful as we look at television, as we look at \nmedia today, not to let it feed our paralysis and fear. I am a parent. \nI have two high school boys; they are still children. I do not want \nthem sitting there every day watching what is, yes, real, but in terms \nof perception, if you just watch television, you say: This risk is \nhuge; that virus or bacteria is going to hit tomorrow; and there is \nnothing I can do about it. I am helpless, and things are out of \ncontrol, and I don't know what is going to happen to my parents or \nkids.\n  I do think the vigilance is important as we go forth because, as I \nsaid just a few minutes ago, there are no better eyes than those of 250 \nmillion people who, in driving to work every day, notice something just \nnot quite right, or in your everyday surroundings, there might be \nsomebody just hanging around for the last 3 or 4 days who did not used \nto be hanging around. That is the sort of vigilance and alertness that \nbecomes a deterrent and also, of course, important information if there \nis potential terrorist activity.\n  My perspective for a lot of this has been as a surgeon and a doctor--\nI have been very involved in viruses, chemical agents, and microbes--\nand as a Senator because of my participation in a lot of hearings on \nbioterrorism, the risk of bioterrorism, but also my experience as a \nhusband and a parent who sees the impact this can, indeed, have on \nfamilies in a very direct way.\n  Past generations have been affected in many ways, as well, by the \nthreat of nuclear war. When I was very young and the generation before \nme lived with this accommodation of the image of a nuclear explosion \nand immediately in schools having exercises of hiding under a desk or \nseeking cover under a desk, of bomb shelters being built in \ncommunities, the same discussion going on in terms of having a supply \nof water and food for 3 days or 5 days, people converting their \nbasements to bomb shelters--in the same way that situation took a lot \nof accommodation, learning, and new ways of thinking, indeed, we are \nhaving to do that today, 40 years later. We are doing it with the \nviruses and bacteria and chemical agents. The same way we got through \nwithout a major catastrophe in the last 50 years, we need to get \nthrough this with an understanding and an increased knowledge that we \nneed to share about chemical agents and microbes. It is a new \nvocabulary. There is a lot to learn, and that can be overwhelming.\n\n  If one is watching this on TV, they know there is a real risk--a tiny \nrisk but a risk--that there is a body of information that we need to \nget accustomed to understanding, just as we did with nuclear weapons 40 \nand 50 years ago. The reason I encourage people, no matter who they \nare, to learn a little bit about the microbes and chemical agents and \nwhat one would do if something happened in their neighborhood, is \nbecause it is real. The terrorist activity we are talking about is \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  We know people such as Saddam Hussein have those weapons of mass \ndestruction, these viruses and bacteria. When we see these linkages to \nal-Qaida and to terrorist activity, it is incumbent upon us, as \nAmericans, to learn more about these biological agents.\n  The good news is the Government has responded aggressively in a lot \nof ways in terms of funding, in terms of organization, in terms of \ncoordination. My message is that families need to respond, too, not \nwith pain and paralysis and increased stress but by taking the\n\n[[Page S2518]]\n\nopportunity to learn, to share information, to talk about it over the \ndinner table and to ask questions.\n  If someone asks a question of somebody and they do not know, ask it \nof somebody else. That sharing of information brings down the stress, \nbrings down the potential for pain and paralysis. With that, we will \nget through this. We will get through it in a comfortable way and \neverything will be OK.\n  Our officials at all levels of Government are taking the appropriate \nsteps. I say that as a Government official. I think it is important for \nAmericans to recognize that this body, the House, and the President of \nthe United States has responded to make sure in terms of prevention, in \nterms of protection, and in terms of response that we have acted and \nwill continue to act.\n  I will run through several questions that I get all the time. How big \nis the risk? The risk of biological weapons or chemical weapons, \nalthough I think it is higher than nuclear weapons being used in our \nhomeland, is still small. It is tiny. It is real. It is bigger than it \nwas 2 years ago. It is bigger than it was 5 years ago. It is bigger \nthan 10 years ago, but the overall risk of biological and chemical \nagents being used successfully as agents of mass destruction in this \ncountry is small. The threat is real and our response needs to be \nproportionate to that overall small risk.\n  There are things that families need to know and be prepared to do. A \ncouple of questions that I get are: What does high alert mean? The \nalerts, as I said, are the way that the Federal Government responds to \nincreased threats. Typically, these threats are nonspecific. They do \nnot say an attack is going to happen in this city or in this location \nat a certain time. The intelligence is gathered through a myriad of \nsources from all over the world, and when they reach a certain \nthreshold where it is clear there is something potentially going on the \nthreat level is raised. Government responds and we, as individuals, \nneed to respond.\n  I do not think everybody needs a disaster supply kit. It may be that \nif one lives near a highly visible potential target that they would be \nmore likely to develop that disaster supply kit, and I leave that to \nindividuals to discuss with their family.\n\n  What should our response be? Communities need to respond by \nincreasing their vigilance because that increase in vigilance does \nempower us as part of this war that I would say is an extension of what \nmay well go on in Iraq--it is part of our patriotic responsibilities of \nbeing a citizen in America to discuss and learn something about what \nthe biological agents might be, and to remain vigilant.\n  People ask me all the time while I am in the public, what should I \nlook for? We do not know where terrorists are.\n  Terrorists are everywhere. The anthrax letters a year ago were first \nin Florida, not in Washington, DC. It was in New Jersey and, yes, New \nYork and Washington, DC. True, terrorism can be anywhere, although \nterrorist activity traditionally goes to highly symbolic areas and \nsites.\n  It was 10 years ago, by the way, that we had the first big terrorist \nactivity in the United States. We know what happened during that second \nattack on the World Trade Center. We have seen biological weapons used \nfor the first time in Washington, DC, and in Florida in October, just a \nmonth after September 11.\n  The question of what do I do if I find myself in the middle of an \nattack, it depends on whether one is inside or outside, and that is the \nsort of information that can be exchanged with local law enforcement, \nand public health and emergency responders. If people will go to the \nWeb sites of the Department of Homeland Security, they can see what \nthose responses would be.\n  I think it is important, as a family, that people talk about \ncommunication, what happens if something occurs right now, what \ntelephone number do the children have. I would say to have a number \nboth in State, in the neighborhood, an extra number to call inside, but \nalso out of State. A decision needs to be made where to go. I encourage \npeople, if there were a biological attack or some sort of chemical \nattack, to have everybody in their family know where would you go.\n  Let me comment on one last thing and then I will close. This is a \ntime of stress. In talking to my colleagues and their families, I sense \nthat when we go to this high alert--and as a physician I know this--\nthere is a sense of stress that may or may not be talked about or \nnoticed. I have to put my physician hat on for one second, because it \ncan be reflected both physically and emotionally. I think it is \nimportant at least to be aware of it.\n  People do not sleep as well. Some people eat more; some people eat \nless. Some people develop tummy aches or belly aches. Some people \ndevelop back pain. That is sort of the physical and emotional \nmanifestations: irritability, detachment, periods of depression, \nfeeling blue, being on edge, waking up in the middle of the night.\n  That is normal. The body is remarkable. We are truly remarkable. The \nfact that we have this response, it is physiologic but it has an \nemotional component; it has a mental component and a physical \ncomponent. The important issue is how one deals with it. When we go to \nthese elevated stress levels or heightened threat levels, which \ncorrelate with stress levels, it is important to realize that everybody \nfeels it to a certain extent. It is not just you. You are not alone.\n\n  There are a lot of things you can do. First and foremost, \ncommunicate. Talk to other people. Talk about it over the dinner table. \nShare. You have to be careful a little bit because if you are anxious \nand you feel the stress and you want to talk to your children, you \nmight wait and talk an hour later when you have settled down a little \nbit. The big thing is to talk. Listen, talk, share your concerns.\n  Two, keep the faith. Some people rely more on drawing strength from \ntraditions, from their synagogue, or their mosque, or their church.\n  Third, embrace daily routines. Do not stop doing the things that you \ndo every day. Go ahead and continue to do them. In fact, focus on doing \nthem better than you did in the past because you want to feel as if you \nhave more control over your life. If you work hard to do something \nwell, like bake a cake, make sure it is a good cake. Take pride in that \ncake because it gives you sense of control.\n  As I mentioned earlier, take a news break. Do not get mesmerized by \nthe television or the newspapers or as you are flipping through the \nnewspaper do not stop on that one article that will scare you to death \nin terms of what a smallpox virus will do to you. It is real, so you \nhave to be careful, but once you know it you do not need to read it \nevery day as you go through the paper. You do not need to watch the 24-\nhour news channels where you see those same images of gas masks and \nwhat the agents can do to people.\n  The fifth is, join a group. Participate with others. Do not lock \nyourself down and worry about this. Some people play cards or play \nbridge. Take part in something that is larger than yourself. With most \npeople it probably begins with family, doing family activities.\n  Again, as a doctor--and then I will take my doctor hat off--exercise \nregularly, eat well, and get a good night's rest. That is enough of the \nphysician end of things. It is a time of heightened anxiety, increased \nstress and if we do not address each of these head on it does result in \npain and paralysis.\n  We are about to begin a recess that will take us to our home and to \nour families. I encourage all of our colleagues to engage in a quiet \nresolve that they have shown on the floor of the Senate in completing \nthe Nation's business.\n  It has been a hugely successful first 45 days as we look at what has \nbeen accomplished in terms of nominations, unemployment insurance, \naddressing the 11 appropriations left over from the last Congress. It \nis pivotal. Now we can move on to the agenda which is very exciting for \nme as we look at jobs, and we look at the economy, and we look at \ngrowth and the feeling, the security in our everyday lives, and the \nhealth care issues, and the education issues as we go forward.\n  When we go back home to our constituents, we will be held to a high \nstandard. They want to make absolutely sure and we need to make it very \nclear to them that we are totally committed to defending them \ninternationally, globally, and here in our homeland. Really, in each of \nthose categories, defending them in this war\n\n[[Page S2519]]\n\nagainst terrorism. We have done it today. We have huge challenges over \nthe coming weeks to continue to do so.\n  Under President Bush's leadership, we have done a tremendous amount \nin making America safer from our enemies. We have reorganized \nGovernment and created a new Cabinet-level agency that consolidates, \ncoordinates, and maximizes communication in our antiterror efforts. We \npassed the landmark bipartisan legislation in June 2002 to provide \nadditional funding for our local law enforcement authorities to protect \nthe Nation from public health threats, such as bioterrorism. We \nincluded $3.5 billion in the bill we passed--18 hours ago--that will go \ndirectly to the first responders. In the event something were to \nhappen, those first responders become the most important people. That \nis who you will call. They are the people who provide treatment.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services 2 years ago did not have \nsmallpox vaccine. Right now, because of the hard work and the \ndedication and leadership of President Bush, we know the Department of \nHealth and Human Services has obtained and procured enough smallpox \nvaccine for every man, every woman, and every child in the United \nStates.\n  That is but a part of what Government has done, and will continue to \ndo, as we go forward. But we must also commit to defending ourselves \nfrom the terrorists' most dangerous weapon of all, the guts of what my \nremarks have been, and that is fear. It was one of our greatest \nPresidents ever, President Franklin Roosevelt, who in an earlier and \ndarker moment in our history, calmed the Nation with the gentle \nremainder that we have nothing to fear but fear itself. In these days \nof stress and distress we must never forget the great words of those \nwho have preceded us, and the test that they, over many generations, \nendured.\n  At such a moment, I often turn to a favorite piece of Scripture or a \npassage from an inspirational work.

Mr. President, on February 14, 1903, President Theodore \nRoosevelt signed the bill that established the Department of Commerce. \nIn doing so he authorized the creation of what had been, to date, one \nof the largest and most complicated departments in the Federal \nGovernment. The original Department of Commerce was responsible for an \noverwhelming set of tasks, including the administration of the census, \nand the development of foreign and domestic commerce.\n  Over the past decade the Commerce Department's role has evolved, but \nit has always kept the vitality of American industry as its core value. \nMy State has a lot at stake in the daily operations of this department; \namong its original duties was the supervision of the Alaskan fur-seal \nharvest and our State's salmon fisheries.\n  When the House debated the Commerce Department's founding in 1903, \nCongressman Robert Mann of Indiana noted that the Department was \npossibly the best hope we had of saving the Alaska salmon fisheries \nfrom extinction. Alaska assumed control of its salmon fisheries after \nStatehood, but the Commerce Department is still involved with our \nfisheries. One hundred years later the people of Alaska work closely \nwith the North Pacific Fishery Management Council and the National \nMarine Fisheries Service to manage the most productive groundfish \nfisheries in the world in the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska.\n  The past century has confirmed what the groups and individuals who \noriginally lobbied for the Department of Commerce knew 100 years ago; \nours is a distinctly commercial and industrial nation. The ingenuity of \nour workers, the dedication of our citizens and the perseverance \ndemonstrated by our entrepreneurs are what make our Nation's economy \nunique and enduring. However, ingenuity, dedication and perseverance \nremain untapped resources without leadership and guidance to help them \nfulfill their potential. For 100 years the Department of Commerce has \nprovided that leadership.\n  In 1981, Secretary of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige wrote that the \nCommerce Department's mission was to ``serve the nation, its business \ncommunity, and its individual citizens.'' That mission lives today in \nthe daily work of the Department and in the leadership of Secretary Don \nEvans. I have served with seventeen Secretaries of Commerce since I \nfirst came to the Senate, and consider many from both parties, \nincluding Malcolm Baldrige, Bill Daley, Norm Mineta, and of course Don \nEvans, to be my good friends.\n  Today, on behalf of all Alaskans, I congratulate the Department on a \ncentury of great achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/14/senate-section/article/S2519-2", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                FISCAL YEAR 2003 OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, my decision to vote for the omnibus \nspending bill late last night was a difficult one. It is the largest \nsingle spending bill ever passed by Congress. It represents work that \nshould have been completed last fall, and crams into one bill what \nshould have been 11 separate bills, each with its own separate debate \nand deliberation. This is no way to legislate, and the final product \nreflects that unfortunate process.\n  I was gratified that many important obligations received funding, but \nunfortunately many others did not. At the same time, this massive \ndocument contains far too many provisions that were never exposed to \nthe daylight of publicity and debate. My vote in favor of this bill was \na very close call.\n  First, the good news. Unlike an earlier version that I could not \nsupport, this bill restored funds for Byrne grants that local law \nenforcement agencies need in these dangerous times. In addition, I was \nable to add language that permits local police to use COPS money for \nthe many hours of overtime involved as they meet the demands of \nhomeland defense. Law enforcement projects in my State of Delaware, \nfrom State to county to local agencies, will receive $3.5 million in \nfunds from that COPS program.\n  But the bad news is that $3 billion for first responders was cut out \nof this legislation. Those are funds to support firefighters and police \nand local emergency response centers. Another $170 million was cut from \nthe Transportation Security Administration, despite the obvious need \nfor additional protection for our Nation's air, highway, and rail \nsystems. Funds for port security and border security were also cut. The \ndebate over these programs will continue soon, as we begin budget \ndebates for the coming year and a security supplemental spending bill, \nand I will continue the fight to provide the citizens of this country \nall of the protection they need.\n  And we must expose those last-minute, back-room deals that litter the \nthousands of pages of this legislation. Some are clear wastes of \ntaxpayer money in these critical times. Others weaken important \nenvironmental protections, and have no place in these spending bills.\n  On balance, I concluded that this legislation which allows the \nFederal Government to continue its important functions narrowly \ndeserves my support. But there is much here that needs to be fixed, so \nthe debate that should have occurred on this huge, complicated bill \nwill continue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/14/senate-section/article/S2519-3", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2519-S2520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nsignificance of Black History Month. This week, I would like to discuss \nbriefly an issue of great importance in African American history, and \none that remains of vital importance still today--the problem of hate \nin our society and hate crimes.\n  As most of my colleagues know, Senator Kennedy and I have introduced \nhate crimes legislation during the past two Congresses. I think it is \nimportant for my colleagues to know just some of the background behind \nhate crimes\n\n[[Page S2520]]\n\nlaw, and have a full understanding of why expanding current hate crimes \nlaw is important today.\n  We can find instances of hate crime throughout our Nation's history, \nbut they drew increased national attention during the last century. \nWidespread lynchings in the South, the murders of Emmet Till in 1955, \nMedgar Evers in 1963, church bombings, and attacks on black protesters \nall contributed to fear in black communities around the country, and \nhorror among Americans who understood those crimes to be nothing short \nof domestic acts of terrorism.\n  Early hate crimes laws stem from such events--laws developed from \nefforts to prevent Ku Klux Klan violence against Black Americans during \nthe Reconstruction era and then, at the Federal level, in the 60s, \nduring the Civil Rights era. What we have today is a patchwork of state \nand local laws that have arisen over the years in response to bias \ncrimes, and federal hate crimes law has not kept pace. Because federal \nlaw was initially designed to protect only certain special activities, \nwe now have a situation in which the Federal Government's involvement \nis virtually limited to hate crimes committed in voting booths and \nnational parks. The law is inadequate, and many Americans understand \nthat.\n  Just a few days ago, I made a statement on the floor of the Senate \nregarding a hate crime committed against Chad Debnam and others in \nNortheast Portland, in my home State of Oregon. On January 19, 2003, \nfour young men went on a shooting spree through Northeast Portland \nbecause, according to police, they thought the neighborhood was \npredominantly African American. Shots were fired into cars and homes in \nthat neighborhood, not 50 years ago, but just last month. But, \nunfortunately, just like 50 years ago, the Federal Government could not \nhelp investigate that crime, even if local law enforcement officials \nasked for it. We saw a similar problem when James Byrd was dragged \nbehind a pick-up truck in Texas just a few years ago.\n  Each day we are in session I come to the Senate floor to detail a \nhate crime that occurred somewhere in the country within the past few \nyears. Local law enforcement officers would not have been able to seek \nFederal help in nearly all of those cases. Crimes against African \nAmericans, Hispanic Americans, Muslim Americans, gay Americans, and \nothers still occur with disturbing frequency today, but our Federal \nhate crimes law is stuck in the last century. The hate crimes \nlegislation proposed by Senator Kennedy and myself would finally make \nit much easier for the Federal Government to respond to hate crimes.\n  During Black History Month, I think it is important for us to \nremember that while we have made tremendous progress in many areas of \ncivil rights law, we have a great deal more work to do. There is no \nmore important civil right than the right to be free from violence, and \nwe should remember the importance of expanded hate crimes law as we \ncontinue to celebrate Black History Month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/14/senate-section/article/S2520-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECENT RULING OF THE BELGIAN SUPREME COURT\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I was extremely disappointed to learn of \nyesterday's ruling by the Supreme Court of Belgium that Prime Minister \nSharon of Israel could be tried in the Belgian courts for alleged war \ncrimes once he leaves government service. The ruling also immediately \nmakes retired IDF General Yaron and other eligible to be brought to \ntrial at the convenience of the Belgian lower court.\n  This action appears to supercede the authority of other national \ncourt systems, the International Court of Justice in The Hague, as well \nas the International Criminal Court which, for better or worse, was \nestablished last year with authority to try war crimes. The ruling sets \nan unwelcome precedent: empowering non-Belgian nationals to bring \nclaims against other non-Belgian nationals in a Belgian court for \nalleged crimes having no connection to Belgium. The Belgian Supreme \nCourt has now ruled that its lower courts have the right to sit in \njudgment of people who come from another nation and have allegedly \ncommitted a crime in a foreign land against another set of people from \nyet another foreign land. This is bad law and bad policy.\n  With this ruling, Belgium has set itself and its legal system above \nall other nations. Belgium's status should be no different from that of \nany other sovereign state, entitling it to enact laws and judge its own \ncitizens or anyone who commits crimes against them. But the Belgian \nlegislature and its court has raised its country's justice system above \nthose of every other nation, and is trying to impose its rule on the \ncitizens of countries with no connection to Belgium. Even the Belgian \nprosecution noted its opposition to pursuing the complainants' \npetition.\n  I hope that the Secretaries of State and Defense take note of this \naction by one of our NATO allies, especially as we prepare to \npotentially send our young men and women into battle in a land far \naway. There is no reason why they too, and their commanders, could not \nbe similarly charged and prosecuted. What the Belgian court did was \nwrong. Our government should call upon them to consult with our \nAmbassadors to Belgium and NATO and express to the Belgian government \nan appropriate level of concern.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/14/senate-section/article/S2520-2", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2520-S2521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE CORPORATE PATRIOT ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have joined with Senators Reid, Durbin, \nand Kennedy in introducing the Corporate Patriot Enforcement Act of \n2003.\n  Over the past several years we have been hearing more and more about \nU.S. corporations using offshore tax havens to avoid paying their fair \nshare of U.S. taxes. One of the most egregious abuses is when a U.S. \ncorporation reincorporates on paper in a tax haven and establishes a \nheadquarters there when, in reality, its primary offices and production \nor service facilities remain right here in the United States. By \nopening shell headquarters in a tax haven like Bermuda, companies that \ngot their start in this country, do most of their work here, and \nbenefit from U.S. roads, banks, patents, computers, law enforcement, \nfair trade laws, its educated workforce, and much more, avoid \ncontributing their fair share to pay for those benefits. Instead, these \ncompanies force the rest of America's taxpayers to shoulder the tax \nburden they have shed.\n  This corporate conduct mistreats the average American. It undercuts \nthe U.S. corporations that do pay their taxes. It is unfair, it is \nfounded on a deception, and it is time for Congress to put an end to \nit. It is time for Congress to say to these companies, if you want \nbenefits, you need to stop avoiding your fiscal responsibility with the \nsham of appearing to move.\n  The list of companies that have undertaken the tax haven headquarters \npretense now called ``corporate inversions'' is growing. The list \ncurrently includes such U.S. born companies as Fruit of the Loom, \nIngersoll-Rand, and Tyco, although Tyco shareholders are trying to \nshame that company's management into giving up its Bermuda shenanigans.\n  It is likely that this list of corporate inversions will continue to \ngrow unless Congress acts to close the tax loopholes that currently \npermit U.S. companies to benefit from their gamesmanship and avoid \nfederal taxes at the expense of average taxpayers and good corporate \ncitizens. That is why we are introducing the Corporate Patriot \nEnforcement Act of 2003, the same bill Representative Neal introduced \nin the House last Congress which garnered over 150 co-sponsors.\n  This bill would deny tax benefits to U.S. companies that invert by \ncontinuing to treat them as U.S. companies for tax purposes. This bill \nwould not only level the playing field between these companies and \ntheir U.S. competitors, it would also save other U.S. taxpayers from \nhaving to pick up an estimated $4 billion in tax revenues over the next \n10 years.\n  U.S. corporations that reincorporate in tax havens typically reduce \ntheir U.S. tax liability in at least two ways. First, by setting up \nheadquarters in a tax haven, the company can eliminate its liability \nfor U.S. taxes on passive and other forms of income earned in foreign \njurisdictions. For instance, the company no longer would have to pay \nU.S. tax on the interest, dividends and royalty payments received by \nits foreign affiliates which would otherwise have been taxed under \nSubpart F of the U.S. tax code. By creating a new, so-\n\n[[Page S2521]]\n\ncalled ``parent'' company in a tax haven jurisdiction, the company's \nobligations under Subpart F disappear, and the passive and other forms \nof income that would otherwise be treated as Subpart F income subject \nto U.S. taxation is no longer taxed by the United States. Second, \ncompanies that pretend to move their headquarters to a tax haven \ntypically also use tax strategies to shelter income actually earned in \nthe United States. By deflecting this income to the shell parent \nlocated in a low or no tax jurisdiction, these companies avoid paying \nU.S. taxes on income earned right here in the U.S.\n  Unlike other corporate inversion proposals under consideration, our \nbill would deny all corporate inverters both of these sought-after U.S. \ntax benefits in their entirety. Corporate inverters would be treated as \nU.S. companies for U.S. tax purposes, thereby denying them all of the \ntax benefits sought by their inversion transactions. This approach \nhopefully will put an end to companies pretending to move to Bermuda or \nany other tax haven in order to duck corporate taxes at the expense of \nhonest taxpayers left holding the bag.\n  Under this bill, a company would be deemed to be inverted, and \ntherefore be treated as a U.S. company, if: 80 percent of the \nshareholders in the previous U.S. company are shareholders of the new \ncompany; and the new company acquires substantially all of the property \nof the old company; or between 50 and 80 percent of the shareholders in \nthe previous U.S. company are shareholders of the new company; the new \ncompany acquires substantially all of the property of the old company; \nthe new company conducts no substantial business activity in the new \njurisdiction; and the stock is principally traded in the U.S. These \nrules would apply to inversions that occurred after September 11, 2001.\n  Rather than let companies that inverted previously enjoy future tax \nbenefits they do not deserve, the amendment would give companies that \ninverted prior to September 11, 2001 an opportunity to incorporate back \nin the United States. If a company failed to do so, the U.S. would \nbegin treating it as an inverted company beginning in 2004 and deny it \nthe future tax breaks sought from its inversion.\n  We should not let companies off the hook that try to avoid paying \nU.S. taxes by setting up a computer in a tax haven jurisdiction. Now is \nthe time to close this corporate expatriation loophole. I hope my \ncolleagues will join with us in enacting this legislation into law this \nyear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/14/senate-section/article/S2521-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             CONGRATULATIONS TO THE UNIVERSITY OF PORTLAND\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a special \ngroup of young women, their coaches, and their fans, who show us the \nvalue of persistence, determination, and personal sacrifice. In \nDecember, the University of Portland women's soccer team gave the \nPilots their first ever NCAA championship by beating the defending \nnational champions, Santa Clara University, in double overtime. At 20-\n4-1, the Pilots were the lowest seed in the Women's College Cup \nchampionship series, and their win makes them the lowest seeded team \never to win the national championship.\n  It has been a long and bittersweet road to victory for the team and \nthe University. The Pilots made it to the semi-finals six times in the \nlast 8 years, coming close to a championship in 1995 only to lose in \nthe finals to Notre Dame in triple overtime. Although never winning a \ncollegiate championship, a number of University of Portland players \nwent on to represent the United States in Olympic Competition, \nincluding Tiffeny Milbrett and Shannon MacMillan, who played on the \nU.S. Olympic gold medal-winning team.\n  The Pilots' superior accomplishment this year marks the culmination \nof years of hard work put forth by the women who came before them, and \nthe young women from this year's national champion Pilots, who are the \ncream of the crop of American youth, will serve as role models for the \nwomen who will follow them. It takes more than athletic prowess to \nsucceed at this level. Winning a national championship takes \nintelligence, teamwork, dedication, and the willingness to rise above \nadversity and try just a little harder. The Pilots are an inspiration \nto us all, and they show today's youth how hard work and determination \ncan lead to great successes.\n  Clive Charles, the Pilots' head coach since 1989, also personifies \nthe finest qualities demonstrated by his team, and it is for good \nreason that his team dedicated their championship to him. Coach Charles \nhas battled prostate cancer for 2 years, and although his cancer is \ntreatable, it is not curable. He continued weekly chemotherapy \ntreatments throughout the season, and, despite challenges, led his team \nto the pinnacle of their sport. His next goal along with the returning \nplayers is to bring home another cup next year.\n  NCAA Division 1 head coaches selected Coach Charles as National Coach \nof the Year, making him the first Western Collegiate Conference coach \nto earn that title. Sophomore striker Christine Sinclair was named \nNational Player of the Year, becoming the first sophomore ever to be \nrecognized with that honor. But it was all the players and their \ncoaches, working as a team, who brought this honor back to Portland.\n  I join the University of Portland and its alumni, the city of \nPortland, and state of Oregon in thanking these young women and their \ncoaches for giving us all something to cheer about. I am pleased that \nthey will be meeting with President Bush at the White House on February \n24, and I am very proud to be able to honor the University of Portland \nwomen's soccer team today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/14/senate-section/article/S2521-2", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING LINCOLN'S FIREFIGHTERS\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today at the White \nHouse six brave Nebraska firefighters will be honored by the Vice \nPresident of the United States for their stirring acts of bravery and \nheroism during a dangerous and daring rescue in Nebraska.\n  All Nebraskans are tremendously proud of these men. They showed \nuncommon bravery when they selflessly risked their lives in service of \nothers and today's honor is but a small payment toward all they have \ngiven for their communities.\n  The Vice President will present Deputy Chief Ron Kennett, Captain \nRick Klein, and Firefighters Bob Borer, Jeremy Hosek, Guy Jones, and \nMike Wright of the Lincoln Fire Department with Public Safety Officer \nMedal of Valor awards. The award recognizes the firefighters' role in \nrecovering an accident victim from a television tower in Bassett, NE, \non April 22, 2002\n  During that rescue a man was trapped on a 1,500-foot tall Nebraska \nEducational Telecommunications, NET, tower. The man, Timothy Culpepper \nof Meridian, MS, was part of a crew installing a new cable and \ntransmission line on the tower about 15 miles south of Bassett. It is \nbelieved Culpepper was killed instantly when a steel cable snapped. His \nbody was about 1,180 feet above ground.\n  After an air rescue was determined to be impossible due to winds, \ntower wires and lack of expertise, Lincoln Fire and Rescue was called \nin. The six-person crew was flown to Bassett in a Nebraska State Patrol \naircraft, usually used by the Governor's Office. Deputy Chief Kennett \nand Captain Klein directed the recovery operation from the ground. The \nsix firefighters climbed for an hour and a half to reach the accident \nvictim. They lowered Mr. Culpepper's body 300 feet at a time, with the \ndescent taking more than 3 hours.\n  Men and women like these firefighters are our first line of defense \nwhenever tragedy strikes. They are truly an inspiration to us all. I \njoin with my fellow Nebraskans and this entire nation in thanking them \nfor their courage and for making my home State proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/14/senate-section/article/S2521-3", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/14/senate-section/article/S2522-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2522]]\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/14/senate-section/article/S2522-2", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bills were read the first time:\n\n       S. 3.

A bill to prohibit the procedure commonly known as partial-\nbirth abortion; read the first time.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Partial \nBirth Abortion Ban Act of 2003. I am joined in introducing this bill by \n38 of my colleagues, over a third of the Senate. This bill is written \nto prohibit one particularly gruesome, inhumane, and medically \nunaccepted late term abortion method, except when the procedure is \nnecessary to save the life of the mother. Partial birth abortion is a \nprocedure that is performed over a 3-day period in the second or third \ntrimester of pregnancy. In this particular abortion technique, the \nphysician delivers all but the head of a living baby through the birth \ncanal, stab the baby in the base of the skull with curved scissors, and \nthe uses a suction catheter to remove the child's brain. This procedure \nkills the baby. After collapsing the skull, the doctor completes the \nprocedure. According to Ron Fitzsimmons of the National Coalition of \nAbortion Providers, this procedure is performed on a healthy mother \nwith a healthy fetus that is 20 weeks or more along in the vast \nmajority of cases.\n  The American public finds this procedure repugnant. A recent CNN/USA \nToday/Gallup poll indicated that 70 percent of Americans favored laws \nmaking it illegal to perform partial birth abortions, except when \nnecessary to save the life of the mother. This procedure is also \nunrecognized by the mainstream medical community as a valid abortion \nprocedure. The American Medical Association has said this procedure is \n``not good medicine,'' is ``ethically wrong,'' and ``not an accepted \n`medical practice'.''\n  As far back as the 104th Congress, the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives both acted to ban this procedure. Unfortunately, \nPresident Clinton vetoed that bill. The House voted to override that \nveto, but the Senate fell short. Likewise, during the 105th Congress, \nthe House and Senate acted to pass a bill banning this procedure. \nAgain, President Clinton vetoed that bill banning an abortion procedure \nthat occurs as the child is inches from being completely outside the \nmother. The House subsequently overrode his veto. The Senate failed to \noverride by just three votes. In the 106th Congress as well, the Senate \nand the House both acted to overwhelmingly pass legislation banning \nthis procedure.\n  A little over two years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court, in its Stenberg \nversus Carhart decision, struck down a similar, but not identical, law \nin the state of Nebraska that banned partial birth abortions. The \nStenberg majority opinion voiced concern that the description of the \nabortion procedure as described in the Nebraska law was vague and might \napply to other types of late-term abortions. A second concern was that \nthe law did not provide an exception for those instances when the \nbanned procedure was judged necessary to preserve the health of the \nmother.\n  Last year, during the 107th Congress, Representative Steve Chabot of \nOhio introduced a bill responding to those concerns. This bill passed \nthe House of Representatives by a vote of 274-151. Unfortunately, the \nSenate was kept from considering this bill.\n  Today, I introduced a similar bill banning the horrific procedure of \npartial birth abortion, except when necessary to save the life of a \nmother. To respond to the Supreme Court's concerns in Stenberg, this \nbill provides a very precise definition of the partial birth abortion \nprocedure to make it very clear what procedure is meant.\n  Second, the Court based its decision in Stenberg on the federal \ndistrict court's factual findings regarding the safety of the partial \nbirth abortion procedure. These findings were highly disputed and \ninconsistent with the overwhelming weight of authority on the issue--\nincluding evidence presented at the Stenberg trial, other trials \nchallenging partial birth abortion bans, and at the extensive \nCongressional hearings that have been held over the years. Despite the \nlack of evidence supporting the district court's findings, the Supreme \nCourt was required to accept them because of the ``clearly erroneous'' \nstandard that is applied to lower court factual findings. However, \nunder well-settled Supreme Court jurisprudence, the Congress is not \nrequired to accept these ``factual findings,'' but is entitled to reach \nits own factual findings--findings that the Supreme Court accords great \ndeference--and may enact legislation based on these findings. The bill \nI introduce today includes a series of findings from congressional \nhearings held over the years and from expert testimony that \ndemonstrates that a partial birth abortion is never necessary to \npreserve the health of the mother, poses significant health risks to \nthe woman, and is outside the standard of medical care.\n  Over the years, during the consideration of this ban, proponents of \npartial birth abortion have supported their arguments for this \nprocedure with myth and misinformation. When the time comes for the \nfull Senate to consider this bill, I look forward to again countering \nthose untruths with the truth, and I ask my colleagues to vote to ban \npartial birth abortion.\n  It is long past time for the U.S. Senate to again pass a bill banning \npartial birth abortion. I am pleased that the Senate leadership has \nseen this as a legislative priority for the 108th Congress. The House \nand Senate have overwhelming supported such a ban time and time again. \nPresident Bush has asked us to send him a bill to end the practice of \npartial birth abortion. The American people clearly believe this is a \nprocedure that should be prohibited. I appreciate the support of so \nmany of my colleagues who have joined me in introducing this bill. And \nI am hopeful--very hopeful--that the 108th Congress will not end before \nthis bill becomes law, before children in the very process of being \nborn are protected by the laws of this great nation of ours.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE:\n  S.414.

A bill to reauthorize and revise the Renewable Energy \nProduction Incentive program, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce--along with my \ncolleagues Senators Smith, Murray and Feinstein--the Renewable Energy \nProduction Incentive, REPI, Reform Act.\n  This bill reauthorizes the REPI program, which was created as part of \nthe 1992 National Energy Policy Act to foster greater renewable energy \nproduction and level the playing field for public power utilities, \nwhich do not qualify for renewable energy tax credits. The REPI program \nprovides direct payments to publicly- and cooperatively-owned utilities \nat a rate of 1.5 cents/kWh, indexed for inflation, for electricity \ngenerated from wind, solar, certain geothermal and biomass sources.\n  As some of my colleagues may recall, the Senator from Oregon and I \nintroduced a very similar bill last session, which was subsequently \nincluded in the energy bill that passed the Senate last spring. While \nconferees were ultimately unable to reach agreement on the broader \nenergy bill, reauthorizing the REPI program must remain a priority as \nwe again contemplate energy legislation during the 108th Congress.\n  Since this program's creation, REPI has become an important incentive \nfor locally-owned, not-for-profit utilities to become involved in the \neffort to diversify our Nation's generation sources to include clean, \nsustainable sources of power. Since 1995, more than 36 projects in 17 \nStates have received more than $21 million in REPI incentives and \nproduced more than 3,000 megawatt-hours of electricity per year.\n  In my home State of Washington, where 55 percent of the overall \nenergy load is served by public power, the REPI program had already \nhelped support wood-waste and landfill gas projects, and promises to \nhelp locally-owned utilities tap into our tremendous wind resources. \nAlready, the hills south of Kennewick, WA are home to the Nine Canyon \nWind project--a 48-megawatt wind farm consisting of 37 turbines--\nproducing enough energy to serve 12,000 households. This bill will \nprovide continued support for these innovative projects.\n  The Renewable Energy Production Incentive Reform Act that my \ncolleagues and I have introduced today will do three simple things. It \nwill: reauthorize the program for another 10 years; direct the \nDepartment of Energy, which runs the program, to allocate funds on a \nmore equitable basis in years in which the demand for REPI dollars far \noutpaces available appropriations; and clarifies that landfill gas \nprojects and tribal governments are eligible to receive REPI funding.\n  One of the key challenges in developing a 21st century energy policy \nfor this Nation is putting in place the proper incentives to add new \nand sustainable sources of power to the grid. My colleagues and I from \nthe Northwest have learned this lesson well over the past few years, \nduring which prolonged droughts have stretched to the limit the \nhydroelectric system that has--since the 1930s--formed the basis for \nour region's economic growth. The new clean energy projects the REPI \nprogram supports help relieve some of the stress on our hydro system \nand position my state and region for the next cycle of innovation in \nenergy technology.\n  I look forward to working with my cosponsors during this session to \nensure this small but important program is reauthorized--whether as \nstand-alone legislation or part of a broader energy bill. I believe we \nas a Nation now stand on the cusp of a revolution in clean energy \ntechnology. The Renewable Energy Production Incentive program is key in \nhelping public power systems participate, as we work to put in place an \nenergy policy that will meet the needs of our 21st Century economy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BREAUX:\n  S. 422. A bill to amend the Tariff Act of 1930 to modify the \nprovisions relating to drawback claims, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I would like to clarify a provision of the \nomnibus appropriations bill that was included as a result of \nlegislation I have been working on since the last Congress. In the \ntransportation section of the omnibus, language was included to help \nprovide for tighter restrictions on the waiver process currently in \nplace at the Transportation Security Administration. Specifically, with \nthis language I was seeking to make sure that venues, events and \nstadiums across the country are safe for the thousands in attendance. \nHowever, there are certain airships which are particularly well suited \nto assist law enforcement in providing sustained airborne surveillance \nover and around stadium or other events. It was my intention when \ncrafting this language that blimps operating in this capacity should \nnot be prevented from applying for a waiver from TSA. In fact, under \nthe legislation, the Secretary may grant a waiver for blimps which are \nbeing operated for event safety or security, including those which are \ncapable of providing\n\n[[Page S2539]]\n\nimmediate on-call airborne security camera surveillance services at the \nstadium or event. It was never my intention to prevent this type of \nsecurity enhancement from being utilized because these types of \nairships can and do provide significant security protections for large \nvenue events. I am in possession of a letter from the city of Anaheim \nwhich states that these air operations ``were a major component of the \nsecurity plan'' as they hosted the 2002 World Series. I ask unanimous \nconsent that this be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                    Anaheim Police Department,\n\n                                   Anaheim, CA, November 19, 2002.\n     James Hilton,\n     Director of Operations, The Lightship Group, Orlando, FL.\n       Dear Mr. Hilton: As you know, the City of Anaheim hosted \n     the 2002 Major League Baseball World Series and the Anaheim \n     Police Department was charged with providing security during \n     the games.\n       Air operations were a major component of the security plan. \n     Carl Harbuck, Chief Pilot for the Saturn airship, facilitated \n     a joint aerial plan with our helicopter pilots. Carl arranged \n     for one of our pilots to fly in your airship during each of \n     the four games played in Anaheim. Having one Anaheim officer \n     in your airship, along with the officers in our helicopter, \n     proved to be an effective combination. The Anahiem officer in \n     the airship was able to make observations and convey them to \n     our helicopter crewmembers and officers on the ground in a \n     timely, effective manner. Each of our pilots assigned to your \n     crew during the games had the highest praise for the members \n     of your airship operations team. The members were very \n     professional and informative on how they conduct operations. \n     As you know, having insight in another work mission \n     facilitates a smooth and safe environment for all \n     participants.\n       Please convey my sincere appreciation to Carl and Pilot \n     Jeff Capek, as well as all your team members, for their \n     hospitality. Let me extend an invitation to your pilots to \n     observe our air operations. They are welcome any time.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Roger A. Baker,\n                                                  Chief of Police.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 423. A bill to promote health care coverage parity for individuals \nparticipating in legal recreational activities or legal transportation \nactivities; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague \nfrom Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, in introducing legislation to \nprohibit health insurers from denying benefits to plan participants if \nthey are injured while engaging in legal recreational activities like \nskiing or horseback riding.\n  Among the many rules that were issued at the end of the Clinton \nAdministration was one that was intended to ensure non-discrimination \nin health coverage in the group market. This rule was issued jointly on \nJanuary 8, 2001, by the Department of Labor, the Internal Revenue \nService and the Health Care Financing Administration--now the Centers \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services--in accordance with the Health \nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act, HIPAA, of 1996.\n  While I was pleased that the rule prohibits health plans and issuers \nfrom denying coverage to individuals who engage in certain types of \nrecreational activities, such as skiing, horseback riding, snowmobiling \nor motorcycling, I am extremely concerned that it would allow insurers \nto deny health benefits for an otherwise covered injury that results \nfrom participation in these activities.\n  The rule states that: ``While a person cannot be excluded from a plan \nfor engaging in certain recreational activities, benefits for a \nparticular injury can, in some cases, be excluded based on the source \nof the injury.'' A plan could, for example, include a general exclusion \nfor injuries sustained while doing a specified list of recreational \nactivities, even though treatment for those injuries, a broken arm for \ninstance, would have been covered under the plan if the individual had \ntripped and fallen.\n  Because of this loophole, an individual who was injured while skiing \nor running could be denied health care coverage, while someone who is \ninjured while drinking and driving a car would be protected.\n  This clearly is contrary to Congressional intent. One of the purposes \nof HIPAA was to prohibit plans and issuers from establishing \neligibility rules for health coverage based on certain health-related \nfactors, including evidence of insurability. To underscore that point, \nthe conference report language stated that ``the inclusion of evidence \nof insurability in the definition of health status is intended to \nensure, among other things, that individuals are not excluded from \nhealth care coverage due to their participation in activities such as \nmotorcycling, snowmobiling, all-terrain vehicle riding, horseback \nriding, skiing and other similar activities.'' The conference report \nalso states that ``this provision is meant to prohibit insurers or \nemployers from excluding employees in a group from coverage or charging \nthem higher premiums based on their health status and other related \nfactors that could lead to higher health costs.''\n  Millions of Americans participate in these legal and common \nrecreational activities which, if practiced with appropriate \nprecautions, do not significantly increase the likelihood of serious \ninjury. Moreover, in enacting HIPAA, Congress simply did not intend \nthat people would be allowed to purchase health insurance only to find \nout, after the fact, that they have no coverage for an injury resulting \nfrom a common recreational activity. If this rule is allowed to stand, \nmillions of Americans will be forced to forgo recreational activities \nthat they currently enjoy lest they have an accident and find out that \nthey are not covered for needed care resulting from that accident.\n  The legislation that we are introducing today will clarify that \nindividuals participating in activities routinely enjoyed by millions \nof Americans cannot be denied access to health care coverage or health \nbenefits as a result of their activities, and I urge all of our \ncolleagues to join us as cosponsors.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nMaine to introduce legislation to promote health care parity for \nindividuals participating in legal transportation and recreational \nactivities. This legislation addresses concerns that I have been \nhearing from a wide range of Wisconsinites about a loophole caused by \nthe Department of Health and Human Services' ruling that makes it \npossible for health care coverage to be denied to those who are injured \nwhile participating in these kinds of legal activities.\n  In January of 2001, the Health Care Finance administration released \nregulations governing the Health Care Insurance Accountability Act of \n1996, also known as HIPAA. As part of this act, Congress intended to \nban health insurance discrimination against those participating in \nlegal transportation or recreational activities. Ironically, it appears \nthat the rules written in response to this legislation may have had \nprecisely the opposite effect.\n  These new regulations at first state that an employer cannot refuse \nhealth care coverage to an employee on the basis of participation in \nrecreational activities. But they then go on to say that health care \nbenefits can be denied for injuries sustained in connection with those \nrecreational activities.\n  Not only does this ruling make little sense, it flies in the face of \nwhat Congress intended. In a colloquy between Senators Moseley-Braun \nand Kassebaum, Senator Mosely-Braun stated, ``As I understand it, this \nformulation is intended to ensure that, among other things, \nparticipants and beneficiaries are not excluded from health care \ncoverage because they participate in activities such as motorcycling, \nskiing, horseback riding, snowmobiling, or other similar activities.''\n  And Senator Kassebaum simply said ``The Senator from Illinois is \ncorrect.''\n  But the bureaucrats turned around and permitted the denial of \nbenefits for any injury sustained while participating in these legal \nactivities. This ruling makes no sense. Because of this loophole, \nsomeone who participates in motorcycling, snowmobiling, running or \nwalking could be denied health care coverage, while someone who is \ninjured while drinking and driving a car would be protected.\n  Congress voted 98-0 in favor of the HIPAA legislation that included \nthis language. We must close the loophole that the interpretation of \nthis provision has created.\n\n[[Page S2540]]\n\n  From riding Harley Davidson motorcycles to the visiting the \nSnowmobile Hall of Fame in St. Germain, these activities are part of \nWisconsin's heritage and economy. It makes no sense that they would be \nsingled out for this unfair treatment.\n  Millions of Americans rely on motorcycles for their transportation to \nwork. Individuals should not singled out just because they choose a \ndifferent mode of transportation to go to work.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and provide health \ncare parity for individuals participating in legal transportation and \nrecreational activities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Campbell, and Mr. \n        Daschle):\n  S. 424. A bill to establish, reauthorize, and improve energy programs \nrelating to Indian tribes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bipartisan bill \nto address the energy needs of Native Americans in this country. In \ndoing so, I hope to build upon the widespread support for these \nprovisions that was evident during the energy bill debate in the 107th \nCongress. That support continues as I am pleased to note that Senators \nInouye, Campbell and Daschle are original cosponsors of this measure. \nI'd like to specifically recognize the work of Senator Inouye and his \nstaff in putting together this bill. I appreciate their significant \ncontribution to its content.\n  Energy matters concerning Native Americans raise two different issues \nthat warrant attention. First, tribal lands contain significant and \ndiverse energy resources and therefore have a role to play in the area \nof national energy policy. Second, there continues to be a lack of \nbasic energy infrastructure on a number of reservations.\n  With respect to the first issue, a significant share of domestic \nenergy resources are located on Indian lands. Over the last 20 years, \nIndian lands have contributed approximately 11 percent of the Nation's \nonshore oil and natural gas production, and 11 percent of its coal \nproduction. This level of contribution could increase in the future \ngiven available supplies of fossil energy resources and the potential \ndevelopment of significant renewable energy resources. The Bureau of \nIndian Affairs estimates that there are almost 90 reservations with \nenergy resource potential, including oil and gas, coal and coal bed \nmethane, wind, and geothermal resources. Developing these resources, \nparticularly those such as wind power that have the capability to \nenable tribes to generate electricity on-reservation, requires dealing \nwith current obstacles such as limited transmission capacity.\n  As for on-reservation energy needs, there is much to be done. A \nrecent Department of Energy report estimated that 14.2 percent of all \nNative American homes on reservations have no access to electricity \ncompared to just 1.4 percent of all U.S. households. The situation is \nespecially acute on the Navajo Reservation where approximately 37 \npercent of Navajo homes do not have electricity. Moreover, the average \nIndian household spends 4 percent of its income on electricity, twice \nthat of the average for all U.S. households. The high cost of energy is \nparticularly harmful to reservation communities, where unemployment \naverages 43 percent. Another 33 percent who live in and around those \ncommunities earn wages below the poverty level. Given these statistics, \nit is clear that Indian tribes with substantial energy resources and \nhigh unemployment rates have a critical interest in enhancing their \nparticipation in the development of energy resources as well as \nproviding electrical services to their reservation communities.\n  The bill being introduced today is a comprehensive approach to the \nenergy issues facing Native Americans. I believe it will assist tribes \nto develop and utilize available energy supplies, thereby improving on-\nreservation quality of life while also assisting tribes as they \ncontinue to move towards economic self-sufficiency. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on this bill and am hopeful that this \nimportant legislation can be enacted this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 424\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to revise the boundary of the Wind Cage National Park \nin the State of South Dakota; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Wind Cave \nNational Park Boundary Revision Act of 2003. The Senate unanimously \napproved this legislation late last fall, but it was not considered by \nthe House of Representatives before Congress adjourned for the year. I \nhope that my colleagues will again support this effort and that we can \nsee this bill signed into law.\n  Wind Cave National Park, located in southwestern South Dakota, is one \nof the Park System's precious natural treasures and one of the Nation's \nfirst national parks. The cave itself, after which the park is named, \nis one of the world's oldest, longest and most complex cave systems, \nwith more than 103 miles of mapped tunnels. The cave is well known for \nits exceptional display of boxwork, a rare, honeycomb-shaped formation \nthat protrudes from the cave's ceilings and walls. While the cave is \nthe focal point of the park, the land above the cave is equally \nimpressive, with 28,000 acres of rolling meadows, majestic forests, \ncreeks, and streams. As one of the few remaining mixed-grass prairie \necostytems in the country, the park is home to abundant wildlife, such \nas bison, deer, elk and birds, and is a National Game Preserve.\n  The Wind Cave National Park Boundary Revision Act will help expand \nthe park by approximately 20 percent in the southern ``keyhole'' \nregion. This land is currently owned by a ranching family that wants to \nsee it protected from development and preserved for future generations. \nThe land is a natural extension of the park, and boasts the mixed-grass \nprairie and ponderosa pine forests found in the rest of the park, \nincluding a dramatic river canyon. The addition of this land will \nenhance recreation for hikers who come for the solitude of the park's \nback country. It will also protect archaeological sites, such as a \nbuffalo jump, over which early native Americans once drove the bison \nthey hunted, and improve fire management.\n  This plan to expand the park has strong, but not universal, support \nin the surrounding community. The community's views were expressed \nduring a recent 60-day public comment period on the proposal. Most \nSouth Dakotans recognize the value in expanding the park, not only to \nencourage additional tourism in the Black Hills, but to permanently \nprotect these extraordinary lands for future generations of Americans \nto enjoy. Understandably, however, some are legitimately concerned \nabout the potential loss of hunting opportunities and local tax \nrevenue.\n  Governor Janklow has expressed his conditional support for the park \nexpansion, stating that there must be no reduction in the amount of \nlands with public access that can currently be hunted, that there must \nbe no loss of tax revenue to the county from the expansion, and that \nchronic wasting disease issue must be dealt with effectively. These are \nreasonable conditions that should be met as this process moves forward.\n  The legislation I am introducing today protects hunting opportunities \nfor sportsmen by excluding 880 acres of School and Public Lands \nproperty from the expansion. In addition, Wind Cave National Park and \nthe Trust for Public Lands are working with interested parties to find \na way to offset the loss of local county tax revenues. Finally, I \nunderstand that the South Dakota Game, Fish, and Parks Department has \nreached an agreement with Wind Cave officials to expand research into \nchronic wasting disease, which will benefit wildlife populations \nnationwide. I am satisfied that the legitimate concerns about the \npotential expansion have been effectively addressed and today am moving \nforward to begin the legislative phase of this process.\n  In conclusion, Wind Cave National Park has been a valued American \ntreasure for nearly 100 years. We have an opportunity with this \nlegislation to expand the park and enhance its value to the public so \nthat visitors will enjoy it even more during the next 100 years. It is \nmy hope that my colleagues will again support this expansion of the \npark and pass this legislation in the near future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished \nformer Chairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources as an \noriginal co-sponsor of the Tribal Energy Self-Sufficiency Act.\n  This measure reflects the work of the House and Senate conferees on \nthe comprehensive energy legislation in the last session of the \nCongress--the tribal provisions of the bill were approved by the \nconferees and it is those provisions which comprise the measure we \nintroduce today.\n  We believe that the enactment of this measure will afford tribal \ngovernments the necessary authorizations and resources that they need \nto develop energy resources on their lands and thereby make a \nsignificant contribution to the Nation's energy needs.\n  We encourage our colleagues to support this measure as they did in \nthe last session of the Congress.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 425\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

This proposal \nis the culmination of more than 4 years of discussion with local \nlandowners, the South Dakota Water Congress, the U.S. Bureau of \nReclamation, local legislators, representatives of South Dakota \nsportsmen groups and affected citizens. It lays out a plan to convey \ncertain parcels of land acquired for the Blunt Reservoir and Pierre \nCanal features of the Oahe Irrigation Project in South Dakota to the \nCommission of School and Public Lands of the State of South Dakota for \nthe purpose of mitigating lost wildlife habitat, and provides the \noption to preferential leaseholders to purchase their original parcels \nfrom the Commission.\n  The bill I'm introducing today is the result of consultations with \nthe Energy and Natural Resources Committee when it considered the bill \nlast July. The committee incorporated changes to the legislation that \nwill ensure a smooth transition of land from federal to private \nownership, increase county tax revenues, as well as provide the tools \nand future funding necessary to help the state of South Dakota improve \nwildlife habitat and public hunting opportunities. The Senate \nunanimously approved this legislation late last fall, but it was not \nconsidered by the House of Representatives before Congress adjourned \nfor the year. I hope that my colleagues will once again support this \neffort, and that we can see this bill signed into law.\n  To more fully understand the issues addressed by the legislation, it \nis necessary to review some of the history related to the Oahe Unit of \nthe Missouri River Basin project in South Dakota.\n  The Oahe Unit was originally approved part of the overall plan for \nwater development in the Missouri River Basin that was incorporated in \nthe Flood Control Act of 1944. Subsequently, Public Law 90-453 \nauthorized construction and operation of the initial stage of this \nunit. The purposes of the Oahe Unit, as authorized, were to provide for \nthe immigration of 190,000 acres of farmland, conserve and enhance fish \nand wildlife habitat, promote recreation and meet other important \ngoals.\n  The project came to be known as the Oahe Irrigation Project. The \nprincipal features of the initial stage of the project included the \nOahe pumping plant, located near Oahe Dam, to pump water from the Oahe \nReservoir; a system of main canals, including the Pierre Canal, running \neast from the Oahe Reservoir; and, the establishment of regulating \nreservoirs, including the Blunt Dam and Reservoir, located \napproximately 35 miles east Pierre, SD.\n  Under the authorizing legislation, 42,155 acres were to be acquired \nby the Federal Government in order to construct and operate the Blunt \nReservoir feature of the Oahe Irrigation Project. Land acquisition for \nthe proposed Blunt Reservoir feature began in 1972 and continued \nthrough 1977. A total of 17,878 acres usually were acquired from \nwilling sellers.\n  The first land for the Pierre Canal feature was purchased in July \n1975 and included the 1.3 miles of Reach 1B. An additional 21-mile \nreach was acquired from 1976 through 1977, also from willing sellers.\n  Organized opposition to the Oahe Irrigation Project surfaced in 1973 \nand continued to build until a series of public meetings were held in \n1977 to determine if the project should continue. In late 1977, the \nOahe project was made a part of Presidents Carter's Federal Water \nProject review process.\n  The Oahe project construction was then halted on September 30, 1977, \nwhen Congress did not include funding in the fiscal year 1978 \nappropriations. Thus, all major construction contract activities \nceased, and land acquisition was halted.\n  The Oahe Project remained an authorized water project with a bleak \nfuture and minimal chances of being completed as authorized. \nConsequently, the Department of Interior, through the Bureau of \nReclamation, gave those persons who willingly had sold their lands to \nthe project, and their descendants, the right to lease those lands and \nuse them as they had in the past until they were needed by the Federal \nGovernment for project purposes.\n\n  During the period from 1978 until the present, the Bureau of \nReclamation has administered these lands on a preferential lease basis \nfor those original landowners or their descendants, and on a non-\npreferential basis for lands under lease to persons who were not \npreferential leaseholders. Currently, the Bureau of Reclamation \nadministers 12,978 acres as preferential leases and 4,304 acres as non-\npreferential leases in the Blunt Reservoir.\n  As I noted previously, the Oahe Irrigation Project is related \ndirectly to the overall project purposes of the Pick-Sloan Missouri \nBasin program authorized under the Flood Control Act of 1944. Under \nthis program, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed four major \ndams across the Missouri River in South Dakota. The two largest \nreservoirs formed by these dams, Oahe Reservoir and Sharpe Reservoir, \ncause the loss of approximately 221,000 acres of fertile, wooded \nbottomland that constituted some of the most productive, unique and \nirreplaceable wildlife habitat in the State of South Dakota. This \nincluded habitat for both game and non-game species, including several \nspecies now listed as threatened or endangered. Meriwether Lewis, while \ntraveling up the Missouri River in 1804 on his famous expedition, wrote \nin his diary, ``Song birds, game species and furbearing animals abound \nhere in numbers like none of the party has ever seen. The bottomlands \nand cottonwood trees provide a shelter and food for a great variety of \nspecies, all laying their claim to the river bottom.''\n  Under the provisions of the Wildlife Coordination Act of 1958, the \nState of South Dakota has developed a plan to mitigate a part of this \nlost wildlife habitat as authorized by Section 602 of Title VI of \nPublic Law 105-277, October 21, 1998, known as the Cheyenne River Sioux \nTribe, Lower Brule Sioux Tribe,\n\n[[Page S2546]]\n\nand State of South Dakota Terrestrial Wildlife Habitat Restoration Act. \nThe State's habitat mitigation plan has received the necessary approval \nand interim funding authorizations under Sections 602 and 609 of Title \nVI.\n  The State's habitat mitigation plan requires the development of \napproximately 27,000 acres of wildlife habitat in South Dakota. \nTransferring the 4,304 acres of non-preferential lease lands in the \nBlunt Reservoir feature to the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish \nand Parks would constitute a significant step toward satisfying the \nhabitat mitigation obligation owed to the state by the Federal \nGovernment and as agreed upon by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the South Dakota Department of \nGame, Fish and Parks.\n  As we developed this legislation, many meetings occurred among the \nlocal landowners, South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks, \nbusiness owners, local legislators, the Bureau of Reclamation, as well \nas representatives of sportsmen groups. It became apparent that the \nbest solution for the local economy, tax base and wildlife mitigation \nissues would be to allow former Blunt Reservoir and Pierre Canal \nlandowners to repurchase their former lands, on which they currently \nhold preferential leases, from the Bureau of Reclamation, BOR. The bill \nalso will transfer non-preferentially-leased lands and unleased lands \nto the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish, and Parks, GFP, as part \nof its broader plan to restore wildlife habitat that was lost due to \nthe construction of the Missouri River dams. Under the provisions \nagreed to by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee last \nsummer, the South Dakota Commission of School and Public Lands would be \nresponsible for working out the terms for selling the preferentially-\nleased lands to the former landowners.\n  The bill will not only rightfully return property to South Dakotans, \nbut also ensure the viability of the local land and tax bases. The \nlegislation authorizes the creation of a trust fund that would be used \nto create a trust fund to pay the local taxes on those lands \ntransferred to State. The trust fund would be through future \nappropriations by Congress.\n  The State of South Dakota, the Federal Government, the original \nlandowners, the sportsmen and wildlife will benefit from this bill. It \nprovides for a fair and just resolution to the private property and \nenvironmental problems caused by the Oahe Irrigation Project some 25 \nyears ago. We have waited long enough to right some of the wrongs \nsuffered by our landowners and South Dakota's wildlife resources.\n  Again, I am hopeful the Senate will act quickly on this legislation. \nOur goal is to enact a bill that will allow meaningful wildlife habitat \nmitigation to begin, give certainty to local landowners who sacrificed \ntheir lands for a defunct federal project they once supported, ensure \nthe viability of the local land base and tax base, and provide well \nmaintained and managed recreation areas for sportsmen.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 426\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
