Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 1, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Conference report to accompany H.R. 1, an act to amend \n     title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide a voluntary \n     prescription drug benefit under the Medicare Program and to \n     strengthen and improve the Medicare Program, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the majority manager is not here. I have \nbeen designated to be the opposition manager for the half hour that we \nhave. In a short time, I will delegate that time to the senior Senator \nfrom Massachusetts.\n  As we begin this half hour on our side and half hour on the other \nside, I extend my appreciation and that of the whole Democratic caucus \nto Senator Kennedy for leading the opposition, literally, to this \nmeasure. He has had a lot of help. I have sat through days of speeches \non this matter and I have been impressed with the quality of the \nspeeches, really, on both sides. Especially on our side, I have been \nimpressed with Senator Kennedy, and I will mention a number of names \nwho I thought did such a wonderful job: Senators Bayh, Boxer, Cantwell, \nClinton, Dayton, Dodd, Harkin, Pryor, Nelson of Florida, and Graham of \nFlorida. What a loss it is going to be to this institution and our \ncountry that this fine man is going to no longer be part of the Senate \nafter 1 year.\n  I believe there is no one who has a better grasp of this legislation \nthan the Senator from Florida. He has done such an outstanding job of \narticulating his views.\n  Of course, I add a congratulatory note to Senator Stabenow who has \nworked on this measure long and hard.\n  Senator Durbin has always done such a good job of expressing his \nviews. He was never any better than on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the last 5 minutes for Senator Daschle. I \ndelegate the rest of our time to the senior Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the last 5 \nminutes is reserved.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on the question of time, we have the last \n5 minutes. That will probably be leader time. The leader, obviously, \nought to have whatever time he needs.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have 23 minutes on our side; 23 minutes \non the other side.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair advises the Senator from \nMassachusetts that the final 5 minutes of the first half of the time is \nfor the minority leader, and the final 5 minutes of the debate time is \nfor the majority leader.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I bring to the attention of the Members a picturesque \ndescription of what the reaction is to this proposed legislation. It is \nwritten in a very explicit article this morning in the Boston Globe. I \nwant to share the article with the Members.\n  The title is ``In Dorchester, Seniors Weigh Changes Against Their \nNeeds.''\n  It reads:\n\n       Thomas Lombardi dropped his private health insurance a few \n     years ago when the price rose steeply. Then he switched from \n     Coumadin, a prescription anticoagulant he took for heart \n     disease, to half an aspirin to save about $15 a month. Living \n     on Social Security and a bit of savings, Lombardi, 75, says \n     he frequently has ``to cut corners to stay alive.''\n       But over lunch at the Kit Clark Senior Center in \n     Dorchester, he said he doesn't support the $400 billion \n     Medicare drug benefit that is about to become law and provide \n     coverage to millions of seniors like him. Echoing the \n     comments of many others at the center yesterday, he said it's \n     far too complicated and probably won't go far enough to help \n     him because of gaps in the coverage designed to keep down the \n     cost of the new benefit. Besides, many said, it will be two \n     years before the full benefits kick in.\n       ``I don't believe it's good for me,'' said Lombardi, who \n     owned a welding business in Dorchester.\n       ``This is part of the Bush strategy to . . . destroy \n     programs put in place years ago,'' Said Richard Schultz, who \n     qualifies for Medicare at 60 because he is disabled. ``I \n     understand that it would benefit some low-income people in \n     the short term, but combined with huge tax cuts, this is \n     going to drive the deficit up. Then they're going to decide \n     they don't have the money, and, in the long run, the program \n     will be dissolved''. . . .\n       Barbara Burke, who operates the switchboard at the senior \n     center, disparagingly called the new benefit ``a Band-Aid.''\n       It's not enough with the high cost of medicines,'' said \n     Burke, who said she's still working at 66 because she \n     won't be able to afford her prescriptions if she retires. \n     The center does not pay health benefits for retirees, she \n     said, and she has chronic lung disease that costs her more \n     than $200 a month for inhalers alone.\n       ``People that can't afford to buy medications should get it \n     at a minimum charge,'' she said. . . .\n       An Kim Hoang, 67, said she can't afford a copayment of $3 \n     for a brand-name drug, which will be required under the new \n     plan for those below the poverty level. Those with incomes \n     from $8,980 to $12,123 will face copayments up to $5 per \n     prescription. Seniors currently getting drug coverage through \n     the MassHealth, the state-federal Medicaid program for the \n     poor, would be shifted to the federal program.\n\n  In fact, that is going to be eliminated in terms of coverage. That is \npart of the 6 million low-income seniors who will pay more.\n\n       Hoang, speaking through a translator, said she borrows from \n     friends to cover the $2 copayment required by Medicaid for \n     each of the eight prescriptions she takes to treat mental \n     illness. ``$1 is OK,'' she said, ``but $2 is too much.''\n\n  This is the real world, Mr. President. This is putting a face and \nname on the 6 million low-income seniors who will pay more.\n\n       ``$1 is OK,'' she said, ``but $2 is too much.''\n\n  That was put in here to save some $12 billion to $15 billion put into \na slush fund to provide additional benefits to the HMOs.\n\n       Because of the Medicaid copayment, her friend Quy Nguyen, \n     71, said she limits herself to four prescriptions she needs \n     most and tries to get by without several others. She said she \n     envisions that choice becoming more difficult under [this \n     program.]\n       Josephine DeSantis said the new benefit would help her \n     immensely, since she struggles to scrape together the $157 \n     she spends every three months for drugs to prevent ulcers and \n     dizziness. But at 78, she said, she's upset that the benefit \n     won't start until 2006.\n       ``In two years,'' she said, ``I'll probably be dead.''\n\n  There you have it, Mr. President, reaction in a working class \ncommunity in Dorchester. We have the reaction in real life about what \nthe low-income seniors pay.\n  When we talk and bring out these charts, as we have in the past few \ndays, this is the very instance about which we are talking. It did not \nhave to be this way. This is just an illustration of the overall \nchallenges of this legislation and a reason that it should not pass the \nSenate.\n  How much time do I have, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 15 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n\n[[Page S15883]]\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Kennedy. We have had a long and quite \nilluminating debate over the past week on one of the most important \nissues that our Nation faces; that is: Shall we turn a program which \nfor 40 years has protected older Americans and disabled Americans \nagainst illness into a program which promotes wellness?\n  In order to do that, we understand that fundamentally we will have to \nmake access to prescription drugs affordable, comprehensive, universal, \nand reliable because prescription drugs are now fundamental to a \npreventive health care policy.\n  There is much to criticize about this legislation, and I intend to \nvote no. We have heard that at great length in recent days. Let me take \na slightly different approach. I am assuming that this legislation is \ngoing to pass. The challenge will then be before us: What do we do \nnext?\n  Let me suggest three things that we ought to do next. One is that we \nhave to look realistically at the cost of this bill. As Senator Ensign \nsaid during last night's debate, the $400 billion figure is a mirage. \nThis bill is going to cost substantially more than $400 billion. The \nCongressional Budget Office is estimating that in the second 10 years, \nit will be over $1 trillion.\n  What are the suggestions of how to deal with this reality? One of \nthose suggestions is to reduce benefits. Another one is to set some \ntype of a formula relating Medicare expenditures to general revenue, \nand then scaling back Medicare expenditures when they break through \nthat barrier.\n  Of course, one of the things that we ought to have done in terms of \ncost is not start this year by passing a massive tax cut which added \nsubstantially to the Federal deficit and narrowed the range of \nrealistic options that we have today.\n  This has been truly an amazing year for the Congress and the \nPresident. We started the year with a proposal for almost a $1 trillion \ntax cut. We reasserted our commitment to fight and win a war against \nterror in Afghanistan. We started a war in Iraq. We have seen surging \nFederal Government expenditures in the nondefense area, and now on what \nwill likely be the last day of the session, we conclude by passing a \n$400 billion unfunded new entitlement.\n  My answer to the question of cost, at least a significant part of it, \nlies in the fact that in this bill we are failing to sanction the use \nof the tremendous marketing influence which the Federal Government, \nthrough the Medicare Program, can have over the cost of prescription \ndrugs.\n  Just as we did over 10 years ago--and the Presiding Officer's \ncolleague, Senator Murkowski, was a prime sponsor of this legislation--\nwe authorized the VA to negotiate to get the best prices it could for \nAmerican veterans. I think the high priority for 2004 should be to give \nto the administrator of the Medicare Program similar authority.\n  Second, I think we need to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. If we are \ngoing to be herding millions of older Americans into various forms of \nhealth management, we have a responsibility to give them some assurance \nas to what the standards of that access to health care will be.\n  Third, we have a strange provision in here for the distribution of \nprescription drugs. That is, we use private insurance programs rather \nthan traditional Medicare. It would be like having to get a private \ninsurance program to get anesthesiology or any of the other services \nthat have traditionally been provided through Medicare.\n  Then, in order to encourage--I would say more than encourage--mandate \nthe maximum number of Americans participating in that program, we say \nthere has to be at least one prescription-only insurance provider in \nthe region and, second, then a preferred provider organization, \nessentially a variant of an HMO, in the region. It is only if both of \nthose fail, there is not one or more drug-only insurance plan or a PPO, \nonly under those circumstances will a person be able to consider using \nstandard fee-for-service Medicare as the means of getting their \nprescriptions.\n  It is ironic that in another part of this bill, which is going to \ncreate a demonstration project on the totality of Medicare, we line up \nall of the choices side by side, including staying in traditional fee \nfor service, which over 85 percent of Americans are electing to do, and \nthen choose on an equal basis, as we do in the Federal health insurance \nprogram. We do not have to wait until all of the other choices have \nbeen rejected, because they are not being provided, and then drop back \ninto a Blue Cross/Blue Shield-type fee for service.\n  We ought to do the same thing with prescription drugs. If we are \ngoing to have what I think is a rather irrational program--\nincidentally, the prescription drug-only proposal is not in existence \nin any other area of American health care. A person cannot buy that \nthrough the Federal health care system. A person cannot buy it through \ntheir employer system. The reason they cannot buy it is because no \ninsurance company is providing it. That ought to tell us something \nabout what they think of the management and fiscal implications of \nproviding a drug-only prescription plan.\n  At least we should not require our oldest citizens to go through a \nso-called fallback process. We should allow older citizens to assess \nall of the options at the same time and make the decision they consider \nto be in their best interest.\n  As I conclude this long debate, I urge that the agenda of cost, \npatients' rights, and providing the more rational process for elderly \ndeterminations as to how they will receive their drugs be the starting \npoint of the agenda for reform next year.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  First, I very much appreciate the passion of the opposition. \nHopefully, they will look back on this day and come to the conclusion \nthat we have not only provided prescription drugs for seniors as the \nfirst improvement in Medicare in 38 years and the strengthening of \nMedicare that follows it, but that we are also in the process of giving \nbaby boomers an alternative Medicare Program, if they would so choose.\n  The basis of such legislation is the right to choose for seniors. No \none is forced to do anything. We will give those baby boomers a program \nthat is much closer to the health insurance they have in the places \nfrom which they retire.\n  Regardless, there are two classes of people covered today or not \ncovered today with prescription drugs that we are emphasizing. For low-\nincome people, too often our seniors are choosing between heat and \nprescription drugs, particularly in the cold areas of the country, or \nbetween food and prescription drugs. This legislation is going to \nlessen the chances that low-income people are going to have to make \nsuch choices.\n  The other group of people are those who have catastrophically high \nprescription drug costs. There is heavy subsidy and help in this bill \nfor those two categories of people. Those are significant categories of \npeople.\n  Also, we are doing something for everybody in this legislation from \nthe standpoint that for the first time there will be in place \nmechanisms to dramatically negotiate down the price of drugs. That is \nobviously going to help the people who voluntarily choose to go into \nthese plans, but the extent to which that is going to have an impact on \neverybody, old or young, is very important because all I hear from \nopponents of this bill is that we do not do anything to help cut down \non the costs of drugs.\n  We do it through the subsidy. We do it through negotiations. We do it \nthrough getting generic drugs on the market much sooner than before.\n  Also, this bill is about enhancing quality of life, because none of \nus think the quality of life is enhanced by putting people in the \nhospital if they do not need to go to the hospital.\n  Remember when Medicare was enacted 38 years ago, the practice of \nmedicine was to put everybody into the hospital. Today, the practice of \nmedicine--and a lot of the thanks can go to prescription drugs--is to \nkeep people out of hospitals and out of operating rooms. So people who \ncannot afford drugs, who go to the doctor very sick,\n\n[[Page S15884]]\n\nare going to not only end up in a place they do not want to go, because \npeople would rather not go to hospitals, rather not go to operating \nrooms. It is going to save our programs a lot of money, both private \nand public payment programs, for doctors and hospitals, when we can \nhave people go into programs where they can get prescription drugs and \nkeep their health up so they do not go to the hospital.\n  So we are bringing Medicare and the practice of medicine into the \n21st century. In strengthening and improving Medicare, we are doing \ntoday exactly what we would be doing if we were writing a Medicare \nProgram in the year 2003 as opposed to the year 1965.\n  I hope the opponents, in a few years, can look back and say this is \nthe day we have done the right thing for seniors, for their economic \nlife, for the quality of their life; we have done the right thing for \nour hospitals and our doctors; we have done the right thing for \nAmerica.\n  I would like to spend just a little bit of time counteracting the \narguments that are used against this bill by those who say we are not \ndoing enough for low-income people. In fact, this bill is coming back \nfrom conference doing better for low-income people than when it went \ninto conference.\n  One of those major changes that were made, not only at the behest of \nthe House of Representatives but also at the behest of a lot of people \nin this body, probably more prominent in the Democratic Party than in \nthe Republican Party, was to make sure the category of people we call \ndual eligibles--those low-income seniors who are already on Medicare \nbut also qualify for Medicaid--is to put all of those into the Medicare \nProgram so we didn't have an inequality. Maybe it was not a very big \ninequality but at least there was some inequality from one State to \nanother State because of the Federal-State partnership in Medicaid that \nenables the State legislatures in some States to maybe set up a little \ndifferent program--a little more rich, a little less rich--than what \nmight be done in another State.\n  So dual eligibles are in this bill because of the demands of mostly \nDemocrat Senators and people in the House of Representatives. That is \nsomething I didn't believe should be done, but I supported it because \nthat was a necessary compromise. But now I find people who were \nadvocating that position complaining about the legislation. So I want \nto tell them how wrong they are or how, if they are right just a little \nbit, they are right in such an insignificant way that it is immaterial \nbecause that ought to be seen as something that results from something \nthey wanted us to do in this legislation.\n  This conference report, then, contains a generous drug benefit for \nthese dually eligible seniors. There is, first of all, no donut hole \nfor low-income Medicare beneficiaries. Let's get this clear. Let me \nmake it clear. People on that side of the aisle are complaining about a \ndonut hole. But for low-income people there is no donut hole. The bill \nguarantees all 6 million dual eligibles access to prescription drugs.\n  Under our conference report, dual eligibles will have better access \nthrough Medicare, especially since State Medicaid programs are \nincreasingly imposing restrictions on patients' access to drugs, and \nthat is what brings about greater inequity from State to State. Since \nStates are in a budget crunch, forced to do that, some dual eligibles \nmight be treated less generously in one State as opposed to another, \nbut when they are all under the Federal Medicare Program, that will not \nbe the case.\n  Further, States have the flexibility to provide coverage for classes \nof drugs, including over-the-counter drugs, that are not now covered by \nthe Medicare Program. This bill ensures appeal rights for dual \neligibles. Under the agreement, dual eligibles will maintain appeals \nrights like those in the Medicaid Program. The dual eligibles are a \nfragile population and I think, because of the conference report as \nopposed to either bill in its original form, they are taken care of \nbetter in this bill. The conference report recognizes and provides \ngenerous coverage to these 6 million people.\n  I hope we can take the summation of the AARP when they said this bill \n``is a historic breakthrough and [an] important milestone in the \nNation's commitment to strengthen and expand health security for its \ncitizens. . . .'' I hope that will be conceived or considered as a \ntoning down of the partisan opposition to this legislation.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time just in case some colleagues come \nover. I have more to say, but I will say it later if other colleagues \ndon't show up, so I yield the floor.\n\n\n                                Title XI\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose the Medicare bill before the \nSenate, but I want to express my understanding of the refinements of \nthe Hatch-Waxman Act found in Title XI of the Medicare bill now before \nthe Senate. I was deeply involved in the negotiations of these \nprovisions in the conference. The Hatch-Waxman Act, which passed in \n1984, reflects efforts by the Congress to promote two policy \nobjectives: to encourage brand-name pharmaceutical firms to make the \ninvestments necessary to research and develop new drug products, and to \nenable competitors to bring cheaper, generic copies of those drugs to \nmarket as quickly as possible.\n  The Hatch-Waxman Act has worked very well for almost 20 years. It has \nprovided the incentives necessary to bring the many medicines to market \nthat have so transformed the shape of modern medical practice. And it \nhas brought generic drugs to market faster than ever, saving consumers \nbillions of dollars.\n  As the Federal Trade Commission has shown, however, in recent years \nboth brand-name and generic drug companies have exploited certain \naspects of the Hatch-Waxman Act to delay generic competition. The \nchanges to the Hatch-Waxman Act found in Title XI represent refinements \nto the present system that will stop these abuses, will restore the \noriginal balance the law intended, and will ensure Americans more \ntimely access to affordable pharmaceuticals.\n  Most significantly, the Hatch-Waxman provisions in this bill limit \nbrand-name drug companies to only one 30-month stay of approval of \ngeneric drugs. This change will stop the multiple, successive 30-month \nstays that the Federal Trade Commission identified as having delayed \napproval of generic versions of several blockbuster drugs and cost \nconsumers billions of dollars.\n  It also restructures how the 180-day generic exclusivity provisions \nwork. The 180-day exclusivity gives a generic company 180 days during \nwhich it is the only generic competitor to the brand drug. The \nexclusivity is a very valuable incentive for generic companies. The \nexclusivity encourages generic companies to challenge patents that are \nlikely invalid or not infringed and, because it goes to the first \ngeneric applicant to challenge a brand-name drug patent, it encourages \nchallenges of those patents as soon as possible. These incentives mean \nthat consumers will be able to enjoy the lower prices provided by \ngeneric companies sooner rather than later.\n  The Federal Trade Commission reports that the exclusivity has at \ntimes been parked through collusive agreements between brand and \ngeneric companies. Parking the exclusivity has blocked other generic \ncompanies from getting to market and has cost consumers billions of \ndollars. The Hatch-Waxman provisions in this bill are intended to \nprevent parking of the exclusivity. It does this by providing for \nseveral situations in which a generic company with the exclusivity \nforfeits the exclusivity, clearing the way for other generic companies \nto bring their products to market.\n  The Hatch-Waxman provisions in this bill also make the exclusivity \navailable only with respect to the patent or patents challenged on the \nfirst day generic applicants challenge brand drug patents, which makes \nthe exclusivity a product-by-product exclusivity rather than a patent-\nby-patent exclusivity, and the exclusivity is available to more than \none generic applicant, if they all challenge patents on the same day.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, I will yield to my friend from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President. Let my just say, before I ask \nmy question, that I want to thank the Senator from Massachusetts, and \nthe senior Senator from New Hampshire, for their leadership on this \nissue. The\n\n[[Page S15885]]\n\nSenator from Massachusetts, as chair of the HELP Committee last year, \ntook up the generic drug bill authored by the senior Senator from \nArizona and myself, saw it through the HELP Committee, and managed its \npassage by the full Senate. This year, the senior Senator from New \nHampshire approached me to work together to come up with the generic \ndrug bill that served as the basis for what is in this bill, and he \nbrought it through the HELP Committee, offered it as an amendment to \nthe prescription drug bill in the Senate, where it was accepted 94-1, \nand defended it very ably in conference with the House. So, again, I \nwould like to thank both distinguished chair and ranking member of the \nHELP Committee for their leadership on this issue.\n  Of course, I also want to thank the senior Senator from Arizona, \nwithout whose leadership over the past several years we would not be \nwhere we are today on such an important consumer issue.\n  As for my question, I understand that a generic applicant that has \nthe 180-day exclusivity will forfeit the exclusivity if it has failed \nto market its product 75 days after certain events have happened with \nrespect to itself or another generic applicant and with respect to each \nof the patents that gives the generic applicant its generic \nexclusivity. Is that correct?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is correct.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. And am I correct that one of these events is when ``a \ncourt enters a final decision'' that the patent is invalid or not \ninfringed by the drug of the generic applicant?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. And am I correct that a final court decision under this \nprovision includes the kind of court decision recognized in the Teva v. \nShalala opinion?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, I very much appreciate your question on this point. \nWe do intend that a court decision like the one in the D.C. Circuit's \n1999 decision in Teva v. Shalala--a decision dismissing a declaratory \njudgment action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the \npatent owner has represented that the patent is not infringed--will \ncount as a court decision under the new ``failure to market'' \nprovision. Under the failure to market provision, the conditions for \nforfeiture are intended to be satisfied when a generic company has \nresolved patent disputes on all the patents that earned the first-to-\nfile its exclusivity. After a court decision such as that at issue in \nTeva v. Shalala, the patent owner is estopped from suing the generic \napplicant in the future and the patent dispute is resolved. So these \nsorts of decisions should be recognized as court decisions under the \nfailure to market provision.\n  I'd also like to point out the importance of the declaratory judgment \nprovisions that are in the Senate bill and are retained in modified \nform by the conferees in the conference report now before the Senate. \nAmendments made by this bill to both the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act and Title 35 clarify that generic applicants may bring \ndeclaratory judgment acts to ensure timely resolution of patent \ndisputes. These provisions authorize a generic applicant to bring a \ndeclaratory judgment action to obtain a judicial determination that a \nlisted patent is invalid or is not infringed if the applicant is not \nsued within 45 days of having given notice to the patent owner and \nbrand-name drug company that it is challenging the patent. This \nclarification of a generic applicants right to bring a declaratory \njudgment action is crucial to ensuring prompt resolution of patent \nissues, which is essential to achieve our goal of speeding generic \ndrugs to market.\n  It's worth pointing out that the Hatch-Waxman Act has always provided \nthat patent owners and brand drug companies can bring patent \ninfringement suits against a generic applicant immediately upon \nreceiving notice that the generic applicant is challenging a patent. \nThe declaratory judgment provisions in Title XI of this bill simply \nlevel the playing field by making it clear that the generic applicant \ncan also seek a prompt resolution of these patent issues by bringing a \ndeclaratory judgment action if neither the patent owner nor the brand \ndrug company brings such a suit within 45 days after receiving notice \nof the patent challenge.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, I will yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator please explain for me and our colleagues \nthe purpose of the provision in Title XI that amends Title 35 to say \nthat courts must hear declaratory judgment actions brought by generic \napplicants?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Certainly. The provision in Title 35 is intended to \nclarify that Federal district courts are to entertain such suits for \ndeclaratory judgments so long as there is a ``case or controversy'' \nunder Article III of the Constitution. We fully expect that, in almost \nall situations where a generic applicant has challenged a patent and \nnot been sued for patent infringement, a claim by the generic applicant \nseeking declaratory judgment on the patent will give rise to a \njusticiable ``case or controversy'' under the Constitution. We believe \nthat the only circumstance in which a case or controversy might not \nexist would arise in the rare circumstance in which the patent owner \nand brand drug company have given the generic applicant a covenant not \nto sue, or otherwise formally acknowledge that the generic applicant's \ndrug does not infringe.\n  The mere fact that neither the patent owner nor the brand drug \ncompany has brought a patent infringement suit within 45 days against a \ngeneric applicant does not mean there is no ``case or controversy.'' \nThe sole purpose of requiring the passage of 45 days is to provide the \npatent owner and brand-name drug company the first opportunity to begin \npatent litigation. Inaction within the 45-day period proves nothing, as \nthere are tactical reasons why a patent owner or brand drug company \nmight refrain from bringing suit on a patent within 45 days.\n  For example, the brand drug company might have several patents listed \nin the Food and Drug Administration's Orange Book with respect to a \nparticular drug. It could be in the company's interest to bring suit \nwithin 45 days on one patent and to hold the others in reserve. The \nsuit on one patent would automatically stay approval of the generic \napplication until the lawsuit is resolved or the 30 months elapses. \nHolding the other patents in reserve would introduce uncertainty that \ncould discourage generic companies from devoting resources to bring the \ngeneric drug to market and that would give the brand drug company a \nsecond opportunity to delay generic competition by suing the generic \ncompany for infringement of the reserved patents after the resolution \nof the initial infringement suit.\n  Or for patents on which no 30-month stay is available, the brand drug \ncompany could sit back to create uncertainty and similarly delay \ngeneric entry by delaying resolution of those patents. Or when generic \napplicants are blocked by a first generic applicant's 180-day \nexclusivity, the brand drug company could choose not to sue those other \ngeneric applicants so as to delay a final court decision that could \ntrigger the ``failure to market'' provision and force the first generic \nto market.\n  In each of these and in other circumstances, generic applicants must \nbe able to seek a resolution of disputes involving all patents listed \nin the Orange Book with respect to the drug immediately upon the \nexpiration of the 45-day period. We believe there can be a case or \ncontroversy sufficient for courts to hear these cases merely because \nthe patents at issue have been listed in the FDA Orange Book, and \nbecause the statutory scheme of the Hatch-Waxman Act relies on early \nresolution of patent disputes. The declaratory judgment provisions in \nthis bill are intended to encourage such early resolution of patent \ndisputes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, I will yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I'd like to ask the Senator if it is the \nintent of this legislation that the declaratory judgment provisions in \nthis bill, in particular, the change to Title 35, will be available \nimmediately to help generic drug applicants who are now in federal \ncourt seeking declaratory judgments that listed drug patents are \ninvalid or are not infringed by their product?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I agree with the distinguished Senator from Arizona. It \nis clearly our intent that, under these\n\n[[Page S15886]]\n\nprovisions, courts considering jurisdictional challenges to declaratory \njudgment actions brought by generic drug companies should apply the \nstandards set forth in this bill to such challenges in any case pending \n(either in the trial court or on appeal) at the time of enactment in \norder to resolve patent issues as soon as possible and to clear the way \nfor quicker generic entry.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator for his answer and for his leadership \non these issues. His experience and technical expertise have been \ninvaluable. I would also like to thank my friend, the senior Senator \nfrom New York, who has worked with me these many years on this \nlegislation. His dedication to American consumers and his commitment to \nrestoring fairness to the drug industry must be commended. The senior \nSenator from New Hampshire must also be recognized for leadership on \nthis issue in his committee, in the Senate, and in the conference on \nthis bill. I would also like to thank the staffs of all three of these \nSenators, who have worked tirelessly on behalf of this issue. I ask \nunanimous consent that a letter from Chairman Muris of the Federal \nTrade Commission about the value of the declaratory judgment provision \nin Title 35 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     Federal Trade Commission,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 21, 2003.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Gregg and Ranking Member Kennedy: In written \n     testimony submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee on \n     August 1, 2003, for a hearing entitled, ``Examining the \n     Senate and House Versions of the `Greater Access to \n     Affordable Pharmaceuticals Act,' '' the Federal Trade \n     Commission commented on both the Senate and House-passed \n     bills that reform the Hatch-Waxman generic drug approval \n     process. The reforms are nearly identical to recommendations \n     contained in the FTC's July 2002 study entitled, ``Generic \n     Drug Entry Prior to Patent Expiration.''\n       I understand that one particular provision contained in the \n     Senate-passed version is of particular interest now on the \n     bills proceed through the conference process. Specifically, \n     the Senate bill adds a provision clarifying that if a brand-\n     name company fails to bring an infringement action within 45 \n     days of receiving notice of an abbreviated new drug \n     application (ANDA) containing a paragraph IV certification, \n     the generic applicant can bring a declaratory judgment action \n     that the patent is invalid or not infringed. Without \n     commenting on the provision's constitutionality, the \n     Commission has stated that ``the Senate provision may help \n     ensure that a federal court has subject matter jurisdiction \n     to resolve the patent issues.''\n       While I defer to others as to the constitutionality of the \n     Senate provision, I note that a court's dismissal of a \n     declaratory judgment action for lack of controversy may \n     resolve uncertainty concerning whether a generic product \n     infringes a brand-name company's patent. It also can reduce \n     the incentives for the brand-name company and the first \n     generic applicant to park the 180-day exclusivity. Without \n     the right to seek a declaratory judgment, a subsequent \n     generic applicant that develops a clearly non-infringing \n     product cannot trigger the first generic applicant's \n     exclusivity because the subsequent generic applicant will not \n     be sued for patent infringement by the brand-name company. If \n     the brand-name company and the first generic applicant agree \n     that the generic will not begin commercial marketing, then \n     the 180-day exclusivity becomes an absolute bar to any \n     general entrant. Moreover, speedier resolution of patent \n     infringement suits will redound to the benefit of consumers \n     by resolving any possible uncertainty that prevents a generic \n     applicant from marketing its products. If also will allow for \n     the simultaneous running of the periods for FDA approval and \n     for the resolutions of patent infringement issues.\n       For these reasons, I believes the declaratory judgment \n     provision in the Senate-passed bill would be a useful \n     mechanism to reduce uncertainty in the Hatch-Waxman process \n     and potentially could speed access of generic drugs to \n     consumers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Timothy J. Muris.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, one of the criticisms that some have \nraised about the conference report is the provision that prevents the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services Secretary from interfering in \nthe negotiations between private prescription drug plans, drug \nmanufacturers, and pharmacies.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes, we have heard this criticism often during the \ndebate. And I believe it is important to clarify that this bill will \nensure that seniors pay less for prescription drugs than they pay \ntoday.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I also believe it is important that we clarify the \npurpose of the non-interference language. This language is not intended \nto pad the pockets of drug manufactures. It is not intended to pad the \npockets of the insurance companies.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The purpose of this bill is to ensure that Medicare \nbeneficiaries get the benefit of negotiated discounts that the private \nsector is able to achieve. We want seniors, who today pay the highest \nprices, to have access to discounted prices. And we also don't want to \nsee the situation we have today with Part B covered drugs. Isn't it \ntrue that the Federal Government dramatically overpays for the drugs \nthat are currently covered under Medicare today?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes, that is true. The HHS Inspector General has been \nurging Congress to end these overpayments for years. The conference \nreport addresses these overpayments, while ensuring fair reimbursements \nfor oncologists and other affected physicians to ensure that patient \ncare remains unaffected. Moreover, I think it is important that members \nof Congress understand the strong consumer protections that are in \nplace to ensure that they receive access to an affordable drug plan, \none that provides access to the prescription drugs that they need.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Isn't it also true that if a plan chooses to use a \nformulary, it must include at least two drugs in each therapeutic \ncategory or class, unless the category or class only has one drug and \nthat the plan must use pharmacy and therapeutic committees that consist \nof practicing physicians and pharmacists to design their formularies?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes, this is true. It is also true that the Secretary is \nprevented from approving a drug plan that charges too high of a \npremium. The premium must reasonably and equitably reflect the costs of \nthe benefits.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Isn't this requirement the same standard that applies \nto the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes, the same one. And I think it is also important to \nnote that conference report has a requirement for a Government-backed \nfallback plan if fewer than two plans are available. This Government-\nbacked plan is required to negotiate prices with drug manufacturers. \nAnd if the fallback plan is unable to negotiate good discounts on its \nown, then the Secretary will be able to intervene as appropriate to \nnegotiate to achieve lower prices.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. In addition, I also think it is important to note \nthat the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the net price \nincrease for prescription drugs under this bill will be 3.5 percent. \nCBO also found that drug plans bearing full statutory risk levels are \nestimated to produce an overall higher cost savings of 20 to 25 percent \nfor prescription drugs under this bill, as compared to the 12 to 15 \npercent that CBO believes is achieved by private prescription benefit \nmanagers today. According to CBO, prescription drug prices would be \ncheaper under this bill. I would like my colleagues to know that should \nCBO's estimates of the higher savings by drug plans in this bill prove \nto overestimate prescription drug savings to seniors, I intend to \nintroduce legislation that will provide seniors with lower drug prices.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, CBO estimates that under the conference report \nseniors will be offered average greater savings under the Senate bill. \nThe price for prescription drugs will almost certainly be lower than \nthe prices seniors who do not have drug coverage pay today.\n\n\n                      company-owned life insurance\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to engage the chairman of the \nFinance Committee in a colloquy regarding pending committee action with \nrespect to the tax treatment of company-owned life insurance, COLI. Let \nme again express my appreciation for the efforts the chairman made on \nOctober 1 in securing the committee's unanimous consent to conduct a \nhearing on issues surrounding COLI and to mark up a COLI provision \nshortly thereafter.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I welcomed the opportunity the chairman provided in the \ncommittee hearing on COLI that occurred on October 23. By the end of\n\n[[Page S15887]]\n\nthat hearing, I believe committee members had a solid grasp of the \nlegitimate problems that still remain after the numerous legislative \nreforms of COLI over the last 20 years.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree. The hearing was informative and prepared the \ncommittee to come to an agreement on the reforms that ought to take \nplace.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Since the hearing, the chairman and I have worked toward \nthe development of a COLI proposal that would garner the support of the \nbroadest possible consensus in the committee and in the full Senate. I \nbelieve that last week we were close to an agreement on a proposal that \nresponded to every legitimate criticism of COLI heard during the course \nof the October 23 hearing.\n  I regret that the crush of Finance Committee legislation on the \nSenate floor in October and November has so far prevented the chairman \nfrom scheduling a markup. Unfortunately, it is now clear that the \nmarkup agreed to on October 1 cannot before the end of this session of \nCongress.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I share this regret. Let me pledge to have this markup \non a COLI provision at the Finance Committee's first opportunity in \n2004. I look forward to completing the action we began in October.\n\n\n                       CANCER CARE REIMBURSEMENT\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the Medicare conference report, which \nincludes a reform of the Part B drug payment system, includes \nsignificant payment reductions to providers of cancer care. I \nunderstand that Senator Grassley does not intend for these payment \nreductions to force efficient cancer clinics to close, jeopardizing \naccess to care for thousands of cancer patients.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That is correct, Senator. The Medicare conference \nagreement contains a number of significant reforms, which will save \nbillions of dollars in overpayments from Medicare covered drugs, while \nalso substantially increasing payments to physicians. I intend to \npreserve continued access to high-quality cancer care.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Many physicians depend on overpayments on Part B \ndrugs to make up for inadequate practice expenses. Is it the intent of \nthe Senator from Montana that physicians' practice expenses will be \nincreased sufficient to ensure access to care?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes, that is my intent. And I am committed to monitoring \nthis new payment system as it is implemented, in order to ensure access \nto high-quality cancer care.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Is it the intent that if this new payment system does \nnot suffice to ensure access to care, that you will revisit the system \nand revise the payment methodology?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Finally, it is my understanding that practice expense \nincreases for oncology are expected to be about $500 million in 2004, \n$600 million in 2005, and $560 million in 2006, as shown in the summary \nwhich I will submit for the Record. Is it your understanding that the \npayment expense increases will allow efficient cancer care providers to \ncontinue serving cancer patients and not close their doors?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes. I would also note that the Senator from Kansas, \nMr. Brownback, has some concerns over this issue. He has been a \nforceful advocate for the oncology community. And while I think the \npackage for cancer care is a fair one, I understand that he has some \nconcerns.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the chairman, both for his commitment to this \nlegislaiton and for keeping my staff and me informed throughout the \ndrafting of these provisions. I would note that from the time he first \nspoke on this issue during consideration of the tax bill the chairman \nhas expressed his intent to, ``ensure that seniors and their caregivers \nhave adequate payment for, and continued access to, important cancer \ntherapies.'' I would ask of the chairman, is it his intent that the \nchanges to outpatient drug reimbursement in Sections 303 and 304 of \nthis bill will not have a significantly adverse impact on access to \ncancer treatment?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Senator from Kansas is correct. My commitment to \ncancer patients has not changed. Indeed, according to estimates from \nthe Congressional Budget Office, this bill is expected to actually \nincrease net payments to oncologists in 2004. Also, CBO estimates that \nthe new Average Sales Price Reimbursement model, when coupled with the \nchanges in practice expense reimbursement, will amount to net \nreductions to cancer care of $4.2 billion over the next 10 years.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I would like to thank my friends for the progress that \nwas made in the conference. The bill passed by the Senate several \nmonths ago contained a net cut of $16 billion as a result of Part B \ndrug payment reforms. The reduction in the Conference report before us \nis now $11.4 billion.\n  However, I would also note to my friend from Iowa that the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services is given the discretion to reduce \nreimbursements further based on studies preformed by the Inspector \nGeneral of the Department. I would ask my friend if it was the intent \nof the conferees that any future adjustments to the reimbursements be \nbased on average of prices available to and paid by a wide range of \nphysicians in the marketplace.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank my friends.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent to print the following in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Medicare Conference Report Cancer Care Changes\n\n       Payments for Part B drugs are currently based on Average \n     Wholesale Price (AWP). The difference between the AWP and the \n     actual sales price often results in a profit to providers \n     when they administer such drugs. For example, an oncologist \n     may buy a chemotherapy agent, called doxirubicin, for about \n     $10.00, while Medicare's reimbursement for that same dose was \n     approximately $42.00, resulting in a profit to the physician \n     of $32.00. Because beneficiaries must pay 20% co-payments on \n     Medicare covered drugs, beneficiaries are paying $8.40 for a \n     dose of doxirubicin. That is 20% of the $42.00, rather than \n     20% of the $10.00 that the oncologist paid for the drug, \n     which is $2.00. The HHS Inspector General estimated that \n     inflated AWPs caused beneficiaries to pay an extra $175 \n     million in coinsurance in 2001.\n       The Medicare conference agreement reforms the Part B drug \n     payment system, saving $4.2 billion from the oncology \n     specialty over the 10-year period 2004-2013. This reform is \n     effected mostly by using an Average Sales Price (ASP) system, \n     which accounts for the true costs of these drugs. An \n     additional $7.3 billion is saved by applying these reforms to \n     other physician specialities. Most of these savings occur in \n     the later years of the budget window. Under the Medicare \n     conference agreement, oncologists will recieve an approximate \n     $100 million increase in payments in 2004, net of reductions \n     in reimbursement for Part B drugs.\n       Following is an estimated overview of what oncologists will \n     receive in increased practice expense payments, starting in \n     2004.\n       2004: Approximately $500 million increase in practice \n     expense (increase to oncology in 2004, net of drug payment \n     reductions, is about $100m).\n       2005: ASP+6%; approximately $600 million increase ($200m \n     for Average Sales Price+6%, $400m increase in practice \n     expense).\n       2006 and thereafter: ASP+6%; approximate $560 million \n     increase ($200m for Average Sales Price+6%, $360m increase in \n     practice expense).\n\n\n      FORMULARIES FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES LIVING WITH HIV/AIDS\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am concerned about the impact the \nMedicare conference report will have on low-income Medicare \nbeneficiaries who are living with HIV/AIDS. I have heard a lot of \nopposition to this bill from the HIV/AIDS community. My concern is with \ntheir access to drug treatment therapy under the Medicare prescription \ndrug benefit. Is it your understanding that the Medicare conference \nreport will not prevent low-income Medicare beneficiaries who are \nliving with HIV/AIDS from getting all the drugs they need through \nMedicare Part D?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct, Senator. One of the things I am \nparticularly proud about in this bill is the strong beneficiary \nprotections that will ensure that all Medicare beneficiaries get access \nto the appropriate medicine they need. You know, Senator Grassley, that \nthere are certain diseases and conditions--like AIDS, and epilepsy--\nwhere having access to just the right medicine is especially important.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I did know that, and I know that certain mental \nillnesses also fall in that category. This bill contains a number of \nprotections for people who need exactly the right medicine for them.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Victims of HIV/AIDS are somewhat unique since the\n\n[[Page S15888]]\n\ntreatment for HIV/AIDS varies with the individual. To be clear, no low-\nincome Medicare beneficiaries who have HIV/AIDS will be denied access \nto the drugs they need in Medicare Part D?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Exactly. The bill asks the US Pharmocopeia to develop \nmodel formularies with therapeutic classes that can't be gamed. Then we \nrequire drug plans to offer at least two drugs in each therapeutic \nclass. And for drugs that treat AIDS, epilepsy, or mental illness, we \nwould expect that plans would carry all clinically appropriate drugs.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree. And I am pleased with the backup protections \nin this bill. That if a plan doesn't carry or doesn't treat as \npreferred a drug needed by, say, a person with AIDS, a simple note from \na doctor explaining the medical need for that particular drug could get \nthat drug covered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Will that apply to all covered drugs required by a \nperson with HIV/AIDS and in all cases?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct. These beneficiary protections are \ncrucial for these vulnerable Medicare beneficiaries. I would expect \nthat the Secretary will take into account their special medication \nneeds when he writes regulations on this provision and when he is \nevaluating plan bids. If a plan can't adequately ensure all of the \nproper medication for beneficiaries living with HIV/AIDS, epilepsy, and \ncertain mental illnesses, that plan should not be doing business with \nMedicare.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree with my good friend.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would like to quote from a letter I received from \nSecretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson, the full text of \nwhich I will include for the Record. Secretary Thompson says, ``I would \nnot approve a plan for participation in the Part D program if I found \nthat the design of the plan and its benefits, including any formulary \nand any tiered formulary structure, would substantially discourage \nenrollment in the plan by any group of individuals. If a plan, however, \ncomplies with the USP guidelines then it would be considered to be in \ncompliance with this requirement. Thus, if a plan limited drugs for a \ngroup of patients (individuals living with HIV/AIDS) it would not be \npermitted to participate in Part D.'' Secretary Thompson goes on to \nsay, ``Under the Conference Report, the beneficiary protections in the \nMedicare drug benefit are more comprehensive than the protections now \nrequired of State Medicaid programs. This will ensure access to a wide \nrange of drugs. For example, there are extensive information \nrequirements so that beneficiaries will know the drugs the plan covers \nbefore they enroll in the plan. Beneficiaries can also appeal to obtain \ncoverage for a drug that is not on their plan's formulary if the \nprescribing physician determines that the formulary drug is not as \neffective for the individual as another drug, or if there are adverse \neffects. As a result, access to all drugs in a category or class will \nbe available to a beneficiary when needed.''\n  Is this your understanding as well?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Absolutely.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the distinguished Senators from Montana and \nIowa.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the above-referenced letter in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the \n           Assistant Secretary for Legislation,\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: Recently, you have expressed \n     concern with the Conference Report over access to drugs for \n     individuals living with HIV/AIDS. Your major concern appears \n     to be whether or not individuals living with HIV/AIDS will \n     have access to all drugs within a therapeutic class under the \n     Conference Report and whether or not a Prescription Drug Plan \n     (PDP) could limit the number of drugs that are covered within \n     a therapeutic class. You also expressed concern that dual \n     eligible individuals will lose the coverage that is currently \n     available to them in Medicaid if they enroll in any of the \n     new Medicare drug plans.\n       Let me assure you that in the Conference Report there are \n     significant safeguards in place for the development of PDP \n     formularies to ensure a wide range of drugs will be available \n     to Medicare beneficiaries. These plans will have the option \n     to use formularies but they are not required to do so. If a \n     plan uses a formulary, it must include at least two drugs in \n     each therapeutic category or class, unless the category or \n     class only has one drug.\n       I will be requesting the U.S. Pharmacopoeia (USP), a \n     nationally recognized clinically based independent \n     organization, to develop, in consultation with other \n     interested parties, a model guideline of therapeutic \n     categories and classes. In designing this model it is \n     essential that categories and classes be established to \n     assure that the most appropriate drugs are included on a \n     plan's formulary. I am confident they will design the \n     categories and classes to meet the needs of patients; USP's \n     work in clinically based and patient oriented.\n       Plans will also use pharmacy and therapeutic committees \n     that consist of practicing physicians and pharmacists to \n     design their formularies. The committees will be independent \n     and free of conflict with respect to the plan. They will have \n     expertise in care for the elderly and in individuals with \n     disabilities. The committees will also use both a clinical \n     and scientific basis for making its decisions relating to \n     formularies.\n       Further, I would not approve a plan for participation in \n     the Part D program if I found that the design of the plan and \n     its benefits, including any formulary and any tiered \n     formulary structure, would substantially discourage \n     enrollment in the plan by any group of individuals. If a \n     plan, however, complies with the USP guidelines then it would \n     be considered to be in compliance with this requirement. \n     Thus, if a plan limited drugs for a group of patients \n     (individuals living with HIV/AIDS) it would not be \n     permitted to participate in Part D.\n       Under the Conference Report, the beneficiary protections in \n     the Medicare drug benefit are more comprehensive than the \n     protections now required of State Medicaid programs. This \n     will ensure access to a wide range of drugs. For example, \n     there are extensive information requirements so that \n     beneficiaries will know the drugs the plan covers before they \n     enroll in the plan. Beneficiaries can also appeal to obtain \n     coverage for a drug that is not on their plan's formulary if \n     the prescribing physician determines that the formulary drug \n     is not as effective for the individual as another drug, or if \n     there are adverse effects. As a result, access to all drugs \n     in a category or class will be available to a beneficiary \n     when needed.\n       On the other hand, because of the optional nature of the \n     Medicaid drug benefit today, States can drop their drug \n     benefit entirely, as well as restrict access to their drug \n     plan through preferred drug lists or prior authorization \n     processes. According to the IG, from 1997 to 2001, Medicaid \n     expenditures for prescription drugs grew at more than twice \n     the rate of total Medicaid spending. This has put extreme \n     pressures on state budgets and has led to Medicaid coverage \n     restrictions for drugs and the use of cost control measures \n     that will not be used in the Part D program.\n       For example, eighteen States contain Medicaid drug costs by \n     limiting the number of prescriptions filled in a specific \n     time period, limiting the maximum daily dosage or limiting \n     the frequency of dispensing a drug. Some states also limit \n     the number of refills. In addition, six States have pharmacy \n     lock-in programs, which require beneficiaries to fill their \n     prescriptions in one designated pharmacy.\n       The new Medicaid benefit will not result in a loss of \n     coverage for dual eligibles. In fact, the Conference Report \n     provides generous coverage to dual eligibles. The Report \n     preserves the universality of Medicare for all eligible \n     beneficiaries including those dually eligible for both \n     Medicare and Medicaid. Unlike Medicaid, the new Medicare Part \n     D benefit will provide a guaranteed benefit to all eligible \n     seniors--a benefit they can count on without fear of loss of \n     benefits when State budgets become tight.\n       Dual eligibles, who currently have full Medicaid benefits, \n     will automatically be given generous subsidies and will pay \n     no premium, no deductible and only minimal cost-sharing \n     regardless of their actual income, even though it can be \n     higher than 135 percent of the Federal poverty level in many \n     cases.\n       In addition, full dual eligibles with incomes under 100 \n     percent of poverty will pay no premiums, no deductibles, and \n     reduced copayments of $1 for generic and other multiple \n     source preferred drugs, and $3 for all other drugs. Note \n     under current Medicaid regulations, States can choose to \n     increase coinsurance to 5%. This is clearly more than what \n     will be permitted for dual eligibles under the new Medicare \n     benefit.\n       Finally, dual eligibles residing in nursing homes and other \n     institutions only have a small personal needs allowance. \n     Under Medicare, they will be exempt from copayments \n     altogether.\n       I hope that this addresses all of your concerns. I look \n     forward to continuing to work with you on this and other \n     issues related to Medicare and Medicaid. Please call me if \n     you have any further concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Tommy G. Thompson.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President. I have been listening to the debate over \nthe past few days, and I think that a common theme on both sides of the \naisle has been this is not a perfect bill. There are those on this side \nof the aisle who rightly say that this bill does not go as far as it \ncould; that it doesn't\n\n[[Page S15889]]\n\nfocus enough of the assistance on low-income seniors and could do more \nto keep employers from reducing or eliminating benefits for their \nemployees. Others have raised concerns about the fact that there is a \n$1,400 ``doughnut hole'' and an overly restrictive assets test that \nwill mean less help for too many Americans. There are those on the \nother side of the aisle that have rightly said that this bill does not \ndo enough to address the long-term solvency issues facing Medicare. \nThey contend that this $400 billion expansion, without making \nadditional structural reforms, puts Medicare on an unsure footing for \nthe future. It is for these reasons that Members on both sides of the \naisle have said they will vote against this bill.\n  Many maxims have been used over the past few days to describe the \nchoice before us. Some have said, ``A bird in the hand is worth two in \nthe bush.'' Others have said, ``Let us not make the perfect be the \nenemy of the good.'' Still others have said, ``Something is better than \nnothing.'' I have spent the last 25 years in public service, and if \nthere is one thing I have learned, it is that a true compromise is one \nfrom which no one side walks away completely happy. If there is anyone \nwho knows that lesson better than I, it is the senior Senator from \nLouisiana, Senator Breaux. I have often said that if there is a deal to \nbe had, Senator Breaux will find it. He has an amazing talent for \nbringing two sides together in a way that preserves the key principles \nof both. I think he has succeeded in doing that again here.\n  Going into the conference, Democrats insisted that the final bill \nmust include the following: meaningful assistance to low income \nbeneficiaries; providing Federal assistance to Medicare seniors on \nMedicaid, dual eligibles; strong Government fallbacks; and real \nincentives for employers to retain coverage. The conference agreement \nrepresents major victories in all four of these key areas.\n  First, and perhaps most importantly, beneficiaries with low incomes \nwill get immediate assistance in paying for their drugs. The premium, \ndeductible and coverage gap would be waived for people earning up to \n$12,123 a year, $16,362 per couple. Those making up to $13,470, $18,180 \nper couple will not have to pay a premium or be subject to a coverage \ngap and would only have a $50 deductible. What this means in real terms \nis that one-third of all Medicare beneficiaries, over 200,000 of which \nare from my State, will get immediate assistance to drugs at little to \nno cost to themselves. These are people who today have no help.\n  This bill also provides $88 billion in tax incentives to employers to \nencourage retaining existing retiree drug coverage. CBO estimates those \nincentives will greatly diminish the number of employers who will \nreduce or eliminate their coverage because of passage of this bill. It \nensures that all beneficiaries will have access to drug coverage by \nproviding a strong government fallback in the event that private plans \ndo not provide adequate coverage in any particular region. Finally, it \nprovides meaningful support to Medicare providers so that they can \ncontinue to care for our Nation's elderly.\n  These are major victories. I am, however, disappointed by some of the \nprovisions that were ultimately included in this bill, most especially \nthe asset test. I understand that the asset test in this bill is \nfashioned after asset tests used to determine a person's eligibility \nfor Social Security Income (SSI) and Medicaid. I understand that it is, \nin fact, three times as generous as the asset tests used by those \nprograms. Yet, in my view, further restricting eligibility for vital \nGovernment programs so as to separate out the near poor from the poor \nis a precedent that should be abolished, not furthered. I think the \nAmerican public would be shocked to learn how restrictive these asset \ntests are.\n  In this bill, if a senior whose income is less than $12,123 a year \nhas more than $6,000 in assets, they will no longer qualify for \nassistance with their premiums or deductibles. The proponents of the \nasset test claim that they are necessary to ensure that a person \ndoesn't claim to have an income of $12,123 and at the same time have a \nvacation home in Florida and $50,000 in stocks. But these are not the \npeople that these asset tests affect. Who they end up affecting is a \nwidow who is living on her husband's $600 a month Social Security \ncheck, but just so happens to have a $10,000 life insurance policy or \nhome full of furniture valued at $3,000. That is just not fair. While I \nam not able to change this policy here, I do intent to work to change \nit later.\n  Ten years have passed since this body was first presented with the \nneed to reform Medicare. We have long recognized that the ways of \nmedicine have changed. Medications and outpatient services have taken \nthe place of intrusive surgeries and long-term hospitalization. We know \nthat Medicare has not keep pace with those changes nor does it reflect \nthe current needs of our seniors. Over the past 10 years, we have \nassembled task forces, engaged in numerous studies, held countless \nhearings and drafted several legislative proposals, but we have never \ngotten to where we are today, at the brink of passing a bill that will \nput us on the path of making reform a reality.\n  I think we must act now. In a time of rising deficits, it is unlikely \nwe will have $400 billion or the political will to make these \nimprovements any time in the near future. The seniors in my State are \ntired of waiting for the perfect bill. If we do not pass this bill this \nyear, who knows how much more time will pass before we get to this \npoint. It certainly won't be next year. If we had not reduced our \nsurpluses by giving out tax cuts, perhaps we could have done more, but \nthere is no sense in wondering what could have been. What we need to \nfocus on now is what can be.\n  One year ago, I was in Louisiana running for re-election and I \npromised the people of Louisiana that while I would be with the \nPresident some of the time and I would be with the Democratic caucus \nsome of the time, no matter what, I would be with the people of \nLouisiana 100 percent of the time. This bill is good for Louisiana. \nUltimately, that is why I support it.\n  In Louisiana, one out of every two seniors has no prescription drug \ncoverage. Today, 72-year-old Ethel Cernigliaro of Homer is one of them. \nWith only her $727 a month Social Security check to depend on, Mrs. \nCernigliaro finds a way to pay her utilities, buy groceries and still \ncover the $300 and more she pays each month for prescriptions. At this \npoint, Mrs. Cernigliaro doesn't know all of the details of how this \nMedicare reform will help her, but she is certain of one thing: It has \ngot to be better than what she has now. ``I've been following it \nclosely, and it is certainly encouraging to know someone is trying to \ndo something,'' she said. This bill means seniors like Mrs. Cernigliaro \nwill no longer be without assistance for the drugs they need to \nmaintain their quality of life and health. She and the 200,000 seniors \nlike her will, in most cases, pay no more than $5 a prescription for \ntheir medications. Because of this reform, no senior citizen in our \nState will be without some level of coverage for prescriptions.\n  What's more, this bill will deliver $551 million over the next 10 \nyears in emergency assistance for Louisiana's hospitals, most of which \nare struggling to keep their doors open. It will provide $156 million \nin much needed assistance to Louisiana's doctors. Without this \nassistance, these doctors could no longer afford to care for Medicare \npatients. It will provide $25 billion in help for our Nation's rural \ncommunities, many of which are in Louisiana. This represents the \nlargest, most comprehensive rural package ever passed by Congress. \nFinally, this bill provides for much-needed prevention services, \nincluding screening for heart disease and diabetes, which could have \nhelped to save the lives of the nearly 10,000 Louisiana seniors who \ndied of these diseases last year.\n  If this bill does not pass, the people of my State will go yet \nanother year without these important interventions. I, for one, cannot \nask them to wait. Since Medicare was first passed into law in 1965, it \nhas been amended and modified hundreds of times. This comprehensive \nreform package is not the first, nor will it be the last. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues in the months and years to come \nto ensure that the Medicare program, and this new prescription drug \nbenefit, will be all that it promises to be and more.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, a vote in favor of this legislation, which \nis designed to add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare, is a very \nclose call for\n\n[[Page S15890]]\n\nme. There are some positive elements of this bill, and there are also \nsome flaws about which I am very concerned. In weighing the good and \nthe bad, however, I have decided to support this bill.\n  The final legislation will provide very generous prescription drug \ncoverage for about one-third of the lowest income senior citizens and \ndisabled Medicare beneficiaries who live in North Dakota. For those \nMedicare beneficiaries whose incomes are below 150 percent of the \npoverty level, they will receive a benefit that will cover nearly 95 \npercent of their drug costs.\n  However, for senior citizens with incomes above 150 percent of the \npoverty level, this prescription drug benefit will not be very \nattractive at all, in my judgment. There is a $35 per month premium \nthat will increase over time, a $250 deductible that will grow to $445 \nby 2013, and a period of time when seniors' drug expenditures reach \n$2,250 and seniors will still be paying premiums but have no drug \ncoverage at all. Only after spending a total of more than $5,100 would \nMedicare beneficiaries receive catastrophic coverage of 95 percent for \nprescription drugs.\n  If this prescription drug benefit was a mandatory program, I would \nvote against it. Because it is optional, I think many senior citizens \nwith incomes above 150 percent of poverty will take a look at the \nbenefit and decide it is not worth it. The one-third of our senior \ncitizens with the lowest incomes will benefit from it.\n  In addition to providing generous coverage for the lowest income \nsenior citizens, the other feature of this bill that I strongly support \nare the steps it takes to offer some fairness in Medicare's payments \nfor rural hospitals, doctors and other health care providers.\n  Hospitals and physicians in rural States have found that their \nreimbursement rates under Medicare have put them at a serious \ndisadvantage. If these lower reimbursement rates were to continue, the \nquality and access to health care delivered to rural citizens would \ndiminish. Rural hospitals have to compete for the same doctors and \nnurses and use the same sophisticated medical equipment as urban \nhospitals, and yet their reimbursement rates have been dramatically \nlower. As a result, many of our North Dakota hospitals are in real \nfinancial trouble. This legislation begins the process of establishing \nsome fairness in those reimbursement rates, and I strongly support \nthat.\n  But there are also a number of provisions in this bill that I think \nare a mistake. First of all, this bill lacks provisions that would \nbegin to contain the rising costs of prescription drugs. That is a \ndramatic failure. For most senior citizens, the problem with \nprescription drugs is the steep rise in the prices of those \nprescription drugs. Unfortunately, the majority party bowed to the \npressure of the pharmaceutical industry and failed to put any real cost \ncontainment in this bill. That is a serious mistake.\n  In addition, this bill includes provisions that have nothing to do \nwith adding a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program but \nthat have the potential to do harm. The Health Savings Accounts \nestablished by this bill are at best a costly tax shelter for the \nwealthy and at worst could drive up costs for the traditional insurance \nmarket. Likewise, this bill is cluttered up with subsidies to private \ninsurers and a phony demonstration program that adds additional costs \nto Medicare and could undermine the Medicare program itself if these \nprovisions are not adjusted in the future.\n  As I sifted through all of these provisions, I concluded that \nproviding nearly total prescription drug coverage for one-third of our \nsenior citizens with the lowest incomes is a very important objective \nto achieve. Add to that the improvement in the reimbursement rates to \nstrengthen rural hospitals and health care providers, and I believe \nthat these two features warranted support for the bill.\n  Again, this bill is a close call because I think those who have \nwritten it have created an optional program that is sufficiently \nunattractive to many senior citizens that they will elect not to sign \nup for this program.\n  My hope is that we can lock in the support in this bill for the \nnearly one-third of the senior citizens with the lowest incomes, \naddress the reimbursement inequity for rural hospitals and doctors, and \nthen come back in future legislation and do what should have been done \nwith the rest of this bill.\n  That is, we need to add some real cost containment, fix the drug \nbenefit so that senior citizens aren't paying premiums while they're \ngetting no coverage, and dump the extraneous provisions that have \nnothing to do with adding prescription drug coverage to Medicare.\n  In summary, I am not pleased with this choice, but I know that if we \ndo not commit the $400 billion that we have now set aside for Medicare \nprescription drug coverage in the coming 10 years, that funding may not \nbe available in the future. And I know that we may not get another \nopportunity to fix the reimbursement rates for rural hospitals in the \nnear future.\n  So I will vote for this bill, but I do so with some real regret \nbecause this bill could have been so much better.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I oppose the Medicare Prescription Drug \nand Modernization Act.\n  I remind my colleagues that we have a national debt that exceeds $6.9 \ntrillion. The legislation currently before us is part of a budget \nresolution and economic plan that will cause our debt to double over \nthe next 10 years. Make no mistake about it, we will borrow every penny \nto pay this $394.3 billion bill. How ironic--we are going to borrow \nmoney from Social Security to pay for seniors health care. And what do \nwe get in return? Spotty drug coverage for senior citizens, millions of \nAmericans who will lose their existing coverage, massive subsidies for \nHMOs, the first step toward the destruction of Medicare as we know it, \nand a larger fiscal noose around the neck of future generations. We can \ndo much better and should go back to the drawing board.\n  Instead of providing seniors with the stable and affordable benefit \nthey deserve, this bill forces seniors to maneuver a complex maze of \npremiums, deductibles and copayments for benefits that contain huge \ngaps in coverage. On top of their premiums, which will vary from region \nto region and plan to plan, seniors will get no help for the first $250 \nof their drug costs, pay 25 percent of costs from $251 to $2,250, pay \nall the costs from $2,251 to at least $5,100, and then pay a fifth of \ncosts above $5,100. With a breakeven point of $810, many healthier \nMedicare beneficiaries will opt not to participate. Because of the \n$2,850 coverage gap, many of the sickest patients will have to ration \ncare for months because even though they continue to pay premiums, they \nreceive no government assistance. Furthermore, seniors better not get \ntoo comfortable with their prescription drug coverage. Nearly 3 million \nof them with retiree coverage, including 39,000 residents of South \nCarolina will lose their coverage. This bill could force those who \nparticipate in the new Medicare drug benefit to move in between three \nseparate plans, with three separate formularies, in 3 years.\n  It should come as no surprise that the authors of this convoluted \nmess and Karl Rove have decided to wait until after the 2004 election \nbefore this new benefit starts up and Medicare beneficiaries see what \nthey are in for. Conferees could have taken a number of steps to \naddress these deficiencies. Instead, they denied the government the \nability to negotiate lower drug prices on behalf of all Medicare \nbeneficiaries. This will impose a higher cost on both the taxpayers who \nfoot this bill and the Medicare beneficiaries who will have to make \nhigher copayments. They also created a $12 billion slush fund the \ngovernment can use to entice private plans to participate against \ntraditional Medicare and diverted $6.7 billion from the amounts saved \nby companies that will drop retiree coverage to create tax shelters for \nwealthy individuals. These funds could have been more appropriately \nspent providing incentives for companies to continue retiree coverage \nor reducing the size of the ``doughnut.''\n  I also believe this bill is the first step toward the dismantling of \nMedicare. The ``premiums support'' demonstration contained in this \nlegislation opens the door to the privatization of Medicare. Seniors in \nat least six parts of the country will be forced to either pay higher \npremium to remain in the traditional Medicare system or move into\n\n[[Page S15891]]\n\nan HMO. This is unacceptable. Furthermore, this legislation provides an \nuneven playing field between traditional Medicare and private plans. I \nhave always felt that if a private plan can offer a better benefit \npackage to a beneficiary at an equal or lower cost, then beneficiaries \nshould have the choice of which plan they want to participate in. This \nbill dramatically slants the playing field in favor of private plans. \nIn addition to a 9 percent higher payment, private plans will have \naccess to a $12 billion fund to further underwrite their costs. These \nactions undermine the traditional Medicare system generations of our \nseniors have come to depend on.\n  The flimsy prescription drug benefit and long-term damage done to \nMedicare contained in this legislation does not warrant its high price \ntag. I encourage my colleagues to defeat this bill, take up and pass S. \n1926 to improve reimbursement for doctors, hospitals and rural \nproviders, and continue to work toward a meaningful drug benefit.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, since Medicare was established in 1965, \npeople are living longer and living better. Today Medicare covers more \nthan 40 million Americans, including 35 million over the age of 65 and \nnearly 6 million younger adults with permanent disabilities.\n  Congress now has the opportunity to modernize this important Federal \nentity to create a 21st century Medicare Program that offers \ncomprehensive coverage for pharmaceutical drugs and improves the \nMedicare delivery system.\n  The Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act would make \navailable a voluntary Medicare prescription plan for all seniors. If \nenacted, Medicare beneficiaries would have access to a discount card \nfor prescription drug purchases starting in 2004. Projected savings \nfrom cards for consumers would range between 10 to 25 percent. A $600 \nsubsidy would be applied to the card, offering additional assistance \nfor low-income beneficiaries defined as 160 percent or below the \nFederal poverty level. Effective January 1, 2006, a new optional \nMedicare prescription drug benefit would be established under Medicare \nPart D.\n  This bill has the potential to make a dramatic difference for \nmillions of Americans living with lower incomes and chronic health care \nneeds. Low-income Medicare beneficiaries, who make up 44 percent of all \nMedicare beneficiaries, would be provided with prescription drug \ncoverage with minimal out-of-pocket costs. In Pennsylvania, this \nbenefit would be further enhanced by including the Prescription \nAssistance Contract for the Elderly, PACE, program which will work in \ncoordination with Medicare to provide increased cost savings for low-\nincome beneficiaries.\n  For Medical services, Medicare beneficiaries will have the freedom to \nremain in traditional fee-for-service Medicare, or enroll in a Health \nMaintenance Organization, HMO, or a Preferred Provider Organization, \nPPO, also called Medicare Advantage, These programs offer beneficiaries \na wide choice of health care providers, while also coordinating health \ncare effectively, especially for those with multiple chronic \nconditions. Medicare Advantage health plans would be required to offer \nat least the standard drug benefit, available through traditional fee-\nfor-service Medicare.\n  We already know that there are many criticisms directed to this bill \nat various levels. Many would like to see the prescription drug program \ncover all of the costs without deductibles and without co-pays. There \nhas been allocated in our budget plan $400 billion for prescription \ndrug coverage. That is, obviously, a very substantial sum of money. \nThere are a variety of formulas which could be worked out to utilize \nthis funding. The current plan, depending upon levels of income has \nseveral levels of coverage from a deductible to almost full coverage \nunder a catastrophic illness. One area of concern is the so-called \n``donut hole'' which requires a recipient to pay the entire cost of \ndrug coverage.\n  As I have reviewed these projections and analyses, it is hard to say \nwhere the line ought to be drawn. It is a value judgment as to what \ndeductibles and what the co-pays ought to be and for whom. Though I am \nseriously troubled by the so-called donut hole, it is calculated to \nencourage people to take the medical care they really need, and be \naffordable for those with lower levels of income. Then, when the costs \nmove into the catastrophic illness range, the plan would pay for nearly \nall of the medical costs.\n  I am pleased that this bill contains a number of improvements for the \nproviders of health care to Medicare beneficiaries. Physicians who are \nscheduled to receive cuts in 2004 and 2005 will receive a 1.5 percent \nincrease over that time. Moreover, rural health care providers will \nreceive much needed increases in Medicare reimbursement through raises \nto disproportionate share hospitals and standardized amounts, and a \ndecrease in the labor share in the Medicare reimbursement formula. \nHospitals across Pennsylvania will benefit from upgrades to the \nhospital market basket update and increase in the indirect medical \neducation. Furthermore, the bill will provide $900 million for \nhospitals in metropolitan statistical areas with high labor costs due \nto their close proximity to urban areas that provide a \ndisproportionately high wage. These hospitals may apply for wage index \nreclassification for three years staring in 2004.\n  I would not that I do have concerns with this legislation with regard \nto oncological Medicare reimbursement and the premium support \ndemonstration project for Medicare Part B coverage. Proposed reductions \nin the average wholesale price for oncological pharmaceuticals may have \na grave effect on oncologists' ability to provide cancer care to \nMedicare Beneficiaries. Every Medicare beneficiary suffering from \ncancer should have access to oncologists that they desperately need. I \nwill pay close attention to the effects that this provision has on the \nquality and availability of cancer care for beneficiaries and \noncologists' ability to provide that care. Further, the premium support \ndemonstration project for Medicare Part B premiums poses a concern. \nSome metropolitan areas may face up to a five percent higher premium \nfor fee-for-service care than neighboring areas. While these provisions \nremain troublesome, we cannot let the perfect become the enemy of the \ngood with this piece of legislation.\n  The Medicare Prescription Drug legislation has been worked on for \nmany years. I believe this bill will provide a significant improvement \nto the vital health care seniors so urgently need. I congratulate the \nmembers of the conference committee including majority leader Frist, \nSenator Grassley, Chairman of the Finance Committee, and the ranking \nmember, Senator Baucus, for the outstanding work which they have done \non an extraordinarily complex bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, seniors need and deserve a stronger \nprescription drug bill than this one.\n  The creation of the Medicare program in 1965 was a tremendous \naccomplishment. With Medicare, older Americans would never again have \nto face a terrifying future with no health care coverage. And since \nthat time, millions of elderly and disabled citizens have come to know \nand trust the quality health care that Medicare ensures them. But \nMedicare's success is marred by one significant factor: the lack of \ncoverage for prescription drugs. When Medicare was created, \nprescription drugs did not hold the pivotal role that they now have in \nhealth care treatment and maintenance. Medical science has advanced \nsince Medicare's charter was enacted, and senior and disabled Americans \nhave been waiting a long time for Congress to remedy this gaping hole \nin coverage.\n  We need a meaningful prescription drug benefit under Medicare, and \nmany of us have been pushing for years to accomplish that. This \nmovement has steadily grown, and for 6 years we in this body have been \ndebating and working toward this goal. In June of this year the Senate \npassed a bi-partisan prescription drug bill that I supported. I \nsupported that bill--even though I thought it was weaker than what we \nneed--because it was a solid start. And that is why it gives me grave \nconcern to see the direction this conference report has taken.\n  We have before us eleven hundred pages--which we have had little more \nthan 3 days to examine--that run far afield of the goal of adding a \nprescription drug benefit to Medicare. It concerns me that some of the \nprovisions in\n\n[[Page S15892]]\n\nthis bill--provisions which were never a part of the bill I supported \nin June--will do more harm than good. I know that many of my colleagues \nworked long and hard to produce this bill. I respect their efforts and \ntheir best intentions, but Vermonters and Americans need and deserve \nfar better than this. We passed a decent bipartisan bill once before \nthis year. I know that we can do better than this compromise before us, \nand that is why I will be voting no. Instead of trying to rush through \neleven hundred pages so that we can go home for Thanksgiving and \nadjourn for the year, I think that we need to keep working on this \nimportant issue until we get it right.\n  I am concerned that the measure before us moves Medicare down the \nroad of privatization and does not adequately protect the access to the \nprescription drug benefit of rural seniors in traditional Medicare. I \nam concerned that fewer low-income seniors will be helped with their \ncosts, and it troubles me that the need to bring down the ever-\nescalating costs of prescription drugs has not been addressed in this \nbill.\n  Under the conference agreement, a significant amount of money--$12 \nbillion--is set aside in a slush fund for the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to entice insurance companies into Medicare. The \nconference agreement also includes a proposal to experiment with \nprivatization of the Medicare program in at least six areas of the \ncountry. This troubling provision could impose increased premiums for \nmillions of seniors in traditional Medicare, potentially forcing them \nto leave the program that they know and trust. And making this \nexperiment even worse, the Federal Government will overpay private \nplans--putting Medicare at an unfair disadvantage--to offer the same \nbenefits that traditional Medicare covers for less. Why are all of \nthese extra payments necessary? If the private insurance model is so \neffective and efficient, why do we need to pay them more than we pay \nfor traditional Medicare? No one can credibly argue that doing this \nmakes sense.\n  The reason that we needed Medicare in 1965, and the reason that we \nwill continue to need Medicare in the future, is because the insurance \nmodel fails elderly and disabled people. It is not all that \ncomplicated. As we get older we inevitably get sick and we need to take \nmore trips to the doctor and to the hospital to manage and maintain our \nhealth. This costs money, and the insurance companies know that they \nlose money when the bills have to be paid not occasionally, but \nfrequently. Instead of sending billions of dollars to insurance \ncompanies, it is far better to use those resources to strengthen \nMedicare and to create a stronger and more reliable prescription drug \nbenefit run directly by Medicare.\n  In the earlier Senate bill, I accepted that we could try this private \ndelivery model for the prescription drug benefit because rural seniors \nin traditional Medicare--this is all of the seniors in Vermont, by the \nway, because private plans have chosen not to operate in our rural \nstate--would be assured of having a choice of two stand-alone drug \nplans. And if those two plans did not exist in Vermont's region, then \nVermonters in traditional Medicare would be guaranteed access to a \nstandard government fall back plan. Unfortunately, this essential \nprotection was weakened in the conference agreement. Instead, \nVermonters will be considered to have adequate choice--and therefore no \naccess to the government fallback plan--if there is only one stand-\nalone plan and one managed care plan. What kind of choice is that? The \nchoice that Vermonters in traditional Medicare will have under that \nscenario is either to sign up for that one stand-alone plan that \nhappens to be offered, or to forgo the new prescription drug benefit \naltogether. That doesn't sound like much of a choice at all.\n  I am also concerned about the impact that this bill will have on low-\nincome Medicare beneficiaries. It is true that the bill provides \ngenerous subsidies to low-income seniors, but the earlier Senate bill \ncovered more people: almost one million Americans who would have had \naccess to a subsidy under that bill will not receive help with their \npremiums, deductible, and cost sharing under this bill. Three million \nmore Americans will not qualify for help because they have minimal \nsavings and other assets. In Vermont, that amounts to about seven \nthousand people who will be worse off under this agreement than under \nthe Senate bill. Furthermore, thousands of Vermonters who currently \nhave prescription drug coverage under the Medicaid program could end up \nwith less generous coverage under this plan.\n  The real winner under this agreement is the drug industry. Many \nexpress concern over the high cost of creating a Medicare prescription \ndrug benefit. I would suggest that we could have done something very \nsimple to bring down the cost: We could have used Medicare's market \npower to negotiate lower prices for the medicines the program will be \nbuying. Instead, this compromise agreement actually prohibits this \ncommon sense approach to cost containment. Thanks to objections by the \ndrug industry, provisions designed to speed low-cost generic drugs to \nmarket were weakened in the conference agreement. And last, but \ncertainly not least, the drug industry prevailed in their efforts to \nblock a provision to allow Americans access to lower-priced medicines \nfrom Canada. This is unacceptable. A majority in the senate voted to \nallow re-importation and the House of Representatives overwhelmingly \nsupported a strong re-importation provision. Somehow, the conference \nagreement is weaker than either provision passed in either body. How \nlong do we intend to force Americans to continue to pay the highest \nprices in the world for their indispensable medications?\n  It is wrong to have hijacked this bill as a locomotive to pull the \ndrug industry's baggage. House leaders have taken the industry's side \nover consumers' interests on issue after issue. They have given the \nindustry a veto over giving Medicare the market leverage to bring down \ncosts. They have done the drug industry's bidding by blocking drug \nreimportation. It is wrong to pad the drug industry's wallets at the \nexpense of the seniors of Vermont and the Nation.\n  I remain concerned that cuts in payments for cancer drugs and \nservices--estimated to be in excess of $11 billion over the 10-year \nbudget window--threaten access to cancer care across the nation and \nparticularly in rural area. And though the conference agreement does \nreduce the number of retirees likely to lose their employer-based \ncoverage as a result of passing this bill from the Senate level, the \nCongressional Budget Office still estimates that close to three million \nretirees will lose their coverage. That number is still far too high \nand could affect thousands of Vermonters.\n  Finally, I question why we set aside $6 billion--money that could be \nspent to reduce the troubling gaps in coverage under the prescription \ndrug benefit--to create Health Savings Accounts that have nothing to do \nwith Medicare and that many analysts predict will boost the costs of \ncomprehensive employer-based health insurance across the country.\n  I do credit this bill with some good provisions to provide increased \npayments to doctors and hospitals, particularly in rural areas. I fully \nsupport these provisions, but their inclusion cannot overcome the \nproblems in the rest of the bill.\n  I hope that I am proven wrong about the impact that this bill will \nhave on the Medicare program and on the help, or lack thereof, it will \nprovide to Medicare beneficiaries. I think we can do better and that we \nmust do better. As seniors learn over the course of the next 2-years \nwhat kind of coverage they will be getting--as they see how complex the \nsystem ad the benefits are--I predict that they will agree and that we \nwill be returning to the drawing board very soon on prescription drugs.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, thank you for recognizing me and letting \nme speak for a couple minutes.\n  I wish to thank one individual. We wonder from time to time about a \nbill of this magnitude. We want to be careful when we mention Senators \nwe want to thank and are grateful toward. But I don't have any \nreluctance on this one, having been part of the process, having been \npart of our distinguished majority leader's life in the Senate before \nhe was majority leader. There is no doubt in my mind when he came to \nthe Senate and learned about Medicare, he made a commitment that he was \ngoing to be part of fixing it.\n\n[[Page S15893]]\n\n  I watched this fantastic, talented man devote his energy and his \nenthusiasm, put the best people one can imagine around him, and I \nwatched him lead the maneuvering, the activities, and the thinking, and \nI watched him learn the intricacies of this bill.\n  I believe if it is done right, history will have a lot of people we \ncan thank for the Medicare modernization bill and the prescription drug \nbill for our seniors, but I think there will be one person who will \nstand out, and it will be the distinguished senior Senator from \nTennessee, the majority leader.\n  He has not been here very long. I remember when he arrived. He joined \nthe Budget Committee, the committee that I chaired, and he was at the \nvery end of the committee because he was the least senior of all \nmembers. He moved up gradually, and then all of a sudden we all recall \nwhat happened, and he became majority leader.\n  He carried into that majority leadership, on his shoulders, in his \nbrain, and in his ability to make commitments, the idea that there has \nto be a way to modernize Medicare and provide prescription drugs.\n  I do not want to let this record on this day close without the \nSenator from New Mexico--who knows a little bit about this man, who \nserved with him, worked with him, and understands him and is \nappreciative of the great talent he brought to the Senate when he \njoined us--thanking him and recognizing his particular involvement in \ngetting this job done.\n  It just seems as if we go months and years without any good news, and \nthen good news comes in bushels. Today we have a bushel of good news. \nWe passed this bill that our seniors have been asking for. It is \namazing, the AARP supports it, and then the other side of the aisle, \nthe Democrats who used to just crave having the AARP on their side, \nbecause the AARP found a bill that the Democrats don't like--and I \ndon't know whether they don't like it because it isn't theirs or it \nisn't good. I would say it is a tossup from what I can tell. Part of \nthe Democrats don't think it is good, but part of them don't think it \nis good because it isn't theirs. They chose now even to blame the AARP; \nthat there was something nefarious involved in the passage of this \nbill.\n  I hope the millions of people in the AARP understand what the \nDemocrats are saying. They are truly accusing the AARP of having a \nconflict of interest that would cause them to support legislation that \nis not good for the senior citizens of America. That is it in a \nnutshell. It is an absolutely ludicrous accusation, but it has been \ndone. It has been done because they saw the tide, and the tide was \ngoing in the direction they didn't like but the AARP liked.\n  Somehow or another, under the leadership of people such as Bill \nFrist, Republicans started coalescing around it. Because of the ability \nof people such as Chuck Grassley and our leader, Democrats joined in \nand we had some very exciting Democratic support. That is one great big \nbasket of news sitting on the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have listened closely to the debate \nover providing prescription drugs and improving other benefits under \nthe Medicare Program. This debate has not been limited to the last few \ndays, as we all well know. This debate has been waged for 38 years.\n  Providing Americans with access to prescription drugs at an \naffordable cost has been one of the most vexing issues facing Congress \nin recent years. Many ``solutions'' have been offered to ``fix'' the \nproblems of high cost and lack of access, and Congress has explored and \ndebated various approaches. Of these approaches, providing a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit is the most important and perhaps the most \nchallenging to accomplish.\n  For years, progress has been delayed over significant policy \ndifferences, not the least of which was the question of whether or not \nthe Government could even afford to create a new and expensive \nentitlement program. But that question shifted and our debate this week \nwasn't focused on the question of whether the Government should provide \na prescription drug benefit but rather on the details of how to \nstructure a prescription drug benefit.\n  Last Congress I had the privilege to work with several of my \nRepublican and Democratic colleagues in the Senate to develop a \nMedicare drug benefit program that became a key option in the ``how \nto'' debate. Our proposal, which became known as the tripartisan \neffort, embodied the principles that I believed must be part of a \nMedicare drug program.\n  First, the program must make a universal benefit available to all \nMedicare beneficiaries. It would be unfair to use much needed medicines \nas a carrot to lure seniors into managed care programs they don't want. \nWe should also avoid providing a benefit only to the poorest of the \npoor and those with catastrophic costs. Virtually all seniors, \nregardless of income, need help to make their medicines either outright \navailable or more affordable, and most have indicated a willingness to \npay their fair share to support the program.\n  Second, the program must be comprehensive so that elders would have \nas generous a benefit as possible, from their initial spending to their \ncatastrophic costs, and they shouldn't have to forego the best \nmedicines for the cheapest ones just in the name of budget savings.\n  Third, a Medicare drug benefit must be affordable for both \nbeneficiaries and the Government. Seniors should be able to get the \nbest medicine available at the best possible price and the Government \nmust derive the best cost savings through open competition. We should \nexpect to realize as much savings in our pharmaceutical purchase for \nMedicare as foreign governments realize today.\n  Finally, for a drug benefit to be truly successful it must be \nsustainable. It will do little good to repeat the catastrophic failure \nof years past by beginning a program that we cannot carry on. That is \nwhy this must be a shared responsibility of beneficiaries and the \nGovernment. A program that combines seniors' contributions with a \nGovernment guarantee will have the best chance of enduring into the \nfuture.\n  Since last year, I have listened to the concerns of my colleagues, \nand I have weighed those concerns seriously. In the last few days of \ndebate, I have given great consideration to the points raised by my \ncolleagues and good friends in this body. I acknowledge their \nsentiments and I agree that this is not the bill I would have written \nif I had infinite resources to do it. This bill is not perfect. \nHowever, 38 years is just too long for American seniors to wait.\n  Turning this legislation away would have been a missed opportunity to \nprovide seniors with the most significant modernization of their \nMedicare benefits since the program's inception in 1965. I believe this \nbill meets these four standards: It is universal, comprehensive, \naffordable, and sustainable. Could it be improved? Certainly. But this \nplan is a good compromise. It offers a respectable and responsible plan \nwithin the budget limitations we faced. It is a good compromise. I \nsupport this bill.\n  The conference report includes many significant features for the \ncitizens of my home State of Vermont. It provides a sustainable, \nuniversal, and comprehensive prescription drug benefit to all 93,000 \nMedicare beneficiaries in Vermont.\n\n  For 40,000 seniors in Vermont with limited savings and incomes below \n$13,470 for individuals and $18,180 for couples, the Federal Government \nwill cover most of their drug costs.\n  In addition, Medicare, instead of Medicaid, will now assume the \nprescription drug costs of 21,767 Vermont beneficiaries who are \neligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. According to the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, this will save Vermont $76 million over \n8 years on prescription drug coverage for its Medicaid population.\n  This bill recognizes the high cost of providing quality care in rural \nsettings and finally puts an end to years of unfair reimbursement gaps \nbetween rural providers and their urban counterparts. Specifically, \nthis Medicare package provides $25 billion for rural providers, netting \n$41 million in additional funds for Vermont hospitals over the next 10 \nyears and $18 million for underreimbursed physicians over the next 2 \nyears.\n  I am also glad Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Baucus have \nworked with me to address another inequity in the system. Critical \naccess hospitals provide care in the some most underserved regions of \nVermont as is the case throughout rural America. These hospitals are \nsmall yet serve\n\n[[Page S15894]]\n\nas critical resources to their communities.\n  I am very pleased to see that the conferees retained a provision from \nthe Senate measure that will allow critical access hospitals, like the \nMount Ascutney Hospital in Windsor, VT, to expand access to psychiatric \nand rehabilitative services to the most vulnerable citizens in that \ncommunity.\n  This bill contains a provision that will allow us to better \nunderstand how to provide quality health care, culminating several \nyears of work in concert with Dr. Jack Wennberg at Dartmouth to measure \ncare by the quality of patient outcomes rather than utilization of \nresources.\n  In closing, I especially want to salute the efforts of Senator \nBaucus, Senator Grassley, and Senator Breaux and the other without \nwhose hard work and commitment to working through an agreement we would \nnot have accomplished passage of this legislation and they deserve our \naccolades. I also thank several of my other colleagues who have \ncontributed so much to this debate over the years. I have worked for \nmore than 3 years with my good friends, Chairman Grassley and Senators \nSnowe, Breaux and Hatch. In many meetings over many months, we delved \ninto the details of what came to be called the tripartisan bill. This \nhas been one of the finest experiences of my many years in Congress. I \nam very proud to have been a part of that group and that our efforts \nled the way to our success today.\n  A bill such as this is the result of great effort on the part of many \ndifferent people who are not elected to this body but upon whom we all \nrely. I would like to recognize the staff members who have worked so \nhard on this bill and deserve much of the credit for its successful \npassage.\n  On Senator Grassley's staff: Ted Tottman, Linda Fishman, Colin \nRoskey, Mark Hayes, Jennifer Bell, and Leah Kegler, and on Senator \nBaucus' staff Jeff Forbes, Liz Fowler, Jon Blum, Pat Bousliman, Kate \nKirschgraber, and Andrea Cohen deserve considerable recognition for \ntheir tireless efforts. Catherine Finley, Tom Geier, and Carolyn Holmes \nfrom my friend Senator Snowe's staff; Patricia DeLoatche and Patricia \nKnight of Senator Hatch's office; and most especially Senator Breaux's \nlegislative director Sarah Walters and his staff Michelle Easton and \nPaige Jennings deserve enormous credit for this bill.\n  On my own staff, I particularly want to recognize the contributions \nof Sherry Kaiman, Eric Silva, and especially Sean Donohue who took up \nthe effort on the tripartisan bill and who has continued to see it \nthrough to today's success. Each and all have worked tirelessly to \ngather the input, analyze the issues, and build a consensus toward \nachieving this final product.\n  Mrs. SNOWE. Mr. President, today, we stand at the precipice of \nopportunity. Culminating a decade of work, we have before us \nlegislation that will forever change the face of Medicare--providing \nevery senior in America with a prescription drug benefit under a \nMedicare program that will experience the largest expansion in its 38-\nyear history.\n  We would not have arrived at this day without the exceptional \ncommitment made by Finance Chairman Grassley to advance this issue and \nmeld the considerable political and policy differences that have marked \nthe development of this bill. His efforts were nothing short of \nHerculean from the outset, and guided us through a challenging \nconference. He, as well as Ranking Member Baucus, have remained \ncommitted to the bipartisan principles that forged the Senate \nlegislation, which garnered the support of 16 members of the Finance \nCommittee, and a remarkable 76 members of the full Senate.\n  I want to recognize the outstanding leadership of the President--who \nin 2001 challenged Congress to enact the Medicare Prescription drug \nbenefit . . . propounded a set of principles . . . and has provided \nstrong impetus during this ``home stretch'' for Congress to complete \nour work and send to his desk legislation he can sign this year. I know \nfirsthand from my conversations with the President that this is a \ncornerstone of his agenda and absent his driving force we wouldn't be \nhere today.\n  So, too, has the Majority Leader redoubled his longstanding and \nunflagging commitment to enacting into law a bipartisan bill, moving us \never closer to that goal. Thanks to the unique confluence of his skills \n. . . his unparalleled knowledge and grasp of the issue . . . and his \nsingle-mindedness of purpose, more than three quarters of the Senate \ncame together to support S. 1, the Senate's prescription drug bill. And \nin bringing us to the eve of final passage of this conference report, \nhe has been typically respectful of--and responsive to--all the wide-\nranging concerns and recommendations voiced to him, and I thank him for \nhis leadership and for guiding and shaping this process to its ultimate \nand successful conclusion.\n  I also want to extend my appreciation to my colleagues Senators \nHatch, Breaux, and Jeffords, with whom I've worked so closely on a \nprescription drug benefit over the past 3 years--they have been \nstalwarts in this fight and together we developed the template for the \n``tripartisan'' proposal that helped frame the proposal before us. And \ncertainly no one has more fiercely championed the cause than another \ncolleague I've joined with in this battle in the past--Senator \nKennedy--who I recognize does not support this conference report, but \nwhose early, longstanding involvement and passionate policy advocacy \nunquestionably built momentum for this issue in Congress.\n\n  Finally, I want to thank my good friend and colleague, Ron Wyden, \nwith whom I began my ``prescription drug coverage journey'' almost 6 \nyears ago, when we developed the first bipartisan prescription drug \ncoverage bill in the Senate, which established the principles that I \nbelieved were critical to shaping this bill.\n  We reached across the party isle because we recognized that only a \nbipartisan plan could ever ``see the light of day''. And we joined \nforces as members of the Budget Committee to establish in the 2001 \nbudget a $40 billion, 5-year reserve fund. Well, look how far we've now \ncome--from the $370 billion tripartisan plan developed last year, to \nthe historic passage of S. 1 in the Senate this past June.\n  But I can tell you from my own personal and professional experience \nthat Congress' journey along this road has never been easy--although it \nhas been infinitely more arduous for America's seniors. The process has \nborne witness to a multiplicity of goals and philosophies across the \nspectrum.\n  Some have wanted to add a drug benefit to the existing Medicare \nprogram to leverage the purchasing power of 40 million seniors, while \nothers have sought to use the issue either as a vehicle for the \nwholesale privatization of Medicare, or full-scale, Government \nadministered benefits.\n  Some have said we are providing too great an incentive for people to \nenroll in private plans, while others argue we are starving those very \nsame plans.\n  And some have argued the benefits provided in a particular bill are \ninadequate, while others submit that they are, in fact, too generous \nand should be limited to a low-income catastrophic plan.\n  Yet, today, we essentially all agree we are well beyond one \nquestion--the question of need. Therefore, it is imperative we \nacknowledge the reality that, just as the journey thus far has been \nimperiled by the ``slings and arrows'' of those on all sides of this \nissue, it will not become easier with the passage of time--not when \nyou're debating the creation of the largest domestic program in nominal \nterms ever.\n  Not when you're attempting the largest expansion in the history of \nthe third largest Federal domestic spending program.\n  And not when significant challenges loom on the horizon such as \nstrengthening Social Security and Medicare as 77 million baby-boomers \nbegin to retire in 2013--all while we face record-setting Federal \ndeficits.\n  We did have an optimal window for positive change just 2\\1/2\\ years \nago when the Congressional Budget office was projecting surpluses ``as \nfar as the eye could see''--about $5.6 trillion through 2011. Now, next \nyear's deficit alone is projected at nearly $500 billion. That is how \nquickly the tide can turn. That is how quickly opportunities can be \nlost.\n  Just think--a little over a year ago, the Senate was presented with a \nchoice between a ``tripartisan'' plan that ensured coverage would be \navailable to\n\n[[Page S15895]]\n\nall seniors . . . was comprehensive, with the maximum benefit possible \nfor lower-income seniors . . . and was a permanent part of the Medicare \nprogram--and the alternative, which was temporary and would have \n``sunset'' . . . and would have statutorily restricted access to drugs. \nTalk about lost opportunities! Indeed, those who are dissatisfied with \nwhat we have before us today should fondly recall that tripartisan \nbill, and lament its unfortunate demise.\n  So here we are. The conference report before us is the result of an \nattempt to balance the competing viewpoints not only among Members, but \nbetween the stunningly disparate House and Senate legislation. The \nsimple truth is, while I continue to prefer the Senate bill, it is this \nconference report upon which we will vote. And after careful review, I \nhave concluded that while it isn't everything it could be, it isn't \neverything it should be. In the end, millions of seniors will benefit \nover the stagnation of the status quo.\n  To quote AARP, ``Enactment of this legislation is essential to \nstrengthening health security for all Americans. This is an important \nstep toward fulfilling a longstanding promise to older and disabled \nAmericans and their families. While this legislation is not perfect, it \nwill help millions of people, especially those with low incomes and \nhigh drug costs.''\n  Margaret Thatcher once said, ``You may have to fight a battle more \nthan once to win it.'' Well, some of us have been fighting this battle \nnow for nearly 6 years. The bottom line is, we cannot hold hostage our \nseniors' futures to a political unwillingness to compromise. And this \nbill provides us with our best available opportunity to secure, for the \nfirst time, a legislative foothold that honors the same basic \nprinciples I have expounded upon since I first came to this issue--\n\n  That, in keeping with the basic tenets of Medicare, the prescription \ndrug benefit must be universal, comprehensive, affordable, voluntary, \npermanent, and provide equal benefits across all plans. And that--like \nthe Senate bill and the tripartisan proposal before that--it directs \nthe most assistance toward those seniors with the lowest incomes . . . \nincludes a reliable Government fallback of last resort . . . and \ncontinues to ensure seniors access to, and the stability of, the \ntraditional Medicare program. In its totality, this conference report \nfulfills all of these principles.\n  In evaluating the individual components of the package, Mr. \nPresident, we should be mindful of how we arrived at this destination. \nAs the Senate passed a bill with overwhelming bipartisan support, the \nHouse passed its bill with the most razor thin margin of just one \nvote--and as we witnessed it passed the conference by a mere five vote \nmargin, after an historic three hour vote held open to secure the \nnecessary votes.\n  And we see the result in the starkest terms, reflected in the nature \nof the benefit designed out of necessity by the conferees. It includes \naspects modeled after each bill--the deductible was set at the House's \nlower level of $250 and the conferees worked to improve this proposal \nby offering a benefit with an actuarial value higher than the benefit \nfrom both bills. However, in providing these improvements concessions \nhad to be made--in doing so the Senate's $4,500 benefit cap was lowered \nto $2,250. But in the same respect the cost sharing provided under this \ncap was lowered from 50 percent provided for in the Senate bill to 25 \npercent. So as you can see, while not perfect this benefit represents \nthe art of compromise.\n  Recognizing that this bill is not perfect, I find it imperative to \nnote I was disappointed to see two provisions that I oppose are \nincluded in the conference report--means testing of the Part B premium \nand indexing of the Part B deductible. The Senate-passed bill did not \ninclude language to means test the Part B premium and I successfully \nfought to defeat efforts on the Senate floor to add it. Unfortunately, \nthe House bill did contain this concept and the conferees chose to \ninclude in it the conference report. And while the Senate bill did \ncontain language to index the Part B deductible, I opposed this \nprovision in the Finance Committee and had hoped it would be removed by \nthe conferees.\n  But in recognizing the flaws of this proposal, at the same time, the \nconference report will at least get the federal ``foot in the door'' in \nproviding a significant level of assistance to the one-out-of-four \nAmericans who right now have no coverage whatsoever. Most seniors--for \na $35 monthly premium--will save 50 percent on their cost of \nprescription drugs. For example, a senior who spends $3,600 will \nrealize $1,714 annually in savings.\n\n  And in examining the assistance provided to the lowest income, I am \nrelieved to know that the conferees utilized the model set by the \nSenate bill. Most critically, in keeping with the Senate bill, seniors \nwith incomes below 150 percent of poverty who qualify for one of the \nlow income categories will not experience a gap in coverage--and will \nreceive a generous level of assistance. This means that in Maine over \n93,450 beneficiaries, or more than 40 percent of the Medicare \npopulation, will receive a generous benefit with no gap in coverage.\n  And while the Senate bill may have extended this coverage to a \ngreater number of seniors, unlike the Senate bill, this proposal \nensures that all seniors, even the so-called ``dual eligibles''--those \nwho qualify for both the Medicare and Medicaid programs--receive a \nMedicare drug benefit. This will ``federalize'' 47,100 beneficiaries in \nMaine and approximately 6 million nationally. This results in a savings \nof $161 million over eight years to the State of Maine. So, while this \nbenefit does not achieve all that I would like, it has laid the \nfoundation from which we can and must build in the future.\n  Yet, not only do seniors deserve a subsidy to help make prescription \ndrugs more affordable, they should also have the benefit of choice when \nit comes to the coverage they purchase.\n  Because seniors shouldn't be limited in their options for coverage, \nwe ensure that all seniors will have a choice of at least two privately \ndelivered drug plans. Furthermore, all drug plans are required to offer \naccess to two drugs from each therapeutic class and category. Not only \ndoes this provide seniors with options, it helps ensure they will \nreceive the drug their doctor determines is the most appropriate.\n  And let us not forget, there was a time when it was proposed that if \nseniors desired prescription drug coverage, they would be obligated to \nenter an HMO. Well, thankfully--and appropriately--this conference \nreport shuns the ``one size fits all'' philosophy of placing all \nseniors into managed care and maintains the critical protection of \nchoice of ensuring seniors can remain in the Medicare program. Seniors \nabsolutely should have the option of staying where they're \ncomfortable--without sacrificing guaranteed and equal prescription drug \nbenefits.\n  Still others on the opposite end of the spectrum have said that the \nprivately delivered stand-alone drug coverage option is doomed to \nfail--that this type of plan doesn't exist in nature and insurance \ncompanies won't participate. However, this conference report includes \nkey principles developed in the Senate bill--including risk corridors, \nreinsurance and stabilization accounts--which are intended to build a \nstable, productive model that I believe will attract and keep companies \nin the program.\n  Ultimately, however, there is no way to guarantee private companies \nwill deliver services in every region of the country. Therefore, as we \nwere developing the Senate bill, many of us who represent the 12 rural \nStates in which no Medicare+Choice programs operate included a fall \nback of last resort--which I'm pleased to say is sustained in this \nconference report. This key provision will serve to provide security to \nbeneficiaries by knowing that no matter where they live, they will be \nassured of coverage even when private plans choose not to participate.\n  Throughout this debate, concerns have been voiced that with the \nenactment of a Medicare prescription drug benefit some employers will \nbe provoked into reducing coverage that they offer to their former \nemployees. Indeed, I have expressed concern about this issue throughout \nmy six years of involvement in developing Medicare prescription drug \nlegislation. And while I have concluded that we can take steps to \nmitigate the problem of employers ending coverage, I do not believe we \ncan eliminate it.\n  That is because this bill is not causing employers to cease \ncoverage--in fact, from 1999 to 2002--prior to the enactment of a \nMedicare prescription\n\n[[Page S15896]]\n\ndrug benefit--almost 10 percent of employers stopped offering retiree \ncoverage. So this bill cannot be held responsible for this problem that \nexists regardless of the enactment of this bill. But we most definitely \nshould use this bill as an opportunity to help reverse the trend of the \nlast decade and offer incentives that will prompt employers to maintain \ntheir retiree benefits.\n  This conference report takes important steps toward alleviating the \nproblem. Looking back to the development of the Senate bill, the \nCongressional Budget Office estimated that S. 1 would prompt 37 percent \nof employers to reduce the drug coverage they offer to their former \nemployers. In comparison, the conference report includes a combination \nof options--both policy and tax incentives--that CBO, and most \nimportantly employers, believe will provide incentives strong enough to \nencourage the maintenance of private sector coverage. It reduces the \nexpected drop rate from the Senate bill's 37 percent to 16 percent; \nthis means an additional 1.6 million seniors will retain their \nemployer-sponsored coverage--seniors who might have lost this coverage \nregardless of the outcome of this bill.\n\n  This proposal also takes vitally important steps to create better \nbalance within the Medicare program to ensure that all providers, \nregardless of where they are located, receive adequate and appropriate \npayments. For too long, States like Maine, which ranks number 47 in \nMedicare reimbursement, have been underfunded simply because they are \nrural. This bill, thanks to the leadership and persistence of Chairman \nGrassley, finally brings Medicare payments into equilibrium.\n  This proposal provides an additional $25 billion over ten years to \nhelp States, like Maine, receive more equitable Medicare payments. \nHospitals in Maine stand to gain an additional $125 million through \npayment improvements for our Disproportionate Share Hospitals (DSH), \nteaching hospitals, critical access hospitals and rural hospitals. \nFurther, Maine's rural home health care providers will see increases to \ntheir reimbursement rates, along with rural ground and air ambulance \nproviders to name just a few. And let us not forget our physicians. \nThis bill reverses the 4.5 percent reimbursement cut expected for 2004 \nand provides an additional increase to payment rates for rural doctors, \nwhich together total more than $22 million.\n  I was especially pleased to have been able to work with the Chairman \nto add, in the Senate Finance Committee, a provision that would ensure \nthe continuation of the country's rural health care residency training \nprograms. This provision reiterated the Congress' intent to allow \nphysicians to volunteer their time as supervisors of residents, and \nallowed programs to use Medicare funding to support these residents \ninstead of utilizing funding provided by the community.\n  I added this provision in an effort to protect policy that I worked \nto include in the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, which, for the first time, \nallowed residency training programs to place their trainees outside of \nhospitals, most often in rural communities, and receive Medicare \nreimbursement. Unfortunately, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices (CMS) recently tried to regulate around that law and prohibit \nprograms from utilizing this option by making it so onerous that \nprograms instead choose to move the residents back into the hospital \ninstead of complying with the agency's new rules.\n  While I was able to include the corrective policy in the Senate-\npassed Medicare bill, some of the House conferees refused to maintain \nthis critical Senate provision. But, working with the Chairman, who \nrecognized the importance of this provision to rural States, I was able \nto secure support to provide a one-year moratorium that prohibits CMS \nfrom taking action against programs that allow physicians who supervise \nresidents to volunteer their time. the provision also calls on the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to perform a review of this \nissue and report to Congress on the impact to rural training programs \nif physicians are not allowed to volunteer their time as a supervisor.\n\n  Though the moratorium is helpful, it does not resolve the issue, and \nI, therefore, will continue to fight on behalf of these vital programs. \nI have introduced as a separate bill, S. 1897, which contains the \nlanguage from the Senate-passed Medicare bill that will in fact protect \nthese programs and ensure their continued viability.\n  This bill also includes a key provision that corrects an inequity \nthat has disadvantaged millions of Medicare beneficiaries who suffer \nfrom cancer. This bill directs the Secretary to establish a 2 year \ntransitional benefit in 2004 and 2005 utilizing at least $200 million \nto allow Medicare to cover all available oral anticancer treatments.\n  Currently, Medicare provides coverage of a limited number of oral \nanti-cancer drugs that originally were available in intravenous, IV, \nform. However, since Congress first expanded coverage to this limited \ntype of oral anti-cancer treatments, the technology has advanced and \nmany of the most innovative and effective drugs do not qualify for \ncoverage because they did not evolve from the IV form. By including in \nthe conference report authority for CMS to extend coverage to all oral \ncancer treatments, we ensure that in 2004 and 2005, prior to \nimplementation of the comprehensive prescription drug benefit, seniors \nwill have access to the best treatment options available.\n  The conference report before us, includes another noteworthy \nimprovement to the Medicare program, one that will help make an \nimportant tool in the fight against breast cancer more accessible for \nwomen--diagnostic mammography. This year alone, 211,300 women in the \nU.S. will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer, and almost 40,000 \nwill die from the disease. Yet, the FDA reports that the number of \nmammography facilities closing now number over 700 nationwide. These \nclosures have led to longer waiting periods for women scheduling annual \nand follow-up mammography visits which could lead to delayed diagnosis \nand delayed treatment. This is not acceptable.\n  The bill before us includes provisions closing the gap between the \nMedicare reimbursement and the actual cost of diagnostic mammography by \nremoving the reimbursement of diagnostic mammography performed in a \nhospital setting from the Ambulatory Payment Classification and placing \nthe procedure in the Medicare Fee Schedule. This would bring the \nhospital technical number closer to the actual cost of the procedure, \nthus reducing the financial disincentive for hospitals to continue \nthese services.\n\n  Having been the lead Republican cosponsor of this bill for a number \nof years, I am pleased the conference report before us today seeks to \nturn the tide on these closures as too many imaging facilities can no \nlonger afford to offer these procedures due to low Medicare \nreimbursement.\n  One million additional women become age-eligible for screening \nmammography each year. This action will help ensure that these women \nwill have access to the screening they need to detect and combat this \ndisease earlier and, hopefully, with less invasive procedures. This \ninexpensive provision in the Medicare conference report could save \ncountless lives, and I am pleased that it will be enacted into law \nalong with the rest of this bill.\n  Finally--and fortunately--this conference report unquestionably \nrepresents the end of the House bill's open-ended efforts to move \nMedicare toward a national, privatized system through an untested, \nuntried policy known as ``premium support'' that could have led to the \npatchwork delivery of health care that existed prior to the creation of \nMedicare in 1965.\n  This approach would have fostered wild fluctuations in premiums for \nthe traditional Medicare program. Whereas, incredibly, Medicare now \nprovides all seniors the same benefit for the same premium, under this \nproposal premium variations would have occurred not just from State to \nState, but within a State and even within a congressional district!\n  And you don't have to take my word for it. According to the Centers \nfor Medicare & Medicaid seniors living in Miami, FL, would pay $2,100 a \nyear for traditional Medicare, compared to $900 that seniors would pay \nin Osceola for the same benefit. And when you compare this to North \nCarolina, the variation from State to State grows even wider with Rowan \nCounty, North Carolina paying just $750 for traditional Medicare. So \nlet there be no mistake,\n\n[[Page S15897]]\n\nthis House-backed provision was a full frontal assault on traditional \nMedicare. Yet, according to CBO, this proposal that supporters touted \nas the savior of the program ultimately would have saved Medicare less \nthan $1 billion.\n  I happen to believe that prescription drug legislation should be \nabout providing seniors with a drug benefit. And while we certainly can \nconsider and incorporate new policies that improve and enhance the \nunderlying program. The drug benefit should not be used as what someone \nappropriately described as a ``Trojan Horse'' to open the door to the \nprivatization of Medicare.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter, as well as another letter \nmy colleagues and I sent in October, and an editorial from the Bangor \nDaily News be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Congress of the United States, Washington, DC, November \n                                                     13, 2003.\n\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n                                     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leader Frist: It has come to our attention that \n     leadership is considering the inclusion of a new version of \n     the policy model known as premium support. As you know, this \n     policy places the traditional Medicare program and private \n     plans into direct competition and according to the Centers \n     for Medicare and Medicaid Service (CMS) will lead to dramatic \n     increases in the annual premium for the traditional Medicare \n     program.\n       We are extremely concerned about the inclusion of this \n     policy proposal in a Medicare bill. Though some may consider \n     this a demonstration project, we disagree. This appears to be \n     a veiled attempt to institute this policy into law. According \n     to CMS data this proposal could capture up to 10 million \n     seniors, 25 percent of Medicare beneficiaries. Further, it \n     will require them to bear the burden of cost increases \n     associated with the demonstration project.\n       This policy also unfairly targets some seniors simply based \n     on their geographic location and mandates their \n     participation. The likely result will be significant \n     increases in traditional Medicare premiums for seniors living \n     in the affected areas and could destabilize the Medicare \n     program for all seniors.\n       We understand that leadership and some conferees may be \n     considering possible changes to this latest proposal. We urge \n     you to remove this policy from the bill. We believe there are \n     other possible options that will encourage private plan \n     participation in the Medicare program that do not negatively \n     impact the traditional Medicare program.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this vitally important \n     issue.\n           Sincerely,\n     44 Members of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                   U.S. Senate\n\n                                Washington, DC., October 23, 2003.\n     Chairman Charles E.

Thomas and Ranking Member Charles B. \n       Rangel,\n     House Ways and Means Committee, Longworth House Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Chairman W.J. (Billy) Tauzin and Ranking Member John D. \n       Dingell,\n     House Energy and Commerce Committee, Rayburn House Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Conferees:\n       The Medicare conference has reached a critical junction in \n     its effort to craft a conference agreement to develop a \n     Medicare prescription drug and modernization bill. The time \n     is fast approaching when final agreements must be made if a \n     proposal is to be developed prior to the November 7 target-\n     adjournment date. However, many key issues remain unresolved, \n     which will determine whether this bill can garner strong \n     bipartisan support and ultimately become law. As you progress \n     into this critical stage, we urge you to remain committed to \n     the bipartisan principles contained in the legislation \n     developed and passed by the United States Senate.\n       First, the Senate bill takes strong steps to provide every \n     senior and disabled American, no matter where they live, with \n     choices in coverage. Notably, this is done in a manner that \n     preserves the traditional Medicare program as a viable \n     option. This balance was achieved by providing all seniors \n     with access to the same level of drug coverage no matter the \n     coverage option chosen. Further, the Senate bill assures this \n     choice will be a fair one that will not disadvantage senior \n     citizens who remain in traditional Medicare. Accordingly, we \n     urge you to remain committed to principles that provide a \n     level playing field between the private sector and Medicare \n     and reject proposals that would unduly raise Medicare \n     premiums or otherwise advantage private plans.\n       Second, the Senate bill assures affordable, comprehensive \n     coverage to those with incomes below 160 percent of the \n     federal poverty level or $15,472 for an individual in 2006. \n     Generous and affordable coverage for this population is \n     essential, given that most presently do not have access to a \n     prescription drug benefit. The conference must assure that \n     the generous assistance provided to low income beneficiaries \n     is maintained and reject measures that would reduce the \n     benefits presently accorded Medicaid recipients.\n       Third, we urge the conferees to include a mechanism that \n     will ensure that all seniors have access to a prescription \n     drug benefit, no matter where they live. The Senate bill \n     assures that private plans interested in providing this \n     benefit can do so and will be the preferred mechanism of \n     delivery in every geographic locality; however, it is not \n     possible to guarantee their participation. Therefore, it is \n     necessary that the final proposal include a fallback \n     mechanism, as we included in the Senate bill, that will \n     ensure that beneficiaries will have access to the drug \n     benefit in the event that private plans are not available in \n     a region.\n       Finally, we caution the conferees against including \n     provisions that will circumvent established congressional \n     procedures or delegate responsibilities for establishing the \n     benefit and cost-sharing requirements to the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services (HHS). The responsibility for \n     developing and overseeing benefits included in the Medicare \n     program rests with the Congress, and this bill should not \n     violate that principle.\n       Enactment this year of a bill that adds a Medicare \n     prescription drug benefit and improves the program is a top \n     priority for each of us. America's seniors have waited too \n     long for comprehensive drug coverage and the addition of \n     market-based options. However, to achieve this goal, we must \n     continue to work together to develop agreements that will \n     receive bipartisan support in each chamber. In 1965, the \n     original Medicare bill garnered this level of support and a \n     change to the program of this magnitude should be no \n     different.\n       We remain ready to help you address these and other issues \n     that will impact the final proposal, and hope you will work \n     with us to develop bipartisan proposals that we can support.\n           Sincerely,\n     Olympia J. Snowe,\n     Arlen Specter,\n     Mike DeWine,\n     Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Jeff Bingaman,\n     Blanche L. Lincoln,\n     James M. Jeffords.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Bangor Daily News, Nov. 21, 2001]\n\n                           Hobson's Medicare\n\n       Never have so many dollars been put to so little use. The \n     $400 billion Medicare bill before Congress establishes what \n     all sides agree is necessary--a prescription drug benefit--\n     but blasts away at much of Medicare's foundation. It is a \n     deal that makes all previously rejected Medicare reform look \n     wise and generous by comparison. It is also the best deal the \n     current Congress is likely to get.\n       The difficult calculation is this: Is a badly flawed bill \n     that contains a needed drug benefit worth passing when the \n     alternative is to reject it without the chance to enact \n     improved legislation? The $400 billion has been set aside for \n     funding this legislation; should it fail, the money would \n     disappear and given the extent of the deficit for the next \n     decade or more, would not be available next year; even in the \n     unlikely chance a bill could be passed in an election year, \n     or perhaps after that.\n       Much of the debate this week has focused on the plan's \n     intent to establish privatization pilot projects--subsidized \n     private insurers would offer Medicare in six metropolitan \n     areas in competition with traditional Medicare--but other \n     aspects of it are equally important and equally troubling. \n     The means-testing provision in the bill, for instance, raises \n     costs for middle-class seniors; reimbursements for medical \n     residents harm clinic work; those who remain in traditional \n     Medicare for the pilot program will see increases in their \n     costs; states that could negotiate for their Medicaid-\n     Medicare clients lose much of their bargaining power while \n     also losing their federal support for the program. The fear \n     remains strong among health care advocates that the entire \n     reform is an attempt to cap the federal contribution to \n     Medicare and shift future costs to seniors. Several of these \n     problems are being debated now--Sen. Olympia Snowe has been \n     in the middle of negotiations all week; imagine the time and \n     argument that would have been saved had she been put on the \n     conference committee. Some of these issues may be resolved \n     but several are likely to remain as the House and Senate \n     vote.\n       Some members of Congress do not support the bill for these \n     many reasons; some don't support it because of its cost and \n     relatively small nod toward privatization. But for those who \n     believe a drug benefit is important and will become more \n     important in the coming years, the choice is to vote yes and \n     immediately set about chipping away at some of the worst \n     aspects of the bill. This is a terrible way to build a health \n     care safety net for the nation's seniors, but lamenting the \n     process is not an excuse for allowing this opportunity to \n     pass by without approving the drug benefit.\n       At 1,100 pages, the Medicare bill is too long and complex \n     to describe it merely as a sop to industry (though \n     pharmaceutical manufacturers should love it), an ideological \n     document (though its medical-savings accounts are a GOP \n     crowd-pleaser) or a broad expansion of entitlements (though \n     the drug benefit is exactly that). It is fair to say the bill \n     is a poor version of what should have been passed years ago \n     and now that Congress is out of time and out of money, it is \n     about as much as the public can expect.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. In a letter that 43 colleagues sent, we expressed our \nstrong opposition to this ideological venture.\n\n[[Page S15898]]\n\nIt is rewarding to note that significant changes were made that \ntransformed the full-scale national premium support proposal into a \nlimited bona-fide demonstration project, as seen in this chart.\n  Where once efforts centered on the wholesale national privatization \nof Medicare under a proposal that offered seniors zero protections from \npremium fluctuations, conferees shifted to crafting a bona-fide \ndemonstration project.\n  Notably, this proposal exempts seniors from the demonstration who \nhave incomes below 150 percent of poverty.\n  This bill includes a sunset that ends the demonstration project after \nsix years, limits premium increases to 5 percent annually; and because \nthe demonstration is phased in over 4 years, the actual impact to \npremiums is significantly less than 5 percent. In fact, the true cap on \npremiums during the first 4 years of the 6 year demo is only one-\nquarter of the five percent increase.\n  Further, under the initial proposal the premium increases would have \ncompounded annually, which could have resulted in a net increase in the \ntraditional Medicare premiums of over 30 percent during the 6 year \nproject. But we worked with the conferees and even this component was \nremoved so that the increases are not compounded.\n  Finally, we were able to secure support to include selection criteria \nthat identifies qualifying MSAs. Sites must have at least 25 percent \nprivate plan participation and seniors living within the MSA must have \naccess to at least two local private plans. Further, the demo must \ninclude--one of the largest MSAs--one with low population density--one \nmulti-State MSA--and all must be from different parts of the country. \nUnder this criteria, Maine will not qualify as a demonstration site.\n  According to CBO this criteria serves to limit the scope of the \nproject to between 650,000 and 1 million seniors, as opposed to the \nproposal we addressed in our letter, which would have captured 10 \nmillion seniors.\n  Looking back it is remarkable how far this provision has come. Where \ndiscussion back in October once focused on the House-passed provisions \nthat created a national premium support program, we now are considering \na limited, bona-fide demonstration project that is a legitimate avenue \nfor exploring new ideas to ensure the future of Medicare.\n  Looking back on the development of the Senate bill, many notions \nexisted about how best to encourage private plans to participate in \nMedicare. But as we discovered, expectations about the impact and \nresults produced by these proposals often were in conflict. With one \nproposal, while CMS predicted 43 percent of seniors would participate \nin private plans, CBO estimated only two percent. Yet at a later point, \nin considering a measure to establish a payment system for the \nMedicareAdvantage program, CBO estimated it would cost hundreds of \nbillions of dollars, while CMS predicted it would save Medicare money.\n  Clearly, it is imperative that we first test proposals before sending \nMedicare down a path of change. To do otherwise would be to potentially \nimperil the very health care system seniors have come to reply upon.\n  So I am pleased that in the final analysis the premium support \nproposal that once threatened to unravel the very thread of Medicare \nhas been reduced to a limited, focused, true demonstration project, \nwhich starts in 2010; is limited to 6 years; is limited to 6 MSAs that \naccording to CBO captures only 1 million seniors; limits premium \nincreases to 5 percent per year without a compounding affect; \nterminates the financial incentives offered to private plans under the \nMedicareAdvantage program; and protects seniors whose incomes are below \n150 percent of poverty by holding them entirely harmless.\n  There is one place where this conference report fails to hold seniors \nharmless, and that is in the skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs \nwhich are increasing at a rate seven times higher than the rate of \ninflation and grew 16 percent between 1999 and 2002.\n  One effective means to reduce the cost of prescription drugs is \nthrough importation. Regrettably, this conference report perpetuates \nthe status quo by insisting on maintaining the safety certification \nrequirements that have to date made it impossible for either the former \nor current Secretary of Health and Human Services to certify the \nintegrity of imported drugs. Yet one in eight American households \nalready use imported prescription drugs, and according to William \nHubbard, senior associate commissioner at the FDA, in his testimony \nbefore the House Government Reform Committee in June, there is ``no \nevidence that any American has died from taking a legal drug from \nanother country.''\n\n  The FDA has a critical role to play in the Secretary's ability to \ncertify the safety of imported drugs--and they're not fulfilling that \nresponsibility. Rather than expending the resources to develop the \ntools necessary to improve safety, and thus open access to this \nmedications, the FDA is instead directing their efforts to threaten \nconsumers. This is astounding because we know we have the ability to \nimprove safety. For a few pennies, anti-counterfeiting packaging can be \nused. We use it on a twenty dollar bill--a lifesaving prescription \ndeserves no less. Further, drug manufacturers were mandated back in \n1992 to track their products using a ``pedigree'', something which has \nyet to be enforced.\n  I challenged the FDA to commit itself to improve packaging and \nrequire better tracking to protect consumers, and maintain high \nconfidence in the products of our pharmaceutical industry. The public \ncannot be held hostage to the seemingly never-ending increase in the \ncost of prescription drugs, and this a fight that will continue to be \nwaged in the halls of Congress, our citizens deserve no less.\n  So taken in its totality, while I am disappointed with aspects of \nthis legislation, passage of this legislation will be looked upon as a \ntransformational moment in the history of the Medicare program, because \nnow there will be no going back.\n  There will be no returning to the days when Medicare lived in the \ndark ages, oblivious to the fact that remarkable drugs were available \nto save lives, prevent disease, and halt the progression of disease.\n  There will be no returning to the days when many needed to be \nconvinced that prescription drug coverage was even a topic worthy of \nserious debate in the United States Congress.\n  There will be no returning to the days when a quarter of our Nation's \nseniors struggled without any assistance whatsoever in paying for the \nprescription drugs that can be the difference between a decent quality \nof life--and life itself.\n  With this bill, we will finally pass the point of no return--and \nthankfully so. This bill--while far from perfect--is the new baseline, \nthe new benchmark which future progress will be measured--and attained. \nTo paraphrase Winston Churchill, in viewing this legislation, it is not \nthe end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, \nthe end of the beginning.\n  For all of these reasons, I will support this conference report, and \nI encourage my colleagues to do likewise.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Less than 5 months ago, I stood before the Senate and \nspoke at length of my concerns that such a package would be detrimental \nto the future solvency of our Nation, and leave future generations with \na reckless and unjust financial burden. Since that time, members \nengaged in conference committee negotiations produced a voluminous \npackage which represents the single largest expansion of Medicare since \nits creation, offering enormous profits and protections for a few of \nthe country's most powerful interest groups, paid for with the borrowed \nmoney of American taxpayers for generations and generations to come.\n  Everyone here is well aware that Medicare faces enormous long-term \nfiscal challenges. In recent years, the program's financial state has \nworsened. The most recent Trustee's Report hastened the year Medicare \nwill reach financial insolvency by four years to 2026. Adding a \nprescription drug benefit to an already failing Medicare, is like \nputting a band-aid on a patient that needs surgery.\n  Earlier today I mentioned several statistics which I believe are \nworth repeating. Today, our Nation has an accumulated deficit of $7 \ntrillion--which\n\n[[Page S15899]]\n\ntranslates into $24,000 for every man, woman and child in the United \nStates. Making our bad financial condition worse, the Federal \nGovernment is estimated to run a deficit of $480 billion in fiscal year \n2004.\n  Passing this bill continues our reckless spending. Although this \npackage is estimated to cost just under $400 billion over 10 years, I \nguarantee you, $400 billion is merely a down payment. I don't believe \nthere is one person here who honestly believes that $400 billion is the \nmaximum we will pay in the next 10 years.\n  Additionally, this new package will substantially increase existing \nunfunded liabilities. The Office of Management and Budget estimates the \ncurrent unfunded liabilities of Medicare and Social Security at $18 \ntrillion. This new benefit will add an estimated $7 trillion in \nadditional unfunded liabilities.\n  By 2020, Social Security and Medicare, with a prescription drug \nbenefit, will consume an estimated 21 percent of income taxes for every \nworking American. Adding a new unfunded entitlement to a system that is \nalready financially insolvent, is so grossly irresponsible that it \nought to outrage every fiscal conservative.\n  The American people deserve some straight talk. Passing this package, \nwithout implementing the necessary reforms to ensure that the Medicare \nsystem is solvent over the long-term, will simply expedite its failure. \nClearly, it should be incumbent upon us to include comprehensive, free \nmarket reforms, into any Medicare prescription drug package in order to \nensure that Medicare is financially sound for current beneficiaries as \nwell as future generations. Unfortunately, this conference report \nrepresents a missed opportunity.\n  Medicine has changed substantially since the creation of the Medicare \nsystem in 1965. Advances in medical technology and pharmaceuticals have \nlead to more prescription-based treatments, and Americans now consume \nmore prescriptions than ever before. In 1968, soon after the enactment \nof Medicare, American seniors spent about $65 a year on a handful of \nprescription medications. Today seniors fill an average of 22 \nprescriptions a year, spending an estimated $999.\n  The conference report before us represents one of the largest \nenhancements to Medicare since its creation--setting up an entirely new \nbureaucracy and establishing a sizable new entitlement program. I \nbelieve this bill attempts to addresses a real problem, but falls \nperilously short. We must have no illusions. There are dangers, \ncomplexities, and potential unintended consequences associated with \nthis bill.\n  This legislation is without a doubt an enormous fiscal and social \ntrain wreck. Long after this Congress and this administration have left \noffice our children and our grandchildren, and a future Congress and \nadministration, will be left here to clean up the mess we have created \nwith this bill.\n  I believe we have an obligation to future generations to start \nexorcizing some fiscal restraint. While our national debt rapidly \nmounts, we continue to increase the financial burden our grandchildren \nwill have to bare, without reigning in costs. Unfortunately, this \nproblem is exacerbated by our inability to put a stop to our excessive \nand wasteful spending, particularly egregious porkbarrel projects which \nCongress has become addicted to.\n  We are on a shopping spree with borrowed money. The extraordinarily \nlarge new entitlement package before us substantially increases the \nalready enormous burden of current and future taxpayers. We have to \nstop living in denial, eventually the money has to come from somewhere \nand none of the options are desirable. The reality is, this new benefit \nwill be funded by raiding other entitlement trust funds, through \nincreasing our national debt, reducing benefits or through increased \ntaxes. An expansion such as this is simply not sustainable.\n  For the enormous cost of this bill, the most alarming fact is that it \nwon't even provide adequate prescription drug coverage or enact many of \nthe significant measures needed to reform the Medicare system and \nensure its long-term financial solvency. To save this system, we must \nenact true free market reforms and bring Medicare into the 21st \ncentury. Some provisions in this bill, including means testing Part B \nand expansion of health savings accounts, are a good start toward long-\nterm reform. Unfortunately, these minor reforms do not outweigh the \nburden of the new unfunded drug benefit.\n  With future generations of American taxpayers funding the purchase of \nprescription drugs under Medicare, we have an obligation to ensure some \namount of cost containment against the skyrocketing cost of \nprescription drugs. Unfortunately, however, this package explicitly \nprohibits Medicare from using its new purchasing power to negotiate \nlower prices with manufacturers. The Veterans' Administration, VA, and \nState Medicaid Programs use market share to negotiate substantial \ndiscounts. Taxpayers should be able to expect Medicare, as a large \npurchaser of prescription drugs, to be able to derive some discount \nfrom its new market share. Instead, taxpayers will provide an estimated \n$9 billion a year in increased profits to the pharmaceutical industry.\n  Prescription drug importation is another lost opportunity for cost \ncontainment. American consumers pay some of the highest prices in the \ndeveloped world for prescription drugs, and as a result, millions of \nour citizens travel across our borders each year to purchase their \nprescriptions. In Arizona, bus loads of seniors depart from Phoenix and \nTucson every week, heading south to Mexico to purchase lower cost \nprescription drugs. The story is similar across the northern border \nwhere seniors make daily trips to Canadian pharmacies.\n  Throughout the country an increasing number of seniors are looking to \nonline pharmacies selling reduced-priced prescriptions imported from \nother countries, oftentimes with questionable safety. In all, Americans \nspend hundreds of millions of dollars on imported pharmaceuticals not \nbecause they don't want to buy American, but because they simply can't \nafford to. Although the conference report does contain language on drug \nimportation, it has been successfully weakened to the point of \nguaranteeing that implementation will never take place.\n  The only provision contained in this package that has any potential \nto help rein in the cost of prescription drugs is a negotiated version \nof a bill Senator Schumer and I have championed for the last several \nCongresses. Regrettably, it is weakened from its original form. But, \nthis language still represents a partial victory for consumers. It \ncloses loopholes in current law that have allowed brand name drug \ncompanies to unfairly delay generic market entry, empowering generic \nfirms to challenge patents and obtain certainty before risking market \nentry.\n  Given the difficult budgetary realities in which we live, this \npackage should have been targeted to the most needy. Today, \napproximately 75 percent of seniors have some form of prescription drug \ncoverage, but the package before us is a universal benefit, not one \nthat targets those poor seniors who we all know make difficult \ndecisions between life sustaining medicines and other basic needs. One \nof the ludicrous facts is that this new plan will spend an estimated \n$100 billion to cover the people who already have coverage. Goldman \nSachs analysts estimate that this bill shifts a total of $30 billion a \nyear in U.S. health care spending to the Federal Government.\n  Despite our differences of opinion over this legislation, virtually \neveryone involved agrees that in this country, there exists a serious \ncrisis for lower and middle income seniors and the disabled. I believe \nit is an outrage that in a country as wealthy as ours, seniors across \nthe country are struggling to afford the high cost of prescription \ndrugs.\n  Here is some straight talk to America's seniors: For those of you who \nthink this bill will solve your financial problems I am here to tell \nyou, there are substantial limitations to the proposed legislation. \nThis new prescription benefit will not be available immediately. In \nfact, it will take several years just to establish the new bureaucracy \nwhich will administer the prescription benefits.\n  Once this program is in place, an estimated 20 percent of seniors who \nare currently covered by former employers--2.7 million individuals--\nwill lose\n\n[[Page S15900]]\n\nthat coverage. Over the summer, the Wall Street Journal quoted one \nanalyst who called this bill the ``automaker enrichment act,'' because \ncompanies will see huge reductions in unfunded liabilities and annual \ndrug spending. It is unconscionable that our grandchildren will be \nshouldering the burden of legacy costs of big business.\n  Despite the enormous sums of money we are spending on this package, \nfar too many seniors will find themselves with a benefit that is \nmediocre, at best. And far too many others will find themselves worse \noff than they are today. Many other seniors, might not even get out of \nthe system what they will pay in deductibles and premiums.\n  I am concerned that we are about to repeat an enormous mistake. I \nhave been around long enough to remember another large Medicare \nprescription drug entitlement program we enacted in 1988, Medicare \ncatastrophic. The image of seniors angered by the high cost and \nineffectiveness of that package attacking Rostenkowski's car, should be \na cautionary tale to all of us.\n  The American people must be aware that this new package has \nsubstantial cost to seniors, to taxpayers and to the future generations \nwho will bare the majority of the financial burden. We must be \nrealistic, there will be unintended consequences of our actions. \nMoreover, we must be honest about the cost of this measure--$400 \nbillion is merely a down payment for what we are creating. If we as a \nbody decide to support this bill, we must also commit to fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  Despite my concern for the overall package, several provisions will \nprovide good fixes to the existing program and a better quality of life \nto many Americans. Several provisions benefitting our Nation's \nhospitals, will provide much needed assistance to hospitals in my \nState, particularly teaching hospitals, those in rural areas and those \nwhich suffer from the crippling burden of uncompensated care of \nundocumented immigrants.\n  I am, however, disappointed that the Immigrant Children's Health \nImprovement Act was dropped from the conference report. This bill would \nhave reversed a 1996 law that prohibited States from extending State \nMedicaid and SCHIP Programs to legal immigrants.\n  The Wall Street Journal has called this bill ``an awfully high price \nto pay for expanded Health savings Accounts,'' but I would call it \nlegislative malpractice.\n  After much thought and careful deliberation, I regret that I cannot \nvote for this conference report. I have reached this conclusion, not \nbecause I believe our seniors and disabled do not need or deserve \nprescription drug coverage, but because I do not believe our country \ncan sustain the cost of this package and because I fear that our \nactions will not provide adequate assistance to most beneficiaries.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, this is a sad day for seniors and a sad \nday for America. I have long fought for a prescription drug benefit, \nand I am truly disappointed that this bill fails to adequately address \nthis need. Seniors deserve a comprehensive, reliable prescription drug \nplan. This is no such bill. It is a weak benefit meant to cover the \ntrue intentions of its authors--privatizing Medicare. In short, the \nbill Republicans are passing today is a wolf in sheep's clothing.\n  This bill, over time, will bring about the unraveling of the Medicare \nsystem, breaking a promise we made to our seniors. It does all this \nunder the cloak of a prescription drug benefit that is far too small \nand far too weak to justify the negative side effects.\n  To illustrate how this bill begins the demise of Medicare and sets \nour Nation back in its effort to care for seniors, we need only to look \nat the years before Medicare, when the private market failed to \nadequately serve the elderly. This sicker, costlier population was an \nunprofitable group for private insurers to cover. It was impossible to \ntake care of this pool and still keep premiums affordable. Before we \npassed Medicare in 1965, 44 percent of seniors were uninsured. Now 1 \npercent of seniors are uninsured--a lower rate than any other age \ngroup. Medicare does this by being able to spread the per-person costs \nacross a large number of people to pool the risk.\n  This bill, however, fragments the risk pool and allows private plans \nto ``cherry-pick'' the healthiest seniors. Left behind will be a group \nof Medicare applicants that are far more expensive per person. This \nwill create a two-tiered system and start an insurance cost death \nspiral that will unravel Medicare's financing. Medicare is a promise we \nmade as a nation to guarantee seniors the health care they need in \ntheir golden years. This bill betrays that promise. And it does so \nunder the false pretense of a prescription drug benefit. While \npromising negligible prescription drug coverage, this bill immediately \nputs benefits at risk for millions of seniors, including retirees, \nmembers of state prescription plans and those who are dual-eligible for \nMedicare and Medicaid--the poorest and the sickest. I voted against \nthis bill for these reasons, and because these flaws will particularly \nharm New Yorkers.\n  This bill contains little to prevent employers from dropping retiree \ncoverage. That will disproportionately affect New York, which has a \nhigher percentage of seniors with retiree health than other States. In \nNew York State, 36.5 percent of Medicare beneficiaries have retiree \ncoverage compared to a national average rate of 31.8 percent. Over \n200,000 Medicare beneficiaries in New York will lose their retiree \nhealth benefits under this bill.\n  This bill will also reduce drug coverage for the lowest-income and \nsickest Medicare beneficiaries--those dually eligible for Medicare and \nMedicaid. In a cost-savings provision, this bill will ban Medicaid from \nfilling in the gaps in coverage by prohibiting Medicaid dollars from \ncovering prescription drugs not covered by the new Medicare drug plan. \nThis could hurt 6 million nursing home residents, people with \ndisabilities, and truly indigent seniors nationwide, and over 400,000 \nin New York alone.\n  This bill also fails to protect seniors who hope to stay in state \nprescription drug plans, like New York's EPIC. Unless corrected, this \nbill will force EPIC to comply with private drug plans preferred drug \nlist, hampering EPIC's ability to ``wrap around'' Medicare and \nsupplement the drug coverage. The state legislature will be forced to \nchange the law and the design of EPIC to continue to program.\n  Retirees, dual-eligible and state plan participants are not the only \nlosers in this bill. The premium support provision will also hurt \nseniors in various regions selected for this experiment. These seniors \nwill incur a surcharge in their Medicare premiums others will not have \nto pay. The seniors who want to stay in traditional Medicare but fall \nin a metropolitan area chosen for the premium support ``demonstration'' \nwill have a 5 percent surcharge over their counterparts in other \nStates. In the future that surcharge could spike to 88 percent if the \n``demonstration'' is expanded to a full-premium support privatization \neffort. New York seniors in Rochester and Buffalo are at risk of being \ntreated in that discriminatory manner. New York State also has two \nother Metropolitan Statistical Areas--Albany-Schenectady-Troy, and Glen \nFalls--that face the possibility of being chosen and whose seniors are \ntherefore at risk of having to pay more in Medicare part B premiums \nthan other seniors in the U.S.\n  The bill also hurts seniors and individuals with disabilities by \nraising every Medicare beneficiary's deductible for physician services \nimmediately, before seniors and people with disabilities even receive \nany benefits. Yet it fails to deal with the rising price of \nprescription drugs. It guts re-importation, weakens the generic \nprovisions, and goes through the most unimaginable contortions to \nundermine government bargaining power, or any other checks on \nskyrocketing prescription drug prices. At the same time it places a 45 \npercent general revenue trigger on overall Medicare spending. This puts \nexisting non-drug benefits in jeopardy by placing an arbitrary lid on \nspending and allowing drug-related spending to grow uncontrollably. \nThat means other Medicare benefits will get squeezed into tighter and \ntighter fiscal constraints. If they can't fit those constraints, this \nbill forces those existing benefits onto the chopping block year after \nyear.\n  I and many of my colleagues have expressed concerns, not just with \naspects of this bill, but with the appalling process with which it was \nthrust upon us. As complex and confusing as this\n\n[[Page S15901]]\n\nbill is, the senate discussed it for less than a week now. We have not \nbeen given ample time to understand this bill, and our constituents \nhave not been given adequate time to discern how it will affect their \nlives.\n  Fortunately, there are some provisions included that I support. I am \nvery glad to see that this bill stops the damaging cuts to physician \npayments and provides a small increase to physicians instead. I am \npleased that the bill includes between $300 and $400 million for rural \nand small community hospitals and health providers in New York, while \nalso providing additional funds for public and other hospitals who \nserve a disproportionate number of uninsured or Medicaid patients. And \nwhile I would have liked to see all teaching hospital cuts averted, I \nam pleased that at least some improvements were made for graduate \nmedical education, since New York State trains many of the graduate \nphysicians in the nation. This bill also includes a version of Senator \nSchumer's proposal, which provides greater market competition for \ngeneric drugs. And finally, this bill contains a proposal that I \noffered as an amendment on the Senate floor--the comparative \neffectiveness research provision. This will assure that we spend money \non drugs that are most effective, not just the ones that are most \nadvertised.\n  These positive provisions, however, should have been attached to a \ngood bill. They are not enough to justify undermining the promise of \nMedicare. I believe New York deserves a better bipartisan alternative \nthan the one that passed today, and I will continue fighting this year, \nas well as in years to come, to correct the deficiencies I've described \ntoday so that Congress might deliver on the long-awaited promise of a \nsimple, affordable, comprehensive prescription drug benefit for all \nseniors.\n  Like so many other pieces of legislation we have witnessed in the \npast two and a half years, this bill is designed to please special \ninterest and not the public. It will be a benefit to drug \nmanufacturers. And it will be an benefit to private insurance \nproviders. They are the big winners here, and that's not right.\n  We need a bill that will benefit seniors. They deserve a benefit that \nis comprehensive, wide-ranging, and reliable. Today's bill is mainly a \nbill to privatization of Medicare. And it's not only seniors who will \nbe harmed. All Americans, young and old, will deal with the financial \nand medical consequences of this bill for years to come. This is a bad \nbill for seniors and a bad bill for America.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President I rise today, conflicted about the \nconference report now before this body. Shortly, my colleagues and I \nwill be faced with making a very important decision regarding whether \nor not we think this Medicare conference report is good enough for \nAmerica's seniors. This is not a simple task as there are so many \nmoving parts, each with its own implications.\n  The Senate bill, which I supported was not perfect. While it had its \nflaws, it represented a bipartisan effort and a first step towards \nproviding the kind of prescription drug coverage seniors need. With the \nconclusion of that vote, I remain cautiously optimistic that conferees \nwould be able to deal with some of the inherent problems in that bill. \nI was hopeful that conferees would find a way to eliminate or come very \nclose to eliminating the employer-sponsored retiree coverage drop \nproblem. I was hopeful that conferees could maintain the level playing \nfield between traditional Medicare and private plans. And I was \noptimistic that progress could be made on reducing the high cost of \nprescription drugs that Americans pay compared to the rest of the \nworld.\n  I was hopeful and confident, but I must unfortunately report today \nthat those feelings are now all but entirely lost. I am discouraged \nthat my colleagues on the other side of the aisle abandoned the \nbipartisan spirit of the conference committee. Senator Daschle, who has \nalways been a strong leader on this important health care access issue, \nas well as many other Democratic members, had been completely shut out \nof the conference committee. This is a very unfortunate circumstance, \nand the result today is obvious.\n  It is obvious because now we are faced with a conference report that \ndoes not represent a fair balance between the strong Senate bill and \nthe bill passed by a 1-vote majority in the House. Rather, today we \nhave a conference report that moves to privatize Medicare, actually \nprohibits the government from negotiating lower drug prices, and puts \nrural and chronically ill seniors at risk of suffering higher premiums \nthan their urban and healthier counterparts. All of these things weigh \non my mind as I think about this very important vote.\n  And I am especially frustrated that the majority has intentionally \nheld the rural provider package hostage. This package should have been \npassed with the tax bill, but President Bush made a convenient promise \nto our Republican friends to address this issue in the context of the \nMedicare prescription drug bill and they have now created the illusion \nthat a no vote for this bill equates to a lack of support of rural \nprovider payment equity. Well, this is simply not true. Many of my \ncolleagues on the Rural Health Caucus have worked tirelessly over many \nyears to achieve payment equity for our providers. I would like to \nthank all members of our caucus, and especially Senator Harkin for his \nhard work on this issue. I have long supported these important \nprovisions, which were all contained in the better Senate-passed \nbipartisan bill.\n  And while I am pleased that the Senate bill's rural provider package \nhas made it into the conference report, I am very concerned about the \nactual drug benefit. While the conference report appears to do a pretty \ngood job of addressing the prescription drug needs of many low-income \nbeneficiaries, most seniors, especially those above 150 percent of \npoverty will be expecting much more than what they will receive under \nthe program. This will be a shocking wake up call for many around the \ncountry when the plan finally reaches them in 2006.\n  Not only will seniors across the country experience varied premium \nrates and benefits, but many seniors will not break even under the \nplan, spending more in premiums, copayments and deductibles than the \nvalue of the drugs they need in a given year. In South Dakota, about \n16.6 percent of the Medicare population will fit in this category. This \nis not what seniors are expecting and they should know this right \naway--up front.\n  Additionally, many beneficiaries will hit the coverage gap and remain \nthere for a long period of time in any given year. In my home State, \napproximately 24.4 percent of seniors will hit the coverage gap of \n$2,250 but never reach the catastrophic level of $5,100, meaning they \nwind up paying 100 percent of their drug costs or $2,850 while \ncontinuing to pay a monthly premium to their PPO or drug-only plan. I \nknow that South Dakotans will be saying to me in the fall of 2006 that \nrather than pay for a deal like that, they might as well just take a \nbus trip up to Canada to get their drugs for a much cheaper deal.\n  In addition to these less than ideal benefits, I am angered that this \nbill does almost nothing to constrain the rising cost of prescription \ndrugs. I am pleased that provisions have been included to speed access \nto lower priced generics, however beyond that, it is blatantly obvious \nthat many have gone to great lengths to establish roadblocks against \nreal price reform. The conference report disallows the Secretary any \nreal authority to negotiate for lower priced drugs for the 41 million \nseniors that will be eligible for this program. This is the real \ntragedy in this conference report of which people across America must \nbe made aware.\n  Disturbing are the estimates that the pharmaceutical industry will \nexperience windfall profits of at least $139 billion dollars over eight \nyears as a result of this new program. Our friends on the other side of \nthe aisle talk of ``free market'' and ``fiscal discipline'' but went \nfar beyond turning the other cheek when they struck the Senate's \nreimportation provisions that disallowed drug manufacturers to restrain \ntheir exports to other countries. This is not free market colleagues \nand such excess will eventually threaten the viability of the Medicare \nPart D prescription drug benefit.\n  I am also concerned that while conferees have provided some dollars \nin the final report to address the loss of\n\n[[Page S15902]]\n\nemployer-sponsored retiree drug coverage, we have only partly addressed \nthis problem. I was pleased to see that conferees allotted funds to \naddress this issue in part. And while the conference report reduced the \ndrop rate by about 14 percent, 23 percent of seniors will still lose \nthe generous retiree coverage they now enjoy. Additional dollars were \navailable in the budget to further reduce this number. Unfortunately, \nconference leadership chose to spending billions on health savings \naccounts, which have nothing to do with Medicare or the prescription \ndrug benefit, and only serve to help healthier and wealthier Americans \nsave money on the costs of their health care. I find this very \ndisappointing and, frankly, unacceptable.\n  There are countless others in my State and across the country that \nare left out under the so called ``agreement'' before us. In South \nDakota, 14.1 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are also eligible for \nMedicaid. These ``dual eligibles'' were protected under the Senate bill \nby maintaining their generous Medicaid coverage. Under the final \nversion, those individuals will suffer higher copayments and will run \nthe risk of losing access to important life-saving medications if a \nparticular drug is not covered on their new Medicare drug formulary. \nAdditionally, in my State thousands fewer seniors will not qualify for \nthe low-income protections because the conference report reduced the \npoverty threshold from 160 percent as was in the Senate bill to 140 \npercent, as well as instituted a strict assets test for low-income \nbenefits.\n  Of most concern to seniors in rural South Dakota will be the \nproposal's heavy reliance on managed care. In my home State, currently \nthere are no beneficiaries enrolled in the Medicare+Choice program. If \nwe take lessons from that fact, one that is mirrored in many rural \nstates, we must conclude that the managed care options in this \nconference report are not likely to have much success in those areas.\n  The Senate bill did contain a strong fallback provision which would \nhave provided real choices to rural seniors. Under the bill I \nsupported, if two ``prescription drug only plans'' of PDP's were not \navailable in a given region, seniors would have the choice to select a \ngovernment-run fallback option. It is my understanding that under the \nconference report that guaranteed fallback trigger is restricted \nbecause only one PDP and one managed care plan are required to prevent \nthe fallback from being made available.\n  This scenario means that a senior in South Dakota has to choose \nbetween two bad options: be forced into a managed care plan and lose \nthe choice of their doctor to achieve affordable drug prices, or join \nthe only PDP plan in the region that enjoys a captive market which \nallows them to charge whatever premium they desire. The managed care \nplans under this conference report will be able to achieve lower prices \nfor seniors because they will enjoy over $12 billion in slush fund \nmoney from a so called ``stabilization fund'' that is included in the \nconference report language. These are not options or choices nor do \nthey represent a level playing field for traditional Medicare, and I \nfear they will hurt rural America and represent the first steps in a \nscheme being pushed by this Administration to fully privatize the \nMedicare program.\n  With a budget allocation of $400 billion this year for a new Medicare \ndrug benefit, Congress had a great opportunity to reach a long awaited \ngoal. The bill I supported in the Senate was the start in the right \ndirection towards meeting that goal and I am so disappointed that what \nis before us today has taken far too many steps in the wrong direction. \nColleagues, seniors deserve better than this and I deeply regret I \ncannot support this conference report.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today I discuss the energy conference report, \nand begin by commending the Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee for his tireless work to pull together such a \ncomprehensive measure. The energy conference report attempts to improve \nour Nation's energy supply and reliability, and for that it should be \npraised. Unfortunately, it also contains numerous provisions that will \ndistort competitive markets for energy through subsidies, tax breaks, \nspecial projects, mandates and, last but not least, outlandish amounts \nof Federal spending.\n  Mr. President, I have been particularly interested in the provisions \nin the electricity title that are designed to restructure our \nelectricity markets. Some of my colleagues have been tempted to move \nimmediately to completely unregulated electricity markets; others \nfavored imposing a more stringent regulatory regime as a result of \nproblems in California.\n  Representing Arizona, I was well aware of the problems stemming from \nthe California energy crisis, but cannot agree with those who say the \nsolution is to return to a command-and-control regulatory structure. I \ncontinue to believe that the most efficient way to allocate resources \nis through competitive markets. The chairman has done an admirable job \nof trying to encourage competitive markets while making sure that \nconsumers continue to pay the lowest possible price for energy \nresources.\n  There are several provisions in this bill that hit the right balance \nfor our electricity policy. The legislation repeals the Public Utility \nHolding Company Act of 1935. As we all know, our energy markets have \nevolved significantly since the era of the Great Depression. State \nregulators are smarter, more well-equipped, and able to protect \nconsumers from the ills that gave rise to the Public Utility Holding \nCompany Act of 1935 nearly 70 years ago.\n  I am also pleased that the conference report has found the right \nbalance with respect to delineating the jurisdictional reach of the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC. As a Senator from the West, \nI've been frustrated by FERC's effort to impose a mandatory \n``Government knows best'' one-size-fits all standard electric market \ndesign, or SMD, on all regions of the Nation. This proposal has drawn \nsevere criticism from the West and other regions of the country, as \nbeing unworkable and potentially disruptive to the functioning of our \nvital electricity infrastructure, all to the detriment of consumers. \nThis criticism comes from a broad spectrum including State regulators, \nindustry representatives and consumer groups, all of whom express \nconcerns about the inflexibility of the SMD requirements, the untested \nnature of many of them in regions without a history of RTO operations, \nand the potential cost burdens on electricity consumers.\n  Normally, one would have expected an agency like FERC to respond to \nsuch comments at a minimum by delaying its SMD proposal, or proposing a \nmore measured approach, both in scope and mandatory application. \nInstead, FERC has indicated it will proceed with the fundamentals of \nSMD. As a result, Congress has been forced to take the unprecedented \nstep of mandating a pause in SMD, through 2006, to enable those \ninvolved in this critical industry to assess how to proceed. It is \nunfortunate that Congress must, in effect, admonish a Federal agency in \nthis way; but we have an obligation to see that an agency Congress \ncreated proceeds in the deliberate and thoughtful manner that the issue \ndemands.\n  I hope that FERC follows both the spirit and the letter of this law. \nThe Senate will be watching to make sure that FERC does not move \nforward on SMD by changing its name to WMP, or using a different legal \nbasis, such as just and reasonable rates, rather than discrimination. \nChange your agenda, FERC. Don't waste our time by forcing us to save \nthe electrical industry from your zeal to regulate, whether with a \nstandards of conduct rulemaking, a supply margin assessment test, or a \nyet to be designed mistake.\n  For example, the standards of conduct rule, as proposed during the \nSMD development period, represents a direct attack on the internal \norganization of vertically integrated utilities. Before the proposed \nrule is finalized, it must be amended to eliminate elements that \nparallel the SMD proposal. The assertion of jurisdiction over retail \nsales of vertically integrated utilities is clearly within the scope of \nSMD.\n  We understand that FERC has and will continue to have matters before \nit that may also involve issues raised in the SMD NOPR. We have \nproposed savings provisions in the bill that are intended to permit \nFERC to resolve those issues when they arise. However, the savings \nprovisions do not detract from the clear mandate that FERC not act \nprior to the end of 2006 on SMD or\n\n[[Page S15903]]\n\nany rule or order of general application within the scope of the \nproposed SMD rulemaking.\n  I have often expressed my concern with what some industry officials \nhave termed a jurisdictional reach by the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission into the delivery of power to retail customers. The service \nobligation amendment that I worked on with the chairman has been \nincluded in this package, and I believe it provides a commonsense way \nto promote competitive markets while preserving the reliability that \nretail electric consumers expect and deserve. In its actions governing \naccess to transmission systems, FERC has not adequately ensured that \nthe native load customers, for whom the system was constructed, can \nrely on the system to keep the lights on. The bill adds a new section \n217 to the Federal Power Act to ensure that native load customers' \nrights to the system, including load growth, are protected.\n  It is also worth noting that the conference report expands \njurisdiction over those stakeholders in electric markets that were \npreviously unregulated by the FERC. The FERC-lite provision that \naddresses the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's efforts to provide \nopen access over all transmission facilities in the U.S. again, in my \nmind, strikes the right balance. It requires FERC to ensure that \ntransmission owners--whether they are municipal utilities, power \nmarketing administrations, or electric cooperatives--deliver power at \nterms that are not discriminatory or preferential. However, this \nprovision is limited and does not give FERC the ability to begin \nregulating the rate-setting activities of these organizations. If FERC \nfinds fault with the transmission rates of such an organization, the \nbill provides that FERC will remand the rates to the local rate-setting \nbody for reconsideration. FERC-lite does not confer further authority \nto FERC over public power systems. FERC cannot order structural or \norganizational changes in an unregulated transmitting utility to comply \nwith this section. For example, if an integrated utility providing a \nbundled retail service operates transmission distribution and retail \nsales out of a single operational office, the commission cannot require \nfunctional separation of transmission operations from retail sales \noperations.\n\n  I would also like to mention the new refund authority provision in \nthe bill. I understand that the purpose of the new section 206(e) of \nthe Federal Power Act is to permit FERC to order refunds where a \ngovernmental entity voluntarily enters the wholesale market and acts \negregiously. Section 206(e) gives FERC authority to order refunds where \na governmental entity voluntarily enters a FERC-regulated market, makes \nshort-term wholesale sales and violates FERC's substantive rules of \ngeneral applicability governing other sellers into that market. Section \n206(e) provides a means to correct market abuse; it is not meant to be \na back door to full FERC jurisdiction over governmental entities.\n  The chairman should also be commended for what is not in this bill. I \nnote that there are some who wanted to include a renewable portfolio \nstandard. I commend the chairman and the Chairman of the Budget \nCommittee for convincing fellow conferees that a renewable portfolio \nstandard would be costly and yield few benefits. I am also pleased that \nthe chairman saw the wisdom of not including a climate-change \nprovision.\n  Gratifying, as well, is that the conference report has not pursued a \ncommand-and-control approach with respect to regional transmission \norganizations, or RTOs. I believe the best approach, which is captured \nin this conference report, is for FERC to provide incentives to \nencourage membership in RTOs and independent system operators. As \nlawmakers, we need to be sensitive to the policy changes we propose and \nhow the laws we draft will affect Wall Street and the markets, and we \nmust make sure we promote the investments that are needed. This is a \nprime example of how the conference report has sought to advance \npolicies to which the investment community can respond favorably.\n  Related to the need to give clear signals to the investment \ncommunity, I believe that the participant-funding provisions have \nplaced FERC in the appropriate role of providing incentives to invest \nin transmission infrastructure. As a member of the Energy Committee, I \nhave heard countless hours of testimony on the Nation's transmission \ngrid being woefully underfunded, and the urgent need for significant \nupgrades to meet energy demands in the future. The provision on \nparticipant funding address this need and gives FERC the appropriate \ninstructions to adapt methodologies for particular regions.\n  As I have said, some important provisions of this conference \nagreement have much to recommend them. Still, I find the bill's many \ntax subsidies--most in the form of tax credits--to be irresponsible, \nunnecessary, and inefficient. There are just too many of them to permit \nme, in good conscience, to vote for this bill.\n  My overarching concern has to do with the use of tax credits by the \ngovernment. The Federal Government uses tax credits to induce \nindividuals or businesses to engage in favored activities. This can \ndistort the market and cause individuals or businesses to undertake \nunproductive economic activity that they might not have done absent the \ninducement. Tax credits are really appropriations that are run through \nthe Internal Revenue Code, the Code, and are a way to give Federal \nsubsidies, disguised as tax cuts, to favored constituencies. It is \nsomething we should do sparingly--very sparingly. While tax credits can \nbe effective in encouraging activities we consider laudable for one \nreason or another, I believe that, as stewards of the taxpayers' money, \nwe must only support those credits that provide broad benefit to all \ntaxpayers and that are worth the revenue they will cost the Federal \nTreasury.\n  I do not believe that any of the tax credits in the conference \nagreement meet these tests. Let me highlight three particular \nprovisions. The conference agreement extends and expands the credit \nprovided in section 45 of the Code. This credit is available on a per-\nkilowatt-hour basis for energy produced from wind, solar, closed-loop \nbiomass, open-loop biomass, geothermal, small irrigation, and municipal \nsolid waste. I believe that the credit for wind energy should have \nsunset several years ago. Wind energy has been provided this credit \nsince 1992 and if it is not competitive after a decade of taxpayer \nsubsidies, it will never be competitive. In 2001, the wind industry was \nin fact touting its great success and competitiveness with other forms \nof energy, but here we are extending the wind credit for 3 more years. \nAll of the credits I just mentioned, except wind and closed-loop \nbiomass, are eligible for the credit for the first time in this bill. I \nwager that we will still be paying for the ``temporary'' advantage \nbeing given to these new energy forms a decade from now.\n  Let me point out that it's good that the conference agreement calls \nfor a study of the section 45 credits. If we are going to spend more \nthan $3 billion on these credits, we should at least know whether they \nare having a positive effect and whether these forms of energy will \never be able to survive without a taxpayer subsidy. A 2002 Cato \nInstitute study suggests that section 45 is not worth the expense; some \neconomists estimate that the cost is double the benefit.\n  Another of the credits provided in the agreement is the tax credit \nfor biodiesel fuel. In addition to questions I have about the need for \nthis credit, I have heard concerns from companies located in Arizona \nthat this credit might have unintended results, including affecting \nmarket prices for tallow and glycerin, which are byproducts of \nbiodiesel production. I strongly encourage the Finance Committee staff \nto closely monitor whether and how the biodiesel credit affects the \nmarket prices for these products.\n  Finally, the conference agreement provides tax credits for the \npurchase of a new qualified fuel cell, hybrid, or alternative fuel \nmotor vehicles. I have grave concerns about this provision and I refer \nmy colleagues to Arizona's disastrous experience with its alternative \nfuel vehicle tax incentives. The program could have cost Arizona half a \nbillion dollars--11 percent of the State's budget--if it had not been \nrepealed. When proposed, the cost of the program was projected to be \nonly between $3 million and $10 million--less\n\n[[Page S15904]]\n\nthan 10 percent of its true cost. The Joint Committee on Taxation \nestimates that the provision in this conference agreement will cost \n$2.23 billion over 10 years. While I appreciate that the Finance \nCommittee incorporated several changes to reflect lessons learned from \nArizona's experience, I seriously doubt we can be confident about the \nrevenue estimate for these provisions of the conference agreement. \nThat's why I am particularly disturbed that it deletes a requirement \nthat was in the Senate bill for a study of the credits. Such a study \ncould have given Congress important information about how much the \ncredits are costing, how effective they are at encouraging the purchase \nof alternative fuel vehicles, and how long the credits will be needed.\n\n  Beyond the issue of tax credits, I would also like to say a word or \ntwo about the tax provisions that were included in this legislation \nthat I believe have merit. These generally have to do with assigning \nmore realistic depreciation recovery periods to various energy-related \ninvestments. For example, the agreement assigns a 7-year life to \nnatural gas gathering pipelines and a 15-year life to natural gas \ndistribution lines. I strongly believe that the Code requires a great \nmany investments to be depreciated over too long a time period, so I am \npleased the agreement begins addressing this problem.\n  Next, I want to discuss an issue that I had hoped would be addressed \nin the conference report that will accompany the agreement, but that \nwas not included. I had hoped that one aspect of the transmission issue \nwould be addressed in the conference with some simple report language. \nThat issue has to do with the electricity supplied in the evolving \nmarketplace by publicly owned utilities. Unfortunately, the conference \nreport does not address this issue and I raise it now as something I \nhope the Treasury Department will address.\n  A significant goal of this bill is to foster open access to the \ngreatest extent possible. However, in recognition of the limitations \nimposed by section 141 of the Code, the electricity title provides that \nStates and municipalities may not be ordered to provide transmission \nservices in a manner which would result in any bonds ceasing to be \ntreated as obligations the interest on which is excluded from gross \nincome.\n  As my colleagues may know, the applicable Treasury regulations are \nflexible in applying section 141 where transmission facilities are \noperated by an independent transmission operator, ITO, approved by \nFERC. The Treasury regulations, however, are significantly less \nflexible for other open access transmission where the facilities are \nnot operated by an ITO. In addition, the conferees are aware that final \nregulations relating to the allocation of private business use to \nfacilities and portions thereof financed with funds other than tax-\nexempt bond proceeds prior to allocating such private business use to \ntax-exempt bond proceeeds--the ``Equity First'' rules--have not been \nissued, although an advance notice of proposed rulemaking has been \nissued.\n  Accordingly, in recognition of the purposes of the act, I would ask \nthe Treasury Department to strongly consider: (1) Amending the \nregulations or providing other general guidance relating to the use of \ntransmission for open access to provide the same degree of broad \nflexibility whether or not the facilities are operated by an ITO, and \n(2) issuing proposed and final regulations relating to Equity First for \noutput facilities as expeditiously as possible, taking into account the \npublic comments submitted.\n  Fleixible guidance on both these points would greatly assist the \nNation's publicly owned utilities in contributing to the reliability in \nthe electricity grid that this bill seeks to implement.\n  Now for ethanol. The ethanol provisions of the conference report are \ntruly remarkable. They mandate that Americans use 5 billion gallons of \nethanol annually by 2012. We use 1.7 billion gallons now. For what \npurpose, I ask, does Congress so egregiously manipulate the national \nmarket for vehicle fuel? No proof exists that the ethanol mandate will \nmake our air cleaner. In fact, in Arizona, the State Department of \nEnvironmental Quality has found that more ethanol use will degrade air \nquality, which will probably force areas in Arizona out of attainment \nwith the Clean Air Act. Arizonans will suffer. Furthermore, according \nto the Energy Information Administration, this mandate--costing between \n$6.7 and $8 billion a year--will force Americans to pay more for \ngasoline. Nor is an ethanol mandate needed to keep the ethanol industry \nalive. That industry already receives a hefty amount of Federal \nlargesse. CRS estimates that the ethanol and corn industries have \ngotten more than $29 billion in subsidies since 1996. Yet, this bill \nnot only mandates that we more than double our ethanol use, but \nprovides even more subsidies for the industry--as much as $26 billion \nover the next 5 years.\n  Professor David Pimentel, of the College of Agriculture and Life \nSciences at Cornell, has studied ethanol. He is a true expert on the \n``corn-to-car'' fuel process. His verdict, in a recent study: ``Abusing \nour precious croplands to grow corn for an energy-inefficient process \nthat yields low-grade automobile fuel amounts to unsustainable, \nsubsidized food burning.'' It isn't efficient. The fuel is low-grade. \nAnd what is more, Congress, by going in for ``unsustainable, subsidized \nfood burning,'' will impede the natural innovation in clean fuels that \nwould occur with a competitive market, free of the Government's \nmanipulation. These ethanol provisions, alone, dictate that I vote \nagainst the bill.\n  So, in conclusion, while this bill includes several meritorious \nprovisions, especially those negotiated by Chairman Domenici, I must \nvote against it because of the $24 billion in tax subsidies and the \nbill's irresponsible manipulation of the energy markets through an \nethanol mandate.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I support the Medicare conference report \nthat is before us.\n  This was not an easy decision, because the conference report is far \nfrom perfect, but I believe it is the right decision for three reasons.\n  First, most basically, the bill provides $400 billion to add a \nvoluntary prescription drug benefit in Medicare. Prescription drugs are \nan integral part of modern medicine. Yet they are not covered by \nMedicare today. No other health insurance program in this country today \nfails to cover prescription drugs. It is long past time to add drug \ncoverage to Medicare.\n  The bill before us creates a voluntary prescription drug benefit in \nthe Medicare program starting in 2006. Here's how it would work. Those \nbeneficiaries who choose to sign up for this benefit will pay a premium \nestimated to average $35/month starting in 2006. Beneficiaries would \nthen have to meet a deductible of $250 in out-of-pocket spending on \nprescription drugs. Above $250, Medicare will pay 75 percent of the \nnext $2000 in drug costs. Then, the benefit cuts off. Medicare will pay \nnothing until the beneficiary has paid an additional $2850 out-of-\npocket. Beyond this gap in coverage, Medicare will then pay 95 percent \nof all additional drug costs.\n  Obviously, this is not a perfect drug benefit. It is not the drug \nbenefit I would have designed. And it is going to fall short of many \nseniors' expectations. The simple reality is that one cannot produce a \ncomprehensive drug benefit that looks like the private health insurance \ncoverage most Americans are used to for just $400 billion.\n  But the $400 billion in drug benefits provided by the conference \nreport will mean a significant improvement in health coverage for \nmillions of seniors across the country. It will provide a meaningful--\nif imperfect--benefit to seniors who currently have no coverage, and it \nwill offer more comprehensive coverage and catastrophic protection to \nseniors who currently rely on medigap plans. This is a step forward. If \nwe do not pass the bill before us today, seniors could be forced to \nwait years before we get another opportunity to update the Medicare \nProgram. In my view, we need to take this opportunity to lock in a \nprescription drug benefit now. We can come back later to fill in the \ngaps in coverage and fix the other troubling provisions of this bill.\n  Second, the bill provides a very generous benefit for low income \nseniors--those with incomes below 150 percent of the Federal poverty \nlevel, or about $13,470 for singles and $18,180 for couples. Seniors in \nthis category--about 40 percent of the seniors in my State--\n\n[[Page S15905]]\n\nwill not face a gap in coverage. They will get the vast majority of \ntheir drugs covered, with minimal out-of-pocket costs. In addition, \nthey will get a $600 annual credit toward their drug costs in 2004 and \n2005 before the main drug benefit takes effect. These low income \nseniors by definition are the ones who most need help paying \nprescription drug costs.\n  In particular, all seniors with incomes below the Federal poverty \nlevel--about $8,980 in annual income for singles and $12,120 for \ncouples--will pay no premium. They will pay no deductible. They will \nhave no gap in coverage. They will pay just $1 for generic \nprescriptions and $3 for brand-name drugs.\n  Those with incomes up to 135 percent of the poverty level and less \nthan $6,000 in countable assets will also pay no premium. They will pay \nno deductible. They will have no gap in coverage. And they will pay \nonly $2 for generic drugs and $5 for most brand-name medications.\n  Those seniors with incomes above these thresholds, but still below \n150 percent of the poverty level, will pay a sliding scale premium \nbased on income. They will pay a $50 deductible. And they will pay 15 \npercent coinsurance on all their medications, until their drug costs \nreach $3600. After that, they will pay only 5 percent coinsurance. \nSeniors who qualify for any of these low income benefits will get an \nextremely generous drug plan. In my view, this benefit alone is a very \nsignificant achievement.\n  Third, the bill includes a whole host of rural provider provisions \nthat I authored or coauthored. Currently, rural areas face huge payment \ndisparities. For example, Mercy Hospital in Devils Lake, ND, gets paid \njust half as much as Our Lady of Mercy Hospital in New York City for \ntreating exactly the same patient with exactly the same illness. Yet \nhospitals in North Dakota don't pay half as much for equipment as their \nurban counterparts. And rural hospitals have much smaller patient loads \nover which to spread their costs. As a result, rural hospitals are on \nthe brink of financial failure. These hospitals are critical economic \nanchors in their communities. Other rural health care providers, from \nclinics to home health to ambulance services, face similar payment \ninequities. This bill will go a long way to eliminating some of the \nMedicare funding inequities that have hurt rural health care. It will \nhelp make sure rural Medicare beneficiaries continue to have adequate \naccess to health care.\n  Specifically, this bill will close the gap in standardized payment \nrates, which will ensure rural hospitals' base payments are equal to \nthose of urban providers. The legislation also takes important steps to \naddress inequities in the wage index system, which is intended to \naccount for labor costs. And it provides a new, low-volume adjustment \npayments for facilities serving the smallest communities in the state. \nIn addition, the Medicare bill includes important provisions to improve \nthe Critical Access Hospital Program. Today, about 28 hospitals in my \nstate have this designation. This bill will place them on sounder \nfinancial footing.\n  Along with the provisions to assist North Dakota hospitals, the \nMedicare bill will also address payment inequities experienced by our \nphysicians and will ensure they do not face payment cuts in the coming \nyears. There are also new adjustments for home health care providers \nand ambulance services. I hope these provisions will make a real \ndifference in their ability to continue providing quality care across \nour state. In total, this part of the bill is a very significant \nvictory for rural America.\n  For these three reasons, I have concluded that we should pass this \nbill, but we should not oversell it either. As I noted at the outset, \nthis bill is--in many respects--very disappointing. Quite simply, it \ncould and should have been a much better bill.\n  Democrats in the last Congress put together a prescription drug bill \nthat I was proud to sponsor. It provided a good drug benefit to all \nseniors. It did not have any gaps in coverage, where seniors would \ncontinue to pay monthly premiums but get no assistance from Medicare \nwith their drug benefits. It did not rely on creating a whole new type \nof insurance plan to meet the drug needs of seniors. Instead, it used \nthe delivery mechanism that the private sector uses to provide drug \ncoverage. It was a bill that would have provided much more \ncomprehensive prescription drug coverage to seniors at a reasonable \nprice. Compared to what we have before us today, it was simple and \neasily understandable for seniors. It did not have a complex scheme of \ndiffering copayments, coverage gaps, and premiums. But that bill was \nblocked by Republicans.\n  This year, the leadership on the other side appears to have put \nideology and special interests ahead of the interests of seniors in \ncrafting many of the details of this drug bill. As a result, seniors \nwill be facing an untested delivery model that may not provide the \nadvertised benefits at the advertised prices. The simple fact is that \nthere is no such thing as a private, drug-only insurance plan in the \ncommercial insurance market anywhere in this country. They just do not \nexist. By contrast, we have a proven, successful delivery model in the \ntraditional Medicare program. It works just fine in providing medical \nand hospital coverage to seniors today. Yet, in drafting this bill, the \nauthors insisted that the plan rely on untested private, drug-only \ninsurance plans. However, it is possible that no such plans will \nmaterialize. Or they may be highly unstable--entering a region one \nyear, just to turn around and leave the next year if they are not \nmaking a profit.\n  In my view, it is a serious mistake to set up a system that could \nforce seniors to change drug plans every year. Under this approach, \neach year seniors could face a different premium, different coinsurance \ncharges, and different lists of covered drugs. I think seniors will be \nvery surprised to learn that they will not have the same benefit from \nyear to year. During consideration of the Senate version of this bill, \nI fought to correct this plan. My amendment would have allowed seniors \nto stay in a government-sponsored back-up plan if they liked it. But \nthat effort was rejected by those who insist--in a triumph of hope over \nexperience--that private drug-only plans will work even though they do \nnot exist today.\n  In the conference, the option was further scaled back to make it even \nless likely that seniors can choose a stable, government sponsored \nbackup. The Senate bill required that seniors be given the option of \nenrolling in the so-called fallback plan if they did not have at least \ntwo private drug-only plans to choose from. But the conference report \nwill not give seniors the fallback option if there is just one private \ndrug only plan available, so long as there is also a managed care \nPreferred Provider Organization plan in the region. I fear that this \nwill give seniors an unpalatable choice if they want access to drug \nbenefits. Either they will have to join a PPO that restricts their \naccess to health care providers of their choice, or they will have to \njoin the one private drug-only plan even if it charges excessive \npremiums.\n  That brings me to another area that I think will be a surprise to \nseniors: the variation in premiums. The authors of this bill like to \ntalk about how the premiums will be $35 a month. But what they don't \ntell seniors is that $35 a month is just an estimate. Individual drug \nplans will have premiums that can vary substantially. If the drug \nplan's projected cost for delivering the benefit is only slightly \nhigher than the national average--a real concern in many areas--the \npremium would be substantially higher than $35 a month. I think seniors \nwill be very surprised to learn that their premiums may actually be as \nmuch as $45 or $50 a month instead of the $35 that has been advertised. \nThese differences will be compounded because monthly premiums will \nincrease each year in line with the increase in prescription drug \ncosts.\n  The thing about this bill that might be the biggest surprise for \nseniors will be the coverage gap, sometimes called the donut hole. The \nauthors of the bill understandably don't want to advertise this gap in \ncoverage. Many seniors probably don't even know that it exists. But \nwhen they hit this gap in coverage, they are going to be mighty \nsurprised. The will discover that Medicare isn't covering one penny of \ntheir drug costs even though their monthly part D premium keeps coming \nout of their Social Security checks. And they're\n\n[[Page S15906]]\n\ngoing to be doubly surprised when they find out that the gap isn't a \nlittle more than $1000 wide, but is closer to $3000.\n  The authors of the bill like to talk about a coverage gap from $2250 \nin drug costs to $3600 in drug costs. When you read the fine print, you \nlearn that the real gap is from $2250 to $5100. That's because the \n$2250 counts all drug costs, by both Medicare and the beneficiary. But \nthe $3600 counts only spending by the beneficiary. When total spending \nhits $2250, the beneficiary has paid $750--the $250 deductible and 25 \npercent coinsurance on the amount from $250 to $2250. So Medicare won't \npay another dime until the beneficiary has paid an additional $2850 \nout-of-pocket.\n  Some who are watching might ask, Who in their right mind would design \na drug benefit that starts, then stops, then starts again, the way this \none does? Why does the benefit have this gap in coverage? The answer is \nsimple: money. It would cost tens of billion of dollars to close this \ngap. The folks on the other side of the aisle made tax cuts for the \nwealthy a higher priority than a prescription drug benefit for middle \nincome seniors. As a result, they didn't have enough money left over to \nprovide a drug benefit without this gap in coverage. By most estimates, \nabout one third of all seniors will reach a point at some time during \nthe year when Medicare just stops paying any part of their drug bills. \nThey will keep paying premiums, but Medicare will not pay another dime \nuntil and unless they reach the catastrophic spending threshold.\n  Finally, I am concerned about the effect of this contorted benefit \nstructure on retiree drug coverage. Millions of seniors currently have \nretiree health coverage that provides more generous prescription drug \ncoverage than this bill will provide. When the Senate passed its bill \nlast June, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that one third of \nthose with retiree drug coverage would lose that coverage because \nspending by an employer plan does not count toward reaching the \ncatastrophic coverage threshold. In other words, if you have employer \ncoverage, no drug spending by your employer plan counts toward the \n$3600 you have to spend out of your own pocket before the catastrophic \ncoverage kicks in. This provision creates a clear incentive for \nemployers to cut back or drop coverage so that a beneficiary will more \nquickly reach the catastrophic coverage threshold and Medicare--not the \nemployer--will pay the remaining costs.\n\n  When this bill passed the Senate, I said it was not a Cadillac drug \nplan. It wasn't even a Chevy drug plan. Instead, it was a bare bones \nplan. To stretch that analogy, in conference, some of the bones got \nfractured, leaving the plan even weaker, and some of those bones were \nreplaced with untested artificial substitutes that may not work the way \nthey have been advertised.\n  The conferees did not just widen the coverage gap and decrease the \nstability of the fallback drug plans that will be important in many \nrural and other areas of the country. They also loaded down those weak \nold bones with a new, heavy load: This bill now is carrying a number of \nprovisions that, in my view, will harm the Medicare program and our \nhealth care system.\n  For example, the bill requires demonstration projects to privatize \nthe Medicare program, taking the first steps in turning it from a \ndefined benefit entitlement to a voucher program. I am pleased that \nthis demonstration has been limited to just six areas. I am hopeful \nthat even these few demonstrations may not get off the ground. I, \nnonetheless, strongly oppose this effort. This policy will allow \nprivate plans to cherry-pick younger, healthier beneficiaries, leaving \nolder, sicker beneficiaries to face higher premiums in the traditional \nMedicare program. This is terrible health policy, and I hope we will \nsucceed in reversing it in the future.\n  The bill also contain a $10.5 billion ``stabilization fund'' that \nallows the Secretary of HHS to make additional payments to managed care \nplans. This slush fund will just add to the substantial overpayment of \nmanaged care plans that already exists in the Medicare plan. To me, it \nmakes no sense to talk about managed care saving money for Medicare \nwhen it costs Medicare more to move people into managed care. Why \nshould we pay managed care billions and billions of dollars more than \nwe would pay in traditional Medicare to provide the same benefit? That \nmoney could have been put to far better use in other ways, either by \nimproving the drug benefit or by devoting money to chronic care disease \nmanagement in traditional Medicare.\n  The fact is that about 5 percent of Medicare beneficiaries account \nfor roughly 50 percent of total Medicare spending. These beneficiaries \noften have a number of conditions, but they don't get coordinated care \nbecause they see different doctors for different problems. This can \nresult in adverse drug interactions, the failure to treat underlying \ncauses rather than symptoms, and higher spending than necessary. Yet \nMedicare does nothing today to coordinate care in the traditional \nMedicare program that serves nearly 90 percent of all beneficiaries. \nSpending a little money up front in this bill could produce significant \ncost savings over time for the Medicare program. I hope we will be able \nto find money to expand the chronic care demonstrations in the bill.\n  The bill also expands health savings accounts that are both bad tax \npolicy and bad health policy. These accounts will allow both untaxed \ncontributions and untaxed withdrawals, a terrible precedent. If it is \ncopied for other tax-preferred savings accounts, this policy could have \ndevastating consequences for the future of our tax base. Moreover, like \nthe privatization voucher program, health savings accounts fragment the \nhealth insurance market, undermining the fundamental principle of \nspreading risk that allows insurance markets to work. Health savings \naccounts will pull wealthier, healthier workers out of the insurance \npool, giving upper income taxpayers significant tax savings. Those who \nremain in traditional insurance plans--average workers who would gain \nlittle in tax benefits from the HSAs and those with significant medical \ncosts--will then face higher premiums. This is the first step toward \ncreating a two-tiered health system in this country. I oppose this \npolicy. The money spent on these tax giveaways could have been far \nbetter spent to help ensure that existing retiree health coverage is \nnot eroded.\n  Finally, the bill fails completely to impose any restraint on the \ncosts of prescription drugs. One of the chief complaints I hear from \nNorth Dakota seniors is that drugs cost far too much. I had hoped that \nMedicare--which has been more successful in holding down health care \ncost increases than the private sector--could use its enormous market \nclout to negotiate lower costs for prescription drugs. Unfortunately, \nthe bill does not do that. In fact, the bill contains language that \nspecifically prohibits Medicare from using its market clout to \nnegotiate with pharmaceutical companies.\n  In addition, the conference failed to include a strong provision on \ndrug reimportation that was passed by the House of Representatives. As \na result, Americans will not be able to access lower cost medications \nfrom other countries. Reimportation will not serve as a brake on rising \ndrug costs in this country. As a result, the Congressional Budget \nOffice tells us the bill will accelerate increases in the costs of \nprescription drugs.\n  These are serious flaws. I wish many of the provisions were far, far \nbetter. I wish other provisions had never been included. But at the end \nof the day, we are faced with the question: Is this bill, with all its \nflaws, better than doing nothing?\n  For me, the answer is yes. For millions of seniors who do not have \naccess to any kind of prescription drug coverage at any price, this \nwill give them a new option to have a portion of their drug costs \ncovered. Millions of low income seniors will be significantly better \noff, with a new generous drug benefit that they do not now have. Rural \nhealth care facilities that are now on the brink of closure because \nthey are underpaid for their services will get a new life from the \nrural Medicare reimbursement provisions in the bill.\n  Even with these significant victories, if I thought this bill \nfundamentally threatened the existing Medicare program, I could not \nsupport it. I know that there are some who sincerely believe that the \nprivatization demonstrations will fundamentally undermine the program. \nAlthough I share their view that these demonstrations are bad policy--\nperhaps even terrible policy--I\n\n[[Page S15907]]\n\ndo not believe that six demonstration projects affecting less than 5 \npercent of all Medicare beneficiaries will destroy Medicare.\n  Although this bill is far from perfect, I have concluded that we \nshould pass it. On balance, this bill is a step in the right direction. \nWe do not know when we will have another, better bill that can pass the \nCongress and be signed into law. In my view, it would not be fair to \nthose seniors--including tens of thousand of North Dakota seniors--who \nhave no access to drug coverage of any kind at any price to deny them \nthis first step in the uncertain hope that we might be able to do \nbetter at some point in the future. Rather, we must take the $400 \nbillion opportunity that is on the table today and start providing \nprescription drug coverage to America's seniors. Then we can and we \nwill go to work to improve the prescription drug benefit provided by \nthis bill.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I voted against this bill today because I \nwould never do anything that risks the future of Medicare, and I fear \nthis bill takes the first steps toward the breakup of the traditional \nMedicare Program. In addition, this administration's misplaced \npriorities put enormous tax cuts first and left us little room to \nprovide the comprehensive and fair drug benefit that seniors deserve. \nWe should have done this right and provided a better drug benefit \nwithout jeopardizing the Medicare Program that has given seniors health \nsecurity for 38 years.\n  My vote today was one of the more difficult decisions I have faced in \nmy Senate career. For starters, let me note that not all of this bill \nis bad. Some people will get help with their drug costs. We in Delaware \nare fortunate to already benefit from unique programs that have long \nhelped low-income seniors with their prescription drug costs, and this \nbill should build upon that foundation. It also offers some coverage to \nmany middle class seniors and disabled citizens. All in all, these \naspects of this bill are not enormously different from those in the \nSenate-passed bill that I voted for earlier this year.\n  This bill also includes sorely needed payment adjustments for \nhospitals, doctors, and other health care providers, which will ensure \nthat Medicare patients get quality care and continued access to \nimportant medical services.\n  On the downside, however, this legislation still has a large gap in \ncoverage--forced by budget constraints--in which the Government \nprovides no subsidy for prescription drugs. I know that many people \nwill find this gap confusing, disappointing, and burdensome. I am also \nvery concerned that this bill does not sufficiently protect millions of \nretirees who currently receive good health care benefits from their \nformer employers.\n  If we had done this the right way, we would have held back on some of \nthe excessive tax cuts pushed through over the last three years and \nallocated more of our resources to meeting our obligation to provide a \ncomplete prescription drug benefit. Instead, the administration's \nmisplaced priorities tied our hands.\n  If this legislation were just limited to the prescription drug \nbenefit and the provider payment modifications, it would probably have \nmy vote as being about as good as could be done under the current \nbudget circumstances. But I have very serious concerns about other \nprovisions tacked onto this bill that will take the Medicare Program \nand the health care benefits for 40 million Americans into uncharted \nand hazardous waters. This bill takes the first step toward monumental \nchanges in the very foundation of how Medicare operates, beginning a \npush toward the breakup of the entire program.\n  The strength of the Medicare system has been its broad coverage, its \nsimplicity, and the open choices patients enjoy. This bill sets in \nmotion a new system that could tear down each of these advantages.\n  On balance I cannot support this legislation. To me, the negative \nfeatures have such damaging potential that they overwhelm the benefits. \nHad the negotiations on this bill been done in the open, with the full \nparticipation of both parties, I think we could have crafted a better \nbill. I cannot vote for a bill that sets us on the path toward \nundermining the traditional Medicare Program that has worked so well \nfor decades.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today we passed historic Medicare \nlegislation. Getting here was not easy. Behind the scenes, for months \nand even years, staff has worked incredibly hard to help produce this \ncomplex and comprehensive bill.\n  In particular, I would like to thank Senator Baucus' Finance \nCommittee staff who put in countless hours and remained dedicated to \nthis legislation during long and difficult late-night and weekend \nsessions. Dr. Elizabeth Fowler lead the Finance health team. Dr. \nFowler's expertise, even-handedness, and professionalism were critical \nin getting us to where we are today. Other professional staff, \nincluding Jon Blum, Pat Bousliman, Andrea Cohen, Bill Dauster and \nDaniel Stein, all served the entire U.S. Senate and served us well. The \nMinority Staff Director, Jeff Forbes, was also instrumental in seeing \nthis legislation through until the end. We were able to achieve many \nDemocratic priorities in this bill because of their hard work and \ndedication.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Grassley's staff on the Senate \nFinance Committee for the critical role they played in passing this \nhistoric legislation. Linda Fishman, Ted Totman, Colin Roskey, Jennifer \nBell, Mark Hayes and Leah Kegler worked tirelessly for many months to \nget a bill drafted, through the Senate Finance Committee, passed on the \nSenate floor and out of tough conference negotiations with the House. \nThe majority staff director of the Senate Finance Committee, Kolan \nDavis, also played an integral role in getting this conference report \npassed.\n  Our Nation's senior citizens owe the whole Senate Finance Committee \nteam a debt of gratitude for making this Medicare legislation possible. \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I cannot support the Medicare \nprescription drug conference report before us. I share in the \ndisappointment of the many seniors, advocacy groups, providers, and \ncolleagues in Congress who have fought so long to provide Medicare \nbeneficiaries with prescription drug coverage. Drug coverage should be \nan integral part of any meaningful health care insurance and it is \ncertain that if Medicare were created today, no one would imagine \nexcluding drug coverage. Unfortunately, the bill before us now has \nwasted an opportunity to give Medicare beneficiaries the affordable and \ncomprehensive coverage they deserve. The conference report provides \ninadequate coverage while at the same time undermining Medicare, a \nprogram that has served our seniors for over 37 years.\n  Under this bill, Medicare beneficiaries will pay an estimated premium \nof $35 per month although that premium level is not guaranteed and it \ncould be higher. After meeting a $250 annual deductible, 75 percent of \na beneficiary's drug costs are covered up to $2,250. A beneficiary \nreceives no coverage for drug costs between $2,251 and $3,600, though \nthey are still required to continue paying monthly premiums during this \ncoverage gap. Once drug costs exceed $3,600, the drug plan would cover \n95 percent of a Medicare beneficiary's drug expenses. This drug benefit \nis insufficient and much less than many retirees receive through \nexisting coverage.\n  Those opposed to offering a more substantial prescription drug \nbenefit claimed there are insufficient resources to pay for it. This \nargument comes from the very people who have pushed through the \nCongress tax-cut programs that tilt heavily in favor of the wealthy. \nOver the last several years, the administration has squandered a \nsurplus and left the Nation facing a deficit already approaching half a \ntrillion dollars. These valuable resources could have been used to \nprovide our Nation's seniors the real drug coverage they deserve.\n  During consideration of the Senate bill, we missed an opportunity to \nprovide Medicare beneficiaries with a substantial, reliable and \nstraightforward prescription drug benefit. I cosponsored and voted for \nan amendment offered by my colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin. His \nalternative would have provided a Medicare-delivered drug benefit that \nwould have allowed the Medicare program to employ negotiating \nstrategies used by the Veterans\n\n[[Page S15908]]\n\nAdministration--VA--and other government entities to bring down drug \nprices. Senator Durbin's plan would have begun as soon as practicable, \nunlike this legislation that leaves beneficiaries waiting until 2006 \nfor the drug benefit to begin.\n  Under Senator Durbin's plan, seniors would have not paid a \ndeductible, would have paid 30 percent of costs, and would have no \ncoverage gap. Once drug costs reach $5,000, 90 percent of their costs \nwould be covered. In addition, employer contributions would count \ntoward out-of-pocket limits so there would be much less risk of \nemployers dropping retiree coverage. This was the proposal we should be \nacting on today.\n  As I emphasized during debate on the conference report, this bill \ncontains a number of provisions that would undermine Medicare. For the \nfirst time in history, Medicare beneficiaries will pay more for their \nPart B premiums based on their income, thereby eroding the universal \nnature of the program. Medicare enjoys widespread support since \neveryone pays the same monthly premium for the same service, thereby \ngiving us a social insurance program in which everyone has an equal \nstake.\n  The bill before us does not deal effectively with the rising costs of \ndrugs. This legislation does not allow the Federal government to bring \nits weight to bear to lower drug costs. Medicare is not allowed to \nbargain on behalf of the millions of beneficiaries who would receive \ndrug benefits. We know that drugs purchased through the VA program cost \nsubstantially less than those purchased at retail value. Furthermore, \nunder this bill drug reimportation is completely at the discretion of \nthe Administration. This is the same Administration that has repeatedly \nexpressed its opposition against drug reimportation even if safeguards \ncan be taken to ensure the safety of the reimported drugs.\n  This bill has the serious potential to cause a number of retirees to \nlose existing employer-sponsored prescription drug coverage. CBO \nestimates that 2.7 million retirees would lose existing coverage. This \nis an unacceptable consequence of legislation that is supposed to make \nlife better for seniors. This serious deficiency has prompted many \nconstituents to call my office to express concern about this bill.\n  Congress began this debate focused on the best way to provide \nMedicare beneficiaries drug coverage and efforts to keep those drugs \naffordable. We now have legislation before us in which the drug benefit \nappears to be an afterthought. I think a deeply troubling aspect of the \nbill is that it takes steps toward privatizing Medicare. This \nlegislation relies on private plans to deliver the drug benefit; \nseniors could be forced to shift from plan-to-plan, year-to-year as \nthey did when Medicare+Choice HMOs pulled out of the Medicare program a \nfew years ago. In my own State of Maryland, insurance companies left \nthe Medicare program, abandoning more than 100,000 seniors.\n  In addition, the bill includes a six-year premium-support \n``demonstration project,'' which would be established in six \nmetropolitan areas. Medicare recipients in these areas would choose \nbetween traditional Medicare and private health plans; if the cost of \nthe selected form of coverage exceeded a benchmark level set for the \narea, the individual pays increased premiums to cover the difference. \nThis bill also contains $12 billion in subsidies for private plans. \nThis funding gives private plans an unfair advantage by enabling them \nto provide benefits that traditional Medicare does not cover. If \nprivate plans were more efficient than Medicare, they would not need \nthis money to compete. This $12 billion should have been used to \nimprove the drug benefit for all Medicare beneficiaries, not to \nunderwrite the private plans.\n  The inclusion of tax savings accounts to pay out-of-pocket medical \nexpenses further underscores how far the focus of the bill has strayed \nfrom providing Medicare beneficiaries prescription drug coverage. The \nbill makes health savings accounts that are currently a limited \ndemonstration project universally available. These accounts could be \nused with high-deductible health policies giving healthy, affluent \nworkers a strong incentive to opt out of comprehensive health insurance \nplans in favor of the new accounts. If large numbers of these workers \nopt out of comprehensive plans, the pool of people left in \ncomprehensive plans would be older and sicker, causing premiums for \ncomprehensive insurance to rise significantly.\n  I have long been a strong supporter of providing older Americans and \ndisabled individuals who rely on Medicare an affordable, comprehensive, \nreliable and voluntary prescription drug benefit. However, I want to \nensure we do so in a way that does not worsen the situation in which \nmany seniors find themselves as they face rapidly rising drug costs. As \nwe consider proposals to expand our Nation's major health entitlement \nprograms, it is appropriate to follow a guiding principle in the \npractice of medicine--do no harm. Our seniors deserve a drug benefit \nthat is a real improvement, not a complex experiment that may cause \nmore trouble than it's worth. We must not enact a law intended to help \nthat might eventually harm millions. The American people deserve \nbetter.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to use the 5 \nminutes reserved for the leader. That has been cleared on both sides.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut. How \nmuch time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. There remain 11 minutes 41 seconds on the \nmajority side, 12 minutes 40 second for the minority. The source is the \nminority leader's time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So we have 12 minutes. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes, 11 minutes 41 second plus the 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, in the limited time we have I would like to \ngo back over and reiterate some points. In the very first instance, \nlooking at the Medicare portion of this bill, right off the bat there \nare almost 9 million seniors who are going to be disadvantaged by this \nlegislation. Almost one-quarter of the 41 million seniors who benefit \nfrom Medicare are going to be disadvantaged by this bill. There are 2.7 \nmillion seniors, according to the Congressional Budget Office, who are \ngoing to lose health benefits currently offered by their former \nemployer. In my State, that is 40,000 people right off the bat. Those \nare CBO numbers; those are not mine, not made up by the minority.\n  Second, 6.4 million low-income seniors will have to pay more for the \ndrugs they need. In my State, that is 74,000 people. The combined \nnumbers are 9 million people, before anything else happens, who are \ngoing to be disadvantaged. This is a fact. If you are on Medicare and \nMedicaid you currently don't have to have a copay when it comes to \nprescription drugs. Now, under this bill, you will. It may not seem \nlike a lot to people, but if you are making $13,470 or less than that, \nbelieve me, even a slight increase in these drug costs can be very \nharmful. That is just a fact.\n  Let me say to my friend from Iowa, I have respect for him and I \nadmire his tenacity and his tremendous effort on behalf of this bill. I \nsay to my friend, $13,470 is not a lot of money for Americans, and if \nyou make $13,471, you are going to pay $420 in premiums, a $250 \ndeductible, and you have to pay 25 percent of the cost of your \nprescription drugs. If you make $13,471, that is what you are going to \nbe burdened with. I appreciate the fact that the very low income get \nsome help, but I do not know anyone in this country who thinks $13,471 \nis a lot of money. But if you hit that number, then you are going to \npay those kinds of costs, and that is going to be tremendously \nburdensome to many people.\n  Second, of course, if you look at chart 2 quickly here, you will see \nthat this bill creates an unlevel playing field. We are told about free \ncompetition and choice. But the fact is, under this bill private plans \nget a 9 percent higher reimbursement than the Medicare plan, and they \nget $12 billion. If you have two competitors trying to appeal to a \nconsumer and one side gets a 9 percent increase in reimbursement rates, \nplus $12 billion to help them get into the market, I don't know how you \ncall that a level playing field. That is not level at all, in my view.\n\n[[Page S15909]]\n\n  If we examine the so-called premium support demonstration programs, \nseniors effected by this experiment are going to be put in situations \nwhere they have less choice. If you end up being pushed into a private \nplan--and you can be under this bill--then your ability to choose your \nown doctor is gone. Talk about choice, there is no more fundamental \nchoice to most Americans than the right to choose the physician who \nwill take care of you, particularly for a senior. But under this \nlegislation, if you are pushed into those plans, you lose the right to \nmake that choice, the opportunity to choose your own doctor.\n  I hardly consider that a step forward or an improvement in the \nMedicare system. It is a major setback.\n  With regard to prescription drug costs, this issue has been made very \nclear by the Senator from Florida. I commend him for it. We are not \nsaying in this legislation that you can go out, as the VA does, and \nconsolidate your membership and then negotiate for prices. As the \nSenator from Florida pointed out, in the case of a couple that has been \nmarried for many years, the price of a drug for the husband, who is a \nveteran who served in Korea and World War II, is going to be \nsubstantially less than the price of the same drug for his wife, who \nwasn't a veteran. How can you explain that to a couple? Why can we not \ndo with Medicare what we do with the VA? It is a logical choice. This \nbill prohibits that from happening.\n  I don't understand, for the life of me, why we are endorsing a \nproposal that doesn't allow the collective buying power of 41 million \nAmericans to go out and lower the cost of prescription drugs. Yet this \nlegislation would prohibit us from doing that.\n  When you look at those issues in this proposal, again I say to my \nfriends who have crafted the prescription drug benefit, there are \ncertainly stated advantages of moving forward with something here. But \nas the lead editorial in my State newspaper pointed out the other day, \nwe can do a lot better with this legislation. It says:\n\n       They deserve better than scrambled eggs that Congress, \n     AARP, and other special interests want to dish out in the \n     guise of ``reform.''\n       The centerpiece of this faux reform is prescription drug \n     coverage. Here is the math: A beneficiary who has \n     prescription drug bills totaling $2,250 a year would have to \n     pay premiums of $420, a deductible of $250 and 25 percent of \n     the cost of medicine.\n\n  For someone in that category, that adds up to $1,252 out of pocket in \ntheir bills. Once the beneficiary's drugs reach $2,250, then they will \nhave to pay the entire bill up to $3,600. Again, I realize you can't \ntake care of everyone here, but that is a tremendous disadvantage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial from the Hartford Courant \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Medicare Reform: Try Again\n\n       It's not perfect, but it's a start. That's the gist of the \n     multimillion-dollar marketing campaign launched by AARP in \n     support of the Medicare bill that passed the House by a 220 \n     to 215 vote early Saturday. The organization that purports to \n     represent Americans who are at least 50 years old pledges to \n     fix the bill's flaws in future years.\n       Beware of such promises. Americans are not looking for a \n     perfect system. They yearn for improvements in Medicare that \n     they can comprehend. They know that Rome wasn't built in a \n     day and prescription drug coverage won't be guaranteed \n     overnight.\n       But Medicare beneficiaries have waited for at least a \n     decade for such coverage. They deserve better than the \n     scrambled egg that Congress, AARP and other special interests \n     want to dish out in the guise of ``reform.''\n       Is it any wonder why shares of health care businesses, \n     particularly drug companies, skyrocketed on Wall Street after \n     the congressional conferees announced the details of the \n     agreement? Lawmakers listened to lobbyists far more \n     attentively than they listened to Medicare beneficiaries.\n       The centerpiece of this faux reform is prescription drug \n     coverage. Here is the math: A beneficiary who has \n     prescription drug bills totaling $2,250 a year would have to \n     pay premiums of $420, a deductible of $250 and 25 percent of \n     the cost of the medicine. That adds up to paying $1,252 out \n     of pocket.\n       Once a beneficiary's drug bills reach $2,250, the \n     beneficiary would have to foot the entire drug bill up to \n     $3,600. Only after drug costs exceed this amount would the \n     prescription plan pay 95 percent of the bills.\n       This package contains little to cheer about. Some \n     provisions deserve jeers. The elderly who had hoped to buy \n     less expensive prescription drugs from Canada and Mexico are \n     out of luck. Those who have paid Medicare payroll taxes would \n     have their benefits linked--for the first time in Medicare's \n     history--to their retirement income. For those who earn more \n     than $80,000 a year, the premiums for Medicare Part B \n     (doctors' bills and other costs not covered by basic \n     Medicare) would increase substantially. So much for relying \n     on government to honor its pledge to treat everyone equally \n     under Part B.\n       Why is AARP aiding and abetting GOP lawmakers in selling \n     such reform under false pretenses? The organization is a big-\n     business operation, with revenue of $608 million last year \n     from its insurance-related operations.\n       ``It's almost unimaginable that--AARP--wouldn't stand to \n     gain'' as a result of this legislation, said David \n     Himmelstein of Harvard Medical School. Alan Simpson, a former \n     GOP senator, hit the bull's-eye when he noted, ``If there was \n     a sublime definition of conflict of interest, it would be \n     AARP from morning to night.''\n       AARP's members should make themselves heard as they did in \n     1988, when the organization successfully lobbied for a flawed \n     catastrophic insurance benefit. The ensuing uproar by elderly \n     people forced Congress to repeal the legislation.\n       On the subject of lobbying, why is AARP still designated as \n     a tax-exempt nonpartisan organization? It shouldn't be.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to reject this bill \nand come back in January and rework it. Forty-one million Americans \ndeserve a lot better than this bill is going to give them.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. There are 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  America's parents and grandparents are the losers today, and special \ninterest groups are the winners. America's senior citizens deserve \nbetter. This bill does nothing to reduce drug prices, and it starts our \nNation down the road toward privatizing Medicare and endangering \nAmerica's lifeline program that has been a bright beacon for seniors \nacross our country for more than four decades. The pharmaceutical \ncompanies and the HMOs will give thanks for this turkey, but America's \nseniors will get stuffed.\n  I am going to vote no on this. I hope my colleagues will join me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's side has 7 minutes 1 second. \nThe other side has 11 minutes 41 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I withhold our time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I consume \nand I invite proponents of the legislation to come over so I can yield \nsome time to them.\n  One of the issues that has been bad-mouthed by the other side, the \nopponents of this legislation, is that we have not done enough to help \nretiree coverage; in other words, the problem they would suppose is \nthat a lot of corporations will be dumping their plans on the \nGovernment.\n  First of all, Congress can't pass a law telling any corporation X, Y, \nor Z that they can't do that. If they decide it is in their interest, \nthey are going to do it. The point is they have been doing it for years \nand years.\n  I had a chart up here 2 days ago that showed how we have gone down \nfrom about 89 percent to 60 percent over the last 10 years of the \ncorporations that had retiree health plans. What we are doing is \nputting in place a program so that if a corporation does that, there is \nat least something for people who have zilch when it comes to \nprescription drugs.\n  One of the things we have done to encourage corporations not to do \nthat is we have put $89 billion in this bill to protect retiree health \ncoverage. This funding makes it more likely--not less likely--that \nemployers will continue their retiree benefits. We do that for two \nreasons. Obviously, it is better for people to keep what they have. So \nthere is an incentive for that. That will help keep a good drug \nbenefit. Second,\n\n[[Page S15910]]\n\nif this is dumped on the Medicare Program, it is going to be much more \ncostly than to keep it in the corporation plan. We did it for those two \nreasons.\n  The opponents of this bill have been saying retirees are going to be \ndropped--that they will be left without coverage because of this bill. \nIt is easy to make very clear that these retirees will not be left \nwithout drug coverage. That is, obviously, because one of the \nmotivations behind this 3-year effort to get prescription drugs in \nMedicare is to take care of or at least offer a plan to people who \ndon't have anything. That is about 35 percent of the people today. It \nis better for those who do not have as good a plan as we are putting on \nthe books. These retirees will still be better off than they are today \nbecause today, when their employers drop their coverage, they are left \nwith nothing--no coverage at all.\n  Because of this bill, these retirees will be getting drug coverage \nfrom Medicare, and their former employer will likely pay the monthly \npremium for that.\n  This is a bipartisan bill. This bill addresses the problem we saw as \na very serious problem. According to the Congressional Budget Office, \nwe have addressed it in a very responsible way and by reducing very \nmuch the possibility that these corporate retirees will be dumped onto \nthis plan.\n  This bipartisan bill protects retirees' benefits. That has been our \ngoal, and we have accomplished it. The time has come strengthen and \nimprove Medicare with this historic bipartisan agreement. It is the \nculmination of years of work by Republicans and Democrats who have come \ntogether to get this done.\n\n  As the AARP has made clear when providing its strong endorsement, \nthis bill ``helps millions of older Americans and their families,'' and \nis ``an important milestone in the nation's commitment to strengthen \nand expand health security for its citizens. . . .''\n  This bill offers an affordable, universal prescription drug benefit \nthat will cover about half the cost of prescriptions for the average \nsenior.\n  It offers generous coverage for 14 million lower income seniors. It \nexpands coverage for lower income seniors far beyond what is offered \ntoday. They will have access to drug coverage with lower or no \npremiums, no coverage cap, and coverage of 85 percent to 95 percent of \nthe cost of prescription drugs.\n  And the new Medicare drug benefit is voluntary--no one is forced to \nenroll in this benefit. Seniors can stay in traditional Medicare just \nlike they have today and have full access to prescription drugs.\n  There is also a guaranteed government fallback. It is a guarantee \nthat seniors will be able to get prescription drug coverage.\n  This bill also invests $89 billion to protect retiree health \ncoverage. This funding makes it more likely, not less likely, that \nemployers will continue their retiree benefits.\n  This bill also creates new coverage choices for beneficiaries in a \nnewly revitalized Medicare Advantage program. And this is voluntary \ntoo--no one will be forced to join an HMO.\n  The bill lowers drug costs by speeding the delivery of new generic \ndrugs to the marketplace, lowering costs for all Americans, not just \nthose on Medicare.\n  The bipartisan bill includes long overdue improvements to Medicare's \ncomplex regulations.\n  It also revitalizes the rural health care safety net with the biggest \npackage of rural payment improvements Congress has ever seen.\n  I urge my colleagues to put the interests of our seniors first and \ngive them more choices and better benefits by voting for this historic \nbipartisan prescription drug bill.\n  We cannot let this opportunity pass.\n  Mr. President, it has been a long and arduous process to get us to \nwhere we are today. This is a process that didn't start this year, or \neven last year, but many years ago, on the foundation of what we then \ncalled the ``tripartisan bill.'' Through many years of discussions and \nnegotiations in the Finance Committee, we have taken the foundation of \nthat first bill and crafted comprehensive Medicare policy that will \nvastly improve the health and overall well being of our nation's \nseniors.\n  Our critics will say it is not enough or that it lacks one provision \nor another. My response is that no other Finance Committee membership \nand no other Congress has been able to produce a bill of this \nmagnitude. We have worked tirelessly in the Finance Committee and with \nour colleagues in the House to try to make this bill as perfect as \npossible.\n  The reality is the Medicare program itself is not perfect.\n  And I challenge those in opposition to this bill, to show me perfect \nlegislation. It is impossible because we're adding layers on a system \nthat has been in place for nearly 40 years. But everyone involved in \nthis process has worked their hearts out to make this bill the best \nbill that it can be. It has been a sacrifice for all involved. Missed \ndinners with family, missed weekends with the kids, little sleep, and \nintense emotions and intellectual energy--to make this bill what it is.\n  We've all given 150 percent to get this bill done. And I will admit \nwe did not reach ``perfection'', but we reached excellence. And \nAmerica's seniors will benefit from the commitment that was made by all \nof us involved. We did it for them. And it will make a positive \ndifference in their lives. To me, that is the closest thing to \nperfection that we could achieve.\n  Let me close by thanking my colleagues on the committee, in the \nSenate, the House, CMS, HHS and the White House. Dedicated individuals \nacross the Congress and the Executive Branch have worked tirelessly, \nnight and day, to make this happen, and they deserve our thanks for \ntheir true commitment to this bill and their commitment to this \ncountry.\n  For my part, I want to thank my own current Finance Committee staff: \nTed Totman, my Deputy Staff Director who shepherded staff and members \nthrough this arduous process; Linda Fishman, my Health Policy Director \nwho led the committee's consideration of this bill and who captained a \nteam of talented analysts, including Colin Roskey, whose daughter, \nRose, was born while negotiations played out in the Finance Committee \nin March; Mark Hayes, who balanced multiple titles of this legislation \nwhile attending law school at night; Jennifer Bell, whose dedication to \nthe needs of rural Americans played an instrumental role in the success \nof our rural healthcare package; Leah Kegler, who managed many of the \ncomplex low income and Medicaid policies in the bill; Alicia Ziemiecki, \nwho provided crucial assistance and support to all on this staff and to \nindividual Committee members throughout the year; and Mollie Zito, who \njoined the staff just this year and immediately made important \ncontributions to the overall effort.\n  Still other former members of my Finance Committee staff who are not \nwith me on the floor today have been instrumental in the development of \nthis legislation. They include: Monica Tencate, Tom Walsh, Rebecca \nReisinger, Hope Cooper, and Jeannie Haggerty, each of whom helped to \nshape the original Tripartisan proposal, whose imprint on this \nlegislation is unmistakable. Each of these individuals contributed \ncreatively, analytically and energetically to the successful completion \nof this legislation.\n  Beyond the health staff of the Finance Committee, I want to recognize \nother committee staff who played important roles in resolving the many \ninterwoven, complex tax, health and trade policies within this \nlegislation. Mark Prater and Diann Howland helped navigate many of the \nhealth savings account and employer-related issues in the bill. Steven \nSchaefer and Everett Eissenstadt along with Rita Lari of my Judiciary \nCommittee staff helped conferees reach consensus on difficult pricing, \nimportation and generic drug policies. Steve Robinson assisted in \nbudgetary matters, and Dean Zerbe and Emilia DiSanto provided good \ncounsel on matters relating to Medicare program integrity. Jill Kozeny, \nJill Gerber, Beth Levine and Dustin Vande Hoef provided cogent and \nconcise outreach and explanation to the media. Leah Shimp, Cory Crowley \nand Mary Gross kept in close touch with Iowans on the legislation. And \nKolan Davis, my Chief Counsel on the committee, provided important \noversight and advice throughout the process.\n  Beyond my own staff, I want to recognize Senator Baucus's staff, with \nwhom I have enjoyed an excellent working relationship over the last few \nyears and with whom my own staff has\n\n[[Page S15911]]\n\nworked especially closely: Jeff Forbes, Russ Sullivan, Judy Miller, \nBill Dauster, Liz Fowler, Jonathan Blum, Pat Bousliman, Andrea Cohen, \nMike Mongan, Kate Kirchgraber and Dan Stein. Senator Baucus's team have \nshown a sincere commitment to balanced, fair bipartisan legislation and \nhave been consummate professionals throughout.\n  The staff to my Senate colleagues on the conference are also \ndeserving our thanks. Each contributed to a collegial working \nenvironment under enormous time and political pressures: Pattie \nDeLoatche, Mark Carlson, and Bruce Artim with Senator Hatch; Stacey \nHughes, Hazen Marshall and Bini Zomer with Senator Nickles; Don \nDempsey, Diane Major, Elizabeth Maier and Lisa Wolski with Senator Kyl; \nDean Rosen, Elizabeth Scanlon, Craig Burton and Eric Ueland with \nSenator Frist; and Sarah Walter, Michele Easton and Paige Jennings with \nSenator Breaux.\n  Finally, all of us were extremely well served by the hard work of our \nCongressional support agencies, including the able work of our Senate \nLegislative Counsels who toiled longer into the night than most: Ruth \nErnst, John Goetcheus and Jim Scott. Technical and analytical support \nwas provided by experts at the Congressional Research Service, \nincluding Richard Price, Jim Hahn, Chris Peterson, Hinda Chakind, \nJennifer O'Sullivan and Jennifer Boulanger and many others who assisted \nin the completion of the Conference Report. At the Congressional Budget \nOffice, Doug Holtz-Eakin, Steve Lieberman, Tom Bradley, Chris \nTopileski, Phil Ellis, Rachel Schmidt, Jeannie De Sa, Eric Rollins, \nShinobu Suzuki and many others played crucial roles in developing cost \nestimates for policies large and small in this conference agreement.\n  Each of these dedicated individuals is deserving of our thanks for \ntheir commitment to improving Medicare and making affordable access to \nprescription drugs a reality for America's seniors.\n  If the other side says it is OK, I would like to yield 3 minutes to \nthe Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I have been here for 10 years now. \nThere are many in the Chamber who have been here longer than I. But I \nknow one thing. Anytime we do something that is very major and very \ncomplicated, it is easy to pick it apart. It is easy in 30 seconds to \nsay why you are not going to vote for something that has so many \nfacets. That is much more politically feasible and it is much easier. \nIt is harder to vote yes on something that isn't perfect.\n  How can you ever expect a bill this complicated to suit every person \nin this body perfectly? Of course, you can't. That is why we have 100 \nSenators from 50 States. It is why we go back and forth and compromise. \nYes, there is compromise in this bill. But let me tell you in a few \nminutes why I am voting yes.\n  I am voting yes because senior citizens do not have benefits for \nprescription drugs. We must start. No one would say this is perfect. \nWho could expect a perfect bill that is this comprehensive? This is the \nbill. Of course, you don't agree with every word in it. But are we \ngoing to throw it away and not even start? I hope not. Those who have \nbeen around here longer than I know that we will come back and we will \nadjust where adjustment is necessary, as we do in every major piece of \nlegislation that is far-reaching.\n  I am voting for this bill because for the first time everyone in our \ncountry will have the chance to put aside money in a health savings \naccount to build up for their copays and for their premiums on health \ncare insurance. It will be a tax-free buildup, and it will be tax free \nwhen you take it out for your health care needs.\n  I am voting for this bill because it increases the reimbursement for \nour people who give medical services. Our rural hospitals are dying all \nover our country and they will have a better reimbursement rate, \nsomething Senator Kennedy and I worked on very hard. This is not what I \nwanted in totality, but we are going to increase the teaching hospital \nreimbursement because the teaching hospitals are the ones that treat \nour poor. Our teaching hospitals are where our up-and-coming physicians \nand nurses learn how to treat patients. We are increasing the \nreimbursement. Senator Kennedy and I worked very hard on that.\n\n  It is not everything we wanted but we can come back and we will make \nit even better. There will be millions of dollars going into our \nteaching hospitals and every State in our country has a teaching \nhospital.\n  The reimbursement to physicians is going to increase. How many \nphysicians have said, I am not taking Medicare patients anymore; I \ncannot afford it. We want physicians to take our Medicare patients. We \nalso want a freedom to choose, which our Medicare patients do not now \nhave and which we will have in the future.\n  That is why I am voting for this bill. It is the harder vote. I urge \nmy colleagues to step up to the plate and help us start.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time is on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 3 minutes 16 seconds and the \nminority has 6 minutes 3 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, my friend from Iowa talked about what is happening to \nthe retiree programs. This is the most recent study. Firms offering \nretiree health benefits dropped 40 percent in the last 8 years. With \nthis legislation, it will go right down through the cellar, make no \nmistake. We brought that out in this debate.\n  My friend from Connecticut has talked about what will happen in his \nState, about the retirees. It happens in Connecticut, it happens in \nMassachusetts, it is happening in every State of this country, the \nlosing of retirees. The low-income elderly and disabled will pay more. \nThousands are going to fail the assets test. That is what is happening \nin the bill.\n  In my early years of service in the Senate I was privileged to \nparticipate in the final stages of the long debate that culminated in \nthe enactment of Medicare.\n  Today, Medicare is so much a part of the essential fabric of our \nsociety that it is hard to remember the harsh reality the elderly faced \nbefore its enactment. Too often, their lives were blighted by the fear \nof a costly illness that would swallow the savings of a lifetime and \nleave them impoverished. Too often, their lack of access to affordable \nmedical care made a mockery of the dignified and secure retirement that \nshould be the birthright of every American. Private health insurance \nhad failed the elderly, and Medicare was the response.\n  Today, Medicare and Social Security are the most beloved and \nsuccessful government programs ever enacted. They form the cornerstone \nof our nation's retirement system. But they are also under assault from \na heartless right-wing ideology that ignores the lessons of the past.\n  This ideology views health care as just another commodity. It sees \nMedicare as another potential profit center for HMOs and insurance \ncompanies, not as solemn commitment between government and its \ncitizens. It says senior citizens should be subject to the sink or swim \neconomics of the marketplace--and if they sink, it is their failure, \nnot our society's.\n  The legislation we are debating today started as an important down \npayment on the comprehensive prescription drug coverage the elderly \nhave long needed to complement the coverage of hospital and physician \ncare that Medicare provides. That was the essence of the bipartisan \nbill that passed the Senate by an overwhelming majority. But that \nbipartisan bill is not the one we are debating today.\n  Instead, the legislation before the Senate is a partisan document \nthat embodies this administration's right-wing ideology and its desire \nto fuel the profits of the wealthy and powerful who support it. It \ncynically uses the elderly's need for prescription drugs as a Trojan \nhorse to reshape Medicare. The Republican majority has hijacked this \nconference.\n  Their program draws its essential inspiration from the President's \noriginal program to limit prescription drug benefits to senior citizens \nwho join an HMO. That plan was too crude and obvious to withstand \npublic scrutiny, so the House of Representatives--and now\n\n[[Page S15912]]\n\nthis conference committee--has crafted a more subtle but no less \ndestructive approach. That is why this legislation had to be rammed \nthrough the House of Representatives in the dead of night, with the \nsupport of only one party, and only after the rules of the House were \nbent and broken. That is why this legislation is being rammed through \nthe Senate after only 3 days of debate, and only after the Senate \nwaived its own rules in a very close and narrow vote.\n  This bill is a cold, calculated program to unravel Medicare, to \nprivatize it, to voucherize it and to force senior citizens into the \nunloving arms of HMOs. It is the first step in the Administration's \ncampaign to reshape America to fit its right-wing ideology. And the \nWhite House has already announced that if they are successful in \nenacting this first step, the privatization of Social Security will be \nthe next step. Today, big HMOs, insurance companies, and pharmaceutical \ncompanies are the winners. Tomorrow, when Social Security is \nprivatized, it will be the big banks and brokerage houses. And, in both \ncases, senior citizens and their families will be the losers.\n  The bill uses a triple threat to unravel Medicare.\n  It creates a new program called premium support. They call it a \ndemonstration, but it is really a vast social experiment using millions \nof senior citizens as guinea pigs. It is designed to raise Medicare \npremiums, so that seniors will be forced to join HMOs to get affordable \ncare. They call it competition, but it's not competition, it's \ncoercion.\n\n  It raises Medicare payments to HMOs so that Medicare can't compete--a \n25 percent overpayment. They use the elderly's own Medicare money to \nundermine the Medicare program they depend on.\n  It creates a $12 billion slush fund for private insurance plans to \nmake Medicare even more competitive.\n  The assault on Medicare is the worst aspect of this bill, but that's \nnot the end of the dishonor roll of this bill.\n  Three million retirees with good coverage through a former employer \nwill lose it as the result of this legislation.\n  Six million of the poorest of the poor elderly and disabled people \nwill face higher costs for the drugs they need and less access to \nmedical care the day this legislation is effective.\n  The government will be prohibited from bargaining to obtain \nreasonable drug prices for senior citizens.\n  The bill imposes a cruel and demeaning assets test that disqualifies \nmillions of the lowest income elderly from the special help they need.\n  The bill provides $6 billion in tax subsidies for health savings \naccounts, a program that has nothing to do with Medicare but everything \nto do with benefiting the healthy and wealthy while driving up \ninsurance premiums for other Americans.\n  Rejecting this misbegotten legislation is not a rejection of our \nsenior citizens' needs for prescription drugs. It is an affirmation of \ntheir need for Medicare and of their right to choose the doctors and \nhospitals they trust. If this legislation is rejected today, the \npending business before the Senate will be the good, bipartisan \nprescription drug program we passed in July. Let us make the vote \ntoday, a new start to do the right thing rather than a conclusion to do \nthe wrong thing.\n  In its own way, this is as historic as the debate that enacted \nMedicare. Medicare is the heart and soul of our society's commitment to \ncompassion and fairness. Today, the Senate will decide whether that \ncommitment will be abandoned for other values--the values that are \nmeasured in the cold coins of profit and power rather than on the \nscales of humanity and justice.\n  The Senate should reject this mistaken choice. It should stand with \nthe elderly and their families, not with HMOs and insurance companies \nand pharmaceutical industries. It should reject this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nUtah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have been listening to the rather remarkable remarks \nfrom the other side, that this legislation has been rammed through the \nCongress, that it is partisan, when it is bipartisan. It has taken us \n15 years to get here. It could take another 15 years if we do not \nsupport this bill right now.\n  We have been working on Medicare prescription drug legislation for 15 \nsolid years. We have worked day in day out, hours, weeks, and months in \norder to get to this point. It is bipartisan. It was bipartisan in the \nHouse; when it passes today it will be bipartisan in the Senate.\n  The opponents of this bill keep saying that seniors will be worse off \nif this Medicare bill becomes law. Give me a break. We are going to put \n$400 billion out there for senior citizens so they will have a Medicare \ndrug benefit. We are giving seniors a choice in coverage. Medicare \nbeneficiaries may stay in traditional Medicare or they may choose to \nparticipate in one of the new Medicare Advantage plans.\n  We are improving health care for rural communities, something our \nfriends on the other side have ignored for years. The fact is, it is \ntime to realize that we are going to have to pass this legislation \nbecause it is the right thing to do and it will be a bipartisan vote.\n  We are devoting close to a quarter of this bill's funding to retiree \nhealth coverage. CBO told us that 37 percent of retirees could have \nlost their coverage if S. 1, the bill approved by the Senate earlier \nthis year, had become law. This bill reduces that number to under 20 \npercent. I don't know how anyone can say this bill is going to be \nharmful to retirees when we are devoting $89 billion towards retaining \nretiree health coverage.\n  We also are improving access to less expensive, generic drugs by \nimproving Hatch-Waxman.\n  The real reason our colleagues do not like this bill is that it is \nnot an $800 billion bill. Our bill is $400 billion which provides for \nsome private sector competitive models. The reason our opponents do not \nlike our legislation is because they do not believe in the private \nsector.\n  With regard to their argument that some of the big companies are \ngoing to benefit from this legislation, of course they will benefit. \nThe argument I find most amusing is the claim this bill will lead to \nincreased drug company profits.\n  The reason the bill is so desperately needed is because beneficiaries \nwith low incomes are unable to afford their prescriptions today. They \nhave to choose between food, rent, and taking their medicines. When \nthis prescription drug benefit goes into effect, low-income \nbeneficiaries will finally be able to get their prescriptions filled. \nThis legislation includes generous subsidies so the low-income will be \nable to receive their prescription drugs without worrying about how to \npay for them.\n  Of course, this is going to lead to increased drug sales. Surely this \nis no surprise to anyone. Any prescription drug bill that works is \ngoing to lead to increased drug sales. Where are the medicines supposed \nto come from, except from the manufacturers of those medicines? Every \nsingle Medicare prescription drug bill introduced by these naysayers \nalso would have increased drug sales, and they know it.\n  This bipartisan conference report has the same basic drug benefit \nstructure that passed the Senate by a vote of 76 to 21--the same one--\nand we are hearing these arguments here today? My distinguished friend \nfrom Massachusetts voted for that bill, and the legislation before us \nhas the same drug benefit structure contained in S. 1 earlier this \nyear.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has concluded that the competitive \napproach of this bipartisan drug benefit will be better at controlling \ndrug costs than other proposals.\n  To suggest that no one support a Medicare drug benefit because it \nwill lead to increased drug sales turns logic on its head.\n  If this were our basic principle, then we should not have food \nstamps, because that would lead to increased profits of grocery stores \nand farmers. What about housing subsidies? This might lead to profits \nby construction companies, utility companies and increased sales of \nlumber, bricks and nails! So, this is just an absurd issue and it is \neasy to see why.\n  I am here to tell you that this bill will strengthen and improve the \nMedicare program. The spending in this bipartisan prescription drug \nbill goes toward more improved health benefits for\n\n[[Page S15913]]\n\nAmerica's seniors and the disabled. This is a good bill and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time because I know \nwe are out of the allotted time.\n  I'm told that when Medicare was passed 38 years ago, the House and \nSenate galleries were filled with senior citizens who felt a great deal \nof hope, optimism and excitement about what that bill meant for them \nand for future Americans.\n  I don't see any senior citizens in the galleries today. And I think \nthat is a real reflection on what this bill really means.\n  Why are there no senior citizens in the galleries for this vote? Why \nisn't there the hope and excitement and enthusiasm and optimism that we \nsaw so vividly 38 years ago?\n  Mr. President, I think we all know the reason: because there is no \nexcitement. There is no enthusiasm. There is no optimism. There is no \nreal confidence that what we are doing today will help the vast \nmajority of senior citizens. They are not optimistic. They are watching \nwith dismay at the vote we are about to take.\n  I'll tell you what rooms are filled--not the galleries but the \nlobbies. The drug companies and the insurance companies are out there \nin droves. The highly paid representatives of these companies couldn't \nbe happier about this bill. Their job is done for now.\n  I heard a report on the radio this morning that the final vote was \ngoing to be taken early today. Well, that report was wrong, Mr. \nPresident. This is not the final vote on prescription drugs for seniors \nor on Medicare. This is only the beginning, not the end. We will see \nmany, many more votes.\n  I predict that we will be back within the next 12 months. Seniors \nwill demand that we correct the many deficiencies in this bill, and \nthey will not rest until we do.\n  This may be the end of this debate. But I predict that a longer \ndebate will begin tomorrow as senior citizens start to fully understand \nthe magnitude of the problems this legislation creates for them.\n  This bill is deeply flawed. There is a poll in this morning's South \nDakota Rapid City Journal. The poll simply asked the question, Do you \nthink the legislation the Senate is about to pass is adequate? Mr. \nPresident, 64.5 percent of those who responded said no, it is not \nadequate. Those of us who have been working on this legislation should \nnot be surprised.\n  Senior citizens with private coverage already know they could lose \nthose benefits as early as tomorrow as the result of this bill. Seniors \non Medicaid already know that they are going to have to pay more for \ndrugs, and may even be refused some of the drugs they need. Seniors in \nSouth Dakota already know they may be coerced into an HMO they disdain \nand out of a Medicare plan they now count on.\n  Seniors already know they are about to be subjected to a scheme for \nbenefits they cannot even understand, much less afford.\n  Taxpayers already know they are going to be giving huge handouts to \ninsurance companies, drug companies, and special interests, even though \nour country is faced with deficits unlike we have ever known.\n  Many Senators know this is lousy legislation, that we may spend the \nrest of our careers repairing the flaws of this disappointing bill.\n  We are going to be called upon to vote today.\n  My father admonished me many years ago never to put my signature on \nsomething I was not proud of. Mr. President, I am not proud of this \nlegislation. I cannot put my signature on this bill. And I do not think \nanyone else should, either.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the majority leader \nis recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today is an extraordinary day for 40 \nmillion seniors. For too long, our medical and health care advances \nhave raced ahead, especially in the last 10 to 15 years, but Medicare, \nas a health security program for seniors, has stood still.\n  But today that will change. And it will change today with \noverwhelming support. On this chart are 358 organizations who support \nthis change, such as the Seniors Coalition, the AARP, the American \nMedical Association, the American Hospital Association, the Family \nPhysicians, the American College of Cardiology, the National Alliance \nfor the Mentally Ill, the Rural Hospital Association, the Sickle Cell \nFoundation, the Society of Thoracic Surgeons--and the list goes on and \non.\n  It has been a long time coming, but it is finally here. With a \nbipartisan majority, the U.S. Senate will enact prescription drug \ncoverage for the first time under Medicare.\n  Forty million seniors and individuals with disabilities will finally \nhave the prescription drug coverage they need and the Medicare choices \nthey deserve.\n  They will finally be able to take full advantage of the tremendous \nmedical advances that have been made in the almost 40 years since \nMedicare was enacted.\n  I do not think it can be overstated that today marks a truly historic \nadvance for America.\n  As a physician, I have written hundreds of prescriptions that I knew \nwould go unfilled because patients simply would not be able to afford \nthem. With this bill, that will change.\n  As a U.S. Senator, I have watched a decades-old Medicare program \noperate without flexibility, without comprehensive care, without \ncoordinated care, without preventive care, without disease management \nand catastrophic protection against out-of-pocket medical costs.\n  By expanding opportunities for private sector innovation, this \nMedicare bill offers the possibility of genuine reform that can \ndramatically improve and strengthen quality of care for our seniors and \nfor those baby boomers who will be seniors in the not too distant \nfuture.\n  At the same time, it preserves traditional Medicare. It strengthens \nand improves traditional Medicare, and it preserves traditional \nMedicare for those who wish to choose it.\n  It combines the best of the public and the private sectors. It \nimproves Medicare for today's seniors and helps, most importantly, lay \nthe foundation for a strong and modern program for seniors today, but \nalso tomorrow's seniors.\n  The legislation provides all seniors with access to more affordable \nprescription drugs and targets more substantial assistance to lower \nincome seniors and those with high catastrophic drug costs.\n  It also dramatically expands health coverage choices for seniors, and \nimproves coordinated care, improves disease management, adds prevention \nto Medicare, and adds catastrophic coverage both under the traditional \nMedicare fee-for-service program and under Medicare private health \nplans.\n  While it does expand those choices and those opportunities to choose, \nchoices that seniors simply do not have today, it also ensures that \nthose seniors can keep exactly what they have. They do not have to \nchoose that new drug plan. They do not have to choose that new type of \nhealth care plan that we might have in the U.S. Senate or that Federal \nemployees have.\n  They don't have that option today, but they can choose that or they \ncan keep exactly what they have today. All of the options in this \nlegislation, including prescription drug coverage, are voluntary. \nBeyond increasing competition, we will also take steps to control \nhealth care costs both within the Medicare Program and within the \nbroader health care system. For the first time, we will ask those \nseniors who can afford to do so to pay a higher portion of their \nMedicare costs. We will increase and index the Medicare Part B \ndeductible for the first time in over a decade. We will make health \nsavings accounts available to all Americans so that they have greater \ncontrol over their own health care choices and so they can plan and \nsave, tax free, for future health care needs.\n  We will make other responsible changes such as speeding generic drugs \nto the marketplace so that seniors will have access to these lower cost \nprescription drugs.\n  Indeed, today is an extraordinary day. Today is a fateful day. Today \nis a red letter day for seniors.\n  In conclusion, today's historic action is only possible because of \nthe hard work of many dedicated Members of the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives, and the administration.\n\n[[Page S15914]]\n\n  I would like to take a moment to thank those whose commitment was \ncritical to this effort. First and foremost, President Bush deserves \ncredit for his bold leadership and commitment to improving the health \nof America's seniors and individuals with disabilities.\n  Tommy Thompson, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and Tom \nScully, the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices, spent hundreds of hours working on this legislation.\n  In the Senate, Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley and \nRanking Member Max Baucus put partisanship aside and worked tirelessly \nfrom beginning to end to deliver on our promise to America's seniors. \nSenator John Breaux also deserves credit. He and I have worked together \nfor the better part of 6 years on legislation to improve Medicare. \nToday, we have finally reached that goal.\n  All members of the conference committee showed a degree of dedication \nand resolve seldom seen in either Chamber, especially Senators Orrin \nHatch, Don Nickles and Jon Kyl. We would not have reached this point \nwithout building on the strong foundation laid by Members who worked so \nhard on this issue during the past several years, especially Senators \nSnowe, Jeffords, Gregg, Hagel, Ensign and Wyden. Senators Bunning, \nThomas, Smith, Lott, and Santorum also made major contributions to this \nlegislation through their work on the Senate Finance Committee.\n  Members of this body who voted against final passage, but nonetheless \nworked to improve this legislation at every step of the way and help \npave the way to final passage also deserve great respect and \nappreciation.\n  The House Leadership, especially Speaker Dennis Hastert and Leader \nTom Delay, also deserves special recognition, as does the Chairman of \nthe Conference, Chairman Bill Thomas, and the Chairman of the House \nEnergy and Commerce Committee, Chairman Billy Tauzin. We would not be \nhere without them.\n  Finally, I want to thank my hard working and dedicated staff: Dean \nRosen, Elizabeth Scanlon, Rohit Kumar, and Craig Burton. They have put \nin thousands of hours and poured over thousands of details.\n  To everyone who has worked so hard and given so much to this effort, \nI thank you. America thanks you. And, most of all, America's seniors \nthank you.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a long list of staff who made major \ncontributions to this legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Passage of a Medicare prescription drug benefit would not \n     be possible without the hard work and dedication of the White \n     House staff and the staff at the Department of Health and \n     Human Services. House and Senate staff, as well as House and \n     Senate Legislative Counsels, the Congressional Budget Office \n     and the Congressional Research Service deserve our thanks. At \n     this time, I would like take a moment to recognize the many \n     individuals who have played a central role in this \n     legislation.\n       We could not do our work without the assistance of our \n     exceptional staffs who have sacrificed time with loved ones \n     in the pursuit of a Medicare prescription drug benefit. I \n     would like to thank them all.\n       On my staff, Dean Rosen, Elizabeth Scanlon, Craig Burton, \n     Rohit Kumar, Eric Ueland, Lee Rawls, Bob Stevenson, Nick \n     Smith, Amy Call, Bill Hoagland, Bill Wichterman, Allison \n     Winnike, Jennifer Romans, Dr. Susan Goelzer, and Tina Thomas \n     deserve recognition.\n       Senate Finance Committee Majority Staff, Linda Fishman, \n     Mark Hayes, Leah Kegler, Jennifer Bell, Colin Roskey, Ted \n     Totman, Mark Prater, Dianne Howland and Alicia Ziemecki \n     tirelessly worked on this legislation. On the Senate Finance \n     Committee Minority Staff, Liz Fowler, Jonathan Blum, Pat \n     Bousilman, Andy Cohen, Dan Stein, and Jeff Forbes made \n     important contributions to this effort.\n       House Leadership staff, Darren Wilcox, Brett Shogren, Joe \n     Trauger, Shalla Ross, Andrew Shore, John DeStefano and Sam \n     Geduldig made the way for House passage of the Conference \n     Report. House Ways and Means Majority staff members, John \n     McManus, Madeline Smith, Joel White, Deb Williams, John \n     Kelliher, and Shahira Knight were invaluable to reaching a \n     bipartisan agreement.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this is an extraordinary day for seniors \nand indeed all Americans. The legislation that we just passed is \nconsequential. It is far reaching for every American. It touches all of \nus in material ways, in meaningful ways. It is epical in the sense that \nit modernizes Medicare to provide 21st century care for our seniors, \nwith preventive care, with disease management, and especially with \nprescription drugs. This bill is notable in its 54-to-44 vote in being \na bipartisan bill.\n  For the information of our colleagues, we will have no more rollcall \nvotes. We currently remain in discussion on the appropriations bills. \nThe bill will not be filed until later today in the House of \nRepresentatives. I will be in discussion with the Democratic leadership \nas to what appropriate time we will be addressing those appropriations \nbills. There will be no more rollcall votes today. I wish everybody a \nvery happy, enjoyable, and especially safe Thanksgiving.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15915-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15915-S15917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n ADMINISTRATION EFFORTS TO GUT THE ``COMPETITIVE SOURCING'' COMPROMISE\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to alert my colleagues and the \npublic to a secret effort by the White House to quash the rights and \neliminate the jobs of thousands if not millions of Federal workers.\n  Right now, the White House is actively working behind the scenes--in \nclosed-door meetings--to reverse a bipartisan agreement that House and \nSenate appropriators reached just 12 days ago. And I regret to say, the \nPresident's operatives appear to be succeeding.\n  I rise to expose these backroom efforts because I believe all \ntaxpayers should be made aware of the White House's efforts.\n  If the White House prevails in this scheme, Federal jobs could be \ncontracted out even if it costs taxpayers more money, Federal workers \nwill have to compete to keep their jobs with their hands tied behind \ntheir backs, and Federal workers will not be able to appeal a decision \nto contract out their job while private companies can appeal a decision \nthat doesn't go their way.\n  If the White House gets everything it wants, Federal workers could \nactually lose their jobs and see that work shipped overseas. This \nadministration has sent enough good American jobs overseas. It is \noutrageous that this White House is now questioning our agreements \nwhich ensure that the work of the American Government is done by \nworkers here in America.\n  When it comes to allowing Federal workers to compete to keep their \njobs, the White House does not want a level playing field. That's why \nthey're engaging in all these backroom deals, and that's why the White \nHouse has seen to it that the bipartisan Transportation/Treasury \nconference report has never been filed.\n  What kind of Federal workers am I talking about here? I am talking \nabout people who protect our borders and keep terrorists off U.S. soil; \npeople who purchase and maintain equipment for our troops, both here \nand overseas; people who help us get the Social Security checks, or \nprice support payments, or unemployment insurance payments that we are \neligible for; people who make sure our food is safe; and many, many \nmore.\n  These are hard-working Americans that serve the taxpayer everyday and \ndeserve a fair shot at keeping their jobs. But, as my colleagues know, \nfor some time the Bush administration has been trying to eliminate \nFederal jobs through what it calls ``competitive sourcing.'' This \npolicy is highly controversial and with good reason.\n  Just look at what happened to Federal employees of the Defense \nFinance Accounting Service in Ohio: Their work was contracted out to a \ncompany in Dallas, TX in January 2002; then the Pentagon's inspector \ngeneral found that the move saved no money and actually cost the \ntaxpayer an additional $20 million; and now that work is being shipped \nto yet another contractor.\n  So this entire policy of contracting out Federal work needs much more \nscrutiny and oversight. But instead of allowing a balanced set of rules \nto be put in place to avoid the situation I just described, the Bush \nadministration is working to undermine it.\n  Let me review some of the recent events to show why this effort by \nthe White House is so disturbing. On May 29 of this year, the Bush \nadministration issued revisions to OMB's Circular A-76. This is the \ncircular that dictates the terms and conditions through which executive \nagencies can privatize activities currently performed by Federal \nemployees.\n  These revisions were highly controversial and were designed in many \nways to undermine the efforts of Federal employees to keep their jobs. \nThe fairness of these revisions was questioned, and not just by \nDemocrats and the Federal employee unions. Several House and Senate \nRepublicans identified flaws, including the chairmen of the relevant \nauthorizing committees and subcommittees.\n  When the Transportation, Treasury and General Government \nAppropriations bill was brought to the House Floor, Representative Van \nHollen offered an amendment to address these flaws. The Van Hollen \namendment was adopted on a bipartisan vote of 220-198. The Van Hollen \namendment effectively suspended the President's new OMB circular. It \nrequired any contracting out activities to be conducted according to \nthe older A-76 rules. Immediately, the White House threatened a veto, \nso the Senate took a different approach.\n\n  During Senate debate, we adopted an amendment offered by Senator \nMikulski and Senator Collins, the authorizing committee chairman. The \nSenate also adopted an amendment offered by Senator Thomas and Senator \nVoinovich, the authorizing subcommittee chairman.\n  The substance of both amendments centered on putting some basic \nfairness into the contracting out process--especially the process \nthrough which Federal employees and private contractors submit bids to \nretain Federal work and how those bids are compared. In some cases, the \namendments reflected language that the President had already signed \ninto law or that the Congress had already adopted on the Department of \nDefense and Department of Interior appropriations bills.\n  When the conference committee convened to reconcile these two very \ndifferent bills, we all recognized that the Van Hollen amendment could \nnot be included in the conference report because of the President veto \nthreat, so we put together a thoughtful and fair compromise. Our \ncompromise was designed to provide a level playing-field between \nGovernment contractors and Federal employees. Our compromise ensured \nfairness in five ways.\n  First, the compromise ensured that the rules pertaining to all the \nFederal agencies would be the same. Second, the compromise ensured that \nthe administration would have to demonstrate that there are real cost \nsavings that would result from a privatization effort before Federal \nemployees lost their jobs to the private sector. Third, the compromise \nensured that Federal employees--and not just private contractors--would \nhave the opportunity to appeal a potentially wrongful decision to \ncontract out work. Fourth, the compromise ensured that no jobs that are \ncontracted out would be transferred overseas. And fifth, the compromise \nensured that Government employees have the opportunity to put together \ntheir best and most efficient bid in order to compete to keep their \njobs.\n  In other words, they do not just need to submit a bid based on the \nway they currently operate. They could propose new efficiencies to make \ntheir bid competitive so that all taxpayers benefit.\n\n[[Page S15916]]\n\n  As I said, this was a thoughtful, carefully crafted compromise in \nwhich neither side got everything they wanted.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my \nremarks, the bill language reflecting this bipartisan compromise be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am placing this language in the Record \nbecause I have been given reason to believe that some very different \nlanguage will appear in the omnibus appropriations act, once it is \nactually filed.\n  A lot of credit belongs to Chairman Istook, Chairman Stevens, and \nChairman Shelby for allowing the conferees on the Transportation/\nTreasury bill to work through the issues and develop our original \ncompromise.\n  When I left the Capitol building late in the evening on Wednesday, \nNovember 12, all the conferees expected that compromise to be \nincorporated into the conference agreement on the Transportation/\nTreasury bill that was to be filed the next day. Each and every \nSenator, Republican and Democrat, that participated in that conference \nagreement was content with the compromise and signed the conference \nreport. What has happened since then has been one of the most \nastonishing and deplorable process that I have ever witnessed in my 11 \nyears in the Senate.\n  When the Bush White House learned that the conferees decided to \ninsist upon a level playing field and some demonstration of taxpayer \nbenefits for Federal jobs to be contracted out, they began a quiet but \nrelentless campaign to the gut the compromise. Despite the fact that \nthe conference committee adjourned well over a week and a half ago, the \nWhite House has seen to it that the bipartisan conference agreement has \nnot been filed in either the House or Senate while they work to \nemasculate the compromise.\n  The administration's alternative language makes their true motives \nclear. One language change that the Bush administration has been \npromoting would effectively eliminate the requirement that the \nadministration demonstrate any cost savings before throwing Federal \nemployees out onto the unemployment line. Indeed, the loophole language \nthey are promoting would allow them to award Federal work to private \ncontractors even if the contractor's costs are considerably higher than \nletting Federal employees keep the work.\n  Could it be that we are seeing yet another attempt by the Bush/Cheney \nadministration to use Federally appropriated resources to reward their \nfriends?\n  I am told that the administration has even voiced reservations about \nthe language in our compromise prohibiting Federal jobs from being \nshipped overseas. Where does it stop.\n  This administration seems to see no problem with senior citizens \npicking up a phone to call Social Security Administration and the phone \nbeing answered by a Federal contractor in India--and it could actually \ncost taxpayers more. That's absurd.\n  On another provision, the administration is objecting to language \nallowing Federal employees to put forward their best and most efficient \nbid in order to keep their jobs. Why? Because the administration \ndoesn't want Federal employees to retain this work no matter what the \nbenefit to the taxpayer.\n  This is the first year that I have served as the senior Democrat on \nthe Appropriations Subcommittee overseeing these government-wide \nprocurement issues. Over the course of this year, I have been \nincreasingly appalled by the disrespect and disdain that the Bush \nadministration holds for the thousands of Americans that come to work \nfor our Government every day.\n  As of today, I regret to inform the Senate that the Bush \nadministration appears to be making meaningful progress in its campaign \nto gut the bipartisan compromise that was agreed to as part of the \nTransportation/Treasury conference.\n  My subcommittee staff was present with language that was intended to \nbe included in the omnibus appropriations bill. That language guts our \noriginal compromise in three fundamental ways.\n  First, the rules included in the Transportation/Treasury bill will no \nlonger apply to all Federal agencies. They will only apply to the \nagencies funded in the Transportation/Treasury bill. So these \nprovisions will apply only to jobs being contracted out in the \nDepartment of Transportation, the Treasury Department, the General \nServices Administration, the Office of Personnel Management, and a few \nsmaller, related agencies.\n\n  None of these protections will apply to the hundreds of thousands of \nemployees in the other major Federal civilian agencies, such as the \nState Department, Commerce Department, Agriculture Department, Labor \nDepartment, and the Health and Human Services Department. There will be \na distinctly different set of rules for jobs in the Department of the \nInterior and still different rules for jobs in the Department of \nDefense.\n  This makes a sham of our Federal contracting-out policy, but the Bush \nadministration certainly doesn't seem to care.\n  The first major change is in the scope of the agreement. Instead of \napplying to all civilian agencies, it would just apply to a few. The \nsecond major change undermines the fairness of our agreement. The \nlanguage being slipped into the omnibus bill would now deny Federal \nemployees the legal standing to appeal a wrongful decision to contract \nout their jobs. Under current regulations, only contractors can appeal \na decision that doesn't go their way. Federal employees who are losing \ntheir jobs have no such right.\n  The administration obviously does not want its decision to ever face \na truly fair appeals process.\n  The third major change effectively eliminates the requirement that \nthere be any meaningful cost savings to the taxpayer before jobs are \ncontracted out. That is deplorable.\n  No wonder the Bush administration will only push for these changes in \nback rooms.\n  I think this result is bad enough. However, I am now being told that \nthe administration has not given up on weakening our provision even \nfurther.\n  As I stand here today, the conference agreement on the omnibus \nappropriations bill, including the Transportation/Treasury section, has \nstill not been filed. The back-room dealing continues and the basic \nprinciple of fairness and respect for our Federal employees continues \nto be under attack.\n  I have to say that in my many years on the Appropriations Committee, \nI have never witnessed such a cynical effort to undermine a fair and \nequitable conference agreement.\n  I want to emphasize that it is not the fault of Chairman Istook, \nChairman Shelby, Chairman Stevens, Chairman Young, or any of the other \nmembers of the Transportation/Treasury conference. Those honorable \ngentlemen reached a deal at the conference room table and, I believe, \nhad every intention of standing by our compromise.\n  This attack on Federal workers, on fairness and on taxpayers has only \none source--the administration of George Bush. It is the White House \nthat is keeping our compromise from being enacted--or even filed--so \nthat the American public can read and understand it.\n  Next year, I hope that our Transportation/Treasury Subcommittee will \nhold hearings with the appropriate administration officials so that \nthey can explain to us why it is so important to them to deny Federal \nemployees even the most basic rights when competing to keep their jobs. \nI hope they will explain why it is important to the Bush administration \nthat different Federal workers be subjected to a hodgepodge of \ndiffering rules depending on where they work. Perhaps they could also \nexplain why they think it is appropriate that only contractors--and not \nFederal employees--have the right to appeal a ``contracting out'' \ndecision.\n  This issue will not go away.

Mr. President, I commend our leader, Senator Frist, as well \nas Senator Grassley, Senator Baucus, and Senator Breaux, for the \ntremendous work in passing this very difficult bill. This is a \ntremendous milestone. It is great news for the seniors of our Nation.\n  I also ask and plead with the leadership and the Members to realize \nthat we have not yet finished work on the vitally important \nappropriations bills. It is extremely important we get these bills \npassed this year prior to the start of 2004, because there is so much \nin these bills that must be passed now.\n  The Appropriations Committees, under the leadership of Chairman \nStevens and Senator Byrd, have worked long and hard to produce these \nbills. Senator Mikulski and I fought to get an increase in veterans \nhealth of $2.9 billion. We did that because of the pressing need for \nour veterans.\n  Our high-priority veterans are waiting sometimes 6 months just to get \nan appointment. We need that money in the VA system now, not sometime \nnext year. We are also seeing more and more veterans coming back from \nthe conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq with serious injuries, long-term \ninjuries, that are going to require veterans health care. We have to \ncome to some agreement to get these bills passed this year, not \nsometime next year, not January or February or March. We cannot afford \nto miss a half a year.\n  In addition to that, the distinguished Senator from Kentucky and the \nSenator from Connecticut put in the over $1 billion needed for the Help \nAmerica Vote Act.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BOND. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask my friend from Missouri, is it not true that if \nwe do not get this omnibus bill funded, the election reform money, \nwhich guarantees that next year it will be easier to vote and harder to \ncheat, as the Senator from Missouri has said on so many occasions, that \nthat money simply will not be there in time to begin this lengthy \nprocess of getting the money out to States and getting the reforms made \nin time for the 2004 election?\n  Mr. BOND. The distinguished Senator from Kentucky makes a very valid \npoint. The time is now to get that money into the voting system in \nevery\n\n[[Page S15918]]\n\nState. We cannot delay any longer. Every week, every month we delay, \nmeans less likelihood that we will make the changes that were promised.\n  This body overwhelmingly adopted the Help America Vote Act which, as \nSenator McConnell has said, will make it easier to vote and tougher to \ncheat. This is a commitment we made to the people of America that we \nwould provide these reforms and we would fund them. If this money has \nto wait until the approval of these appropriations bills sometime in \nFebruary and getting the money out in March or April, we are not going \nto get it done in time. They are not going to be able to implement \nthese vitally important reforms in election.\n  I know many people want to get their voting machines improved. \nFrankly, I want to see the end of dogs and dead people voting. They are \nstill trying that in St. Louis. There was a nice 180-count indictment \nissued by the prosecuting attorney in the city of St. Louis, the \ncircuit attorney. That problem needs to stop and the only way we can \nget it to stop is by funding the Help America Vote Act.\n  There are many other good arguments, but I urge the leaders to come \ntogether to work on this matter. If we could do it by unanimous \nconsent, that would be the best, but if we have to come back the second \nweek in December, we have an obligation to the people of Missouri to do \nour job. I plead with the leadership to come to some agreement so we \ncan finish these bills.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15918-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PASSAGE OF H.R. 1\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I rise to comment briefly about the \nlegislation which we have just passed and also about the omnibus \nappropriations bill. I compliment all of those involved in this \nMedicare bill. It is a long time in coming. It will provide much needed \nrelief to America's seniors on the high cost of prescription drugs. It \nwill eliminate the cuts in Medicare which were supposed to take effect \nin 2004 and 2005. It will, in fact, give the doctors an increase of 1.5 \npercent.\n  There was also a mechanism for changing the wage index classification \nfor metropolitan statistical areas, the MSAs, so that the Secretary \nwill have discretion to make that correction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15918-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15918-S15919]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, with respect to the omnibus \nappropriations bill, the Senator from Missouri is correct that we ought \nto complete it. He has pointed out the importance of having the \nincreases for veterans. I would add to that the importance of increases \nin the appropriations bill for Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation, where I chair the subcommittee.\n  I would like to comment briefly on two points in the appropriations \nbill for my subcommittee. One of them involves the issue of overtime \npay. The Senate passed, by a decisive majority, 54 to 45, a prohibition \non any expenditures to implement the regulation on overtime which would \ncut out overtime for many Americans who really need that compensation, \nespecially in light of the fragility of the economy at the present \ntime.\n  In the House of Representatives, the regulations stood by three \nvotes. Then on a later vote in the House of Representatives, by 18 \nvotes, the House directed the conferees to strike the regulation, not \nto fund it until September 30, 2004.\n  When the omnibus was in the final stages of preparation last week, it \nwas apparent to me that any course of action would leave the regulation \nin effect. If Senator Harkin and I had insisted on keeping in the \nSenate amendment striking funding for the regulation, then our \nappropriations bill was scheduled to be taken out of the omnibus and \nour three Departments, Health, Education, and Labor, would be funded on \na continuing resolution and the regulation would remain in effect. If \nwe agreed to remove the amendment striking the funding, then of course \nthe regulation would go into effect. So either way, the regulation was \ngoing to go into effect. By having our bill included in the omnibus, we \nhad $4 billion more for vital programs in NIH, for Head Start, for \neducation, Leave No Child Behind, and workers' safety. So in effect we \ndid not have a Hobson's choice, we had no choice at all. Either way we \nwent, the regulation would remain in effect. If we agreed to take it \nout so we would be included in the omnibus, then the prohibition \nagainst funding would fall. If we were taken out and made a part of the \ncontinuing resolution, then the regulation would stay in effect.\n  It is my hope, when this matter goes forward, the vote in the Senate \nwill remain and the provision remains in the Senate bill to strike the \nfunding for the regulation. So that battle is not over. We intend to \ncontinue to fight it right down to the wire, until the omnibus \nappropriations bill is adopted.\n  One other point, and I will be brief. I know my other colleagues are \nwaiting to speak. One other point, and that involves the House language \nto prohibit funding for patents for human tissue. That provision in the \nappropriations bill for the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State \nis going to cause enormous uncertainty. It is very expensive, and a \nvery long process, to have a patent. There will be many people, who \nwill be interested in proceeding with patents, who will not understand \nthe ramifications of the language on human tissue.\n  I am against human cloning. I made that point emphatically clear in \nour conference, where I offered an amendment, a motion to strike the \nHouse language, which passed on the Senate side 18 to 8, but the House \nrefused to agree. So the language remained in the bill. But I believe \nthe scientific community in America is going to march on the Congress \nto stop the meddling with scientific research with vague prohibitions \nwhich can only lead to grave difficulties and which impede medical \nscience.\n  One concluding thought. I thank those on the other side of the aisle \nwho, as I understand it, have removed the holds on all of the pending \nnominees. Just a word in support of Pennsylvania Attorney General \nMichael Fisher, who is up for confirmation for the Third Circuit. I \nhave known Attorney General Fisher for the better part of three \ndecades. He has an extraordinary record in the Pennsylvania Legislature \nand as the State attorney general and as candidate for Governor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a full statement of his resume be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of these remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Attorney General Mike Fisher\n\n       Mike Fisher, the Attorney General of Pennsylvania since \n     1997, was nominated on May 1, 2003, by President George W. \n     Bush to serve on the Untied States Court of Appeals for the \n     Third Circuit, which covers Delaware, New Jersey, \n     Pennsylvania and the Virgin Islands. The nomination is \n     subject to a majority confirmation by the United States \n     Senate.\n       Currently serving his second four-year term, Attorney \n     General Fisher is only the third elected Attorney General in \n     State history. His top priorities have included protecting \n     Pennsylvanians from crime, reducing the use of illegal drugs, \n     stopping the tobacco industry from marketing to children, and \n     expanding consumer protection services.\n       Attorney General Fisher personally argued major cases in \n     State and Federal appellate courts. In March 1998, he \n     sucessfully argued before the United States Supreme Court a \n     precedent-setting case ensuring that paroled criminals meet \n     the conditions of their release.\n       Attorney General Fisher has worked to improve the quality \n     of justice in Pennsylvania. He is an active member of the \n     Pennsylvania Bar Association (PBA), serving in its House of \n     Delegates and on various committees. Working with the PBA, he \n     has co-sponsored an innovative violence prevention program in \n     Pennsylvania elementary schools called Project PEACE, which \n     helps young people learn to resolve conflicts without \n     violence. Fisher also encourages PBA participation by the \n     attorneys in his office.\n       Before his election as Attorney General, Mike Fisher served \n     for 22 years in the Pennsylvania General Assembly, serving \n     six years in the State House and 16 years as a member of the \n     State Senate. He was a member of the House and Senate \n     Judiciary Committees, the Chair of the Senate Environmental \n     Resources and Energy Committee and the Majority Whip of the \n     Senate. During his legislative career, he was a leader in \n     criminal and civil justice reform and an architect of many \n     major environmental laws.\n       Attorney General Fisher began his legal career in his \n     hometown of Pittsburgh following his graduation from \n     Georgetown University in 1966 and Georgetown University Law \n     Center in 1969. As an Assistant District Attorney for \n     Allegheny County, he handled nearly 1,000 cases, including 25 \n     homicides. He\n\n[[Page S15919]]\n\n     continued to practice law during his career in the General \n     Assembly and was a shareholder or partner in various firms, \n     including Houston Harbaugh, where he practiced from 1984 to \n     1997. Fisher's law practice included civil ligation, \n     commercial law, estate planning and real estate.\n       Mike Fisher was Pennsylvania's Republican candidate for \n     Governor in 2002. During a hard-fought campaign, he raised \n     key issues and helped shape current public debate on matters \n     such as Pennsylvania's growing medical malpractice insurance \n     crisis, the need to improve public education and the \n     necessity of property tax reform.\n       Attorney General Fisher and his wife, Carol, an education \n     consultant, have two children, Michelle, 27 an attorney in \n     Pittsburgh, and Brett, 24, an information technology sales \n     consultant in the Washington, D.C. area.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, since Medicare was established in 1965, \npeople are living longer and living better. Today Medicare covers more \nthan 40 million Americans, including 35 million over the age of 65 and \nnearly 6 million younger adults with permanent disabilities.\n  Congress now has the opportunity to modernize this important Federal \nentity to create a 21st century Medicare Program that offers \ncomprehensive coverage for pharmaceutical drugs and improves the \nMedicare delivery system.\n  The Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act would make \navailable a voluntary Medicare prescription drug plan for all seniors. \nIf enacted, Medicare beneficiaries would have access to a discount card \nfor prescription drug purchases starting in 2004. Projected savings \nfrom cards for consumers would range between 10 to 25 percent. A $600 \nsubsidy would be applied to the card, offering additional assistance \nfor low-income beneficiaries defined as 160 percent or below the \nFederal poverty level. Effective January 1, 2006, a new optional \nMedicare prescription drug benefit would be established under Medicare \nPart D.\n  This bill has the potential to make a dramatic difference for \nmillions of Americans living with lower incomes and chronic health care \nneeds. Low-income Medicare beneficiaries, who make up 44 percent of all \nMedicare beneficiaries, would be provided with prescription drug \ncoverage with minimal out-of-pocket costs. In Pennsylvania, this \nbenefit would be further enhanced by including the Prescription \nAssistance Contract for the Elderly (PACE) program which will work in \ncoordination with Medicare to provide increased cost savings for low-\nincome beneficiaries.\n  For medical services, Medicare beneficiaries will have the freedom to \nremain in traditional fee-for-service Medicare, or enroll in a Health \nMaintenance Organization (HMO) or a Preferred Provider Organization \n(PPO), also called Medicare Advantage. These programs offer \nbeneficiaries a wide choice of health care providers, while also \ncoordinating health care effectively, especially for those with \nmultiple chronic conditions. Medicare Advantage health plans would be \nrequired to offer at least the standard drug benefit, available through \ntraditional fee-for-service Medicare.\n  We already know that there are many criticisms directed to this bill \nat various levels. Many would like to see the prescription drug program \ncover all of the costs without deductibles and without co-pays. There \nhas been allocated in our budget plan $400 billion for prescription \ndrug coverage. That is, obviously, a very substantial sum of money. \nThere are a variety of formulas which could be worked out to utilize \nthis funding. The current plan, depending upon levels of income has \nseveral levels of coverage from a deductible to almost full coverage \nunder a ``catastrophic'' illness. One area of concern is the so-called \n``donut hole'' which requires a recipient to pay the entire cost of rug \ncoverage.\n  As I have reviewed these projections and analyses, it is hard to say \nwhere the line ought to be drawn. It is a value judgement as to what \ndeductibles and what the co-pays ought to be and for whom. Though I am \nseriously troubled by the so-called donut hole, it is calculated to \nencourage people to take the medical care they really need, and be \naffordable for those with lower levels of income. Then, when the costs \nmove into the ``catastrophic'' illness range, the plan would pay for \nnearly all of the medical costs.\n  I am pleased that this bill contains a number of improvements for the \nproviders of health care to Medicare beneficiaries. Physicians who are \nscheduled to receive cuts in 2004 and 2005 will receive a 1.5 percent \nincrease over that time. Moreover, rural health care providers will \nreceive much needed increases in Medicare reimbursement through raises \nto disproportionate share hospitals and standardized amounts, and a \ndecrease in the labor share in the Medicare reimbursement formula. \nHospitals across Pennsylvania will benefit from upgrades to the \nhospital market basket update and increases in the Indirect Medical \nEducation. Furthermore, the bill will provide $900 million for \nhospitals in metropolitan statistical areas with high labor costs due \nto their close proximity to urban areas that provide a \ndisproportionately high wage. These hospitals may apply for wage index \nreclassification for three years starting in 2004.\n  I would note that I do have concerns with this legislation with \nregard to oncological Medicare reimbursement and the premium support \ndemonstration project for Medicare Part B coverage. Proposed reductions \nin the average wholesale price for oncological pharmaceuticals may have \na grave effect on oncologists' ability to provide cancer care to \nMedicare Beneficiaries. Every Medicare beneficiary suffering from \ncancer should have access to oncologists that they desperately need. I \nwill pay close attention to the effects that this provision has on the \nquality and availability of cancer care for beneficiaries and \noncologists' ability to provide that care. Further, the premium support \ndemonstration project for Medicare Part B premiums poses a concern. \nSome metropolitan areas may face up to a five percent higher premium \nfor fee-for-service care than neighboring areas. While these provisions \nremain troublesome, we cannot let the perfect become the enemy of the \ngood with this piece of legislation.\n  The Medicare Prescription Drug legislation has been worked on for \nmany years. I believe this bill will provide a significant improvement \nto the vital health care seniors so urgently need. I congratulate the \nmembers of the conference committee including Majority Leader Frist, \nSenator Grassley, Chairman of the Finance Committee, and the Ranking \nMember, Senator Baucus, for the outstanding work which they have done \non an extraordinarily complex bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee).

Mr. President, people have to understand the process here. \nWe are being criticized for not agreeing to this omnibus bill.\n  I first of all want the Record to be spread with the fact that the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, has worked \ntirelessly to get this done. He has worked, not a matter of hours or \ndays but weeks. I have spoken to him on this legislation at least 50 \ntimes. So my remarks are not in any way to criticize the distinguished \nPresident pro tempore of the Senate.\n  Here it is, November 25, and there have been no final papers filed. \nWhat does that mean? There is no final draft of the legislation. \nYesterday was the first day that some selected staff people could look \nat the proposed bill. But even then there were open items. It certainly \ndoes not speak well of the legislative branch of Government, as to what \nis happening.\n  What do I mean by that? The Congress has agreed on these \nappropriations bills. The Congress, the House and the Senate, in \nconference have agreed on these bills. What has been the problem is the \ninterference--and I say that word purposely--by the executive branch of \nGovernment.\n  What are some of the outstanding items in this bill that are causing \nproblems? We have over here 15 holds on this bill if it ever came to \nme. Regarding the Federal Communications Commission, the House and the \nSenate have agreed. We had two votes in both bodies, overwhelming votes \nthat determined what would happen. But the White House is not happy \nwith that. They want that changed. They don't want to change it in the \nnormal process, by having hearings, et cetera; they want to do it in \nthe conference--even\n\n[[Page S15920]]\n\nthough there have been two overwhelming votes in both the House and the \nSenate.\n  Another deals with outsourcing. There were overwhelming votes in the \nHouse and Senate dealing with outsourcing, privatizing. The White House \ndoesn't like that, so they want it changed.\n  There were two overwhelming votes dealing with overtime pay. The \nWhite House didn't like the votes of the legislative branch of \nGovernment, so they, by fiat, want to change that.\n  Then we have other issues that are troublesome in this bill, not \nnecessarily to this Senator but to other Senators. We have situations \ndealing with when the ATF destroys records of the instant check on \nguns. The legislation called for 90 days. It has been shortened to 24 \nhours.\n  There is a situation that has come up that has overtones of the \nabortion debate. This is dealing with cloning, human cloning. We \nthought it was so simple in the committee that we--people don't want to \ndo cloning of human beings, but there is a protracted dispute as to how \nto write that.\n  This bill may pass when we come back in January. But we can come back \nnext week, the week after--it is not going to happen. It is not going \nto happen, as important as this legislation is. And no one knows the \nimportance of it more than the senior Senator from the State of \nConnecticut, Mr. Dodd, who has fought for this legislation, making sure \nthat we have fair votes across the country, that we have votes using \nthe same pieces of equipment, basically, so we do not have the problems \nwe had in the last Presidential election.\n  We understand the importance of this legislation, even though it is \nnot the right way to do things. We would rather do appropriations \nbills. We accept the omnibus strategy. But here it is, November 25, 1 \nmore day from the eve of Thanksgiving and we don't have a final draft \nof what they want us to approve, in addition to all of the things that \nhave been interfered with by the White House.\n  I believe in the Constitution of the United States. Here it is. This \nis the second one. It was given to me by Senator Byrd. I wore the first \none out. He gave it to me. I treasure the other one, although it is \nworn out. I asked him to give me another one.\n  The Constitution, among other things, calls for three separate but \nequal branches of Government. This is not a king's court. This is an \nExecutive led by the President and a Congress that has two branches; \nthe House and the Senate. Then, of course, we have the courts. The \nPresident can't just override by dictates what we have done here in a \nlegislative body. I know there are crocodile tears being shed by people \nsaying: Why can't we do the omnibus?\n  These are only some of the reasons. Some people badly want to pass \nthis omnibus bill, and the reason is quite clear. My friends have come \nto me and indicated that they agreed to do this in the Energy bill, or \nin this bill we just passed, because they were told they would get \nthings in the omnibus. I understand the legislative process. I have no \nqualms about arrangements being made. I believe legislation is the art \nof compromise. That is how we work with different legislation. There is \nnothing wrong with that. It is not illegal or immoral doing that. But \nyou have to understand that it will be a difficult time.\n  I favor the omnibus. I want to get it done. I have worked very hard \non the omnibus. The Senator from New Mexico and I added money in our \nenergy and water bill. There was no problem at all. We have worked with \nSenator Byrd and Senator Stevens to make sure we were part of the deal. \nWe didn't want to interfere with getting a bill. We were told there \nwere certain things that needed to come out of our bill and which could \nonly come from our part of the omnibus. We agreed to do that.\n  But I repeat: If we only had appropriations matters in this bill, \nthis thing would whip out of here in a second because the chairmen and \nthe ranking members of the appropriations committees are Members of the \nSenate who are appreciated and respected. They know we wouldn't jam \nthings into those bills. I speak for all of the other 12 appropriations \nsubcommittees on the Democratic side.\n  But we don't have that situation. We have a situation that these two \nlegislative bodies agreed to overwhelmingly. But the White House won't \nleave them alone. That is why the House hasn't given us a bill because \nthe White House won't leave them alone. They keep wanting other things \nstuffed in it.\n  When we come back in January, I hope this is the first bill we take \nup. I hope the second bill we take up is the highway bill. I hope we \nget to this bill. It is too bad we are not going to do something for \nthe months of December and January. It would be better for the American \npeople, and it would be better for my State. But we can't agree to this \nbecause we have so many problems dealing with FCC and outsourcing. We \nswallow hard and take the across-the-board cuts that Senator Stevens \nsaid we have to do. That is fine.  There are issues such as dealing \nwith guns, abortion, and overtime. People don't have to come and tell \nus what is in this bill. We know what is in this bill. We know how \nimportant the bill is. Go down 16 blocks from here and tell them to \nleave us alone and let us go back to the constitutional basis of this \ncountry and have a Congress that does what it wants. If the White House \ndoesn't like it, let them veto the bill. But they have no right, in my \nopinion, to start stuffing things in the bill that the House has \noverridden--overtime, FCC, outsourcing, for example.\n\n  I want this omnibus bill to pass. We want the omnibus bill to pass. \nBut we are not going to under the constraints we have.\n  Remember, it is November 25 and they still haven't filed the papers. \nWe are asking for unanimous consent to pass this. A legislator would \nhave to have rocks in their head to agree to something they haven't yet \nread.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15920-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15920-S15922]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE ENERGY BILL\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to make a few observations for \nthe Senate and for our people regarding the Energy bill that is still \npending as we leave.\n  First, I hope and pray that during the ensuing months without an \nEnergy bill we don't have high spikes in natural gas prices and the \npeople of our country asking: What have we done about it? Our answer is \nnothing. I hope that doesn't happen. But I think there is a chance it \nwill happen.\n  I hope there isn't another blackout. I am not sure there will be but \nthere could be. If there is, the American people are going to ask why \nand we are going to tell them because we did nothing. There was \nsomething that was in that bill that would have solved the problem, \naccording to the experts, and the answer will be, if you have a \nblackout, we did nothing.\n  For all of those who have projects that will be finished in wind, \nenergy, solar energy, and renewables, they will be looking around and \nasking: Where is my next project? The answer will be there is no next \nproject. The question will be: Why? And the answer will be because we \nhaven't provided laws that will give to those kinds of projects the tax \nrelief to which they are entitled and which they have been receiving \nthat will keep wind energy going and solar energy going and geothermal \nenergy going.\n  When these projects stop and thousands of people who are working in \nthe industry have no jobs, when there are no new projects, the question \nwill be asked: What happened? The answer will be simple. We didn't pass \nan Energy bill. I can go on with many more such as this.\n  In closing, I hope the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission does not \nact with the full power that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \nnow has. I hope the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will \nunderstand that we were that close to deciding we did not want the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission to have the single and sole power \nto regulate electricity interests in this country.\n\n  But when the first electric-generating plants and generating systems \nare mandated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to join in \norganizations that they don't want to be in, and they ask the question \nwhy, the answer is going to be clear.\n  For those Senators who represent them who are upset because their \nutilities are being forced to conduct themselves in a manner that the \nFederal\n\n[[Page S15921]]\n\nEnergy Regulatory Commission determines singularly and solely, the \nquestion will be: How can they do that? My friend, Senator Craig from \nIdaho, knows how they can do that. That is their authority without an \nEnergy bill.\n  We modified that significantly to take into account the differences \nin our energy system. That is gone. Between now and the time we get a \nchance to take another look at this bill, perhaps we will have a few of \nthose mandates that will take place. Then people will ask: Why did that \nhappen? I will say: Well, there was nothing we could do about it. The \nSenate chose not to pass the bill.\n  I acknowledge that the Senate worked its will at least temporarily in \nan interim decision, but I am hopeful that in the next couple of months \nas we watch things get worse in the energy field we will find a way to \ncome back to this bill and pass it substantially as it is, and if some \nadjustment has to be made, that we will find ways to do that.\n  It isn't going to be easy. But neither has it ever been easy to pass \nan energy policy for this country. We have been looking for it, looking \nat it, staring at it, watching it evolve and doing nothing for many \nyears. We passed a bill about 10 or 12 years ago. But it wasn't like \nthis bill. It wasn't a dramatic change in the policy of our land in \nterms of energy production and energy efficiency and energy \nalternatives. Those are temporary--while the winter season hits. Those \nare out there with no action. They have a big NA after them--no \naction--or a big nothing done by Congress after each of those episodes \nthat could occur and that will embarrass us because we didn't do our \njob.\n  I yield the floor to the distinguished Senator, Mr. Craig.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank my colleague, the senior Senator from New Mexico, \nfor yielding.\n  Let me first and foremost thank him for the phenomenal time and \neffort he has put into a national energy policy. We missed getting \ncloture by just two votes. Again, a majority of the Senate supports \nyour work. It is full, it is comprehensive, it is revolutionary in \ndriving this country toward having reliable energy once again.\n  As the average American got up this morning and flipped the light \nswitch, the lights came on. They expect that to happen every day. What \nthey do not understand is that there is now a risk in our country that \nmight not happen. Why? Because over the last decade we have not allowed \nthe energy sector to reinvest, to reconnect, to change the way it did \nbusiness in the past. Government regulation, in almost every instance, \nstood in the way and created a supertest and sometimes total \nobstruction in the ability of a company to invest back into the energy \nsector.\n  During the decade of the 1990s, if you wanted to generate \nelectricity, how did you do it? You used natural gas because the Clean \nAir Act said you could do it no other way. So we did. But on the other \nside, we were not producing more natural gas so we used up the surplus \ncapacity, and a couple of months ago gas spiked--at $5 to $6 per \nmillion cubic feet--astronomically high. What happened? The chemical \ncompanies shut down and sent their work overseas. Of course, those \nelectrical plants that were built in the decade of the 1990s, that were \ngenerating electricity, turned off the switches. They could not afford \nin the marketplace to be able to generate electricity. The bill we have \nin the Senate today, that we have been denied passage of, would go a \nlong way toward remedying that problem.\n  If the American consumer believes you pass a bill tomorrow and the \nlight switch is reliable, they better remember its reliability is based \non a decade of investment, that it does not happen just overnight. What \nthe Senator from New Mexico was trying to do is drive that investment \nforward for decades to come to create reliability.\n  The other morning I woke up to the announcement that the President of \nthe nation of Georgia had just resigned. What does that mean as it \nrelates to our energy? We want the oil out of the Caspian Sea to flow \ninto the energy markets of this world to drive down overall prices and \nto create availability. Guess what happened. Companies are building a \nmajor pipeline across Georgia. They invested heavily through the \npolitics of this President. He resigned. Georgia is almost in \nrevolution. Yet that $2 billion pipeline that is going to start \nproducing about 1.2 million barrels of oil a day into the world market \nmay not produce.\n  The significance of the resignation of Shevardnadze, the President of \nGeorgia, is quite simple. He, by that action, created some degree of \ninstability in the world oil market. If we are going to continue to \nrely on our supply flowing from unstable areas of the world, then the \nAmerican consumer can expect broad fluctuations at the fuel pump--\n$1.50, $2, $2.50.\n  The passage of this legislation would stabilize that kind of action. \nThere is no question. If this Senate thinks we will rely on the nation \nof Georgia or the Caspian Sea or Saudi Arabia or anywhere else to be a \nreliable, continual supplier of hydrocarbons into our system to fuel \nthe gas pumps and to fuel our chemical industry, they ought to think \nonce again.\n\n  The Senate Energy Committee has fought long and hard about this for \nthe last decade. In the last 5 years we have worked hard, in the last 2 \nyears we have kept the lights burning all night to try to craft a bill.\n  The Senator from New Mexico got that job done. We missed by just two \nvotes in the Senate. It is the President's No. 1 priority. He thinks \nlike we think, if we do not make a major move in the direction of \nbeginning to supply energy to the country once again, the availability \nof jobs, our cost of living, our lifestyles, our standards, all that we \nhold dear as Americans will have to change because so much of what we \ndo today is based on a relatively low cost, reliable supply of energy \nto all sectors, all segments of our economy.\n  Shame on this Senate because a little bit was not right or a little \nbit was not right there. Nobody looked down the road. Nobody got out in \nfront of their headlights to try to understand the implication of \nfailing to move a bill that produces long-term investment in the energy \nsector.\n  We just passed an important bill for all citizens of our country. It \nis an expenditure right out of the general fund of the United States \nTreasury. While we were criticized on the energy side for some of the \ntax credits in this bill, there is a fundamental difference.\n  First of all, the industry has to invest in the economy before they \ncan get the credit out. They have to drive investment. They have to go \nout and borrow money, pour concrete, build transmission lines, and hire \npeople. These jobs, created by the tax incentives and the investment, \nis somewhere in the neighborhood of 800,000 over the decade into the \nenergy sector.\n  There is a fundamental difference in the way both bills ought to be \nlooked at. While what we just voted on is an important expenditure for \nthe well-being of our country and the well-being of our citizen's \nhealth, this is an investment in the infrastructure, in the stability, \nin the light switch reliability.\n  Tomorrow morning, for anyone who is listening, when you flip that \nswitch for just a moment, think, how did the electricity get there? No \none really understands it unless you have studied it. Think a little \nbit about it. When you go to the gas pump and fill up your car, ask \nyourself why it is a little higher now than it was a year ago. How did \nit get there? All of that is part of what makes our country work.\n  The Energy bill we had before the Senate, the Energy bill we must \nhave before the Senate again when we return, will speak to that, speak \nto it clearly, and say to the American people, the Congress of the \nUnited States has looked out into the future, determined what the \nfundamental needs are, and is creating an environment of investment \nthat creates reliability, that creates conservation, that creates new \ntechnologies, that drives the energy sector in the direction of \nproduction as well as conservation for the well-being of this country \nand future generations.\n  I thank the senior Senator from New Mexico for all the work he has \ndone in 2004. Early on in the next session of the 108th it is incumbent \nupon this Congress to finish our work on that issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom the State of Idaho, Mr. Craig,\n\n[[Page S15922]]\n\nvery much for his comments and his help on the bill thus far.\n  He made a great point about the future in terms of investment and the \ninfrastructure. This bill would have encouraged that. That is just one \nitem.\n  There is an ancient piece of legislation called PUCHA, and it would \nhave been repealed. People have been saying it should have been \nrepealed for decades. It makes it hard to get the kind of investment in \nthis industry that most industries can get. We finally repealed it this \nyear. It was stuck in the mud of an ancient bill. We are scared to let \nmoney get invested in utilities and utility investment in business.\n  Everywhere you looked there were things to be fixed. That is why it \nis a big bill.\n  There is an issue, Senator, regarding the MTBE, the substance \napproved by the United States Government as an oxidizer for gasoline. \nThere is no question Senators brought issues with reference to it to \nthe attention of the Senate. We have to take a look at that with the \nHouse because the Senate has many Members who are worried about that \nissue. We know we get no bill or we take that in conference.\n  I hope the House will look at that in January because when this bill \ndies, there is no protection for the producers of MTBE. When it dies, \nthe hold harmless clause that we put in--and we can sit around a table \nand with enough time we can convince almost anyone that they are not so \nbad as some implied. That is a major issue that will have to be looked \nat. I thank the White House for helping us on that--or trying to help. \nThere are those who think it is the most important issue around, and I \nhave an empathy with them.\n  I call on them to apply their thought process in the next few months. \nThe bill will die if we do not inject life into it. With it will go \nwhatever protections the MTBE industry got in this bill. Maybe that is \nthe way we can look at it when we come back and try to figure out a way \nto take a frontal attack on that issue. Who knows, there might be \nenough Senators who may want to take a look at that bill just on that \npoint alone.\n\n  I close now by thanking Senators who worked very hard on the bill. It \nis as difficult an undertaking as you can have. I decided to do that \nafter years on the budget, and it is much more difficult than writing \nthe budget for the United States. We did it, but in a sense we are two \nvotes short. The rule is it requires 50 votes for adoption, but we did \nnot have enough for a filibuster, which would require 60.\n  So with that, I yield the floor and thank the Senate for listening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15922-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15922-S15926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ACCOMPLISHMENTS THIS YEAR\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I commend the chairman of the Energy \nCommittee and the Senator from Idaho for their fine work on the Energy \nbill. While we are not going to get that bill passed before we leave \nfor the holiday break, it is something that I know the Senator from New \nMexico and the Senator from Idaho and others are going to work on and \ndiligently try to accomplish for the reasons they outlined.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to run down and put into the Record a summary \nof some of the things we have been able to accomplish this year.\n  We go out on the accomplishment of delivering to the American people \nwhat has been asked now for several years by our seniors, and not just \nby seniors but by the children of seniors and the grandchildren of \nseniors, who see the fiscal strains that have been put on their parents \nand grandparents as a result of, in many cases, not having prescription \ndrug coverage or having prescription drug coverage that is very \nexpensive. Particularly for lower-income individuals, it can be quite a \ndrain on their resources, as well as diminishing their quality of life \nin their senior years.\n  So we go out on somewhat of a high here. And as it should be, because \nwe have accomplished a lot this year.\n  If you go back to when this session started, and the Senator from \nTennessee became the majority leader in the transfer of power, if you \nwill, here in the Senate, the first thing he said we would do was clean \nup the mess that did not get accomplished last year.\n  We had no budget last year, which meant we could not really pass any \nof our appropriations bills. The Government spending was locked into \nlast year's level, and we did not have a whole lot of new initiatives \nat the time, when we were looking at a whole new Department of Homeland \nSecurity, a war on terror, and a war on the horizon in Iraq.\n  There was a lot of uncertainty going on here, and we did not have the \nfiscal discipline in place to be able to get our fiscal house in order \nhere in Washington, DC.\n  So the first thing we said we would do was we would clean up that \nmess and pass the spending bills, and fight off repeated attempts, in \nalmost $1 trillion in amendments on the other side, of adding spending \nto these appropriations bills and then subsequently to the budget that \nwe passed after we passed the appropriations bills from the prior year.\n  So we passed the appropriations bills from the prior year. On top of \nthat, we put a new budget in place, and we passed a budget. We thought \nthat was important. Many here thought another budget could never pass \nin the Senate because of the practice of last year and the difficulty \nin trying to get a budget into the framework of seeing really slow \ngrowth compared to what we have seen in the past 7 or 8 years.\n  That was accomplished. It was tough, and a lot of tough votes. We \nwere able to stand tall and fight back amendments from many on the \nother side of the aisle. And some on the other side of the aisle joined \nus. I thank those Members who have stood up, just as many did today, to \nwhat appears to be, from the Democratic leadership point of view, \nobstructionist tactics that are used here in the Senate on almost--I \nalmost want to go back and maybe reconsider the term ``almost''--I will \nsay almost everything, but it is almost everything to the point where \nyou think it is everything. But we have had some cooperation from many \nDemocrats, and certainly enough to get some of the more important bills \nthat we considered here done. I thank those who participated in that \nbipartisan cooperation.\n\n  We were able to accomplish a budget. We were able to accomplish, as a \nresult of the budget, a tax plan, again, done in a bipartisan way, here \non the floor of the Senate. And the effects of that tax plan have been \nreally some of the most startling economic news we have seen in a long \ntime.\n  Just today, it was announced for the last quarter growth--which was \nreally the first full quarter that was able to get the impact of the \nPresident's tax reduction and jobs growth proposal--we saw it now not \nat 7.2 percent growth but 8.2 percent growth, the best in 20 years in \nthis country. That is an enormous feather in the cap of this \nadministration's policy of stimulating growth in the economy by \nreducing taxes, particularly targeted at investors and small- and \nmedium-sized businesses.\n  We were able to accomplish that because we had a budget we passed in \nthe Senate that allowed for a tax reduction that has been put in place. \nAs a result of that tax reduction, which in part was reducing capital \ngains tax, but also reducing the double taxation of dividends, it has \ncaused a $2 trillion increase--a $2 trillion increase--in valuations of \nequities in this country. That is an enormous turnaround.\n  I was watching the news this morning, and someone was talking about \ntheir retirement savings having been eroded, and the impact on seniors, \nand the impact on those who are approaching those seniors years and \ntheir ability to have a stable retirement. When you add $2 trillion \nback to the value of those equities, you do a lot to stabilize people's \nretirement and give them the peace of mind they are going to be able to \nget through their retirement years with a fair--hopefully, good--\nstandard of living.\n  That was as a result of the budget, the leadership here in the Senate \nand of the Senate Republicans, and ultimately the tax reduction that \nwas passed as a result of the great leadership of our President.\n  We were able to provide resources for, obviously, the war on \nterrorism and homeland security, which is a new appropriation. The \nSenator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran, who chairs that subcommittee, \nwas just in the Chamber. We passed that bill in a timely\n\n[[Page S15923]]\n\nfashion so those increased resources would go out to help fight the war \non terrorism here at home, as well as, obviously, provide resources we \nneed for our men and women in uniform in Afghanistan and in Iraq to \nfight the battle on terrorism on the front line over in the Middle \nEast.\n  Another historic accomplishment of this Congress, which is yet to be \nfully realized is the AIDS bill. We were able to pass a bill that \nauthorized money for AIDS. And now we are talking about fulfilling that \npromise to come up with the money that was in the authorization to fund \nAIDS in Africa and several countries in the Caribbean that are faced \nwith outrageous, just absolutely incredible suffering and the \ndestruction of the family unit in those countries, with infection rates \nof double digits in the country, with literally millions of people \ninfected with this disease, and transmitting it, in some cases, to \ntheir children.\n  We need to do something about prevention, and we need to do something \nabout the transmission of AIDS. We also need to do something about \ntreatment. With the appropriations bill that is now going to be filed \nin the House in about an hour and 20 minutes, we will have the \nPresident's AIDS proposal fully funded: $2 billion in bilateral aid and \n$400 million to meet our obligations under the Global Fund--for every \n$1 we put up, $2 of international funds. And $400 million will meet \nthat obligation as of this time.\n  We will have in place the commitment we made to those less fortunate \nin Africa and in the Caribbean for the needed help on prevention, \ntransmission, and treatment of those who are suffering with AIDS or \nhopefully will not get AIDS. That is a huge accomplishment for this \nSenate. Candidly, it is probably one of most important things we can do \nfor humanitarian relief. If you look back in history, there really \nisn't a humanitarian crisis, a health crisis that will match what is \ngoing on today in Africa and sub-Saharan Africa. I am glad to be part \nof a Senate which on a bipartisan fashion stood up and made a huge \nfinancial commitment. It is not an easy thing to do in a country that \nfeels a lot of suffering here at home and wants more resources directed \nhere at home, to be able to set that money aside for those who are \nliterally dying by the thousands each day from this pandemic that has \nstruck sub-Saharan Africa. The commitment of the President, followed up \nby the commitment here in the Congress, is something of which we should \nall be very proud.\n  We passed the partial-birth abortion act. We are stopping this \nhorrendous procedure from occurring anymore. There are those who are \ntaking that bill to court. We expected that, but the Senate, with the \nPresident's leadership, has been able to pass this bill that is \noverwhelmingly supported by the American public and is a real step in \nthe right direction. We haven't had very many steps in the right \ndirection with respect to this culture in America. This is a step in \nthe right direction to put some humanity back in the treatment of those \ninnocent children in the womb.\n  We passed some antispam legislation. As someone who has young kids \nand is bombarded daily with e-mails of not the most wholesome nature, \npop-up ads and the like, this is a tool we can give to authorities to \ntry to limit the amount of that kind of information falling into the \nhomes of families. It is a very serious problem to have this wonderful \ntool of the Internet be infected by this disease of pornography and \nviolence and other things that are marketed to our children through e-\nmails and through other types of advertising. The Senate has begun the \nslow process. It will be a slow process, as maybe it should be, because \nwe have to balance the rights of free speech. Freedom is something that \nneeds to be used responsibly. No one who wrote the founding documents \nof this country believed freedom to be an absolute. With rights come \nresponsibilities. That freedom, more properly defined as liberty, is a \nbalancing of those rights and responsibilities. We need to seek to do \nthat in the case of the Internet, which I find to be a wonderful tool \nbut at the same time a very dangerous vehicle for information to flow \nto people who may not handle it well and may be scarred or changed for \nlife as a result of some of this activity.\n  As I went down that list, I think you can see it is a list of great \naccomplishment. Yet at the same time there is so much left to be done \nand so much that was blocked by the other side. So when you hear, as \nyou will hear, the term ``obstructionism'' about things that could have \nbeen--the Senator from Idaho is here and talked eloquently about the \nEnergy bill--could have been, should have been, but for the procedural \ntactics of raising the requirement to pass this bill by 60 votes \ninstead of an up-or-down vote of 51. That is their right to do. But as \nthe Senator from Idaho and the Senator from New Mexico said earlier, it \nis going to have severe consequences for the long-term future of our \neconomy.\n\n  Energy is not something you turn off and on like we do the stove or \nthe thermostat. It is something that takes a long time to be developed. \nIt takes investment, a lot of people, a lot of steps in the process, as \nit should, even environmental steps in the process to be able to \nextract the resources we need. We are not moving in that direction. We \nare not moving toward energy independence. For a country that is as \nmuch dependent upon cheap energy as this country and this economy are, \nto continue to turn a blind eye towards the needs of our economy and \nthe impact on the quality of life here is a very dangerous thing.\n  Again, I suggest while I understand the rights of the minority, we \nneed to find a way to get the 60 votes necessary to get this piece of \nlegislation moved forward for our children and for our future economy.\n  We have the omnibus appropriations bill. One of the victories was the \nAIDS authorization bill we were able to pass. But more candidly, the \nmost important thing is funding that program. There are a whole host of \nthings: An increase in VA health care, which is in the omnibus \nappropriations bill, an increase in NIH funding is in the Labor-HHS. \nThere are so many important priorities in this bill. Yet we have been \ntold we are just not going to be able to get to it until January. I \nknow the leader later is going to ask unanimous consent to bring up \nthis bill when the House passes it. The House will pass it first, as it \ndoes customarily with appropriations bills. They are coming back \nDecember 8. We hope to reconvene the Senate shortly thereafter to bring \nup this legislation so we can pass it here. Why? Well, because if we \ndon't pass it, those increases in VA health care funding, those \nincreases in AIDS funding, those increases in NIH, and a whole host of \nother things in this bill simply will not go into effect until at the \nearliest the end of January.\n  If you are for those increases and you are for the realignment of \nbudget priorities in these appropriations bills, we should take a \nlittle time out of our break, come back here for a day. We will have \nhad several weeks to look at this. The bill will be filed in an hour \nand 10 minutes. Take a look at it. If you have problems with it, you \ncertainly have the opportunity to voice that opposition and vote no. \nBut that is going to be the up-or-down vote we are going to have. We \nshould take the opportunity to come back and do it in a timely fashion. \nWe have been told by the other side they will object to us coming back. \nSo this bill will sit there for roughly 2 months with a variety of \ndifferent spending priorities many people in this Chamber agree with \nand that the American public has asked us for, including increased \nfunding for education, DC choice, allowing students in the District of \nColumbia to have the opportunity to go to the schools of their \nchoosing. All of those things will be in this bill, and we will not be \nable to have a vote because of the power--it is a wonderful thing when \nyou are the minority--of individual Senators to stop things from \nhappening. That is another obstruction.\n  We spent 3 days here on the floor of the Senate 10 days ago, 12 days \nago, debating the issue of judges. Here we are again. We have six \nqualified, terrific nominees--not turkeys, not lemons, not \nneanderthals. Those were words used here in the Senate to refer to \ndistinguished people who are judges in their own right today, justices \nof supreme courts today, reelected by overwhelming numbers in their \nhome States, gone through the ABA approval process and were considered \nto be either qualified or unanimously well\n\n[[Page S15924]]\n\nqualified. These folks were referred to by the people here in the \nSenate as neanderthals, as lemons, and in some respects as turkeys.\n  I can understand where there may be a difference as to the \nqualifications of these judges. They have every right to suggest their \ndeficiencies. But to use that kind of terminology to describe people of \ndistinguished legal records and careers calls into question the \npropriety of the Senators' remarks and whether they don't in fact meet \nthe standard of what is referred to as rule XIX. Rule IX refers to a \nSenator. I don't think we should be able to refer to nominees, who put \nthemselves out to serve the public, in a way that is as callous and \ncavalier and disrespectful as that.\n\n  So I suggest that there is another area of obstructionism--changing \nthe rules. For 214 years, the rule was that every judicial nomination \nthat came to the Senate floor got an up-or-down vote. Since we put the \nfilibuster in place in the early 1930s, 2,370 nominees have come to the \nfloor of the Senate, and zero were filibustered. None. None were \nblocked.\n  Now, there are several on that side of the aisle who have taken to \nputting a chart up that shows 168 to 6, as if 6 is somehow a good \nnumber out of 174, when zero out of 2,370 was the norm. I think the \nSenator from Georgia, Saxby Chambliss, suggested the right answer to \nthat. They said they were doing a great job in approving them 95 \npercent of the time. The Senator from Georgia suggested that if he went \nhome to his wife and said he was faithful to her 95 percent of the \ntime, that would not be adequate in her eyes. It is not adequate, when \nthe Constitution requires an up-or-down vote, for those people who \nbelieve in the sanctity of that Constitution to say we are upholding it \n95 percent of the time. But that is what is happening on judicial \nnominations, and it is another case of obstruction.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, during the debate on the judges, the \nopponents, the Democrats who were obstructing an up-or-down vote, \nasserted that these judges were ``extreme,'' and they repeated that. \nThey used that word repeatedly. They really cited no specific reason \nthey were extreme. I ask the Senator from Pennsylvania, who has been so \neloquent on this issue, how he can explain, in light of the groups we \nnow know are opposing these nominees, who are extreme? I think we can \ndemonstrate, without any doubt, these nominees, such as Janice Rogers \nBrown of California, who got 76 percent of the vote, and Judge \nPriscilla Owen, who got 84 percent of the vote are not extreme. Is the \nSenator from Pennsylvania aware that among the groups blocking these \njudges, and actually appearing to pull the strings of Members of the \nSenate, they have views on their Web sites?\n  For example, they say there should be no pornography laws, even child \npornography. They oppose any change in abortion whatsoever, even \npartial-birth abortion, which 84 percent of the American people believe \nought to be dealt with. Some of them believe in legalization of drugs. \nI ask the Senator, who is extreme here?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Obviously, by definition, a Republican who gets 76 \npercent of the vote in a State such as California cannot be extreme. \nCertainly, if they are extreme in the State of California, the only \nchance I would think in my mind that someone could get that high a vote \nis if they were extremely liberal. California, let's admit, is a fairly \nliberal State. It is a very heavily Democratic State. So for a \nRepublican ``extremist'' in California to get 76 percent of the vote--I \ndon't think Republican extremists can get 76 percent of the vote in a \nState such as California. I argue that, by definition, that doesn't \nwash.\n  The fact is, what the Senator said is true. When you have these \norganizations who, in these memos that have leaked out, are sort of \ngiving marching orders to Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee on \nthe Democratic side as to what nominees to hold--and some use the term, \nreferring to Miguel Estrada who was nominated for the second highest \ncourt in the land--a great rags-to-riches story of a Hispanic immigrant \nto this country--that he was ``dangerous'' or a ``threat.'' It was one \nof those terms. He is a real threat. Why? Because he is a superior \nintellect? Because he has tremendous qualifications? No, because he is \nLatino and we cannot have that.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If the Senator will yield, does he think it is possible \nthey saw Miguel Estrada as a threat because he is a brilliant \nmainstream lawyer, a Hispanic, who would make a highly qualified \nappointment to the Supreme Court?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is exactly what they said. He is all of the things \nI talked about--highly qualified, very bright, and a great story of \nintegrity and overcoming obstacles. It is a compelling story. As a \nresult of his ethnicity, he would be a threat because he might be \nelevated to a higher court someday.\n  This is the kind of activity I think really does debase this \ninstitution. We should not be involved in blocking people who, 10 years \nago, would have probably not even required a vote on the floor of the \nSenate to be confirmed. We have gotten to the point where the special \ninterests--you hear so much on the Medicare bill about the special \ninterests that were involved in the Medicare bill. I cannot think of \nany area where special interests have had more impact that has been \ncontrary to the interests of ordinary citizens in America than what we \nhave seen by the special interests on this judge debate. These \norganizations support the things the Senator from Alabama just talked \nabout. But they were also the ones supporting the complete removal of \nGod, or any hint of God, in the public square, whether it is in Alabama \nor in the Pledge of Allegiance out in the Ninth Circuit.\n  The people who made this decision in the Ninth Circuit to strike \n``under God'' from the Pledge of Allegiance--do you think they were \nnominees who would be considered to be out of the mainstream that \nPresident Bush supported or nominated? No. They are nominees of, \nprimarily, President Clinton, who views the Constitution as a document \nto be ignored, a nice little piece of antiquity that they might want to \nlook to see if it suits their purpose. But if it doesn't, we will set \nit aside and do what we think is right. That is what they do on a \nregular basis. It is called activist judges who believe we are a \ngovernment of men, not laws. That is what many on the other side--\nparticularly members of the Judiciary Committee--would love to see. \nThey don't want judges who take the Constitution and the words in it \nseriously and feel bound by them. So we had a huge debate.\n  I think it was an important debate for the Senate on that important \nissue, and a related issue. There are several issues percolating in the \nSenate to do something about the huge cost of litigation to our \neconomy--whether it is asbestos litigation, on which there have been \ntens of thousands of cases filed by people who have been ``exposed'' to \nasbestos. In the vast majority of the cases, the people who have filed \nthe case, the plaintiffs, are not sick and have no indication that they \never will be sick. But they have been ``exposed.'' They are clogging \nthe courts, consuming huge amounts of resources. I hear colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle complain about manufacturing and the problems \nwith manufacturing. Well, look at the asbestos liability issue, in \nlight of what we are doing to our manufacturers. Manufacturers are \ngoing bankrupt--I won't say every day, but every week or two--because \nof this litigation going on. It is frivolous. The worst part is, I have \npeople in my State who were infected and have asbestosis, mesothelioma. \nIt is a disease that comes with exposure to asbestos, and a respiratory \ndisease. These people are sick and they are dying and they are not able \nto get a proper jury award. In fact, they have gotten their awards and \nit is pennies. The money was eaten up by the trial lawyers. It is a \nhorrible situation.\n\n  We need to get the people who are sick the compensation for their \ndisease and the treatment for their disease, and those who are not \nsick, they need to be set aside. If they get sick, they will be \ncompensated, but we are all exposed to lots of dangerous things in our \nlives. That doesn't mean you can sue for them. Only if it causes you \nharm should you be able to sue. That is another area again being \nblocked.\n  Class action: I see the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Carper, here, who \nis one\n\n[[Page S15925]]\n\nof the leaders in trying to get a bipartisan bill together. I give him \na lot of credit. It is another attempt like we did with Medicare, on \nwhich he was involved, trying to bring the sides together. So far, we \nhave not been able to get to that 60-vote threshold. We need to get \nthat bill done to try to help our economy move forward.\n  Medical liability, frivolous lawsuits: Again, this is plaguing the \nsystem when it comes to health care, driving up our cost of \npharmaceuticals and of health care. In Pennsylvania, our doctors are \nmoving to Delaware, moving to other places where the laws are more \nbeneficial, where the legislatures have put caps in place to try to \nlimit the amount of cases where runaway juries end up bankrupting the \nhealth care system.\n  That is another area where we have been blocked over and over.\n  Another area we have been blocked, something on which I have been \nworking, is assistance to the poor. We are trying to pass a charitable \ngiving bill, a bill in which I have been involved. We are talking about \ngiving $10 billion over the next 2 years in incentives for people to \ngive more money to charities at a time when we are still not completely \nout of the recession that hit us in 2001 and 2002.\n  Again, we have not been able to get the cooperation necessary to get \na bipartisan bill to help social service providers, to help nonprofit \ngroups meet the humanitarian needs of people.\n  I can go on. The bioshield bill is being blocked. There are a lot of \nother issues on which we are being obstructed. I wanted to balance the \naccomplishments we have been able to achieve in the Senate and this \nCongress, and they have been substantial. We have a lot to go back home \nand talk about as to what we have been able to work out in a bipartisan \nway in the Senate, but there is still a lot of work to be done that the \nHouse has accomplished and that is sitting in the Senate not being \ndone. It is very important to our economy and very important to the \nfuture of our country.\n  One further comment. The Senator from Idaho has been very patient. I \ndon't know if the Senator from Idaho or the leader is going to propound \nmomentarily a unanimous consent request to vote on a resolution. This \nis a resolution having to do with marriage.\n  As my colleagues know, the Massachusetts Supreme Court handed down a \n4-to-3 decision that said there is now a constitutional right in the \nState of Massachusetts to same-sex marriage, which is a remarkable turn \nof events, within a few months of a case in the U.S. Supreme Court, the \nLawrence v. Texas case, which took an act--which for 214 years in many \nStates has been seen as an illegal act and in the vast majority of the \nAmerican public's mind certainly not a moral act--an act of sodomy and \nturned that act into a constitutional right. That is what the Court \ndid. It turned this act that is considered by many to be illegal in \nStates and, by most Americans, immoral with no tradition of acceptance \nof the history of the United States since our Constitution was written. \nThey have taken that act and turned that into a constitutionally \nprotected act.\n  Many of us said there would be consequences for doing so. When we \nsaid that, we thought it would be years down the line. It has not taken \nyears; it has taken a matter of a few months for the Massachusetts \nSupreme Court to cite Lawrence v. Texas and say now that this is a \nconstitutionally protected right to engage in this behavior, how can we \ndiscriminate two people who engage in this behavior under the equal \nprotection clause, to protect everybody equally, how can we \ndiscriminate against these people who are practicing a constitutional \nright under the rights and privileges of marriage? It would be unequal \ntreatment if we didn't treat these constitutionally protected actions \nthe same way as we treat traditional marriage.\n  I suggested before Lawrence v. Texas was decided that if it was \ndecided in the way it was, we would be heading down a slippery slope. I \nwas wrong. We are heading off a cliff. This is not a slippery slope; it \nis a cliff.\n  If we do not respond to this decision, other States will be forced to \naccept the dictates of the Massachusetts Supreme Court--the court of \nappeals in this case. A couple can go to Massachusetts, get married, \ncome back to Pennsylvania, Idaho, Alabama, or Delaware, and say: I \ndemand under the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution that \nyou recognize this marriage.\n  What is the State to do, because the Constitution demands it. So we \nare in a situation where de facto, we could have that policy of \nMassachusetts by an unelected group of judges, by a vote of 4 to 3 \nbeing forced on the entire country unless we do something in the Senate \nto act. That is a constitutional amendment which defines marriage and \ndescribes it in the Constitution.\n  I happen to think we put a lot in the Constitution that are building \nblocks of society, certain freedoms, certain truths that we establish \nin the Constitution. I cannot imagine anything more fundamentally \nimportant to the stability of our society than having stable families \nin which to raise stable children, and anything that undermines that, \nto me, undermines the core of who we are as Americans.\n  We will ask for a vote on the resolution. I ask unanimous consent to \nprint the resolution in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       Whereas, marriage is a fundamental social institution that \n     has been tested and reaffirmed over thousands of years; and\n       Whereas, historically marriage has been reflected in our \n     law and the law of all jurisdictions in the United States as \n     the union of a man and a woman, and the everyday meaning of \n     marriage and the legal meaning of marriage as defined in \n     Black's Law Dictionary is ``the legal union of a man and a \n     woman as husband and wife;'' and\n       Whereas, families consisting of the legal union of one man \n     and one woman for the purpose of bearing and raising children \n     remains the basic unit of our civil society; and\n       Whereas, in Goodrige v. Department of Public Health, the \n     Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts ruled four to three \n     that the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts \n     prohibits the denial of the issuance of marriage licenses to \n     same-sex couples; and\n       Whereas, the power to regulate marriage lies with the \n     legislature and not with the judiciary and the Constitution \n     of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts specifically states that \n     the judiciary ``shall never exercise the legislative and \n     executive powers, or either of them: to the end it may be a \n     government of laws and not of men;'' and\n       Whereas, in 1996, Congress overwhelmingly passed, and \n     President Bill Clinton signed, the Defense of Marriage Act \n     under which Congress exercised its rights under the Effects \n     Clause of Article IV Section 1 of the United States \n     Constitution: Now, therefore, be it.\n       Resolved, That it is the Sense of the Senate--\n       (1) That marriage in the United States shall consist only \n     of the union of one man and one woman; and that same-sex \n     marriage is not a right, fundamental or otherwise, recognized \n     in this country; and that neither the United States \n     Constitution nor any Federal law shall be construed to \n     require that marital status or legal incidents thereof be \n     conferred upon unmarried couples or groups; and\n       (2) The Defense of Marriage Act is a proper and \n     constitutional exercise of Congress's powers under the \n     Effects Clause of Article IV Section 1 and that no State, \n     territory, or possession of the United States, or Indian \n     tribe, shall be required to give effect to any public act, \n     record, or judicial proceeding of any other State, territory, \n     possession, or tribe respecting a relationship between \n     persons of the same sex that is treated as a marriage under \n     the laws of such State, territory, possession, or tribe, or a \n     right or claim arising from such relationship.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I won't read the whereases, but I will \nread the resolved clause:\n\n     . . . it is the sense of the Senate--\n       (1) That marriage in the United States shall consist only \n     of the union of one man and one woman; and that same-sex \n     marriage is not a right, fundamental or otherwise, recognized \n     in this country; and that neither the United States \n     Constitution nor any federal law shall be construed to \n     require that marital status or legal incidents thereof be \n     conferred upon unmarried couples or groups. . . .\n\n  Second, because we already passed a statute in the Congress that \naccomplishes pretty much what I just read--it was the Defense of \nMarriage Act, supported by 90-some Senators and signed by President \nClinton. The resolution says:\n\n       (2) The Defense of Marriage Act is a proper and \n     constitutional exercise of Congress's powers under the \n     Effects Clause of Article IV Section 1 and that no state, \n     territory, or possession of the United States, or Indian \n     tribe, shall be required to give effect to any public act, \n     record, or judicial proceeding of any other state, territory, \n     possession, or tribe respecting a relationship between \n     persons of the same sex that is treated as a marriage\n\n[[Page S15926]]\n\n     under the laws of such state, territory, possession, or \n     tribe, or a right or claim arising from such relationship.\n\n  In other words, we are going to go back on record in the sense of the \nSenate--as a precursor, hopefully, to a more full debate--that no State \nshould be forced to adopt the marriage laws of another State such as \nMassachusetts. It should be, as this constitutional amendment which I \nwill advocate will be, the people's decision. If the people decide, by \nconstitutional amendment or otherwise, we are going to change what \nmarriage is, I will fight against that, but I will respect that \ndecision because that is the way we decide issues in America.\n  What I am concerned about is that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts \nand their courts are going to create a new constitutional right; they \nare going to change the Constitution without going through the rigors \nof what the Constitution demands for change, and that is a \nconstitutional amendment.\n  So we will take up that mantle. We will do it the right way. We will \ntry to change the Constitution in the way the Framers intended, not the \nway it has been practiced recently with the courts taking on that \nmantle themselves and changing it without the benefit of having any \npublic input on the process.\n  We will offer an amendment to get the constitutional majority that is \nnecessary to pass it, which is two-thirds of the Members of this body \nand of the House, and then three-quarters of the States through their \nlegislature, representing the people in those States, to ratify this \namendment.\n  I believe this is a fundamentally important issue, one I guarantee we \nwill be discussing at length next year, and I hope the American public \nwill begin to engage in this debate, not as an attempt to stop anybody \nfrom doing anything but as an attempt to solidify what is the basic \nbuilding block of our society.\n  This is not being done as against anybody. It is being done for \nsomething that we know has intrinsic value and good and is a \nstabilizing and important element of any successful society, and that \nis healthy stable families in which children can be raised in that \nenvironment, so we can raise the leaders of the next generation.\n  This is an important debate. I hope we will not be obstructed. I hope \nwe will have an opportunity to have a full and fair debate on this \nissue, that the public will have an opportunity to see the Senate at \nits finest on an issue that I believe is at the core of who we are as \nAmericans.\n  I thank the Senator from Idaho for his indulgence in listening to me \ngo on for a while, as well as the Senator from Delaware, although he \nhad to indulge less than the Senator from Idaho.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I was pleased to sit and wait and listen to \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania. I appreciate his leadership and the \naccomplishments he has helped guide us through this past year in the \nfirst session of the 108th Congress. They are many, and there are yet \nmany to accomplish.\n  Yes, we have had substantial obstructionism on the part of our \ncolleagues on the other side. Why? It is politics to them in many \ninstances. They see those as defining lines between their party and \nours. I do not think objecting to or obstructing judges is that. I \nthink it is an act that is unconstitutional in its character. I think \nit is now broaching on a constitutional crisis in our country to \nsuggest that it takes a supermajority when any one individual decides \nto confirm or at least bring to the floor the vote of a judge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15926-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15926-S15927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NOVEMBER, NATIONAL ADOPTION MONTH\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Senator from Pennsylvania was talking \nabout marriage. I come to the floor to talk about families for just a \nmoment, and I will be brief. The Senator from Delaware has been waiting \npatiently also.\n  This is November. This is the month of Thanksgiving. Hopefully, most \nof us are a few days away from the opportunity and the privilege to go \nhome and sit down with our families and have a Thanksgiving dinner of \nsome proportion; most importantly, to be with our families. That is \nwhat this country is all about and certainly that is what Thanksgiving \nis all about.\n  November is, in my opinion, another special month. For the last \nmonth, I have been wearing on my lapel--and I do not have it on today--\na little gold word that says ``adopt.'' November is National Adoption \nMonth. I am a proud parent of three adopted children. I am going home \nto be with them and our grandchildren for Thanksgiving. We have three \nchildren and seven grandchildren now. My wife Suzanne and I are \ntremendously proud of that.\n  I became a father through adoption. Well, this month of November is \nNational Adoption Month. It is a time to celebrate special families, \nthe families of more than 2 million children in America who are \nadopted, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. In fact, it is estimated \nthat more than half of the population of America has been personally \ntouched by adoption, whether they are adopted or have adopted or have a \nclose friend or family member who is adopted or has adopted. In other \nwords, many of us have said adoption is a phenomenally viable option \nwhen it comes to forming a family.\n  Just this past week, we added to those numbers. November 22, this \nlast Saturday, was the fourth annual National Adoption Day. On that \nday, the courtrooms of the Nation, where volunteers helped, over 3,000 \nchildren found permanent, loving homes and new parents through the \nadoption system of our country. Think what this Thanksgiving is going \nto be to those 3,000 children who will now sit down at a table to have \nThanksgiving dinner with new parents who are offering them permanent \nlove and stability in their life.\n\n  While this is wonderful news, there are still far too many children \nwaiting for permanent, safe, and loving homes. Our foster care system \nprovides temporary care for more than 580,000 oftentimes abused and \nneglected children. Among those children, 126,000 of them are waiting \nfor adoption. For anybody who reads this Record or might be watching at \nthe moment, listen up. There are 126,000 kids in America who would love \nto have one of you as their parent, their mother or their father, who \nwould love to have you offer them a permanent and loving home.\n  Sadly, every year 25,000 children age out of foster care. What does \nthat mean? They become 18 years of age. They leave the foster care \nsystem, never having known a permanent, caring, loving home. Foster \nparents are caring, but it is not permanent and the child knows that. \nSo they graduate out. They are out on the street at 18 years of age. \nThey do not have the stability of the family unit. Seventy-plus percent \nof them get in trouble. Seventy-plus percent of them just cannot make \nit because they do not have a mom or a dad to refer back to, to help \nthem, to give them advice. They are on their own at age 18.\n  I would not have wanted to be on my own at age 18. Now I might have \nthought I could have been. But how many times did I go home to mom and \ndad to ask for their advice, their help, or their counsel? Well, \ninnumerable times.\n  So I hope Americans will consider opening their homes and their \nhearts to children through adoption. As an adoptive father, I can say \nthis experience has changed my life, and this Thanksgiving I will be \nreminded of all of that when I hug those seven grandbabies and try to \nshare a little turkey with them.\n  Last year, President Bush launched the first Federal adoption Website \nto help families connect while waiting children across America connect \nto them. The Web site is www.AdoptUSKids.org. Go online. Find out that \nyou, too, can become an adoptive parent.\n  Mary Landrieu, the Senator from Louisiana, and I have cochaired the \nadoption caucus on the Senate side for a good number of years. We have \npassed a lot of laws to make adoption easier, we have provided tax \ncredits, we have created incentives, because we want Americans to go \nafter those 126,000 children who are not yet in permanent, loving \nhomes.\n  We have also created the Congressional Coalition on Adoption. I have \njust stepped down as its chairman. Mary Landrieu has become its \nchairman. It is now a freestanding 501(c)(3)\n\n[[Page S15927]]\n\ninstitute. We have had tremendous success with people coming in to help \nus, to advance the cause of adoption. We hope Americans might look at \nus also because we are willing to help them break down the barriers so \nthat they can build their family through adoption, if that is what they \nchoose.\n  Later this week, a lot of Americans, as I have said, will be sitting \ndown at that Thanksgiving table. It is a moment to be thankful for so \nmuch, but it is a moment also to recognize that you could give a little \nmore. If it is at that time in your life or at that moment when you and \nyour spouse have decided you want a family, here is one way to do it. \nThere are 126,000 children waiting for you to select them and bring \nthem into your heart and your home for a loving, permanent relationship \nthat in every way will be positive.\n  So November is National Adoption Month. Choose adoption as an option. \nIf I can be of help, call me, or go online and go to \nwww.AdoptUSKids.org. You will have a happier Thanksgiving.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15927-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   PROVIDING FOR SINE DIE ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF \n                            REPRESENTATIVES\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

I don't know that Winston Churchill, one of the great \nleaders of Britain, ever said anything about Thanksgiving or turkeys. \nHe is somebody we like to quote a lot. He used to say there are two \nthings people should not see made: One of them is sausages and the \nother is laws.\n  That could be said of the process we have gone through to modernize \nMedicare and add a prescription drug benefit. It has been a difficult \ndebate and a difficult process.\n  Churchill also said democracy is the worst form of government devised \nby wit of man, except for all the rest. That is also something I would \nhave us keep in mind today as we reflect on this bill.\n  Mr. President, 38 years ago a Democratic President, Lyndon Johnson, \nsigned into law legislation creating Medicare. At the time it was \nhailed as a milestone. It was hailed as a landmark in providing a \nbenefit to millions of our senior citizens who did not have access to \nhealth care, did not have access to hospitals, did not have access to \ndoctors and nursing care. With the signing of that bill by then-\nPresident Johnson, the whole world changed for millions of Americans. \nToday it continues to change for tens of millions more.\n  Initially, Medicare, when it was fashioned, was designed to provide \naccess to hospitals for people who needed to get hospitalized to get \nwell. They would have that under Medicare if they were old enough. \nSimilarly, if folks were in need of access to a doctor's care or \nnurse's care, they would have it under that legislation he signed 38 \nyears ago.\n  There are a number of things that bill did not provide. It did not \nprovide for home health care. It did not provide for outpatient care. \nIt did not provide for access to prescription medicines or enable \nsenior citizens, those Medicare eligible, to obtain help buying \nprescription medicine. Over time Medicare has evolved, as we know. Over \ntime we have learned. Today we are a lot smarter. We can keep people \nout of hospitals and treat them on an outpatient basis. We are far \nwiser about keeping elderly people out of hospitals and, where it makes \nsense, treating them in their homes.\n\n  We also know today, in 2003, we can prevent a lot of illnesses and we \ncan cure a lot of illnesses. We can enhance the quality of life for \nsenior citizens by making sure they have access to prescription \nmedicines we did not have in 1965, and frankly we did not dream about \nin 1965.\n  If we were creating Medicare anew today, this week or this month, it \nwould be a no-brainer. We would have home health care. They would \nprovide for outpatient services and care. It would also include a \nprescription medicine component.\n  When I was Governor of Delaware and running for the Senate in 2000, I \ntalked a fair amount about prescription drug programs that were \nproposed in the Congress, principally one proposed by Senator Graham of \nFlorida. I thought and still think it is a better alternative than what \nwe have adopted here today. Adopting this legislation today is an \nexample of not letting the perfect be the enemy of the good.\n\n[[Page S15928]]\n\n  There are a number of principles I have said for some time we should \nattempt to adhere to when putting in place a Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit. Foremost among these is that the program should be voluntary. \nIf senior citizens want to participate, they can. If they choose not to \nparticipate, then they will not have to.\n  Second, I suggested that among the principles we adhere to is the \nprescription drug plan we adopt be one that would provide help where \nthe help was most needed--for folks who do not have any kind of \ncoverage, those whose incomes were very low, and those whose need for \nprescription drugs is exorbitantly high.\n  A third principle I have suggested is that middle-income senior \ncitizens should find some help, some benefit from this legislation.\n  A fourth principle is we should do our very best to harness \ncompetition and market forces, to use those market forces to help \ncontain the dramatic increase in the cost of prescription medicines.\n  A fifth principle is there should be no gaps and no caps in coverage. \nWe violated that principle in this legislation. We violated one other \nprinciple that I have talked about as well, and that is this \nprescription drug plan should be consistent with a balanced budget.\n  The unfortunate reality is that a plan with no gaps or caps has \nbecome inconsistent with a balanced budget. We find ourselves today as \na country in a huge hole, a fiscal hole, because of unwise tax cuts, a \nwar on terrorism, a war in Afghanistan, a war in Iraq, and a slumbering \neconomy that is slow to revive. Because of the size of that budget \ndeficit, we are unable to pass the kind of prescription drug program \nmany of us would like, one that has no gaps and one that has no caps.\n  I have listened with some fascination to the debate here in the \nSenate and raging across Capitol Hill and across the country. On the \none hand, my friends on the left say the bill we have just adopted here \nis the end of Medicare as we know it. They say that it is not just the \nnose of the camel under the tent, it is the camel under the tent.\n  On the other hand, I have heard folks from the far right, who oppose \nthis with equal vehemence, say there are no changes of consequence to \nMedicare, that it will be more of the same, that we have adopted a new \nentitlement program with scarce efforts at serious cost containment.\n  Both those sides cannot be right. My own view is neither of them are \nright. For folks old enough to participate in this program, they will \nhave a choice. If they want to participate, they can. If they want to \npay $35 a month for a premium, they can participate in this program. If \nthey are poor, that $35 per month premium is forgiven. There is a $250 \nannual deductible that must be satisfied before the Medicare benefit \nkicks in. For people who are poor, that $250 deductible will be \nessentially eased or eliminated.\n  Between $250 and roughly $2,250, Medicare will pay 75 percent of drug \ncosts for most seniors who participate in this program. Medicare will \npay more for those who have low-incomes. I am told the average cost of \nprescription medicines for people 65 and older in this country is \nroughly $2,200. That would suggest to me that many who elect to \nparticipate in this benefit, including middle-income seniors, will \nbenefit from it.\n  Between $2,250 and $5100 in drug costs, Medicare continues to provide \ncomprehensive coverage for low-income seniors. However, for middle-\nclass seniors, the benefit does not provide any coverage at all for \nspending in this range. That is the gap in coverage. I wish it was not \nthere. I hope we can eliminate this gap in coverage as we get our \nfiscal house in order.\n  Seniors will have a drug discount card as part of this program. The \ndiscounts they will receive may be worth 10 to 20 percent. If someone's \nprescription use is $4,000 or $5,000 a year, they will fall in the \ncoverage gap, but the benefits from that discount card I think will \nequal or exceed the cost of their premium. But that is still a very \nmodest benefit for those whose drug needs are between $2,250 and $5,000 \na year. On the other hand, for people who have very large prescription \ndrug needs, whose costs exceed $5,000, the catastrophic benefit is \ngenerous. Medicare pays for 95 percent of those costs that exceed \n$5,000.\n  I have heard any number of concerns about this legislation, raised \nnot just by my colleagues but by folks back home in my State of \nDelaware. They have raised questions and legitimate concerns that we \nneed to address.\n  First of all, with respect to cost containment, is there enough in \nthis bill? I don't think so. There are those who suggest we ought to \nconsider the approach adopted by the VA, whereby the Veterans' \nAdministration negotiates with the pharmaceutical industry in order to \nbuy pharmaceuticals for veterans at lower prices. I think that is worth \nexploring.\n  We made it easier as part of this legislation for generic drugs to be \nintroduced, to come to market. That will increase competition and push \ndown prices. It is a modest effort. We need to do more in this respect.\n  But what we have with this bill is an opportunity. I sometimes talk \nabout the glass being half full or half empty. I think we have an \nopportunity--certainly in my State, and I suspect in other States as \nwell--to take this basic Medicare drug benefit and to build on it. \nSince I know my State best, I will talk about Delaware. We have a \nnumber of employers who provide prescription drug coverage to their \nretirees. Roughly 40 percent of our employers in Delaware today still \nprovide that benefit. Some of those benefits are provided as a result \nof collective bargaining agreements. I hope we are smart enough--\nemployers, labor unions, and individuals--to find a way to take those \nsame dollars to provide first dollar of coverage for pensioners. I hope \nwe are smart enough to take those same dollars and perhaps use them to \npay the $35 monthly Medicare prescription drug premium for retirees; to \npay for the $250 deductible; to pay for some of the costs Medicare will \nnot cover between $2,250 and $5,000.\n  Similarly, I hope we are smart enough in States such as my State, and \nin cities and counties and those units of government that have in many \ncases prescription drug benefits for their pensioners, to have the \nwherewithal and farsightedness to modify the kind of coverage we now \nprovide to build on the basic Medicare prescription plan offered as \npart of this legislation--maybe to pay for the monthly premium, or all \nthe deductible, or maybe to reduce the size of that donut hole between \n$2,250 and $5,000.\n  But we don't just have to hope that will happen. The legislation \nincludes substantial incentives for employers and States to do just \nwhat I have described. For every dollar that a private sector employer \nprovides in qualified prescription drug benefits for their pensioners--\nbenefits that will supplement and enhance the Medicare benefit in this \nbill--they will realize, as a result of the incentives in this \nlegislation, an after-tax benefit of 50 to 70 cents on that dollar.\n  Is that going to keep all those employers and all those State and \nlocal governments in the game? No, it is not. But in the absence of \nthat kind of incentive, what has happened? Well, go back in time. In \n1988, roughly two-thirds of the large companies in America provided \nhealth benefits for their pensioners and provided a prescription drug \nbenefit for their pensioners--roughly two-thirds, 15 years ago.\n  Today, in 2003, that two-thirds is no longer two-thirds. Today, \nroughly one-third of the larger employers in this country provide a \nprescription drug benefit for their pensioners. Without this \nlegislation we are adopting today, we have seen a reduction almost by \nhalf of those employers that provided a benefit 15 years ago. They have \nstopped doing so today. If you run it out over the next 15 years, if \nthis trend continues, by the time 2018 rolls around you may have no \nprivate sector employers providing benefits.\n  That would be an awful thing. We need to do something about it. We \nneed to provide the kind of incentives to employers we have provided in \nthis legislation. We desperately need private sector employers to \ncontinue to provide a prescription drug benefit for their pensioners. \nWe desperately need States and local governments to do the same with \nrespect to their pensioners.\n  There is another source of prescription drug benefits I want to talk \nabout. When I was privileged to serve as Governor, I signed into law \nlegislation to create the Prescription Assistance Program in our State. \nFor pensioners\n\n[[Page S15929]]\n\nwhose incomes go up to 200 percent of poverty, they are eligible for a \nbenefit each year that is worth about $2,500. We also have in our State \na wonderful program called the Nemours Program, funded by a trust left \nby a wealthy family a long time ago. They provide help to children in \nmy State and they also provide assistance to senior citizens in my \nState. The DuPont Children's Hospital in Delaware is funded by that \ntrust. It is a wonderful institution. It helps kids all over the \ncountry and literally all over the world. The Nemours Plan also \nprovides a prescription drug plan for senior citizens whose income runs \nfrom 0 to 135 percent of poverty. They also provide eyeglasses and \ndentures.\n  We have to be smart enough in our little State of Delaware to make \nsure the dollars being spent for prescription medicines under the \nNemours Plan continue to be spent on prescription assistance for \nDelaware seniors. It does not need to be spent in the same way it is \ntoday, because the Medicare plan will cover literally all of the needs \nfor very low income seniors that Nemours currently assists with. But \nthose same dollars can now be used to help fill in the gaps and make \nmore generous the basic Medicare plan, which will be, at best, modest.\n  Similarly, the millions of dollars the State of Delaware is spending \non the prescription assistance plan that we put in place roughly 4 \nyears ago covers between 135 percent and 200 percent of poverty. If we \nare smart in our State, we will take those same dollars and redirect \nthem--not necessarily to cover the same people; we will not need to. \nSome of those people who will be advantaged by virtue of the Medicare \nplan won't need the kind of help they get under the Delaware \nPrescription Assistance Plan. But we should take those dollars now \nbeing spent through that program and redirect them to fill the gaps, to \nwrap around and supplement the basic Medicare plan.\n  Similarly, the dollars spent by private sector employers and by \npublic sector employers should no longer, starting in 2006, be spent \nexactly in the same way, but to the extent that we are smart and wise \nand farsighted, we can redistribute those dollars to build around the \nbasic Medicare plan, to fill the gaps that obviously are there that \nneed to be filled, and be able to provide in the end a benefit that we \ncan all feel good about and be proud of.\n  I close by going back to where I started. If we had gathered here \nthis year and had no Medicare Program, and we said let us start from \nscratch, we would include a prescription drug plan. In 1965, we didn't \nhave the ability to provide prescription medicines for the sort of \nthings we do today. If we had, a lot of people would have lived a lot \nlonger and healthier and better lives.\n  A couple of days from now, I will be with my own mother. I look \nforward to being with her, probably the day after Thanksgiving. She is \nalive today in part because of the love that surrounds her. She is also \nalive today, I am convinced, because of prescription medicines to which \nshe has access. She has heart failure and takes medicine for that. She \nhas arthritis. She is able to take medicine for the arthritis that \nafflicts her. My mom suffers from Alzheimer's disease. She and \nliterally hundreds of thousands of Alzheimer's victims around the \ncountry today have access to medicines that are beginning to show great \npromise in making sure that many of us do not end up living the last \nyears of our lives in a state of dementia. She has a better quality of \nlife today because of prescription medicine. She gets a fair amount of \nhelp through the employer that my dad used to work for. They provide a \nprescription benefit and hopefully will continue to do that. We are \nthankful for the assistance that she gets. For a lot of people in our \ncountry who do not have anything at all, who do not have any kind of \nprescription benefit, who are elderly and need that help, a lot of them \nwill get this help as a result of the legislation we have adopted here \ntoday.\n\n  Is this legislation all we would like it to be? No. Is this the end \nof the road? No. Is this a decent beginning? It is. It is incumbent \nupon Congress to make it a beginning, a good beginning, but not the \nend.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15929-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15929-S15930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IN MEMORY OF JUDGE RAYMOND J. PETTINE\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, on Monday, November 17, 2003, Rhode Island, \nthe judicial community and the entire Nation lost a great jurist, a \ngreat scholar and a great man. United States District Court Judge \nRaymond J. Pettine passed away leaving behind a legacy of protecting \nindividual liberties and constitutional rights.\n  Judge Pettine was born July 6, 1912 on America Street in Federal \nHill, one of the original Italian neighborhoods in Providence; a \nfitting place to be born for someone who would champion the \nConstitution that distinguishes this country, America, from so many \nothers. His father was a wigmaker in Italy who immigrated to these \nshores to find a better life for his family and to make a better \nAmerica through his labors and his sacrifice. Judge Pettine was \nsustained and inspired by the example of these good people, his mother \nand father. The hard work, the great patriotism, the unwavering decency \nand integrity, the deep respect for both family and faith, the gracious \nmanners of a true gentleman were learned in that home on America \nStreet.\n  Early in his life, Judge Pettine became fascinated with the law. As a \nchild of eight, he scrawled a note to the Dean of Harvard Law School \nand asked him, ``What do you have to do to become a lawyer?'' The Dean \nwrote in reply ``study hard, be a good boy, always have a dream.'' His \ndream led him to Providence College and Boston University Law school. \nSoon after graduation, he enlisted in the United States Army and served \non active duty from 1941 until 1946 rising to the rank of major. He \nlater would be promoted to colonel in the Judge Advocate General Corps \nas a reservist.\n  After his discharge from active duty and a brief stint in private \npractice, Judge Pettine began a thirteen year career as a prosecutor in \nRhode Island Attorney General's office. Like every task he undertook, \nhe brought great passion and determination to his endeavor. He \nunderstood that our adversarial system of justice requires that both \nthe prosecution and the defense must bring the full weight of the facts \nand the law before the jury so that they may have the benefit of \nprincipled and forceful advocacy to make their decision. He was a tough \nand uncompromising prosecutor determined to enforce the law. His \nrepututation and his record as a prosecutor earned him appointment as \nthe Federal Attorney for the District of Rhode Island in 1961. His \nservice as Federal Attorney won him the praise of U.S. Attorney General \nRobert F. Kennedy as one of the nation's top three federal prosecutors. \nAnd, this prosecutorial experience would help make him a superb judge \nupon his appointment to the bench in 1966 by President Johnson. Judge \nPettine recognized that the role of a judge was different than that of \na prosecutor or defense counsel. He was charged with something greater \nthan simply enforcing the law or arguing for a client. He was charged \nwith seeking justice, that delicate balance that rests on fairness and \na keen understanding of the nature of people as well as the tenets of \nthe law. He was also charged in a special way with defending the \nConstitution and the Bill of Rights. He recognized that our democracy, \nin his words, ``prizes itself in having a Bill of Rights designed to \nprotect us against despotic abuse of authority by the government.''\n\n  There was no more courageous, forceful or principled defender of the \nConstitution than Raymond Petinne. In 30 years on the federal bench, \nand as chief judge from 1971 to 1982, Judge Pettine staunchly guarded \nthe individual rights enshrined in the Constitution. He said the \nConstitution should be interpreted in ways that ``give meaning to the \nheart and soul of what it's all about: a kinder, more understanding \nConstitution that recognizes the disenfranchised, the poor and \nunderprivileged.''\n  In his rulings, he repeatedly upheld the Bill of Rights' freedom of \nspeech, of religion and of privacy. Judge Pettine stood by the \nConstitution and showed courage in the face of controversy when he, a \npracticing Catholic, ruled that municipalities could not erect \nChristmas nativity scenes on public\n\n[[Page S15930]]\n\nland. As he said, ``I firmly believe this with great conviction: that \nthere has to be a separation between church and state--that one of the \nsaving graces of this country is the fact that we are tolerant of all \nreligions, and even of those who have no religion. And, if we start \nbreaking that down, we are going to be in an awful lot of trouble.''\n  His wise defense of the Constitution and its protections for \nindividual conscience brought him vicious criticism and personal scorn. \nBut, no amount of criticism or scorn could deter him from his \nobligation to extend the protections of the Constitution to the poor as \nwell as the powerful, to the maligned as well as the popular. Judge \nPettine embraced his judicial duties with remarkable dedication. He \nbecame a scholar of the law and, in order to insulate himself from even \nthe appearance of partiality, he led a life focused on his family and \nthe lonely rigors of his judicial responsibilities.

Mr. President, I thank my good friend, Senator Byrd, from \nWest Virginia.\n  There have been many comments about the Medicare bill that just \npassed, all the time and effort, and the controversies that surround \nit. My personal view is that it is not just a good bill, it is a very \ngood bill. It will help senior citizens and a lot of others who need \nhelp.\n  I understand some of the criticisms made against the bill. Some of \nthem are overdrawn and exaggerated. But I understand the core points \nsome critics have made. As with all legislation, and as with all things \nhuman, there is some truth all the way around. I pledge my time and \neffort to work to correct any imperfections in this legislation that \nmay arise. But all in all, we have to make decisions. We have made a \ndecision; and that is, to pass this legislation. I think it is a good \nbill that is going to help a lot of people. It is a major advance to \nthe Medicare Program.\n\n  The Medicare Program, which was enacted 38 years ago and signed by \nPresident Lyndon Johnson in Independence, MO, has been a tremendous \nsuccess for our senior citizens.\n  This bill represents the next major advancement. It is a new \nentitlement for prescription drug benefits for our seniors not \ncontained in the original Medicare Act that passed 38 years ago.\n  There are a lot of people to thank. And my point here today is not to \ndwell on the bill but, rather, to thank people who worked so hard and \nwho ordinarily receive so little credit.\n  The most noble human endeavor is service. It is service to church, to \ncommunity, to family, to spouse, to children. It is service in whatever \nway makes the most sense for each one of us. There are many people who \nserved to the maximum in helping to write good legislation, and I shall \nmention their names.\n  Members of the House and the Senate who serve get the benefit of \ntheir names in newspapers and shown on TV--usually it is a benefit, \nsometimes it is not--but at least they get the credit or the blame. But \nthere are other people who work very hard behind the scenes. That is, \nthe staff, who probably work even harder and receive little or no \nrecognition. So I would like to recognize a few of those people who \nplayed a central role in this legislation.\n  First, my Finance Committee health care team, led by the wonderful \nLiz Fowler. Those of you who have worked with Liz Fowler know what I \nmean. There is none better. She works so hard, she is so smart, and she \nhas a wonderful disposition, working hard to help provide better health \ncare for Americans.\n  Jon Blum. He was the ace numbers guy. I think in many cases he knew \nmore about the various intricacies of this bill than anyone else; an \namazing man.\n  Pat Bousliman, the same. Pat worked extremely hard and knew the ins \nand outs of all the provider positions--the physician and the hospital \npayment provisions, and home health care, so well.\n  Andy Cohen, who worked primarily on Medicaid and low-income issues, \nand then Dan Stein, who was the cleanup hitter--he is wonderful. And \nI'd like to recognize former staff persons, who also worked so hard on \nthis bill earlier in the process, but have since taken advantage of \ndifferent jobs or opportunities.\n  Kate Kirchgraber. Kate was our Medicaid specialist.\n  Mike Mongan is a young man, who is brilliant. I was able to hold onto \nhim for one extra year before he finally decided to go off to law \nschool.\n  Those are the members of my Finance Committee health care team who \nworked so hard.\n  Others in the Finance Committee who played a very key role are Jeff \nForbes, the minority staff director, and Bill Dauster. Many people know \nboth Jeff and Bill. Bill has served the Senate in many capacities, \nparticularly with his expertise in budget matters and Senate \nprocedures. He was invaluable to me.\n  Russ Sullivan is my top tax person. And Judy Miller. Judy is from my \nhome State of Montana and, she knows pension issues better than anyone \nI can think of. The two of them worked on the tax provisions in this \nbill.\n  Laura Hayes handled press for the Finance Committee.\n  Tim Punke is my chief trade person. And Brian Pomper, also on the \ntrade staff. There are several trade provisions that came up in this \nbill, particularly with respect to reimportation from Canada.\n  Two of my former staff who left a year ago, or less than that, are \nwonderful people and also deserve recognition. One is my former staff \ndirector, John Angell; and my chief counsel, Mike Evans, who, during \nthe course of this bill, would call in. They would call in and give \nlots of advice.\n  Senator Grassley, Chairman of the Committee--his health team have all \nbeen wonderful to work with. Linda Fishman, Mark Hayes, Colin Roskey, \nJennifer Bell, and Leah Kegler--all working so hard. And others on \nSenator Grassley's team, Ted Totman, who has been with Senator Grassley \nfor many years, and Kolan Davis, who is Chairman Chuck Grassley's staff \ndirector.\n\n  Senator Breaux, my chief negotiating partner: On his staff is Sarah \nWalter. Sarah is very smart. She is very good. Michelle Easton and \nPaige Jennings, both of whom have also contributed significantly to \nthis bill.\n  Other conference members, of course, were Chairman Bill Thomas and\n\n[[Page S15931]]\n\nChairman Billy Tauzin, Majority Leader Frist, Speaker Hastert, and \nMajority Leader Tom DeLay in the House played a great role. Their \nstaffs did, too, especially John McManus, who is the chief health staff \nfor Chairman Thomas, and his staff, Madeline Smith, Joel White and Deb \nWilliams; Pat Morrissey, the deputy staff director for Chairman Billy \nTauzin, and his staff Kathleen Weldon, Chuck Clapton, Pat Ronan and \nJeremy Allen; and then for Majority Leader Bill Frist, Dean Rosen and \nLiz Scanlon. They are all very able, wonderful, extremely capable \npeople, along with everybody else we have been working with who I have \nnot mentioned by name.\n  On the administration side, Ziad Ojakli, Matt Kirk, and Jennifer \nYoung all played a significant and helpful role. And Erik Ueland on \nSenator Frist's staff played a valuable role in the coordinating \nbetween the Congress and the White House.\n  Senator Nickles, Senator Kyl, Senator Hatch, Congresswoman Nancy \nJohnson, and Congressman Mike Bilirakis and their staffs played an \nimmeasurable part in this bill.\n  Other conferees who were, unfortunately, excluded from the \nconference--that is, from the working group--played very strong roles \nin making this bill better than it otherwise might have been: Minority \nLeader Tom Daschle, Senator Rockefeller, Representatives Dingell, \nRangel, and Berry. Believe it or not--they may not believe it--but \ntheir views helped to shape this bill; many of the low-income \nprovisions, their views on premium support, and lots of areas where \ntheir strong views helped Senator Breaux and I a lot.\n  I need to mention, also, the Congressional Budget Office and the \nHouse and Senate legislative counsel.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, CBO, as we call it, is headed up by \nDouglas Holtz-Eakin. He works long hours, as do his top people, Steve \nLieberman and Tom Bradley and all of their staffs. Particularly in the \nfinal weeks of this bill, when we had to call up and say: What is the \nCBO estimate for this change? What is the CBO estimate for that change? \nIt is an almost impossible job because we were asking for lots of \ndifferent changes.\n  The House and the Senate legislative counsel--Ed Grossman, John \nGoetcheus, Pierre Poisson, and Jim Scott. Man, oh, man, did they work \nhard. They probably put in more hours than anybody else. Once we had \nthe concepts, they would have to write the language. And this world, \nwhich is run by deadlines, we were always waiting until the very end, \nunfortunately, before decided on a direction to write the legislation. \nAnd Ruth Ernst, who also worked extremely hard.\n  On my personal staff: Zak Andersen, who is my chief of staff, in \nhelping to coordinate all these matters; Sara Roberts, my legislative \ndirector; Farrar Johnston, my scheduler; and Sara Kuban--all in the \noffice here in Washington, DC. And back home in my State of Montana: \nBarrett Kaiser, Jim Foley, and Melodee Hanes, working all the time to \nanswer tons of telephone calls about this bill and coordinating all of \nour outreach and education efforts.\n  Others here in my DC office, two persons who work in the receptionist \narea, Megan Mikelsons and Rachel Sherouse answered many telephone \ncalls, too, and handled them all very directly and with great grace and \ncivility.\n  There are many others, Mr. President, on other staffs who I have not \nmentioned, but I mention these people because I know personally how \nhard they have worked. I also mention them as representative of all the \nother people who have worked for Senators, who have worked in different \ncapacities up here in the Senate and over in the House and who have \njust poured their hearts out. They are here because they want to do the \nright thing. They are here because they want to help people. They are \nhere because they want to make this a better place. Essentially, they \nare here because they are fulfilling a very deep moral obligation. I \nthink all of us have an obligation to make this place as good or even \nbetter than we found it, in whatever way we do that. For some of us, it \nis health care legislation, and for some of us it is some other area.\n  The names I have mentioned are the names of people who I hope are \nremembered and recognized. I urge everyone to dwell a little more on \nthe people who really do the work, those I have mentioned, and others \nwho work in similar capacities in this body.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, 38 years ago, President Lyndon B. Johnson \nsigned the Medicare Act in Independence, MO. For millions of senior and \ndisabled Americans, the enactment of this legislation heralded an era \nof hope, health, and improved financial security.\n  At the signing of the Medicare Act, President Johnson said, ``No \nlonger will older American be denied the healing miracle of modern \nmedicine . . . And no longer will this Nation refuse the hand of \njustice to those who have given a lifetime of service and wisdom and \nlabor to the progress of this progressive country.''\n  Over the past 4 decades, the Medicare Program has fulfilled President \nJohnson's vision. Through Medicare, more than 100 million Americans \nhave received the protection of health insurance during their most \nvulnerable years. Today, Medicare covers more than 35 million seniors \nand 6 million disabled Americans. Medicare provides assurances to these \nmillions of Americans that their health care needs will be taken care \nof.\n  And Medicare has stood the test of time. Thirty-eight years after its \nenactment, Medicare remains one of the most extraordinary acts of \nlegislation in the history of Congress.\n  But we all know that the program is not perfect. It is at times slow \nto adapt to the evolving health care market place. We owe it to our \nseniors to ensure that Medicare changes with the times and continues to \nserve their needs today and into the future.\n  The practice of medicine has changed dramatically over the past 4 \ndecades. Outpatient prescription drugs were not included in Medicare's \noriginal benefit package. In 1965, medical care emphasized hospital-\nbased and physician-provided care. Today, medical care increasingly \nrelies on the use of prescription drugs.\n  As the role and expense of prescription drugs have grown dramatically \nover the past several decades, the lack of a prescription drug benefit \nin Medicare has become a critical flaw.\n  Seniors will spend an estimated $2,300 on average for prescription \ndrugs this year, with almost $1,000 coming directly from their pockets. \nAnd while many seniors are fortunate to have coverage through retiree \nhealth plans, Medicaid, Medigap, and Medicare managed care plans--over \n35 percent of Medicare beneficiaries currently lack any coverage for \noutpatient prescription drugs.\n  The lack of prescription drug coverage in Medicare, coupled with the \nrising cost of prescription drugs, is forcing seniors across America to \nmake difficult choices. In the wealthiest nation in the world, millions \nof elderly Americans are forced to choose between much-needed \nprescription drugs and basic necessities of daily living.\n  Our seniors deserve better.\n  With the passage of this bill, we have the opportunity to uphold our \ncommitment to America's seniors. With this conference report, we can \ndeliver on our promise to add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare.\n  This bill provides seniors with much-needed prescription drug \ncoverage and protection against high out-of-pocket drug expenses. Under \nthe new Medicare Part D, seniors will have access to prescription drug \ninsurance for a modest monthly premium. This benefit will provide up-\nfront coverage for prescription drug expenditures up to $2,250 \nannually, and catastrophic coverage for out-of-pocket spending above \n$3,600.\n  For the millions of seniors with lower incomes and costly medical \nillnesses, this legislation offers the promise of comprehensive \naffordable prescription drug coverage through Medicare. Low-income \nseniors, more than a third of all Medicare beneficiaries, will receive \ngenerous assistance for all their prescription drug expenses, including \npremium subsidies, reduced deductibles, and affordable cost-sharing.\n  And we have designed a bill that will provide coverage in every part \nof the country. If private drug plans elect not to participate in any \narea of the country, our seniors will have guaranteed access to a \ngovernment fallback, backed by the solemn commitment of Medicare.\n\n[[Page S15932]]\n\n  Thus, all seniors will have equal access to a drug benefit, \nregardless of whether they choose to join a managed care plan or remain \nin traditional fee-for-service Medicare.\n  This legislation offers more than a Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit. It will finally address many of the Medicare reimbursement \ninequities that have plagued America's rural health care providers. It \nwill increase payments to local physicians and community hospitals to \nimprove health care services throughout the nation. And this \nlegislation will better foster competition between generic and brand-\nname pharmaceuticals.\n  I have heard from many of my colleagues regarding some of the \nimperfections in the conference report--for example, the gap in \ncoverage, the risk that the bill may cause employers to drop retiree \ndrug coverage, the potential state shortfalls in the early years of the \nbenefit, the increased payments to private plans, and the ``premium \nsupport'' pilot program.\n  While I remain committed to addressing these potential shortcomings \nin the legislation during the upcoming months and years, we must not \nforget that this bill creates a $400 billion expansion of the Medicare \nProgram. We must not squander this historic opportunity to \nfundamentally improve the lives of millions of American seniors.\n  We would not have this opportunity without the fine leadership in the \nSenate. Senator Grassley, chairman of the Finance Committee, skillfully \nled this effort through the committee, on the floor, and in the \nconference negotiations. Majority Leader Frist was willing to put aside \nparty differences to focus on achieving bipartisan consensus. Senator \nBreaux's efforts helped bridge differences. The work of Senator Breaux, \nmy steadfast partner in the difficult negotiations, as well as Senators \nSnowe, Hatch, Jeffords, and Graham have greatly contributed to the \ndebate over prescription drugs throughout the past several years.\n  And Senator Kennedy, the health care expert of the Senate. For over \n25 years, Senator Kennedy has fought to include prescription drug \ncoverage within Medicare. Through his continued leadership, \nprescription drugs for seniors are now within reach.\n  Senator Kennedy played a key role in getting a good bill out of the \nSenate and throughout the conference. The 76 votes in the Senate are a \ntribute to his efforts, and whatever is positive in this bill is due to \nhis dedication and hard work.\n  And there is much that is positive in this bill, in my view. Of \ncourse, the conference report is not perfect by any means. There are \nelements that I would not include if I were writing this bill on my \nown. But it is a true compromise. It reflects a near evenly split \nCongress.\n  Let us not forget that the original Medicare Act also represented a \ncompromise--in the way that the program was financed through a \ncombination of payroll taxes, premiums, and general revenue, and in the \nway it was organized, with fiscal intermediaries and carriers making \npayments for separate Part A and Part B benefits.\n  In the final analysis, let us not forget why this bill is important. \nMillions of seniors live today without prescription drug coverage. They \nlive in greater pain, and they live shorter lives, because of that.\n  With this bill, we will take an important step to make their lives \nbetter. To help them live longer, fuller lives. That is our purpose \nhere today, and that is why I support this conference report.\n  For 38 years, Medicare has been a covenant--a pact between the \ngenerations. All Americans--young and old, rich and poor--pay into the \npromise of Medicare. And the Congress has the responsibility to uphold \nthis commitment to those who benefit from it. As part of that \nresponsibility, we must continue to improve the program and keep up \nwith modern medical care.\n  This conference report represents an historic opportunity to \nstrengthen Medicare. And as elected officials, we have the obligation \nto take advantage of this opportunity. Of course, we also have the \nresponsibility to ensure timely implementation in a way that fulfills \ncongressional intent.\n  On the day of this historic vote, we take a step to ensure that \nMedicare continues to fulfill Lyndon Johnson's vision. We take an \nimportant step to deliver on our promise to America's senior citizens.\n  I yield the Floor, and I again thank my good friend from West \nVirginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Montana, Mr. Baucus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15932-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15932-S15933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            INVASION OF IRAQ\n\n  Mr. President, it was the prophet Hosea who lamented of the ancient \nIsraelites, ``For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the \nwhirlwind.''\n  I wonder if it will come to pass that the President's flawed and \ndangerous doctrine of preemption on which the United States predicated \nits invasion of Iraq will some day come to be seen as a modern-day \nparable of Hosea's lament. Could it be that the Bush administration, in \nits disdain for the rest of the world, elected to sow the wind, and is \nnow reaping the whirlwind?\n  I ponder this as the casualties in Iraq continue to mount, long past \nthe end of major conflict, and as the vicious attacks against American \ntroops, humanitarian workers, and coalition partners increase in both \nintensity and sophistication. I ponder this as the number of terrorists \nattacks bearing the hallmarks of al-Qaida appear to be increasing, not \njust in Iraq but elsewhere, including Saudi Arabia and, most recently, \nTurkey. I cannot help but wonder, as I view these developments with a \nsorrowful heart, what the President has wrought. By failing to win \ninternational support for the war in Iraq and by failing to plan \neffectively for an orderly post-war transition of power, has the \nPresident managed to create in Iraq the very situation he was trying to \npreempt?\n  The deaths of three more American soldiers in Iraq over the weekend, \nand the vicious mob attack on the bodies of two of them, are but the \nlatest evidence of a plan gone tragically awry. The death toll of \nAmerican military personnel in Iraq since the beginning of the war has \nnow reached 427, and it continues to climb on a near-daily basis. Most \ntroubling of all is the fact that more than two-thirds of those \nsoldiers who have died in Iraq have been killed since the end of major \ncombat operations. At that time, 138 American fighting men and women \nhad died in Iraq, at the time major combat operations had ended. \nInstead of making headway in the effort to stabilize and democratize \npost-war Iraq, the administration seems to be losing ground. If the \ncurrent violence cannot be curbed, if Iraq is allowed to descend \nunchecked into a holy hell of chaos and anarchy, the implications could \nbe catastrophic for the region and the world.\n  An article earlier this month in the Los Angeles Times, entitled \n``Iraq Seen As Al Qaeda's Top Battlefield,'' raises the alarming \nspecter that Iraq already is replacing Afghanistan as the global center \nof Islamic jihad. According to the article, as many as 2,000 Muslim \nfighters from a number of countries, including Sudan, Algeria and \nAfghanistan, may now be operating in Iraq. No one knows the numbers for \ncertain, but foreign Islamic terrorists are suspected in some of the \ndeadliest attacks in Iraq, including the bombing of the United Nations \nheadquarters and the Red Cross offices in Baghdad.\n  It seems only yesterday that the President and his advisers were \nwarning the United Nations that Saddam Hussein must be disarmed at \nonce, forcibly if necessary, to preempt Iraq from becoming the next \nfront in the war on terrorism. On May 1, when the President announced \nthe end of major combat operations in Iraq as he basked in the glow of \na banner that was waving overhead proclaiming ``Mission Accomplished,'' \nhe described the liberation of Iraq as ``a crucial advance in the \ncampaign against terror.''\n  What a difference a few months makes. Before the war, it was \nAfghanistan and al-Qaida, not Iraq, that constituted the central front \nin the war on terror. It was Osama bin Laden, not Saddam Hussein, who \norchestrated the September 11 attacks on the United States, and it was \nOsama bin Laden, not Saddam Hussein, who orchestrated earlier attacks \non the USS Cole and on the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. It \nis Osama bin Laden who continues to taunt the United States and who \ncontinues to plot against us,\n\n[[Page S15933]]\n\nand it is Osama bin Laden who has exhorted his followers to gather in \nIraq to avenge the U.S. invasion.\n  Today, while the Taliban appears to be regrouping in Afghanistan, it \nis Iraq that has become the most powerful magnet for Islamic \nterrorists. It is Iraq where these forces have coalesced with Saddam \nHussein loyalists to create an increasingly sophisticated and deadly \ninsurgency that has paralyzed U.S. efforts to establish postwar \nstability. Ironically, Saddam Hussein and his henchmen are more of a \nthreat to the United States today than they were before the war began.\n  Could it be that the war on Iraq, while succeeding in chasing one \nmonster into hiding, has created another, equally vicious, monster in \nhis stead, a hydra-headed monster that is spewing terrorism against \nboth the Iraqi people and their would-be liberators? Could it be that \nthe convergence of Islamic jihadists and Baathist loyalists constitutes \na more potent adversary than we ever imagined possible in Iraq?\n  Could it be, that instead of providing a ``crucial advance'' in the \nwar on terrorism, as the President suggested, the war on Iraq has \nprovided crucial new resources--money, weapons, and manpower, as well \nas motivation--for the terrorists themselves? Could it be that instead \nof curbing terrorism, the war on Iraq has served to fan the flames of \nterrorism?\n  If only the President had listened more closely to his father, and \nhis father's advisers. In the 1998 book that he co-authored with former \nNational Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, A World Transformed, the \nfirst President Bush said of his decision to end the 1991 Gulf War \nwithout attempting to remove Saddam Hussein from power, ``We would have \nbeen forced to occupy Baghdad and, in effect, rule Iraq. . . .there was \nno viable `exit strategy' we could see, violating another of our \nprinciples.''\n  The former President Bush and his national security adviser further \ncautioned that, ``Going in and occupying Iraq, thus unilaterally \nexceeding the United Nations' mandate, would have destroyed the \nprecedent of international response to aggression that we hoped to \nestablish. Had we gone the invasion route, the United States could \nconceivably still be an occupying power in a bitterly hostile land. It \nwould have been a dramatically different--and perhaps barren--\noutcome.''\n  Clearly the situation in Iraq today is far more difficult and \ndangerous than the administration ever envisioned or prepared for \nbefore the war. Although the President declared an end to major combat \noperations more than six months ago, U.S. forces in Iraq have recently \nbeen forced to resort to a new bombing campaign in and around Baghdad--\nthe most intense aerial offensive since active combat ended--in an \neffort to stem the insurgency. More than 6 months after the end of \nmajor combat operations, the situation in Iraq appears to be \ndeteriorating, not improving.\n  While the President and his military advisers remain upbeat about \nIraq, the top CIA official in Baghdad appears to have reached a far \nbleaker assessment of the situation on the ground. According to news \nreports, a top secret CIA analysis from Baghdad has concluded that \ngrowing numbers of Iraqi citizens are turning against the American \noccupation and supporting the insurgents. It may well have been this \nreport that prompted the President to recall the U.S. administrator of \nthe Coalition Provisional Authority to Washington two weeks ago for a \nhastily arranged round of meetings on accelerating the transition of \npower to an Iraqi provisional government.\n  Nothing could do more to spotlight the Administration's abysmal \nfailure to rally international support for the stabilization and \nrebuilding of Iraq than this frantic scramble to arrange a Hail Mary \npass of power from the United States to a provisional government in \nIraq that does not yet exist. The Administration has slapped a new \ndeadline on the democratization of Iraq--an Iraqi ``transitional \nassembly'' is to be in place by June 1--but it has come up with no \nblueprint as to how that assembly is to function or how it can be \nexpected to stem the violence in Iraq.\n  Once again, the administration is ignoring the obvious--the United \nStates cannot go it alone in Iraq. The United Nations and NATO need to \nbe brought on board as full partners with a personal stake in the \ngovernance, the stabilization, and the future of Iraq.\n  Every day that the administration continues to spurn the United \nNations is another day that the insurgents have to choreograph their \nattacks in Iraq and further isolate the United States from the rest of \nthe world. The pattern is becoming chillingly clear. Systematic \nattacks, including those against the United Nations and the Red Cross \nheadquarters in Baghdad and the Italian military police headquarters in \nNasiriyah, have succeeded in driving most humanitarian workers from \nIraq and have rocked the resolve of U.S. allies to support the Iraq \noperation. In the wake of the attack on the Italian troops, Japan is \nreconsidering its offer to send troops to Iraq, and South Korea \ncontinues to procrastinate. Help from other countries on which the \nUnited States had pinned its hopes, including Turkey and Pakistan, has \nevaporated.\n  Even in the streets of London, the seat of government of America's \nstrongest ally, tens of thousands of demonstrators marched on Trafalgar \nSquare last week to protest President Bush's state visit and his \npolicies in Iraq.\n  Because of the administration's arrogance and impatience, the United \nStates, for better or worse, is the make-or-break force in Iraq. Could \nit be that the President, in his haste to impose his will on the rest \nof the world, has inadvertently sown the wind and must now confront the \nwhirlwind?\n  Mr. President, in a short time--perhaps the next day or so--the \nSenate will adjourn for the year. We are privileged and blessed to \nreturn to the comfort of our families for the holidays. Not all \nfamilies in America will share in our blessings.\n  Many families will wait out the holidays in fear and tension as they \nworry about their loved ones in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  We in the Senate will not be here to absorb the news from the battle \nfronts in Iraq and Afghanistan or to voice our response to these \ndevelopments. I pray that all will be calm, that ``Silent Night, Holy \nNight'' will be more than the strain of a familiar carol. But I worry \nit will not be so, that reality will be harsher than sentimentality.\n  The war in Iraq is far from over. When we will ultimately be able to \ndeclare victory, I do not know and I dare not venture a guess. I only \nhope that the President will be able to put the good of the Nation over \nthe pride of his administration and accept a helping hand from the \nUnited Nations to turn the tide of anarchy in Iraq. Perhaps he may \nfinally be ready to do so. Senior administration officials have been \nquoted as suggesting that the United States is preparing to seek \nanother U.N. resolution endorsing a new plan for the transition of \npower in Iraq. I urge the President to do so without delay. This time \naround, the effort must be genuine, and the resolution must be \nmeaningful.\n  The facts are stark and hard to accept. If not outright losing, the \nUnited States is far from winning the peace in Iraq. Only a significant \nturnabout in the handling of the security and reconstruction effort, \ncentered on giving the United Nations a leading role in the transition \nof power, holds any hope for a constructive course change in Iraq. It \nis a course change that is desperately needed.\n  As the crisis in Iraq deepens, leadership and statesmanship are \nurgently needed. I pray that the President, in his desperate quest for \na new solution to the chaos in Iraq, will demonstrate those qualities, \nabandon the U.S. stranglehold on Baghdad, and forge a meaningful \npartnership with other nations of the world, a partnership with the \nUnited Nations so that a swift, orderly, and effective transition of \npower in Iraq can be achieved and American fighting men and women can \ncome home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15933-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15933-S15935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues to decry this \nappropriations process. This process has fallen apart. Despite the hard \nwork of the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the \nbipartisan effort of members of the House and Senate Appropriations \nCommittees, the omnibus bill is parked and the engine is cold.\n\n[[Page S15934]]\n\n  Why? Why is it that funding for 11 of the 15 departments of this \nGovernment is two months late? Why is it that the Nation's veterans \nhaven't received funding? Why is it that our classrooms have been \nrelegated to the sidelines? Why is it that health care, law \nenforcement, education, roads, airports, embassy security, worker \nsafety, job training, farmers are put off, day after day? It is because \nthe White House has insisted on legislating. The White House has \noverplayed its hand and, as a result, the nation is not served.\n  On Thursday, the Nation will pause to celebrate Thanksgiving. But our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle have decided to deliver to \nthe Senate a turkey of an omnibus appropriations conference report. \nThis turkey is filled with stuffing and all the trimmings, but as we \nstand here today, few Senators know what it is stuffed with. What we do \nknow is that this turkey has been specially carved for special \ninterests.\n  The process for producing this bill was just one more example of the \nPresident's disrespect for the Congress. My way or the highway is the \nPresident's mantra. He expects the Congress to rubber stamp his budget.\n  Initially, the conference process was bipartisan. Chairman Stevens \nwanted to do the right thing in producing this bill. The ranking \nmembers on the seven bills were at the table and worked out reasonable \ncompromises on the bills. I commend Chairman Ted Stevens and House \nChairman Bill Young for their efforts to get this bill done in a \nbalanced way.\n  But when it came time to make the tough decisions, the leadership \nwent behind closed doors with the White House at the table. And they \nserved up a turkey.\n  They took a balanced package that was worked out by the conferees and \nat the eleventh hour insisted that they had to have it all. They \ninsisted on changes that were not even contemplated when the bills were \nbefore the House and Senate.\n  The President prevailed on every one of his veto threats.\n  The overtime regulation prohibition, which passed the Senate by vote \nof 54-45 was dropped; virtually identical Cuba sanction provisions that \nwere in both the House and Senate versions of the Transportation/\nTreasury bill were dropped, as was a Cuba sanction provision in the \nSenate version of the Agriculture bill; the 1 year limitation on the \nFCC media ownership rule was turned into a permanent cap at 39 percent; \nthe House language in the Transportation/Treasury bill, blocking OMB's \nplan to contract out 400,000 Federal workers was dropped. A bi-partisan \ncompromise that was worked out by the conferees was rejected by the \nWhite House and what remains provides so many loopholes for OMB that \nlittle protection is provided for Federal workers.\n  This is a bad bill.\n  There are many provisions that are controversial and were not \nconsidered by the Senate. There is language that permits overfishing in \nthe Northeast fishery. There is language that would mandate that the \nJustice Department destroy background check records for the purchase of \nguns within 24 hours of the gun purchase. These matters were never \ndebated in the Senate because the Commerce/Justice/State bill was never \ndebated in the Senate.\n  There is language in the omnibus conference report that would \npostpone the country of origin labeling rule that was enacted as part \nof the Farm bill. Rather than the 1-year delay that was in the House \nbill, there is a 2-year delay, breaking up the balance of the 2002 Farm \nbill. The DC portion of the bill contains $13 million for approximately \n2,000 school vouchers.\n  The White House's approach to Congress is my way or the highway. \nWell, this turkey of a bill wandered out on the highway and the rights \nof Senators to amend legislation and the needs of the American people \ngot crushed. Whenever the Senate Republican leaders decide to bring \nthis turkey to the floor, the Senate will be asked to vote on this as a \nconference report, with no opportunity for amendment.\n  Let's look at the overtime issue. This omnibus appropriations bill \ndoes not include the overtime pay protections included in the Senate \nLabor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations bill. \nThat provision was included in that bill on a 54-45 vote in the Senate \nin early September. The House of Representatives voted to instruct its \nconferees to the Appropriations bill to accept the Senate language on \novertime on a vote of 221-203. Yet the provision was dropped. It should \nbe clear to the working men and women of this country that it was the \nRepublican leadership, at the behest of the White House, that killed \nthe overtime pay protections in the omnibus appropriations bill despite \na majority of members in both the House and Senate voting to protect \nthe overtime rights of American workers. As a result, the White House \nis responsible for the pay cut that 8 million American families will \nreceive this holiday season.\n  On the overtime issue, Congressman DeLay recently said, ``We're \nsticking with the White House. We're going to win.'' White House Chief \nof Staff Andrew Card, on November 19, said the White House was \nunwilling to move away from its position of supporting the Department \nof Labor's proposed rules. ``We'll stick to it,'' he said.\n  In September, Members of Congress received a letter from several \nwomen's organizations that concluded, ``Millions of working women would \nsee their pay reduced and their workdays lengthened.'' Well, as far as \nthe President is concerned it is my way or the highway and the Senate \neffort to protect American workers is gone.\n  Let's look at the issue of the FCC media ownership cap. The original \nprovision included in both the House and the Senate CJS appropriations \nbills limited funding to the FCC for purposes of keeping the media \nownership cap at 35 percent for the next year. The CJS conferees agreed \nto the language. But behind closed doors, the White House said no, not \ngood enough.\n  In a back room, the Republican Leadership and the White House changed \nthe rules. Instead of a 1-year limitation, we now have a ``permanent'' \nfix, authorizing the cap to be raised to 39 percent. A permanent fix \nwas never debated by the Senate. This is a policy decision that should \nbe made by the authorizing committees. Instead, it was made by a few \nindividuals and that authorizing language is now being placed in an \nunamendable appropriations conference report.\n  Let's look at the gun issue. As part of a carefully negotiated \nagreement, the C/J/S conferees agreed to drop language that was in the \nHouse bill that would have reduced the amount of time that the Justice \nDepartment has to retain records from gun purchases from ninety days to \nimmediate destruction. Yet, the White House said that was not \nsatisfactory. Agreements reached between House and Senate Republicans \nand Democrats did not make the cut for this White House.\n  A significant national security provision, a counter-terrorism \ninitiative approved by Congress, is being gutted by the Bush White \nHouse. Under current law, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms \ncan retain for 90 days the records from gun purchases. This 90-day \nperiod gives the law enforcement community the opportunity to find \nindividuals purchasing weapons who should simply not have access to \nthose weapons.\n  It is a simple matter of law enforcement, of national security. Yet \nthe Bush White House wants no 90 day cushion. This administration is \ninsisting that any federal record associated with the purchase of a \nweapon be destroyed after just 1-day. This current 90 day cushion is \nnot a delay on the actual purchase. This is not a step that infringes \non an American's right to bear arms. But it is a better protection for \nAmerica's national security. At a time when we are in a heightened \nstate of alert for terrorist attack, should we not provide law \nenforcement with more than 24 hours to examine information on weapons' \npurchases?\n  This administration's own Department of Justice's Office of Legal \nCounsel, in an October 1, 2001, legal opinion concluded that having \ndata from the gun transactions would aid in the investigation of 9/11. \nBut for the White House, it is ``my way or the highway.'' No cushion, \nno security.\n  Among the many outrages that I find with the substance of this \nOmnibus Appropriations bill and the process in which it was developed, \ncenters around the language regarding President Bush's so-called \n``competitive sourcing'' initiative. Competitive\n\n[[Page S15935]]\n\nsourcing is President Bush's euphemism for throwing a federal employee \nonto the unemployment line for the purpose of contracting out his work \nto a private company.\n  Division F of this Omnibus Appropriations Act includes the \nTransportation, Treasury and General Government Appropriation bill. One \nwill find in that division of the bill, under section 647, a largely \nmeaningless and ineffective provision, that is rife with loopholes \nintended to mask the Bush administration's determined efforts to fire \nthousands of Federal employees. This provision did not always read this \nway. Indeed, the conferees on the Transportation, Treasury and General \nGovernment Appropriations bill met in open conference on Wednesday, \nNovember 12th and it was anticipated at that time that the conference \nagreement would be sent to the President as a freestanding bill. That \nconference was chaired by the very able Subcommittee Chairman Senator \nShelby. I was a conferee on that bill and I was proud to sign the \nconference report when it was presented to me.\n  The original conference agreement reached by the members of that \nconference committee included a sound and balanced policy to govern the \nPresident's competitive sourcing initiative. The conference agreement \nensured that there would be uniform rules for this initiative across \nall agencies of the Federal Government. It also ensured that the \nadministration would have to demonstrate meaningful cost savings to the \ntaxpayers before contracting out federal work. The agreement also \nprovided Federal employees an opportunity to appeal a wrongful \ncontracting out decision. Under the Bush administration's regulations, \nonly private contractors have that appeal right.\n  That tentative conference agreement was agreed to as a substitute for \nthe amendment that was included in the House bill that was championed \nby Congressman Van Hollen of Maryland. The Bush White House made it \nquite clear to all the conferees that inclusion of the Van Hollen \namendment would result in the Transportation/Treasury bill being \nvetoed. Ever since the day that conference concluded--Wednesday, \nNovember 12th--we have been waiting for the conference agreement on the \nTransportation-Treasury bill to be filed in the House and Senate. \nInstead, what has happened has been an unpardonable effort by the Bush \nWhite House to dismantle this agreement as it pertains to its beloved \n``competitive sourcing'' initiative.\n  Why did the administration not like this agreement? Because they do \nnot care to have to demonstrate to the taxpayers that any real dollar \nsavings will accrue to the taxpayer when they contract out Federal \njobs; they do not want Federal employees to have the opportunity to \nappeal a decision that was made in error; and they do not want a \nconsistent and fair policy for all Federal agencies in this area.\n  Believe it or not, the Bush administration complained about \nprovisions in the Transportation/Treasury conference agreement that \nwere identical to provisions that President Bush had already signed \ninto law on the Department of Defense Appropriations Act and the \nDepartment of Interior Appropriations Act. When one now reviews the \nOmnibus Appropriations bill, it is clear that the Bush administration \nhas succeeded in neutering the original conference agreement in this \narea. Never mind that we met in full and open conference and agreed to \na meaningful set of safeguards. Never mind that all the members of the \nconference committee signed on to that agreement--Democrats and \nRepublicans alike. This White House would have none of it. So, working \nthrough the offices of the House and Senate Republican leadership, the \nWhite House has succeeded in undermining the provisions of the original \nconference agreement to the point of making them largely hollow. The \nBush administration has made a sham of our Federal procurement process \nand a sham of the appropriations process. So, on the Transportation \nAppropriations bill, once again, the President says it is my way or the \nhighway.\n  Finally, there is the matter of the across the board cuts. The \nPresident set an arbitrary topline for discretionary spending of $786 \nbillion. In the President's view, we can afford $1.7 trillion dollars \nof tax cuts. When it comes to the Medicare bill, we can afford $12 \nbillion for subsidies for private insurance companies. When it comes to \nthe Energy bill, we can afford over $25 billion of tax cuts and $5 \nbillion of mandatory spending for big energy corporations. But when it \ncomes to discretionary programs that help average Americans, the \nPresident insists on cuts. A cut of 0.59 percent would reduce funding \nfor No Child Left Behind programs by over $73 million, resulting in \n24,000 fewer kids being served by Title I. Overall, the Title I \nEducation for the Disadvantaged program would be $6 billion below the \nlevel authorized by the No Child Left Behind Act that the President \nsigned in January of 2002. Another promise unfulfilled.\n  The across-the-board cut would reduce Head Start funding by $40 \nmillion, resulting in 5,500 fewer kids attending Head Start. Veterans \nMedical Care funding would be cut by $159 million, resulting in 26,500 \nfewer veterans receiving medical care or 198,000 veterans not getting \nthe drugs they need.\n  Funding for highway construction would be cut by over $170 million. \nWell, for this President, it is my way or the highway, but fewer \nAmericans will be building highways next year.\n  Chairman Stevens and I tried very hard to produce thirteen bills to \nsend to the President. I commend him for his effort to do so. But, the \nprocess was kidnapped by the White House and the leadership. Instead of \nsending thirteen fiscally responsible appropriations bills to the \nPresident, the House is filing a turkey of a conference report. That is \nno way to govern. That is no way to serve the American people.\n  I wish all Senators a happy Thanksgiving and a happy Christmas. I \nhope they stay safe for the holidays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, no one deserves that holiday more than \nSenator Byrd who constantly reminds us of what this wonderful, \ninteresting discussion is all about; that is, stand up for the \nConstitution, and stand up for the people we represent. To Senator Byrd \nand his wonderful wife, we wish an especially warm and cheerful \nholiday.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank again the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15935-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15935-S15937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THANKFUL FOR THANKSGIVING\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Thanksgiving is one of the oldest and most \ncherished American holidays. Along with the Fourth of July, it is a \nuniquely American holiday. I realize that other countries and other \ncultures have their days of feasts, some even have them in autumn to \nglorify their harvests. But our Thanksgiving, our day of thanks, is a \ntruly American holiday.\n  Thanksgiving is our special day. It is a day on which we celebrate \nwith Turkey, gravy, dressing, cranberry sauce. You should try Erma's \ncranberry sauce; there is nothing like it anywhere in the world, my \nwife's cranberry sauce. Just to think of it, just to think of it makes \nme want to go home now--cranberry sauce, sweet potatoes, pumpkin pie.\n  In addition to being a time of family togetherness, it is a day of \nfootball games, parades, and the beginning of the Christmas holiday \nseason--a little early for the Christmas holiday season, but that is \nthe way it is in this commercial time in which we live.\n  But more profoundly, Thanksgiving is a day for recognizing and \ncelebrating our Pilgrim heritage--that small group of men and women who \nleft their homeland, crossed a mighty ocean, and settled in a \nwilderness so that they could worship God as they chose.\n  Before disembarking from the ship that brought them to these lands, \nthe famous and legendary Mayflower, this gallant group of early \nAmerican settlers gathered together and they formulated a government \nfor their new world--a government based on the principle of self-rule. \nIt was also a government under God--a government under God. The \ndocument that created that new government, the Mayflower Compact--we \nshould have on our office walls. That government was anticipated in the \nMayflower Compact. The Compact read in part--listen to this:\n\n       In the name of God, amen, we whose names are underwritten . \n     . . Having undertaken for the Glory of God . . . Do by these \n     Presents, solemnly and mutually in the Presence of\n\n[[Page S15936]]\n\n     God and one another, covenant and combine ourselves together \n     into a civil Body Politik. . . .\n\n  How about that? That was the Mayflower Compact. A copy of that \nCompact ought to hang or appear in every schoolroom in this country. I \nknow there are a few atheists around who wouldn't like it, but who \ncares that they wouldn't like it? Maybe we could win them over.\n  But let us read it again. How wonderful it is to read that. I wonder \nif there would be those who would say it is unconstitutional.\n\n       In the name of God, amen, we whose names are underwritten . \n     . . Having undertaken for the Glory of God . . . Do by these \n     Presents, solemnly and mutually in the Presence of God and \n     one another, covenant and combine ourselves together into a \n     civil Body Politik. . . .\n\n  A year after landing--after months of privation, suffering, sickness, \nhunger, and death--these men and women set aside time to express their \ngratitude to God for protecting them and for the preservation of their \ncommunity. With all the hardships and agony they had endured, they \nstill set aside time to thank God for being good to them. They were not \nonly men and women of great courage, they were also men and women of \ngreat religious faith.\n  Two years later, in 1623, the Pilgrims made this day of thanks a \ntradition. The spirit of that glorious day, which some people recognize \nas the first official Thanksgiving, was captured in a proclamation \nattributed to Governor Bradford that read:\n\n       Inasmuch as the Great Father has given us this year an \n     abundant harvest of Indian corn, wheat, peas, squashes and \n     garden vegetables, and made the forest to abound with game \n     and the sea with fish and clams, and inasmuch as he has . . . \n     spared us from the pestilence and granted us freedom to \n     worship God according to the dictates of our own conscience, \n     now I, your magistrate, do proclaim that all ye Pilgrims, \n     with your wives and ye little ones, do gather at ye meeting \n     house, on ye hill, between the hours of nine and twelve in \n     the daytime on Thursday, November ye 29th, of the year of our \n     Lord one thousand six hundred and twenty-three, and the third \n     year since ye Pilgrims landed on ye Plymouth Rock, there to \n     listen to ye Pastor and render Thanksgiving to ye all \n     Almighty God for all his blessings.\n  The tradition of Thanksgiving was reaffirmed again during the \nAmerican Revolution. Following the Battle of Saratoga in October 1777, \nthe American victory that marked a crucial turning point in the war and \nthe birth of our Nation, the Continental Congress approved a resolution \ndesignating a day of ``Thanksgiving and praise.'' George Washington \nwrote of the day set apart--these are words I quoted--the ``day set \napart by the honorable Congress for Public Thanksgiving and praise, and \nduty calling us to devoutly to express our grateful acknowledgments to \nGod for the manifold blessings he has granted us.''\n  This was George Washington, the Father of our Country, Commander of \nthe American Forces at Valley Forge--George Washington, the first \nPresident of the United States, the greatest of all Presidents of these \nUnited States--who said in part when he wrote of the ``day set apart by \nthe honorable Congress for public Thanksgiving and praise, and duty \ncalling us devoutly to express our grateful acknowledgments to God for \nthe manifold blessings he has granted us.''\n  That was George Washington.\n  Following the Revolutionary War, the Continental Congress used \nThanksgiving as the day to give thanks to the proper authority for \ndelivering the country from colonization and war into independence and \npeace.\n  These were our forefathers--George Washington, of whom there is none \ngreater--nay, of whom there is no peer, George Washington.\n  On October 11, 1782, Congress proclaimed ``the twenty-eight day of \nNovember next, as a day of solemn THANKSGIVING to God for all his \nmercies.''\n  Think about that.\n  On October 11, 1782, Congress proclaimed ``the twenty-eight day of \nNovember next, as a day of solemn THANKSGIVING to God for all his \nmercies: and they do further recommend to all ranks, to testify to \ntheir gratitude to God for his goodness.''\n  I was just verifying from the fine man who serves on my staff that \nthis coming Thanksgiving again falls on the calendar on the day of \nNovember 28.\n  The proclamation further stated:\n\n       It being the indispensable duty of all Nations, not only to \n     offer up their supplication to ALMIGHTY GOD, the giver of all \n     good, for his gracious assistance in a time of distress, but \n     also in a solemn and public manner to give him praise for his \n     goodness in general, and especially for great and signal \n     interpositions of his providence in their behalf.\n\n  Following the establishment of the new government of the United \nStates in 1789, President George Washington--he is now President; the \nPresident is George Washington--issued the first Presidential \nproclamation calling for ``a day of public thanksgiving and prayer.'' \nHe asked that the public observe that day ``by acknowledging with \ngrateful heart the many favors of Almighty God.'' At President \nWashington's request, Americans assembled in churches on the appointed \nday and thanked God for his blessings.\n  Then during the awful Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln officially \nasked the people of the United States to set aside the last Thursday of \nNovember ``as a day of Thanksgiving and praise to our beneficent \nFather.'' ``In the midst of a civil war of unequal magnitude and \nseverity,'' President Lincoln proclaimed in 1863 that the country \nshould take a day to acknowledge the gracious gifts of the most high \nGod.\n  Perhaps we have noticed that in every one of these proclamations, the \nFounders and the early leaders of our country carefully and \npurposefully recognized and thanked Almighty God for their blessings.\n  So in a year when we have been told that it is wrong to post the Ten \nCommandments in our courthouses, and we have Federal courts ruling that \nours is not a nation under God, it is well to remember how the Founders \nof our country, going back to the Pilgrims, continuing through the \nContinental Congresses and our foremost Presidents, Washington and \nLincoln, certainly considered ours to be a nation under God.\n  I was a Member of the House of Representatives on June 7, 1954, when \nthe House voted to insert the words ``under God'' in the Pledge of \nAllegiance to the flag. That was June 7, 1954. I was a Member of the \nHouse 1 year from that day, perhaps just coincidentally, when the House \nvoted to place the words ``In God We Trust'' on the currency and coins \nof these United States. June 7, 1955, that was.\n\n  There you have it, June 7, 1954, the words ``under God'' were \ninserted in the Pledge of Allegiance, and 1 year from that day, June 7, \n1955, they put the words ``In God We Trust'' on the currency of our \nNation. And there they are, the words ``In God We Trust.''\n  Do you think we would ever have to remove those words from the walls \nof this Chamber? Let us trust in God that those words will never be \nremoved. No court will ever think that it can remove those words ``In \nGod We Trust'' from the walls of this Chamber.\n  So our foremost Presidents, Washington and Lincoln, certainly \nconsidered ours to be a nation under God. They used Thanksgiving, our \nspecial unique American holiday, as a time and a reason to celebrate \nit.\n  That acknowledgment of divine blessing did not stop there. After \n1863, President Lincoln issued other Thanksgiving proclamations, and \nsubsequent Presidents who followed him, followed his example.\n  In 1905, President Theodore Roosevelt talked of how appropriate it \nwas to ``set apart one day in each year for a special service of \nthanksgiving to the Almighty.'' ``It is eminently fitting,'' he \nproclaimed, ``that once a year our people should set apart a day of \npraise and thanksgiving to the Giver of Good . . . [therefore] I ask \nthat through the land the people gather in their homes and places of \nworship and in rendering thanks unto the Most High for the manifold \nblessings of the past year.''\n  In his 1938 Thanksgiving proclamation, President Franklin Roosevelt \nnoted:\n\n       [F]rom the earliest recorded history, Americans have \n     thanked God for their blessings. In our deepest natures, in \n     our very souls, we, like all mankind, since the earliest \n     origin of mankind, turned to God in time of happiness.\n\n  Mr. President, 20 years later in his 1958 Thanksgiving proclamation, \nPresident Eisenhower proclaimed:\n\n       Let us be especially grateful for the religious heritage \n     bequeathed us by our forefathers, as exemplified by the \n     Pilgrims, who,\n\n[[Page S15937]]\n\n     after the gathering of their first harvest, set apart a \n     special day for rendering thanks to God for the bounties \n     vouchsafed to them.\n\n  In 1962, President John F. Kennedy asked the American people to \n``renew the spirit of the Pilgrims at the first Thanksgiving, lonely in \nan inscrutable wilderness, facing the dark unknown with a faith borne \nof their dedication to God and a fortitude drawn from their sense that \nall men were brothers.''\n  So it is that we celebrate this unique American holiday, a day \ndevoted to family, to country, and to God. It always has been. I pray \nit always will be a day for giving thanks. With the turmoil of the past \nyear with our sons and daughters in far away lands putting their lives \nin danger, we still have so much for which to be thankful.\n  We can be thankful for the heritage of liberty bequeathed to us by \nour ancestors, and from whom we are entrusted to preserve for future \ngenerations of Americans.\n  Mr. President, we can be thankful for the wisdom and the foresight of \nour Founding Fathers, who bequeathed to us a form of government unique \nin history, with its three strong pillars of the executive, the \nlegislative, and the judicial branches, each balanced and checked one \nagainst the other.\n  Like President Washington, we can be thankful for ``the many favors \nof Almighty God,'' including a government that ensures our ``safety and \nhappiness.''\n  And like President Lincoln, we can be thankful for the ``gracious \ngifts of the most high God, who, while dealing with us in anger for our \nsins, hath nevertheless remembered mercy.''\n  While we are saddened that there are so many young American men and \nwomen in uniform who will not be able to be with their families on this \nholiday, we can be thankful for their courage, thankful for their \ndevotion to duty, and thankful for their service to our Nation.\n  We can be thankful for those men and women who, 383 years ago, had \nthe courage, the faith, and the devotion to our Almighty Father, to \nGod, to embark upon the most difficult and dangerous of journeys and \nface the darkest unknown so that they, and we, could worship freely.\n  We can be thankful, can we not, for the abundance of America, an \nabundance that includes an annual production of millions of turkeys, \nmillions of pounds of cranberries and sweet potatoes and pumpkins.\n  Mr. President, a few minutes ago, I read from President Lincoln's \nThanksgiving Proclamation of 1863. Permit me now to read from the 1863 \nWhite House Thanksgiving menu.\n  According to that menu, in 1863, the White House Thanksgiving dinner \nconsisted of the following, and I quote from that menu: cranberry \njuice; that is good. How sweet it is, cranberry juice; roast turkey \nwith dressing, cranberry sauce.\n  Look at that man sitting in the chair, presiding over this Senate. \nYes, there he is. I can see his mouth is watering like mine is \nwatering.\n  Sweet potatoes, creamed onions. Well, I like my onions just plain \nonions, not creamed, but that was on the menu. Squash, pumpkin pie, \nplum pudding, mince pie, milk, and coffee.\n  Does that sound familiar? How about it, does it sound familiar?\n  I hope my wife Erma is watching right at this moment because nobody \nin my lifetime can spread a table like my wife Erma. She has been \nspreading that table in my family now for 66 years, bless her heart.\n  But does it sound familiar? It sure sounds like the 2003 Thanksgiving \nmenu at the Byrd house. Boy, how I look forward to it. I am getting \nhungry just thinking about it. I am getting hungry. How about that?\n  I hope that my listeners are getting hungry also, and thinking about \nthe first Thanksgiving. The first Thanksgiving, how would you have \nliked to have sat with that incredible, intrepid band of men and women?\n  So I am going to stop talking now, and I am going to head home, \nbefore too long, for our great Thanksgiving meal with my wife Erma and \nour two daughters and their husbands and our five grandchildren, their \nspouses, and our three great-grandchildren and our little dog, Trouble.\n  Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.

Mr. President, economic growth is the lifeblood of this \ncountry. Economic growth is what gets rid of deficits. Economic growth \nis what provides jobs. Economic growth is what causes investments. \nEconomic growth is what gives our people hope.\n  Today, the Government just released news that our economy grew by an \namazing 8.2 percent last quarter, up from an earlier estimate in the \nsame quarter of 7.2 percent. I recall when it went up 7.2 percent. We \nwere all saying: Isn't that fantastic? The economy is really booming.\n  Well, it turns out there is always an adjustment, and they made the \nadjustment. Frequently, the adjustment is downward. In this case, the \nadjustment is upward, an astronomical 8.2 percent growth in the \ndomestic product last quarter. This means solid growth this quarter and \ninto next year. This is a tribute to the resilient American economy and \nto the fiscal policy pursued by the President and the Republican-led \nCongress.\n  The naysayers, principally on the other side of the aisle, have been \nthe ones saying we should not have cut taxes. Taxes create deficits. On \neverything the President chose to ask us to do about the economy, the \nnaysayers said no. Now they have been proven wrong and we have the \nsecond basket on the floor in the nature of great big positive news for \nthe American people. Even more important to the future, confidence \namong the American consumers soared. They know when things are going \nwell. It soared to almost 92 percent, a full 10 percent gain from last \nmonth. We remember when we were all worried because it was extremely \nlow, into 60 percent, and the naysayers were saying: It is all \nPresident Bush's fault. Well, if that is the case--it is 92 percent \nnow--is that not his fault? Or is that not to his credit? I would think \nso.\n  The kind of extraordinary growth I am talking about obviously cannot \ncontinue for years and years, perhaps not even for very many quarters, \nbut it does mean that most estimates of growth for the year 2004 will \nprove to be pessimistic. They will prove to be too low. If we get a \nsolid 3 and 3\\1/2\\ percent growth rate each of the next quarters for an \nentire fiscal year, then we will see Federal deficits also decline. \nEmployment will increase and investments will improve.\n  The naysayers will be stuck. How will they answer all of these items \nof good news when employment starts coming down, which it already has \nbut will come down more; when Federal deficits, instead of going up, \nwhich they run around talking about President Bush created, when \neverybody knows we have a huge expenditure for our military men and \nequipment because we have been in a series of war-like efforts from \nSomalia, Afghanistan, and now this one. Nothing can be done without \nspending a lot of money. But we are going to see the deficit come down \nif these growth numbers continue up.\n  Yes, we have all been worried about American business: Where is it \ngoing? First, we have to give American business some credit. I used the \nwords ``resilient economy'' awhile ago. When there is a recession, \nAmerican business takes action. They are not like us. They do not have \nall of the money to spend. They have to stop spending. They have to \nmake changes.\n  They made changes. Guess what happened. Productivity went through the \nroof, and enormous productivity growth normally is accompanied by great \nGDP growth, and that has happened.\n  Now, it seems as if productivity growth is probably going to stop. \nThey have taken about as much as they can out of their businesses, and \nnow we are going to have the growth that will follow it, the job \nincreases that will follow it, and the deficits that will diminish.\n  I close where I started, by saying it seems as if good news comes in \nbushels.\n\n[[Page S15938]]\n\nGood news comes not one thing at a time but two things and maybe three \nat a time, and the two pieces of great news are before us today. Let us \nhope there is more to come because, clearly, we are on the path upward.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15938-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15938-S15948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CAN-SPAM ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, as my good friend from New Mexico was \npointing out some of the good news, I have some more. I ask that the \nChair lay before the Senate a message from the House on S. 877.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message:\n\n                                 S. 877\n\n       Resolved, That the bill from the Senate (S. 877) entitled \n     ``An Act to regulate interstate commerce by imposing \n     limitations and penalties on the transmission of unsolicited \n     commercial electronic mail via the Internet'', do pass with \n     the following amendment:\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Controlling the Assault of \n     Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003'', or the \n     ``CAN-SPAM Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Electronic mail has become an extremely important and \n     popular means of communication, relied on by millions of \n     Americans on a daily basis for personal and commercial \n     purposes. Its low cost and global reach make it extremely \n     convenient and efficient, and offer unique opportunities for \n     the development and growth of frictionless commerce.\n       (2) The convenience and efficiency of electronic mail are \n     threatened by the extremely rapid growth in the volume of \n     unsolicited commercial electronic mail. Unsolicited \n     commercial electronic mail is currently estimated to account \n     for over half of all electronic mail traffic, up from an \n     estimated 7 percent in 2001, and the volume continues to \n     rise. Most of these messages are fraudulent or deceptive in \n     one or more respects.\n       (3) The receipt of unsolicited commercial electronic mail \n     may result in costs to recipients who cannot refuse to accept \n     such mail and who incur costs for the storage of such mail, \n     or for the time spent accessing, reviewing, and discarding \n     such mail, or for both.\n       (4) The receipt of a large number of unwanted messages also \n     decreases the convenience of electronic mail and creates a \n     risk that wanted electronic mail messages, both commercial \n     and noncommercial, will be lost, overlooked, or discarded \n     amidst the larger volume of unwanted messages, thus reducing \n     the reliability and usefulness of electronic mail to the \n     recipient.\n       (5) Some commercial electronic mail contains material that \n     many recipients may consider vulgar or pornographic in \n     nature.\n       (6) The growth in unsolicited commercial electronic mail \n     imposes significant monetary costs on providers of Internet \n     access services, businesses, and educational and nonprofit \n     institutions that carry and receive such mail, as there is a \n     finite volume of mail that such providers, businesses, and \n     institutions can handle without further investment in \n     infrastructure.\n       (7) Many senders of unsolicited commercial electronic mail \n     purposefully disguise the source of such mail.\n       (8) Many senders of unsolicited commercial electronic mail \n     purposefully include misleading information in the message's \n     subject lines in order to induce the recipients to view the \n     messages.\n       (9) While some senders of commercial electronic mail \n     messages provide simple and reliable ways for recipients to \n     reject (or ``opt-out'' of) receipt of commercial electronic \n     mail from such senders in the future, other senders provide \n     no such ``opt-out'' mechanism, or refuse to honor the \n     requests of recipients not to receive electronic mail from \n     such senders in the future, or both.\n       (10) Many senders of bulk unsolicited commercial electronic \n     mail use computer programs to gather large numbers of \n     electronic mail addresses on an automated basis from Internet \n     websites or online services where users must post their \n     addresses in order to make full use of the website or \n     service.\n       (11) Many States have enacted legislation intended to \n     regulate or reduce unsolicited commercial electronic mail, \n     but these statutes impose different standards and \n     requirements. As a result, they do not appear to have been \n     successful in addressing the problems associated with \n     unsolicited commercial electronic mail, in part because, \n     since an electronic mail address does not specify a \n     geographic location, it can be extremely difficult for law-\n     abiding businesses to know with which of these disparate \n     statutes they are required to comply.\n       (12) The problems associated with the rapid growth and \n     abuse of unsolicited commercial electronic mail cannot be \n     solved by Federal legislation alone. The development and \n     adoption of technological approaches and the pursuit of \n     cooperative efforts with other countries will be necessary as \n     well.\n       (b) Congressional Determination of Public Policy.--On the \n     basis of the findings in subsection (a), the Congress \n     determines that--\n       (1) there is a substantial government interest in \n     regulation of commercial electronic mail on a nationwide \n     basis;\n       (2) senders of commercial electronic mail should not \n     mislead recipients as to the source or content of such mail; \n     and\n       (3) recipients of commercial electronic mail have a right \n     to decline to receive additional commercial electronic mail \n     from the same source.\n\n     SEC. 3.

For purposes of this paragraph, more than 1 person \n     may be considered to have initiated a message.\n       (10) Internet.--The term ``Internet'' has the meaning given \n     that term in the Internet Tax Freedom Act (47 U.S.C. 151 \n     note).\n       (11) Internet access service.--The term ``Internet access \n     service'' has the meaning given that term in section \n     231(e)(4) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n     231(e)(4)).\n       (12) Procure.--The term ``procure'', when used with respect \n     to the initiation of a commercial electronic mail message, \n     means intentionally to pay or provide other consideration to, \n     or induce, another person to initiate such a message on one's \n     behalf.\n       (13) Protected computer.--The term ``protected computer'' \n     has the meaning given that term in section 1030(e)(2)(B) of \n     title 18, United States Code.\n       (14) Recipient.--The term ``recipient'', when used with \n     respect to a commercial electronic mail message, means an \n     authorized user of the electronic mail address to which the \n     message was sent or delivered.

If an \n     electronic mail address is reassigned to a new user, the new \n     user shall not be treated as a recipient of any commercial \n     electronic mail message sent or delivered to that address \n     before it was reassigned.\n       (15) Routine conveyance.--The term ``routine conveyance'' \n     means the transmission, routing, relaying, handling, or \n     storing, through an automatic technical process, of an \n     electronic mail message for which another person has \n     identified the recipients or provided the recipient \n     addresses.\n       (16) Sender.--\n\n[[Page S15939]]\n\n       (A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph (B), \n     the term ``sender'' means a person who initiates such a \n     message and whose product, service, or Internet web site is \n     advertised or promoted by the message.\n       (B) Separate lines of business or divisions.--If an entity \n     operates through separate lines of business or divisions and \n     holds itself out to the recipient of the message, in \n     complying with the requirement under section 5(a)(5)(B), as \n     that particular line of business or division rather than as \n     the entity of which such line of business or division is a \n     part, then the line of business or the division shall be \n     treated as the sender of such message for purposes of this \n     Act.\n       (17) Transactional or relationship message.--\n       (A) In general.--The term ``transactional or relationship \n     message'' means an electronic mail message the primary \n     purpose of which is--\n       (i) to facilitate, complete, or confirm a commercial \n     transaction that the recipient has previously agreed to enter \n     into with the sender;\n       (ii) to provide warranty information, product recall \n     information, or safety or security information with respect \n     to a commercial product or service used or purchased by the \n     recipient;\n       (iii) to provide--\n\n       (I) notification concerning a change in the terms or \n     features of;\n       (II) notification of a change in the recipient's standing \n     or status with respect to; or\n       (III) at regular periodic intervals, account balance \n     information or other type of account statement with respect \n     to,\n\n     a subscription, membership, account, loan, or comparable \n     ongoing commercial relationship involving the ongoing \n     purchase or use by the recipient of products or services \n     offered by the sender;\n       (iv) to provide information directly related to an \n     employment relationship or related benefit plan in which the \n     recipient is currently involved, participating, or enrolled; \n     or\n       (v) to deliver goods or services, including product updates \n     or upgrades, that the recipient is entitled to receive under \n     the terms of a transaction that the recipient has previously \n     agreed to enter into with the sender.\n       (B) Modification of definition.--The Commission by \n     regulation pursuant to section 13 may modify the definition \n     in subparagraph (A) to expand or contract the categories of \n     messages that are treated as transactional or relationship \n     messages for purposes of this Act to the extent that such \n     modification is necessary to accommodate changes in \n     electronic mail technology or practices and accomplish the \n     purposes of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 4.

and\n       (C) header information shall be considered materially \n     misleading if it fails to identify accurately a protected \n     computer used to initiate the message because the person \n     initiating the message knowingly uses another protected \n     computer to relay or retransmit the message for purposes of \n     disguising its origin.\n       (2) Prohibition of deceptive subject headings.--It is \n     unlawful for any person to initiate the transmission to a \n     protected computer of a commercial electronic mail message if \n     such person has actual knowledge, or knowledge fairly implied \n     on the basis of objective circumstances, that a subject \n     heading of the message would be likely to mislead a \n     recipient, acting reasonably under the circumstances, about a \n     material fact regarding the contents or subject matter of the \n     message (consistent with the criteria are used in enforcement \n     of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. \n     45)).\n       (3) Inclusion of return address or comparable mechanism in \n     commercial electronic mail.--\n       (A) In general.--It is unlawful for any person to initiate \n     the transmission to a protected computer of a commercial \n     electronic mail message that does not contain a functioning \n     return electronic mail address or other Internet-based \n     mechanism, clearly and conspicuously displayed, that--\n       (i) a recipient may use to submit, in a manner specified in \n     the message, a reply electronic mail message or other form of \n     Internet-based communication requesting not to receive future \n     commercial electronic mail messages from that sender at the \n     electronic mail address where the message was received;

or\n       (ii) the electronic mail address of the recipient was \n     obtained using an automated means that generates possible \n     electronic mail addresses by combining names, letters, or \n     numbers into numerous permutations.\n       (B) Disclaimer.--Nothing in this paragraph creates an \n     ownership or proprietary interest in such electronic mail \n     addresses.\n       (2) Automated creation of multiple electronic mail \n     accounts.--It is unlawful for any person to use scripts or \n     other automated means to register for multiple electronic \n     mail accounts or online user accounts from which to transmit \n     to a protected computer, or enable another person to transmit \n     to a protected computer, a commercial electronic mail message \n     that is unlawful under subsection (a).\n       (3) Relay or retransmission through unauthorized access.--\n     It is unlawful for any person knowingly to relay or \n     retransmit a commercial electronic mail message that is \n     unlawful under subsection (a) from a protected computer or \n     computer network that such person has accessed without \n     authorization.\n       (c) Supplementary Rulemaking Authority.--The Commission \n     shall by rule, pursuant to section 13--\n       (1) modify the 10-business-day period under subsection \n     (a)(4)(A) or subsection (a)(4)(B), or both, if the Commission \n     determines that a different period would be more reasonable \n     after taking into account--\n       (A) the purposes of subsection (a);\n       (B) the interests of recipients of commercial electronic \n     mail; and\n       (C) the burdens imposed on senders of lawful commercial \n     electronic mail; and\n       (2) specify additional activities or practices to which \n     subsection (b) applies if the Commission determines that \n     those activities or practices are contributing substantially \n     to the proliferation of commercial electronic mail messages \n     that are unlawful under subsection (a).\n       (d) Requirement To Place Warning Labels on Commercial \n     Electronic Mail Containing Sexually Oriented Material.--\n       (1) In general.--No person may initiate in or affecting \n     interstate commerce the transmission, to a protected \n     computer, of any commercial electronic mail message that \n     includes sexually oriented material and--\n       (A) fail to include in subject heading for the electronic \n     mail message the marks or notices prescribed by the \n     Commission under this subsection;

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The provisions of this Act, other than section 9, shall \n     take effect on January 1, 2004.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nconcur in the House amendment with the substitute amendment from \nSenator Burns, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no \nintervening action or debate, and that any statements relating to the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Domenici). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2219) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, this is a good day, not only for me \npersonally but many of us who serve in this Senate, especially my \nfriend from Oregon whom I see across the aisle.\n  It has been 4 years, working on this legislation. This is the CAN-\nSPAM bill--everybody is pretty familiar with it--which we hope will \nstem the tide of junk mail that is flooding our Nation's inboxes and \nour e-mail.\n  I specifically thank my colleague Senator Wyden from Oregon who is \ncoauthor of this bill. He has been working tirelessly on this for \nyears--as long as I have. Thanks to the discussions over the past few \ndays, many already strong proconsumer provisions in CAN-SPAM have been \nenhanced. Those negotiations have been ongoing and, in some cases, have \nbeen rather tense. The bill the Senate considers today contains \nsubstantial statutory damages for spammers and additional notice \nrequirements on commercial e-mail.\n  The character of the Congress is not always proactive; it is always \nreactive, it seems. That is the nature of the political landscape in \nwhich we find ourselves. We do not get too excited about doing anything \nuntil the folks at home get excited, or enough of them, that they form \na critical mass for us to take action.\n  I congratulate Senator Wyden. We serve together on the Commerce \nCommittee. We were approached about doing something about the Internet \nand what is coming down on our computers and is found in our mailboxes \non the Internet. We saw, 4 years ago, that this was going to become a \nproblem. It was not just the idea of the Senator who stands before you \nnow to do something about unwanted e-mail 4 years ago. There were more \nSenators around here who had the same vision, that as this industry \ngrows, a problem will also grow with it. And that is what happened.\n\n  The extent of bipartisan cooperation on this issue is no surprise, \ngiven the deluge of spam consumers face in their inboxes every day. The \ncosts to businesses and individuals is escalating and wide ranging. \nBusinesses lose money when employees take more and more time to wade \nthrough their e-mail. Servers all over the country have difficulty \nblocking spam, clearing their machines so they can operate while \nspammers work to find more and more ways to circumvent the latest \nsoftware server or individual blocking systems.\n  In my State of Montana, spam is really horrible, as it is in all \nrural areas across the United States. We have vast distances in \nMontana. Many of my constituents are forced to pay long distance \ncharges on their time on the Internet. It is not the only State that \nhas to do that. You will find that in the majority of rural areas, in \nall our States. Spam makes it nearly impossible for rural America to \nrealize the tremendous economic and educational benefits of the online \nera.\n  This bill empowers consumers and grants additional enforcement to the \nFederal Trade Commission to take action against spammers. It also \nallows the States' attorneys general to do the same. The bill requires \nthe senders of commercial e-mail to include a clear opt-out mechanism \nto allow consumers to be removed from the mass e-mail lists. This opt-\nout must also be clearly described in the e-mail itself, so users of e-\nmail are not forced to sift through pages and pages of legalese to \ndetermine where they can stop the unwanted mail. Senders of commercial \ne-mail must also provide a valid physical postal address, so they are \nnot able to hide their identities. Finally, e-mail marketers must \ninclude a notice that the e-mail is advertising.\n  Simply put, the CAN-SPAM bill finally gives consumers a measure of \ncontrol over their inboxes.\n  In cases where e-mail marketers don't comply with the CAN-SPAM bill, \nthe penalties are very severe. For this part of the bill we have many \npeople to thank. Spammers are actually on the hook for damages up to \n$250 per spam e-mail with a cap of $2 million. That gets my attention \nright there. This already high penalty can be tripled if particularly \nunethical methods are used, such as a computer hijacking to send spam \nby taking control of computers of legitimate users without their \nknowledge, and for harvesting addresses from legitimate Web sites to \nsend spam. For criminal spammers who try to hide their identities by \nusing false header information, damages are not capped. In other words, \nthey can go as high, those damages can go as high as the market would \nstand. It also includes enhanced enforcement authority of the FCC to \nclose possible loopholes for spammers and to keep up with the \ntechnological developments.\n  Let's face it, technology moves at the speed of light. Granting the \nCommission the ability to keep pace with new techniques of spammers is \nessential because it has become clear, in recent years anyway, that \nthese criminals are growing increasingly sophisticated in their \nmethods.\n  So the passage of this bill today will help stem the tide of the \ntoxic sea of\n\n[[Page S15944]]\n\nspam. Clearly, consumers have been demanding control over their e-mail \ninboxes, and the passage of the CAN-SPAM today will give those \nconsumers a key victory in the battle against criminal spammers.\n  Again, I thank my good friend with whom I served on the Commerce \nCommittee, Senator Wyden of Oregon, who has absolutely been a knight in \nshining armor in negotiations and working this through the Congress. \nAlso on the floor is Senator Schumer of New York. Senator Schumer has \noffered many positive provisions in this bill. We have had a great time \ndebating that. But nonetheless, his contribution is clearly in this \nbill and we appreciate his work. Of course, when I say it is a \nbipartisan effort, that is usually the way we get legislation passed \naround here, legislation that has any kind of future at all.\n  I thank them both. It gives me great pleasure to yield the floor for \nmy friend from the great State of Oregon, Senator Wyden.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I know my colleague \nfrom New York, Senator Schumer, has a plane to catch.\n  Senator Burns and I have worked for more than 4 years on this \nlegislation, and it is particularly important that it pass today. Every \nsingle day, the flood of pornographic and sleazy spam grows. With this \nlegislation, Congress is beginning to stem the tide. We understand that \nthis is going to be a difficult battle because the kingpin spammers are \nnot technological simpletons. No matter what law Congress passes, they \nare going to be very aggressive about trying to find evasive strategies \nto get around that. But I am of the view that with the passage of this \nlegislation, if our prosecutors, the Federal Trade Commission, and the \nAttorney General come down on the kingpin spammers with hobnail boots, \nwe can put in place a strategy that can stem this tide.\n  Suffice it to say, the spammers are going to go to great lengths to \ntry to get around this law. We know, for example, that many of them are \ngoing to try to move offshore. It is going to be important to have \ninternational agreements that will also bring together U.S. authorities \nand international authorities against those who would try to get around \nthis legislation.\n  It is important to remember what Congress is doing now; that is, \nCongress is saying spamming is an outlaw business. It is an outlaw \nbusiness that is going to be treated as an area of priorities for \nprosecutors and law enforcement officials. That has not been the case \nin the past. Essentially, when Senator Burns and I pursued this problem \nof spamming a number of years ago, a lot of people asked: Why in the \nworld would a couple of U.S. Senators be tackling this issue? They \nintimated that it really wasn't worthy of the Senate's time. Spam has \ngrown so extraordinarily in the last few years, and now people have \nbeen clammering about why the Senate isn't moving ahead with this \nlegislation that they think is important because spam is such an \nintrusion into their lives every single day.\n  We have continued work to do. Senator Schumer will speak next. He has \na very important idea with respect to trying to put in place a Do Not \nSpam list. It is a promising one. I think all of us would acknowledge \nthere are some details to be worked out with the Federal Trade \nCommission. Senator Corzine has done some very good work in looking at \nsome creative ideas for the future. I intend to work closely with him \nbecause he has been a leader in the technology area. But I think we \nought to understand that this effort today is the culmination of more \nthan 4 years of hard work. It is not just needed, it is overdue.\n  We are not going to pretend this legislation is a silver bullet \nbecause we know that no piece of legislation is. But when this bill \ntakes effect, the big-time spammers who up to this point faced no \nconsequences, for all practical purposes, will suddenly be at risk for \ncriminal prosecution, Federal Trade Commission enforcement, and \nmillion-dollar lawsuits by State attorneys general and Internet service \nproviders.\n  I believe a number of these key enforcement actions will be taken \nimmediately after this legislation is passed. This will set in place \nthe kind of deterrent that is going to allow us to say it is a \ndifferent day. The big-time spammers will face consequences when they \nflood our citizens and our families with the trash and the pornography. \nThat is why this is an important step forward.\n  He is going to speak next, but I commend my colleague, the Senator \nfrom New York, for his usual persistence. He stayed at it by saying \nthis was an important issue. We have wrestled with this question with \nrespect to the Do Not Call list as well. I happen to think that the \nSenator from New York is certainly talking about a principle we need to \naddress in the communications area. I happen to think the first \namendment is special. People ought to have the right to communicate. \nBut citizens also ought to have the right to say: We have had enough. \nWe don't want to have people flooded with this kind of information. \nThat is the principle that is at stake here. I commend the Senator from \nNew York.\n  My partner, the chairman of the telecommunications subcommittee, is \nnot in the Chamber. But I am proud to serve with him. He has been an \nexceptionally gracious ally on this for many years.\n  I am glad that this proconsumer measure, a measure that I think makes \na beginning in efforts against big-time spammers, is passing. It will \nbe of great benefit to consumers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  First, let me thank my colleague from Oregon for his leadership on \nthis issue, for his persistence--done in a slightly different way, the \nOregon way, not the New York way, but it is effective, if not more \neffective--and for his understanding. There is no one in this Chamber \nwho both understands technology issues and yet has a political grasp of \npolitics and blends the two. I thank him for his leadership.\n  I thank the Senator from Montana, as well, who has worked long and \nhard on this issue; and my good friend from Arizona, the chairman of \nthe Commerce Committee, also.\n  This is going to be a good Thanksgiving for consumers. We are dealing \nwith spam today. The portability rules for cell phones have been \nenacted. I worked long and hard on those. Both antispamming legislation \nand portability rules are very important things we have done for \nconsumers. As technology changes, we need to adapt the rules by which \nthis technology can work. The basic principles we have always have to \nbe applied in new and different ways. That is what we are trying to do \ntoday.\n  E-mail is one of the great inventions of the 20th century. But, \nunfortunately, if we did nothing, e-mail would not be around within a \nfew years and no one could use it. What was an annoyance a few years \nago has become a major problem this year and could really cripple e-\nmail a few years from now. So this Congress has acted. We acted in a \nthoughtful and careful way.\n  Is this bill going to solve everything? No. But will it make a real \ndifference? You bet. Spammers: Be put on notice. Within a few months \nyou will be committing a criminal act if you do what you are doing now.\n  With this bill, Congress is saying that if you are a spammer, you can \nwind up in the slammer. That is the bottom line. The bottom line is \nthat there will be criminal penalties and real prosecution. Will we go \nafter every spammer, somebody who makes a mistake here and there? No. \nBut the studies show us--this is what gives all of us such hope--that \nmaybe 250 spammers send out 90 percent of the e-mail. And we are saying \nto those 250, no matter where you are, or how you try to hide your \nspam, we will find you. This bill gives the FTC and the Justice \nDepartment the tools to go after you.\n  That is why this bill is so important. This is such a good day, not \nonly for those who use computers but for technology in general.\n  I became familiar with this issue when I noticed my daughter on her \ncomputer. My wife and I had always said to one another: Isn't it great \nthat instead of watching television, our kids are always on the \ncomputer? Then we saw what was popping up in their e-mail--things we \nwouldn't want to see, let alone my 14-year-old daughter. As we looked \ninto it, we saw what was happening. Spam is annoying, crippling \ncommerce, and pornographic. All of\n\n[[Page S15945]]\n\nthat has to end while we preserve the essence of spam itself, which is \nease of communication.\n  There is no single solution. That is why this bill is correct in \ntaking the eclectic approach. I wanted to put a few more provisions in. \nI have talked to my friends from Montana and Oregon. We are going to \nmonitor this. If new things are needed, we will add them. But there are \nmany different ways we can go after spammers after this legislation is \nsigned by the President.\n  The part for which I fought fiercely is the No Spam Registry. It will \nprovide prosecutors with the best tools to create the case. They won't \nhave to prove intent. They won't have to prove anything other than as \nthey do with the No Call Registry. Day after day, spammers have \nrelentlessly sent hundreds and thousands of spam e-mails to people who \nhave explicitly said they do not want spam.\n  I believe that it will work. I know that the FTC has some doubts. \nAlthough, fortunately, they now say it is technically feasible, and \nthey are not worried about the list being stolen, they are worried \nabout the evidence.\n  My answer to the FTC: Try it. We do not have anything better. It is \nnot going to solve everything, but it is the best tool we have.\n  When they come back to us in 6 months with their proposal, which they \nmust do under this legislation, I have been assured by both Chairman \nMcCain and Ranking Member Hollings, as well as Senators Wyden and \nBurns, that we will make sure they implement it. We will either do it \nstatutorily or by pressure from the appropriators and others.\n  So the FTC may disagree with the vast majority of Americans and the \nunanimity of the Congress--I guess unanimous in the Senate, not quite \nin the House--but we are going to make this No Spam Registry a reality \nwithin a year.\n  So the bottom line is simple: For the first time there is some light \nat the end of the tunnel in the fight against spam. This legislation--\nnot a panacea--will greatly reduce the burden of spam, the difficulty \nof spam, and the pornographic aspects of spam.\n  So again, I thank all of my colleagues in the Senate in letting this \nlegislation go through. Again, it is a happy Thanksgiving to computer \nusers everywhere.\n  I thank my colleagues from Montana and Oregon for their leadership. I \nthank Senators McCain and Hollings, as chairman and ranking member of \nthe committee, for their support.\n  When the industry groups tried to rip the registry out of the \nlegislation, these folks stood firm, the Senate stood firm, and that is \nwhy we have it in here today.\n  With that, Mr. President, let me just conclude by wishing you, my \ncolleagues from Maine and Oregon, and all of my colleagues, and all \nthose who work here, a very happy Thanksgiving.\n  For me, God has given me much to be thankful for, and I will dwell on \nthat over the next few days. I hope everyone here feels the same way \nabout their fortune and good fortune.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                         anti-span legislation\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I would like to engage the gentleman from \nOregon, Mr. Wyden, in a colloquy regarding some details of the anti-\nspam legislation approved by the Senate. We have worked tirelessly on \nS. 877, and it is important to ensure that spammers cannot get around \nthe definitions of electronic mail address and electronic mail message \nthat will be regulated under this law. The definitions in the bill \nrequire electronic mail addresses to contain a domain part. This \nrequirement is important to make sure we only capture e-mail and do not \nregulate other communications platforms, such as Instant Messaging. \nHowever, I want to be clear that the intent of Congress is to capture \ne-mail messages as that term is commonly understood. This includes e-\nmail messages sent within the same domain that may not actually display \nthe domain part of the e-mail address.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the gentleman from Montana for raising this \nimportant issue. Yes, the intent of S. 877 is to capture all e-mail \nmessages as that term is commonly understood. This includes e-mail \nmessages where the domain part of the address may not be displayed. \nThat is why the bill's definition of e-mail address, in referring to \nthe domain part, contains the phrase ``whether or not displayed.'' We \ncertainly do not want to create any loopholes that spammers could \npotentially exploit and I appreciate the opportunity to clarify this \npoint.\n  Mr. BURNS. I would like to flag one other aspect of the bill. Under \nsection 6, the FTC can bring enforcement actions against merchants \nwhose products are promoted in spam e-mails, even if the merchant is \nnot the spammer. Isn't that correct?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I agree with the Senator.\n  Mr. BURNS. But isn't it also true that section 5 can be used against \nmerchants whose products are promoted in spam e-mails? Can't the FTC, \nState A.G.s, and Internet Service Providers bring actions under section \n5 against parties who aren't themselves spamming, but rather hire \nspammers to promote their products or services?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Absolutely. The bill's definition of ``initiate'' makes \nthat clear, because it applies not only to the spammer that originates \nthe actual e-mail, but also to a party who has hired or otherwise \ninduced the spammer to send the e-mail on its behalf. If the e-mail \nmessage violates the bill, both parties would be on the hook under \nsection 5, and enforcement would be possible against both or either \nparties.\n  Mr. BURNS. That confirms my understanding. So what is different about \nsection 6, as I understand it, is that section 6 does not require any \nshowing that the merchant actually hired or induced the spammer to send \nthe spam. In other words, if the spammer is hard to find and his \ncontractual relationship with the merchant has been obscured by under-\nthe-table dealings, the FTC doesn't have to spend time and effort \ntrying to prove the relationship.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I share the Senator's understanding of how section 6 \ndiffers from the provisions of section 5. I would only add that the \ndrafters considered which parties should have the discretion to enforce \nthe bill in the manner set forth in section 6, and decided that section \n6 should be enforced by the FTC only.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank my colleague from Oregon.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is passing \nlegislation to help staunch the torrent of unwanted commercial e-mail, \ncommonly known as spam. During the past year, I worked closely with \nSenator Hatch and other members of the Judiciary Committee to craft \ncriminal penalties for a variety of spammer tactics. Those penalties, \nwhich we introduced in June as part of the Criminal Spam Act, S. 1293, \nare included in the broader anti-spam legislation that we pass today. \nThe bill will now go back to the House of Representatives for final \napproval, and then to the President for signing.\n  Spam is much more than a technological nuisance. In the past few \nyears, it has become a serious and growing problem that threatens to \nundermine the vast potential of the Internet.\n  Businesses and individuals currently wade through tremendous amounts \nof spam in order to access e-mail that is of relevance to them--and \nthis is after Internet Service Providers, businesses, and individuals \nhave spent time and in some cases enormous amounts of money blocking a \nlarge percentage of spam from reaching its intended recipients.\n  In my home State of Vermont, one legislator recently found that two-\nthirds of the 96 e-mails in his inbox were spam. And this occurred \nafter the legislature had installed new spam-blocking software on its \ncomputer system that seemed to be catching 80 percent of the spam. The \nassistant attorney general in Vermont was forced to suggest to computer \nusers the following means to avoid these unsolicited commercial e-\nmails: ``It's very bad to reply, even to say don't send anymore. It \ntells the spammer they have a live address . . . The best thing you can \ndo is just keep deleting them. If it gets really bad, you may have to \nchange your address.'' This experience is echoed nationwide.\n  E-mail users are having the online equivalent of the experience of \nthe woman in the Monty Python skit, who seeks to order a Spam-free \nbreakfast at a restaurant. Try as she might, she cannot get the \nwaitress to bring her the meal she desires. Every dish in the\n\n[[Page S15946]]\n\nrestaurant comes with Spam; it is just a matter of how much. There is \n``egg, bacon and Spam''; ``egg, bacon, sausage and Spam''; ``Spam, \nbacon, sausage and Spam''; ``Spam, egg, Spam, Spam, bacon and Spam''; \n``Spam, sausage, Spam, Spam, Spam, bacon, Spam, tomato and Spam''; and \nso on. Exasperated, the woman finally cries out: ``I don't like Spam! . \n. . I don't want ANY Spam!''\n  Individuals and businesses are understandably reacting similarly to \nelectronic spam. A Harris poll taken late last year found that 80 \npercent of respondents view spam as ``very annoying,'' and fully 74 \npercent of respondents favor making mass spamming illegal. Earlier this \nmonth, more than three out of four people surveyed by Yahoo! Mail said \nit was ``less aggravating to clean a toilet'' than to sort through \nspam. Americans are fed up.\n  Some 30 States now have anti-spam laws, but the globe-hopping nature \nof e-mail makes these laws difficult to enforce. Technology will \nundoubtedly play a key role in fighting spam, but a technological \nsolution to the problem is not likely in the foreseeable future. ISPs \nblock billions of unwanted e-mails each day, but spammers are winning \nthe battle.\n  Millions of unwanted, unsolicited commercial e-mails are received by \nAmerican businesses and individuals each day, despite their own, \nadditional filtering efforts. Ferris Research has estimated that spam \ncosts U.S. firms $8.9 billion annually in lost worker productivity, \nconsumption of bandwidth, and the use of technical support to configure \nand run spam filters and provide helpdesk support for spam recipients.\n  The costs of spam are significant to individuals as well, including \ntime spent identifying and deleting spam, inadvertently opening spam, \ninstalling and maintaining anti-spam filters, tracking down legitimate \nmessages mistakenly deleted by spam filters, and paying for the ISP's \nblocking efforts.\n  And there are other prominent and equally important costs of spam. It \nmay introduce viruses, worms, and ``Trojan horse'' programs--that is, \nprograms that unsuspecting users download onto their computers that are \ndesigned to take control of those computers--into personal and business \ncomputer systems, including those that support our national \ninfrastructure.\n  Spammers are constantly in need of new machines through which to \nroute their garbage e-mail, and a virus makes a perfect delivery \nmechanism for the engine they use for their mass mailings. Some \nanalysts said the SoBigF virus may have been created with a more \nmalicious intent than most viruses, and may even be linked to spam e-\nmail schemes that could be a source of cash for those involved in the \nscheme.\n  The interconnection between computer viruses and spam is readily \napparent: Both flood the Internet in an attempt to force a message on \npeople who would not otherwise choose to receive it. Criminal laws I \nwrote prohibiting the former have been invoked and enforced from the \ntime they were passed. It is the latter dilemma we must now confront.\n  Spam is also fertile ground for deceptive trade practices. The FTC \nhas estimated that 90 percent of the spam involving investment and \nbusiness opportunities, and nearly half of the spam advertising health \nproducts and services, and travel and leisure, contains false or \nmisleading information.\n  This rampant deception has the potential to undermine Americans' \ntrust of valid information on the Internet. Indeed, it has already \ncaused some Americans to refrain from using the Internet to the extent \nthey otherwise would. For example, some have chosen not to participate \nin public discussion forums, and are hesitant to provide their \naddresses in legitimate business transactions, for fear that their e-\nmail addresses will be harvested for junk e-mail lists. And they are \nright to be concerned. The FTC found spam arriving at its computer \nsystem just 9 minutes after posting an e-mail address in an online chat \nroom.\n  I have often said that Congress must exercise great caution when \nregulating in cyberspace. Any legislative solution to spam must tread \ncarefully to ensure that we do not impede or stifle the free flow of \ninformation on the Internet. The United States is the birthplace of the \nInternet, and the whole world watches whenever we decide to regulate \nit. Whenever we choose to intervene in the Internet with Government \naction, we must act carefully, prudently, and knowledgeably, keeping in \nmind the implications of what we do and how we do it. And we must not \nforget that spam, like more traditional forms of commercial speech, is \nprotected by the first amendment.\n  At the same time, we must not allow spam to result in the ``virtual \ndeath'' of the Internet, as one Vermont newspaper put it.\n  The Internet is a valuable asset to our Nation, to our economy, and \nto the lives of Americans, and we should act prudently to secure its \ncontinued viability and vitality.\n  On June 19 of this year, Senator Hatch and I introduced S. 1293, the \nCriminal Spam Act, together with several of our colleagues on the \nJudiciary Committee. On September 25, the Committee unanimously voted \nto report S. 1293 to the floor. On October 22, the Senate unanimously \nadopted the criminal provisions of the bill as an amendment to S. 877, \nthe CAN SPAM Act. Today, the Senate is passing these same criminal \nprovisions as section 4 of a modified version of S. 877, as passed by \nthe House last week.\n  The Hatch-Leahy criminal provisions prohibit five principal \ntechniques that spammers use to evade filtering software and hide their \ntrails.\n  First, our legislation prohibits hacking into another person's \ncomputer system and sending bulk spam from or through that system. This \ncriminalizes the common spammer technique of obtaining access to other \npeople's e-mail accounts on an ISP's e-mail network, whether by \npassword theft or by inserting a Trojan horse to send bulk spam.\n  Second, our legislation prohibits using a computer system that the \nowner makes available for other purposes as a conduit for bulk spam, \nwith the intent of deceiving recipients as to the spam's origins. This \nprohibition criminalizes another common spammer technique--the abuse of \nthird parties' ``open'' servers, such as e-mail servers that have the \ncapability to relay mail, or Web proxy servers that have the ability to \ngenerate ``form'' mail.\n  Spammers commandeer these servers to send bulk commercial e-mail \nwithout the server owner's knowledge, either by ``relaying'' their e-\nmail through an ``open'' e-mail server, or by abusing an ``open'' Web \nproxy server's capability to generate form e-mails as a means to \noriginate spam, thereby exceeding the owner's authorization for use of \nthat e-mail or Web server. In some instances the hijacked servers are \neven completely shut down as a result of tens of thousands of \nundeliverable messages generated from the spammer's e-mail list.\n  The legislation's third prohibition targets another way that outlaw \nspammers evade ISP filters: Falsifying the ``header information'' that \naccompanies every e-mail, and sending bulk spam containing that fake \nheader information. More specifically, the legislation prohibits \nforging information regarding the origin of the e-mail message, and the \nroute through which the message attempted to penetrate the ISP filters.\n  At the suggestion of the Department of Justice, this third offense \nhas been amended since the Senate last considered it to require a \nshowing of materiality. This means the Government must prove that the \nheader information was altered or concealed in a manner that would \nimpair the ability of a recipient of the message, an Internet access \nservice processing the message on behalf of a recipient, a person \nalleging a violation of this title, or a law enforcement agency, to \nidentify, locate, or respond to the person who initiated the e-mail or \nto investigate the alleged violation.\n  Fourth, the Hatch-Leahy legislation prohibits registering \nfor multiple e-mail accounts or Internet domain names using false \nidentities, and sending bulk e-mail from those accounts or domains. \nThis provision targets deceptive ``account churning,'' a common outlaw \nspammer technique that works as follows. The spammer registers--usually \nby means of an automatic computer program--for large numbers of e-mail \naccounts or domain names, using false registration information, then \nsends bulk spam from one account or\n\n[[Page S15947]]\n\ndomain after another. This technique stays ahead of ISP filters by \nhiding the source, size, and scope of the sender's mailings, and \nprevents the e-mail account provider or domain name registrar from \nidentifying the registrant as a spammer and denying his registration \nrequest. Falsifying registration information for domain names also \nviolates a basic contractual requirement for domain name registration \nfalsification. As with the last offense, this offense now requires that \nthe registration information be falsified ``materially.''\n\n  Fifth and finally, our legislation addresses a major hacker spammer \ntechnique for hiding identity that is a common and pernicious \nalternative to domain name registration--hijacking unused expanses of \nInternet address space and using them as launch pads for junk e-mail. \nHijacking Internet Protocol--IP--addresses is not difficult: Spammers \nsimply falsely assert that they have the right to use a block of IP \naddresses, and obtain an Internet connection for those addresses. \nHiding behind those addresses, they can then send vast amounts of spam \nthat is extremely difficult to trace.\n  Penalties for violations of these new criminal prohibitions are tough \nbut measured. Recidivists and those who send spam in furtherance of \nanother felony may be imprisoned for up to 5 years. Large-volume \nspammers, those who hack into another person's computer system to send \nbulk spam, and spam ``kingpins'' who use others to operate their \nspamming operations may be imprisoned for up to 3 years. Other \noffenders may be fined and imprisoned for no more than one year. \nConvicted offenders are also subject to forfeiture of proceeds and \ninstrumentalities of the offense.\n  In addition to these penalties, the Hatch-Leahy legislation directs \nthe Sentencing Commission to consider providing sentencing enhancements \nfor those convicted of the new criminal provisions who obtained e-mail \naddresses through improper means, such as harvesting, and those who \nknowingly sent spam containing or advertising a falsely registered \nInternet domain name. We have also worked with Senator Nelson on \nlanguage directing the Sentencing Commission to consider enhancements \nfor those who commit other crimes that are facilitated by the sending \nof spam.\n  I should note that the Criminal Spam Act, from which these provisions \nare taken, enjoys broad support from ISPs, direct marketers, consumer \ngroups, and civil liberties groups alike. Again, the purpose of these \ncriminal provisions is to deter the most pernicious and unscrupulous \ntypes of spammers--those who use trickery and deception to induce \nothers to relay and view their messages. Ridding America's inboxes of \ndeceptively delivered spam will help clear electronic channels for \nInternet users from coast-to-coast. But it is not a cure-all for the \nspam pandemic.\n  The fundamental problem inherent to spam--its sheer volume--may well \npersist even in the absence of fraudulent routing information and false \nidentities. In a recent survey, 82 percent of respondents considered \nunsolicited bulk e-mail, even from legitimate businesses, to be \nunwelcome spam. Given this public opinion, and in light of the fact \nthat spam is, in essence, cost-shifted advertising, we need to take a \nmore comprehensive approach to our fight against spam.\n  While I am generally supportive of the CAN SPAM Act, it does raise \nsome concerns. For one thing, it may not be tough enough to do the job.\n  The bill takes an ``opt out'' approach to spam--that is, it requires \nall commercial e-mail to include an ``opt out'' mechanism, by which e-\nmail recipients may opt out of receiving further unwanted spam. My \nconcern is that this approach authorizes spammers to send at least one \npiece of spam to each e-mail address in their database, while placing \nthe burden on e-mail recipients to respond. People who receive dozens, \neven hundreds, of unwanted e-mails each day may have little time or \nenergy for anything other than opting-out from unwanted spam. Meantime, \nCAN SPAM will sweep away dozens of State anti-spam laws, including some \nthat were substantially more restrictive.\n  I am also troubled by the two labeling requirement in the CAN SPAM \nAct. The first makes it unlawful to send an unsolicited commercial e-\nmail message unless it provides, among other things, ``clear and \nconspicuous identification that the message is an advertisement or \nsolicitation,'' and ``a valid physical postal address of the sender.'' \nThe second--added as a floor amendment during Senate consideration of \nthe bill in October--requires ``warning labels'' on any commercial e-\nmail that includes ``sexually oriented material.''\n  While we all want to curb spam and protect our children from \ninappropriate material, there are important first amendment concerns to \nregulating commercial e-mail in ways that require specific labels on \nprotected speech. Such requirements inhibit both the speaker's right to \nexpress and the listener's right to access constitutionally protected \nmaterial.\n  In addition, the bill's definition of ``sexually oriented material'' \nas any material that ``depicts'' sexually explicit conduct seems overly \nbroad. According to Webster's dictionary, ``depict'' may mean either to \nrepresent by a picture or to describe in words. It is my hope that the \nFTC, which has some rulemaking authority with respect to this labeling \nrequirement, will clarify that it applies to ``visual'' depictions \nonly.\n  The CAN SPAM Act may not be perfect, but it is a serious effort to \naddress a difficult and urgent problem. I support its passage today, \nand commend the bipartisanship that was needed to get this done.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to support the final passage \nof the CAN-SPAM bill, which will help to stem the tide of junk e-mail \nthat is flooding the Nation's inboxes. I want to specifically thank my \ncolleague Senator Wyden, the coauthor of the bill, who has been working \ntirelessly on this issue for years. Thanks to discussions over the past \nfew days, many of the already-strong proconsumer provisions in CAN-SPAM \nhave been enhanced. The bill the Senate considers today contains \nsubstantial statutory damages for spammers and additional notice \nrequirements on commercial e-mail.\n  The extent of bipartisan cooperation on this issue is no surprise \ngiven the deluge of spam consumers face in their inboxes everyday. The \ncosts to businesses and individuals are escalating and wide ranging. \nBusinesses lose money when employees take more and more time to wade \nthrough their e-mails. Servers all over the country have difficulty \nblocking spam, all while spammers work to find more and more ways to \ncircumvent the latest software, server, or individual blocking systems.\n  Spam is particularly harmful to rural areas. Because of the vast \ndistances in Montana, many of my constituents are forced to pay long \ndistance charges for their time on the Internet. Spam makes it nearly \nimpossible for those in rural America to realize the tremendous \neconomic and educational benefits of the online era.\n  The CAN-SPAM bill empowers consumers and grants additional \nenforcement authority to the Federal Trade Commission to take action \nagainst spammers. The bill requires the senders of commercial e-mail to \ninclude a clear ``opt-out'' mechanism to allow consumers to be removed \nfrom mass e-mail lists. This ``opt-out'' must also be clearly described \nin the e-mail itself, so that users of e-mail are not forced to sift \nthrough pages of legalese to determine where they can stop unwanted e-\nmail.\n  The senders of commercial e-mail must also provide a valid physical \npostal address so that they are not able to hide their identities. \nFinally, e-mail marketers must include notice that the e-mail is an \nadvertisement. Simply put, the CAN-SPAM bill finally gives consumers a \nmeasure of control over their inboxes.\n  In cases where e-mail marketers don't comply with the CAN-SPAM bill, \nthe penalties are severe. Spammers are on the hook for damages up to \n$250 per spam e-mail with a cap of $2 million. This already high \npenalty can be tripled if particularly unethical methods are used, such \nas ``computer hijacking'' to send spam by taking control of the \ncomputers of legitimate users without their knowledge or for harvesting \naddresses from legitimate Web sites to send spam. For criminal spammers \nwho try to hide their identities by using false header information, \ndamages are not capped.\n\n[[Page S15948]]\n\n  The CAN-SPAM bill also includes enhanced enforcement authority for \nthe FTC to close possible loopholes for spammers and to keep up with \ntechnological developments. Granting the Commission the ability to keep \npace with the new techniques of spammers is essential because it has \nbecome clear in recent years that these criminals are growing \nincreasingly sophisticated in their methods.\n  The passage of CAN-SPAM today will help to stem the tide of the toxic \nsea of spam. Clearly, consumers have been demanding control over their \ne-mail inboxes and the passage of CAN-SPAM today will give consumers a \nkey victory in the battle against criminal spammers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, let me first return the Thanksgiving \ngreetings of my colleagues.

Mr. President, last week NBC News aired a report \nindicating that suspected terrorists had been granted American \ncitizenship or permanent residency at the same time they were under \ninvestigation by the FBI for their involvement in terrorism. This well-\nresearched piece reached the warranted and troubling conclusion that \nthis occurred despite advance knowledge within the Department of \nJustice.\n  The NBC report revealed an alarming and dangerous lack of \ncoordination between Federal agencies. The NBC piece parallels credible \nallegations that first came to my attention in January.\n  As the chairman of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, to followup \non these allegations, I have made repeated requests of the Department \nof Justice for information that would allow my committee to assess this \npotentially serious threat to our national security.\n  We have a saying up in Maine: You can't get there from here. You may \nhave heard it, Mr. President. But when it comes to travel in my home \nState, it is not really true. The roads may be winding, and the route \nmay not be all that direct, but with persistence and patience, you can \nalways get where you need to go.\n  However, when it comes to dealing with the Department of Justice on \nthis very serious matter, it seems that you cannot get anywhere. I have \nbeen persistent, but my patience has pretty much run out.\n  The allegations that I received in January were these: In the course \nof investigating foreign-born individuals for terrorism-related \noffenses, the FBI learned that some of these individuals were in the \nprocess of applying for naturalization or permanent residency.\n  FBI agents requested permission to share that critical important \ninformation with the INS. Their FBI supervisors, however, refused those \nrequests. This information has been confirmed by NBC News's chief \ninvestigative reporter, Lisa Myers, in her thoroughly researched piece \nthat aired last week.\n  My requests to the Department of Justice for information that would \ndefine the size of this alleged hole in national security and of this \npossible gap in interagency cooperation have been refused repeatedly.\n  I have modified my requests in order to accommodate the specific \nobjections raised by the Department. My modified requests have also \nbeen refused due to new objections or, in some cases, old ones simply \nrephrased.\n  Here is a brief travelogue of my 10-month journey in the bureaucracy \nof the Department of Justice: On January 21, shortly after these \nallegations came to my attention, I wrote to the FBI Director, Robert \nMueller, and asked that he provide the committee with the names, dates \nof birth, INS registration numbers, and start dates of investigations \nof all persons who have been the subjects of terrorism investigations \nfrom September 10, 1991, through September 10, 2001, in the 15 largest \nFBI field offices. I asked to have this information delivered to my \noffice by February 4.\n  Well, I received no response at all until February 28, when I \nreceived a reply from the Department categorically denying my request. \nThe primary reason cited was that the Department had a longstanding \npolicy of not providing Congress with information about people who have \nbeen investigated but not prosecuted.\n  Among the other supporting reasons were the separation of powers \nand--I am not making this up, Mr. President--a concern that providing \nCongress with information that could help it understand and remedy a \nsituation so potentially damaging to our Nation's security could, and I \nquote, ``gravely damage the nation's security.''\n  The Department did offer, at that point, to work with me to see if \nthere was an alternative. I eagerly took the Department up on that \noffer, and I wanted to try to accommodate whatever legitimate concerns \nthe Department might have.\n  Thus, my staff talked repeatedly with the Department during the next \nfew months to craft a mutually agreeable alternative approach.\n  On May 21, I submitted another much narrower request proposing that \nthe Department of Justice would conduct its own review, a review I \nwould think that the Department would be very eager to conduct once \nthis threat was brought to the Department's own attention. Moreover, \nthe length of the review would be reduced from a decade to 5 years, and \nthe scope would be reduced from 15 field offices to just 5.\n  Now, by this time, of course, the INS had been moved from the \nDepartment of Justice to the new Department of Homeland Security.\n  It had been renamed as the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration \nServices. I suggested the FBI provide the results of its internal \nreview to the BCIS so it could determine who had been granted \ncitizenship or permanent residency while they were being investigated \nfor terrorism. Again, I would think the Department would be very \nconcerned about the serious breakdown and lapse in communication and \nwould be eager to review its own files to quickly uncover the names of \nindividuals who might have become citizens or permanent residents while \nthey were under investigation for terrorism-related activities.\n  After months of negotiations between my staff and the Department's \nstaff, I believed I had finally come up with a solution that addressed \nall of the Department's concerns.\n  On July 3--keep in mind how much more time has yet elapsed--I \nreceived a reply. Much to my astonishment, the answer once again was \nno.\n  Two new concerns were raised: First, when the FBI and the INS were \npart of the same overall Department of Justice, they could share \ninformation for this purpose legally; although, as we well know, they \ndidn't. Now that they are in two different departments, the Justice \nDepartment claims the Privacy Act prevents the sharing of this critical \ninformation.\n  The second reason advanced was the FBI simply did not have the time \nor resources to review its own files. Again, keep in mind how important \nit is for the Department to know how many people were in this situation \nwhere they were under investigation for terrorism and yet received \neither American citizenship or permanent residency. I would think the \nFBI, on its own volition, would be eager to retrieve that information.\n  At this point some of my Senate colleagues may be asking themselves a \nfew questions, if they have had some experience with congressional \noversight. First, hasn't the Justice Department many times in the past \nprovided Congress with information such as interview summaries and \ndocumentary evidence related to individuals who have been investigated \nbut not prosecuted? Second, does this refute the Justice Department's \nargument about a supposedly sacrosanct longstanding policy? Would such \na policy, if it existed and were adhered to as strictly as the Justice \nDepartment now asserts, exempt the Justice Department from effective \ncongressional oversight? The answer to these questions is obvious.\n  Although the Justice Department would not review its own files to \ndiscover the extent of this problem and to document whether terrorists \nhad been granted citizenship or permanent residency, its officials have \nindicated in writing to me that this likely occurred.\n  Let me expand on that point. The Justice Department is not refuting \nthe basic premise. In a July 3 letter I received from the Department, \nfrom which I want to quote, it says:\n\n\n[[Page S15949]]\n\n\n       We appreciate the Committee's interest in the question of \n     whether individuals were naturalized or received permanent \n     residence status while they were subjects of foreign \n     counterintelligence investigations and, in fact, we have \n     indicated in conversations with Committee staff our belief \n     that this likely occurred prior to September 11, 2001. We do \n     not have data to support this view, but based upon our \n     knowledge of how Bureau and then-Immigration and \n     Naturalization Services systems interfaced, we do not \n     dispute the premise.\n\n  This is serious. In other words, suspected terrorists most likely \nreceived citizenship or permanent residency in the country they swore \nto destroy because the FBI and the INS did not talk to each other. This \nis extraordinary.\n  During my negotiations with the Department of Justice, I had \nsuggested the Privacy Act concern the Department raised could be dealt \nwith if the FBI passed the sealed findings of their review through my \ncommittee which then could, in turn, pass the findings along to the \nBCIS. That wouldn't work, Justice said, because it would violate--you \ngot it--their longstanding policy against providing information to \nCongress about investigations that did not result in prosecution.\n  If you think we have been driving around in circles, you are right. \nThe Justice Department refuses to provide my oversight committee with \ninformation because of a ``longstanding policy.'' We suggest a way \naround that longstanding policy, and the Department cites the Privacy \nAct. We suggest a way to avoid the Privacy Act concerns, and we find \nourselves back to the longstanding policy.\n  This is simply unacceptable. We know some terrorists and supporters \nof terrorism seek out the protective guise of American citizenship. We \nknow a lack of coordination between the relevant agencies allowed this \nunacceptable situation to occur. What we don't know is how many times \nit has happened, how broad this problem is, how many people are \ninvolved and, most important of all, what has been done to stop it, to \nclose that communications gap.\n  The Committee on Governmental Affairs will pursue this matter by \ncontinuing its investigation. I have again written to the FBI Director \nto request the records needed by the committee. I have now focused my \nrequest on those individuals who were named in the NBC report. It is \nnot a burdensome request. It is not an onerous request. It is a request \nthat is very specific, time limited, and narrow in scope. There is no \nreason for the Department of Justice not to promptly turn over these \ndocuments to the committee.\n  I want to acknowledge those courageous FBI agents who wanted to do \nthe right thing, tried to do the sensible thing, who said: Let's share \nthis critical information, when they discovered suspected terrorists \nwere trying to become American citizens or permanent residents. It is \ndeeply disturbing that in some cases their supervisors did not listen \nto them. It is deeply disturbing that bureaucracy trumped national \nsecurity and common sense.\n  I invite those agents to step forward again to make their concerns \nknown by contacting my committee. We will listen, and we will act.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, the other day the distinguished majority \nleader came to the floor to call attention to the special contribution \nmade by a number of our pages who volunteered to stay beyond the time \nthat was originally scheduled for their experience in the Senate. I \nwanted to join with him in expressing our heartfelt gratitude to each \nof those pages, not only those pages who stayed as volunteers but to \nthose pages who have been with us this past session.\n  Pages play a very important role in the Senate. They are not only \nspectators to the democratic experiment, but they are real \nparticipants. Each of them becomes all the more adept at all of their \nresponsibilities as the session unfolds and they become students of \nGovernment in a unique and special way.\n  I have always been an admirer of our pages because of the great job \nthey do and the little attention they get. I hope they leave with an \nappreciation of Government.\n  When we have graduation for our pages, I oftentimes urge them to \nconsider this the first installment of their public experience. I urge \nthem to consider coming back, not only as members of the staff, but \nhopefully one day as elected Members themselves. I am absolutely \nconfident at some point some will.\n  I will never forget Senator David Pryor, Mark Pryor's father, telling \nthe story that when he was a page he left a penny in the Capitol and \npromised himself he would come back and pick up that penny as an \nelected official. He did. I think it was a testament to the dreams, \naspirations, and remarkable persistence that oftentimes our pages have.\n  As I noted, there are a number of pages who not only served the time \nthat was expected of them but stayed on afterward to accommodate the \nelongated Senate schedule. Many others offered to stay, but because \nthey had schedules that were in conflict were not able to. There are \nseven pages who stayed on until the last couple of days and in a couple \nof cases all the way up until today. Margaret Leddy, Melissa Meyer, \nKrista Warner, Yael Bortnick, Emily Holmgren, Farrell Oxley, and Sarah \nSmith all went above and beyond the call of duty. They all have served \nthe Senate in their capacity as pages superbly. I did not want this day \nor this session to end without publicly acknowledging their remarkable \ncontribution, the quality with which they did their work and the \ngratitude we have for the job they did.\n  Yesterday was Melissa Meyer's birthday. I wish her a happy birthday \nbesides, but to each of our pages--those who may still be here and \nthose who have gone, those who served--again let me express on behalf \nof the entire Senate our heartfelt thanks, our best wishes for a happy \nholiday season, and, perhaps most importantly, our sincere wish that \nthey come back again in some other capacity, because we need them.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier today I spoke briefly about the need \nto get our appropriations bills, many of which are now included in the \nso-called omnibus appropriations measure--some of us think it is an \n``ominous'' appropriations measure--passed prior to the end of calendar \nyear 2003. Among the things I pointed out were some very important \nmeasures. This body passed something called the Help America Vote Act, \nwhich I think focused attention on two very important problems. My \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle wanted to make sure we had \nup-to-date voting machines to make sure everyone who was entitled to \nvote could vote to remove barriers to voting. We supported that.\n  We also got support for something I thought was very important as \nwell, and that was to stop the rampant fraud that has come back as a \nresult of postcard registration.\n  I have the honor of representing an area that has probably the \ndubious distinction of being one of the vote fraud centers perhaps in \nthe universe. The city of St. Louis, as I have said many times before, \nis famous for voting rolls clogged with people registered one, two, \nthree, even four times; vacant lots with small cities worth of \nregistered voters; and even my favorite dog, Ritzy Meckler, a 13-year-\nold Springer Spaniel who was registered there.\n  We have had some great theological experiences. For the last general \nelection, a very prominent and outstanding alderman of the city of St. \nLouis registered to vote on the 10th anniversary of his death. It is a \nwonderful theological statement. It does not do much\n\n[[Page S15950]]\n\nfor me as a political scientist, but he registered by postcard.\n  After the 2000 election, when we found tremendous vote fraud problems \nin St. Louis, they had a mayoral election scheduled for the spring of \n2001. The last day of registration, 3,000 postcards showed up to \nregister voters for that election. It did not take long for observant \nelection officials to note that all of those cards appeared to be in \nthe handwriting of one or two people. They started checking and they \nfound that, lo and behold, there were a lot of phony people registered.\n  Terribly, the deceased mother of the prosecuting attorney of the city \nof St. Louis was registered to vote. This brought about some action. \nSeveral of the people involved in that little process came together and \ndecided to destroy the records. Since that time, I have read in the \npaper that the prosecuting attorney in St. Louis has filed significant \ncriminal indictments for those people.\n  However, I am proud to say that the St. Louis City election board is \nusing new laws passed in the State of Missouri to tighten up on these \npostcard registrations. Prior to the Help America Vote Act, you \ncouldn't even check on people who registered by mail. The process for \ngetting voters off the list, if they are improperly registered, was \nbyzantine, and took years to do. But under the Federal standards, there \nare still areas where these nonexistent or duplication voter \nregistrations can be made by mail.\n  We provided new powers and new responsibilities for local election \nofficials in the Help America Vote Act. We promised to fund them. So \nduring the process of debate on the appropriations bills, Senator Dodd \nof Connecticut, Senator McConnell of Kentucky, the Chair, and the \nranking member of the Rules Committee, when this passed, came to the \nfloor and I supported them. We got over $1 billion to fund the Help \nAmerica Vote Act. That languishes in the omnibus appropriations bill. \nThat money is necessary to support local efforts to carry out the \nmandates under the Help America Vote Act.\n  We all thought that once we passed that law we were going to ensure \nhonest elections in 2004, elections where everybody entitled to vote \ncould vote. The problem is, if we don't get around to passing the \nfunding for the Help America Vote Act until we come back next year, the \nprocess drags on and on and we are probably into March before the money \ngoes out--which is too late to make many of the changes and to build \nthe infrastructure and to buy the equipment that is needed to carry out \nthe requirements of the Help America Vote Act.\n  I have talked with other Senators about the many important measures \nthat are included in that Omnibus Appropriations Act. But I want to \ncall the attention of my colleagues to some further information that I \nhave developed about the Veterans Affairs budget.\n  Senator Mikulski and I fought long and hard to get the funding that \nwe needed to try to catch up to the backlog in the VA. People with \nservice-related injuries, permanent disabilities, low-income people, \nhomeless people, are being denied, for months, the ability to get in to \nsee a doctor because so many new enrollees have come into the system. \nThis body expanded the eligibility. We expanded the eligibility, but \nthe money has not kept up. So we are trying to play catchup, and there \nis an additional $2.9 billion above this year's funding level for the \nVA that cannot begin until the bill is signed. We are already a couple \nof months into the fiscal year 2004. We would be 6 or 7 months in \nbefore we could get funding if we wait until next year.\n  My staff tells me there are a number of other things that will \nhappen. Specifically, noninstitutional long-term care cannot be \nincreased. The VA has placed a high priority, providing a high quality \nof life, long-term care for each veteran. The VA planned to expand the \nprogram by over 20 percent this year because of the demand. The VA, \nwithout these funds, will not be able to expand the long-term care \nservices under the fiscal year 2003 funding authority.\n  Second, pharmacy costs will continue eating the budget. For fiscal \nyear 2003, pharmacy costs rose over 11 percent and the VA is incurring \nincreasing demands for prescriptions each month. The continuing rise in \ndemand for prescriptions is stripping funds from other priority areas \nas VA continues to operate under last year's funding levels.\n  Third, new community-based outpatient clinics will be curtailed. The \nVA has 48 high-priority community-based outpatient clinics ready to go \nthat can't move forward because they don't have the funds under the \ncontinuing resolution.\n\n  Finally and most important, and something I hope will be significant \nto each one of us here, the waiting lists will continue to lengthen. \nContinued operations under a continuing resolution will force VA to \ncurtail hiring of new physicians and nurses. The VA experiences about a \n1-percent normal attrition rate of physicians per month. By January, \nVA's waiting list will rise by over 10,000 from the projected level.\n  VA patients, who should be getting our top priority attention, are \ngoing to find the waiting list longer. That is why I renew my appeal to \nthe leaders on both sides to deal with the omnibus appropriations, to \ncome to some agreement, either to take this on UC, or take it by voice \nvote, with the distinguished chairman and ranking member on our side \nand the other side to come to closure on it, or, if need be, bring us \nback in session.\n  The House is going to come back into session on December 8, I \nunderstand, and vote on the bill. We have an obligation to come in--\neither if there is a unanimous consent agreement granted to do it by \nvoice vote or if there is not--and do what we are paid to do and that \nis to vote up or down and pass the appropriations that are so essential \nfor many areas where continuing resolution funding will be inadequate.\n  I urge the leadership to work on this. We need it in many areas.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Madam President, I, just very briefly, want to thank \npeople for a lot of hard work over the last several months.\n  Earlier today, we did pass a historic bill that is notable for the \nfact that it does help so many people in a very direct way. I think it \nis gratifying to all of us as U.S. Senators. But that outcome is made \npossible by a lot of hard work. I will be very brief, but I do want to \nthank the appropriate people. Again, I leave out so many people.\n  But, first, I thank the President of the United States. President \nBush does deserve credit for making this vision of being able to reach \nout and help people as soon as possible in a direct way with \nprescription drug coverage possible. That vision really did set the \ntemplate for all of us. We pulled together and passed this bipartisan \nbill.\n  Secretary Tommy Thompson, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, \nand Tom Scully, the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & \nMedicaid Services, spent literally hundreds of hours working on this \nlegislation.\n  I participated on the conference committee and had the wonderful \nopportunity of working side by side with them, consulting with them, \nseeking counsel, receiving their input.\n  In the Senate, Finance Committee chairman, Chuck Grassley, and \nranking member, Max Baucus, really did put partisanship aside from day \n1,\n\n[[Page S15951]]\n\nwhen we first started this Senate bill, and worked tirelessly from \nbeginning to end to deliver on the promise that we all have to the \nAmerican people. In large part it was accomplished because of their \nwork and their partnership in many ways.\n  Senator John Breaux deserves huge credit. I have worked with Senator \nBreaux over the last 7 years. There was a Breaux-Frist bill that came \nout of the Bipartisan Commission. He has demonstrated real leadership \nand, in my mind, has been at it in terms of the final product longer \nthan anybody in the Senate, working together on the model we ended up \nwith.\n  All members of the conference committee showed a degree of dedication \nand resolve that is seldom seen in either Chamber. There were Senators \nOrrin Hatch and Don Nickles and John Kyl. We simply would not have \nreached this point if we had not worked together with strong leadership \non the part of the conferees.\n  In addition, there were people such as Senators Jeffords, Gregg, \nHagel, Ensign, Wyden, and Snowe, who have focused on a tripartisan, \nbipartisan approach to health care reform, which has been instrumental \nin many ways.\n  Senators Bunning, Thomas, Smith, Lott, and Santorum all made huge \ncontributions working through the Finance Committee.\n\n  Members of this body who voted against final passage also contributed \nin remarkable ways to this product.\n  I do also want to mention, just in passing, the House leadership \nbecause the House leadership, especially Speaker Dennis Hastert and \nLeader Tom DeLay, deserve very special recognition. I worked very \nclosely, and our leadership worked very closely with them, especially \nin the final 2 weeks of that conference.\n  I had the opportunity to call yesterday Chairman Bill Thomas. He is \nreally the mind behind what we accomplished. He was able to assimilate \nvery complex policy and put it into a portrait that ultimately became \nthe substrate for this bill. He demonstrated real leadership, real \npatience.\n  Also, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Chairman \nBilly Tauzin, we simply would not be here without his active \nparticipation as well.\n  My dedicated staff--Dean Rosen, Elizabeth Scanlon, Rohit Kumar, and \nCraig Burton--put in hundreds of hours and poured over thousands of \ndetails. Lee Rawls, Eric Ueland, David Schiappa and his wonderful staff \nhere really made it possible.\n  So in closing, to everyone who worked so hard and have given so much \nof themselves, working hard on this effort, I thank them. I thank you, \nthe Senate thanks you, America thanks you, and, most of all, America's \nseniors thank you.\n  Madam President, I appreciate the Senator from New Jersey giving me \nthe floor for those few minutes. I look forward to listening to what he \nhas to say on a very important issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, first, I want to say thank you----\n  Mr. CORNYN. Will the Senator yield for a brief UC?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Sure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe remarks of the Senator from New Jersey--I believe he told me he \nwould speak for about 10 minutes or so--I be recognized for remarks \nthat I might make at that time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object, I wonder if the Senator might add to that UC--about how \nlong does the Senator plan to speak, so I could then try to amend that \nUC to place myself in order?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I would make my remarks no longer than \n15 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask the Senator if he would modify his \nunanimous consent request to allow the Senator from Michigan, and then \nI believe the Senator from Washington, to each have 10 minutes \nfollowing his remarks?\n  Mr. CORNYN. That is acceptable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. No objection, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I would just note that the gracious \nstatement of the Senator from Texas said ``10 minutes or so.'' I would \nhope, for clarification, if ``or so'' is 3 or 4 minutes longer, it will \nnot be a violation of the unanimous consent agreement that we just \nheard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15951-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COMMENDING THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.

We are all cognizant of the \nwonderful work that Dr. Frist has done in his time before the Senate \nand how he served populations so desperately in need. He took the risks \nand the time necessary to do that.\n  We all congratulate him for that, for his generosity of spirit, and \nhis skill as a surgeon and physician.\n  I have found on the rare occasions that I--I hope they are rare--\ncalled on Senator Frist for an ear, he was more than willing to lend \nit. If he disagreed, he said so. And if he agreed--even rarer--that was \ndone with dispatch and a straightforwardness which I greatly respect. I \nhope he and his family will enjoy the Thanksgiving holiday.\n  As we muse over what happened in the last week, since Senator Frist \nis a physician, I hope he can prescribe a way we can heal some of the \nbruises that occurred in this last contentious period.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15951-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15951-S15952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1602\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, it is about 26 months since the \nassault on our families, our people, and our invincibility that took \nplace at the World Trade Center, at the Pentagon, and in a field in \nPennsylvania where it was so heroically disrupted on its way to a \ntarget. Therefore, I am outraged that we can't find enough time to \nfurther pay attention to the memory of the 9/11 victims by passing a \nbill to extend the deadline for victims' families, enabling them to \napply for victims' compensation which is in a fund that was passed in \nthe Senate and passed in the House and that is about to expire.\n  Though we have just been through a difficult and contentious period \nwith some acrimony, no matter how much I or others might have agreed \nwith the outcome, our business for this year is not yet done. We are \nfacing the expiration of this compensation fund, and there are lots of \nfamilies who have yet to participate in this program that was designed \nfor them.\n  The need for this 9/11 victims bill is urgent. If we don't vote on it \nbefore Thanksgiving, this bill will become obsolete because the current \nfiling deadline is December 22, 2003.\n  We are reminded that a truly joyous part of the year is just \nbeginning. It starts with Thanksgiving, goes through to Christmas and \nHanukkah. It is just around the corner. A lone, anonymous Republican \nSenator is holding up a bill that would make these holidays less \nstressful for the 9/11 families. As we requested or will request in a \nunanimous consent request, the Senate must take up and pass this bill \ntoday in order to fulfill our commitments to compensate the victims' \nfamilies.\n  So far, out of approximately 3,000 killed, about 1,800 families, or \nonly 60 percent of those eligible, have filed claims on behalf of \nrelatives who were killed. This is far too low a percentage.\n  Helping the families of 9/11 victims is not just the responsibility \nof the Senators in the Northeast, it is a national commitment we made \nthat we owed to those who suffered on that tragic day. I am distressed \nby the fact that because of somebody in the majority, having just spent \n39 hours of time talking about a handful of judicial nominees, we can't \neven commit a few minutes today to take up a simple but critical bill \nand pass it.\n  The bill is vital to thousands of Americans who lost loved ones or \nwho were themselves injured in the 9/11 attacks. Many of these families \nwill mourn forever. Many of these families\n\n[[Page S15952]]\n\ncannot yet bring to closure the terrible tragedy that befell their \nfamilies. They are just not emotionally ready to begin the process of \nclosure by applying to the victims compensation fund while their grief \nis still surrounding them.\n  Imagine the Thanksgiving table without a son or a daughter or a \nmother or a father or a child. How sad that is. And we walk away from \nhere not yet completing the task.\n  I quickly point out, there are no additional funds required. Those \nfunds were allocated 2 years ago when the fund was established. It is a \nrather confusing application, 40 pages. The difference is, if one \napplies to the fund, there is a settlement available. But in some \ncases, it may seem better for them to resort to the courts. That is why \nwe have the system we have.\n  It is hard to proceed and leave here without trying to do something \nabout the condition in which we leave these families. We should help \nthem get through the holiday period and encourage them a little bit \nfurther.\n  The fund was estimated to cost $5 billion by Mr. Feinberg, who is the \nmaster in charge of the distribution. He is an outstanding lawyer who \ntook this job, volunteered to do it. He notes that only $1 billion out \nof $5 billion that might be required or available were expended. Many \nothers have been waiting. Some victims' families are non-native-English \nspeakers, working hard to understand, get people to help them \ncomprehend the application forms. Many others have been waiting to \nreceive the required information from their loved ones' former \nemployers in order to complete the forms.\n  S. 1602, the bill that Senator Leahy and I introduced, keeps our \npromise to the 9/11 victims' families by extending the deadline to \napply to the fund to the end of 2004, roughly a year from now. We are \nsimply giving these grief-stricken families some more time to fill out \nthis cumbersome application. Senators Boxer, Clinton, Corzine, Dodd, \nDurbin, Lieberman, and Schumer are cosponsors of this bill.\n  I think it is really unfair that the Republican majority will not \npermit us to just move this bill along. President Bush and other \nRepublicans were anxious to appear with the 9/11 families soon after \nthe tragedy to show that they shared in some way their grief and to try \nto alleviate their distress. Now the cameras are gone. We should not, \nhowever, forget that we have these obligations to these families. This \nbill is unfinished business with a deadline.\n  I had hoped the majority leader and my Republican colleagues would \nallow us to pay our respects to these families who need our help.\n  On September 11 of this past year, I spoke at an event in Central \nPark, NY, that was arranged by a company called Cantor Fitzgerald. They \nlost 700 of their 1,000 employees. One of those who perished was a very \nclose friend of my oldest daughter. They had worked together at another \nfirm. My daughter went to law school and her friend went to work for \nCantor Fitzgerald and was one of the 700 and left 3 young children and \na husband behind--so unwilling to believe that his wife, the mother of \nthese children, was taken away, that he visited hospitals in the area \nfor some time after the attack took place, hoping that there was an \nerror someplace, that he might find his wife, and that some way they \nwould be able to continue. But she is gone.\n\n  When I spoke to the people from Cantor Fitzgerald, about 4,000 people \nwere there. And, again, this company lost 700. The people they touched \nis a far greater number than the number who actually perished. They \nwere looking to us for some leadership, some recognition that they paid \na price for their sheer courage, many of whom died helping others, \nincluding the policemen and the fire personnel, the emergency \npersonnel.\n  There are all kinds of stories, including the one about the man who \nwalked up a flight to try to carry a woman down and both of them \nperished in the process. The stories are replete with heroism and \ncourage--but dying.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary Committee be discharged \nfrom further consideration of S. 1602 and that the Senate then proceed \nto its immediate consideration; that the bill be read the third time, \npassed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, without \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I object, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I know I have to surrender the \nmicrophone. I do it sadly, because I don't believe that the Senator \nfrom Texas, who raises the objection on behalf of the Republican Party, \nreally would object to extending a deadline--no more money and nothing \nelse has to be done except to say to these people that we have not \nforgotten. We remember that you died when America's invincibility was \nshattered. That is a day that will mark our coming and going forever. \nOne need only remember what happens every time you take your shoes off \nat the airport, or you are forced to show your ID, or you are searched \nwith a magnetic wand, or whatever, or the fence surrounding the \nWashington Monument so you cannot see it at ground level when you pass \nby on Constitution Avenue and fortresses are being built out there. \nThey did this to us and we are going to have to live with that.\n  I wish reconsideration would be taken here in a discussion with the \nmajority leader and the Senator from Texas, if he cares to be involved, \nand that we can pass that bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15952-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15952-S15954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     JUDICIAL CONFIRMATION PROCESS\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I wish to speak for the next few minutes \nabout the judicial confirmation process, now that we have passed the \nMedicare bill, which represents perhaps the single largest \naccomplishment of this session--a session filled with many important \naccomplishments. I want to revisit the judicial confirmation process \nbecause I think it is perhaps the one issue that has the greatest \npotential for constructive action in this body, and the one issue that \nhas the most potential for destruction of constructive action in this \nbody.\n  The American people have seen accusations fly back and forth in the \nSenate as we have observed partisan minority filibusters of President \nBush's judicial nominees. As a relatively new Member of the Senate, I \nhave no personal stake in these grievances over past perceived slights \nor actions. In fact, as the Chair knows, in April, all 10 freshmen \nSenators wrote a letter to the Senate leadership asking that we have a \nfresh start when it comes to the way we approach this process because, \nas we all know, any tactic or strategy used by a partisan minority now \nto obstruct President Bush's nominees, if successful, if allowed to \nproceed, will no doubt be sought to be used in the event a Democrat \ntakes the White House and Republicans find themselves in the minority \nof this body.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter we freshmen Senators wrote to \nthe leadership be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 30, 2003.\n       Dear Senators Frist and Daschle: As the ten newest members \n     of the United States Senate, we write to express our concerns \n     about the state of the federal judicial nomination and \n     confirmation process. The apparent breakdown in this process \n     reflects poorly on the ability of the Senate and the \n     Administration to work together in the best interests of our \n     country. The breakdown also disserves the qualified nominees \n     to the federal bench whose confirmations have been delayed or \n     blocked, and the American people who rely on our federal \n     courts for justice.\n       We, the ten freshmen of the United States Senate for the \n     108th Congress, are a diverse group. Among our ranks are \n     former federal executive branch officials, members of the \n     U.S. House of Representatives, and state attorneys general. \n     We include state and local officials, and a former trial and \n     appellate judge. We have different viewpoints on a variety of \n     important issues currently facing our country. But we are \n     united in our commitment to maintaining and preserving a fair \n     and effective justice system for all Americans. And we are \n     united in our concern that the judicial confirmation process \n     is broken and needs to be fixed.\n       In some instances, when a well qualified nominee for the \n     federal bench is denied a vote, the obstruction is justified \n     on the ground of how prior nominees--typically, the nominees \n     of a previous President--were treated. All of these \n     recriminations, made by\n\n[[Page S15953]]\n\n     members on boths sides of the aisle, relate to circumstances \n     which occurred before any of us arrived in the United States \n     Senate. None of us were parties to any of the reported past \n     offenses, whether real or perceived. None of us believe that \n     the ill will of the past should dictate the terms and \n     direction of the future.\n       Each of us firmly believes that the United States Senate \n     needs a fresh start. And each of us believes strongly that we \n     were elected to this body in order to do a job for the \n     citizens of our respective states--to enact legislation to \n     stimulate our economy, protect national security, and promote \n     the national welfare, and to provide advice and consent, and \n     to vote on the President's nominations to important positions \n     in the executive branch and on our Nation's courts.\n       Accordingly, the ten freshmen of the United States Senate \n     for the 108th Congress urge you to work toward improving the \n     Senate's use of the current process or establishing a better \n     process for the Senate's consideration of judicial \n     nominations. We acknowledge that the White House should be \n     included in repairing this process.\n       All of us were elected to do a job. Unfortunately, the \n     current state of our judicial confirmation process prevents \n     us from doing an important part of that job. We seek a \n     bipartisan solution that will protect that integrity and \n     independence of our Nation's courts, ensure fairness for \n     judicial nominees, and leave the bitterness of the past \n     behind us.\n           Yours truly,\n         John Cornyn, Lisa Murkowski, Elizabeth Dole, Norm \n           Coleman, Lamar Alexander, Mark Pryor, Lindsey Graham, \n           Saxby Chambliss, Jim Talent, John E. Sununu.\n\n  3aMr. CORNYN. Madam President, I, frankly, think it would be just as \nwrong for that to happen as I do for a partisan minority to stand in \nthe way of a bipartisan majority of the Senate, who stand ready to \nconfirm many of President Bush's fine nominees.\n  I guess just when you think this process cannot get any worse, it \ndoes. The credibility of this process has recently been called into \nquestion by the disclosure of several internal memos written for \nDemocratic Senators on the Judiciary Committee.\n  Madam President, as the Chair knows, and as all Members of this body \nknow, there is currently an investigation ongoing by the Sergeant at \nArms into the circumstances under which these memos became public to \ndetermine whether there was any wrongdoing in obtaining those memos, \nand, of course, we must withhold judgment until that investigation is \ncomplete and the facts are made known to the Members of this body. I \ntrust we will do whatever the law and justice requires, and that we \nwill follow the truth, wherever it may lead in the investigation and \ntake appropriate action. I certainly support that.\n  These memos are available on the Web at http://\nfairjudiciary.campsol.com.\n  The fact is, these memos have now entered into the public domain, and \nI think it is important that we address these memos and what, in fact, \nthey confirm about the obstruction and destructive politics that have \ntaken hold of the judicial confirmation process and which have left me \nconcerned that there is no foreseeable end to the current gridlock.\n  Let me go over a few of the examples. You will see here on this chart \nto my left, one internal memorandum, dated November 2001. It was \nreported that liberal special interest groups urged Senate Democrats to \noppose the nomination of Miguel Estrada ``because he has a minimal \npaper trail, he is Latino, and the White House seems to be grooming him \nfor a Supreme Court appointment.''\n  Such comments discredit the claim made by those who object to this \nnomination and who oppose Miguel Estrada's confirmation to the DC \nCircuit Court of Appeals and who say that ethnicity played no part in \ntheir obstruction. This memo stands in stark contrast to that claim. \nBut the one thing I hope we can all agree to is that the Senate should \nnot make any decisions about judicial nominees, or anyone else, period, \nbased on their ethnicity or their race. Such actions demean not only \nthis body but all of us, and the American people did not elect us to do \nany such thing.\n  Yet this memo makes clear--or at least adds credence to the argument \nthat but for his ethnicity Miguel Estrada would be on the Federal bench \ntoday.\n  In another memo, dated November 7, 2001, Democratic staff asked the \nquestion, ``Who to fight?'' Which of President Bush's judicial nominees \nshould be opposed? The answer: Texas Supreme Court Justice Priscilla \nOwen. Why? Because `` . . . she is from Texas and was appointed to the \nSupreme Court by Bush, so she will appear parochial and out of the \nmainstream.''\n  I served for 4 years on the Texas Supreme Court with Priscilla Owen. \nI know Priscilla Owen. It is obvious to me that the people who wrote \nthis memorandum do not.\n  Nevertheless, they decided to use the terms ``parochial'' and ``out \nof the mainstream,'' and to suggest that simply because she was from \nTexas, she could be cast in an ignorant and unfair stereotype, which \nshould never be appropriate, even in discussing judicial nominees.\n\n  I believe firmly that these nominees should be judged on their \nmerits, not on their home State, and certainly not on the basis of any \nignorant or ill-informed stereotype.\n  An April 2002 memorandum indicates some Democrats wanted to delay \njudicial nominees, not because of any lack of qualifications but \nbecause they wanted to influence the outcome of particular cases, a \nvery troubling suggestion.\n  According to one memorandum, Elaine Jones of the NAACP Legal Defense \nFund would like the committee to hold off on any Sixth Circuit nominees \nuntil the University of Michigan case regarding the constitutionality \nof affirmative action and higher education is decided en banc by the \nSixth Circuit. The memo writer appears to have understood that such \ntactics were highly improper but chose to proceed with those plans \nanyway. The memorandum expressed concern about the propriety of \nscheduling hearings based on the resolution of a particular case but \nwent on to say, ``nevertheless, we recommend that Sixth Circuit nominee \nJulia Scott Gibbons be scheduled for a later hearing.''\n  Even acts that are widely recognized as improper and inappropriate \nseem to have become fair game for obstructionists today.\n  Not only have we seen obstruction, we have seen destruction when it \ncomes to the reputation of the nominees who have been proposed by the \nPresident by the use of vicious ad hominem character attacks. In \npublic, leading Democrat Senators have called this President's judicial \nnominees everything from turkeys to neanderthals, to kooks, to selfish, \ndespicable, and mean.\n  In memos, Democrats--the ones in the minority who obstruct the \nPresident's consideration of his nominees--seem to scrape the bottom of \nthe barrel when it comes to vituperation, describing these widely \nrespected nominees as alternately ugly, heartless, and even, as was \nreported in today's edition of the Washington Times, Nazis. This \nlanguage is deplorable and simply has no place in the Senate.\n  After reading these offensive memos, we cannot, nor should America, \nharbor any further illusions about what is going on here. The current \nmistreatment of nominees is not politics as usual, it is politics at \nits worst and exposes those who would march in lockstep with \nideologically driven special interest groups whose main purpose is to \ndefeat these nominees--and not just defeat them but destroy their \nreputation.\n  I am sad to say that as long as these tactics continue without the \ncondemnation they deserve, we will see only further degradation and a \ndownward spiral of the judicial confirmation process. In the end, we \nall know who will pay the price. It is the American people who will pay \nthe price.\n  Just so we understand why this is so critical to this process, why \nthese memos, and what they reveal is so unfortunate and deplorable, in \none of the memos it was made clear that one of the special interest \ngroups that was monitoring this process would ``score this vote in the \n2003 Congressional Record.'' In other words, these special interest \ngroups are not only dictating the tune, expecting Senators to dance to \nthat tune, but told that if they do not, they will be punished because \ntheir vote will be scored in mass mailings and advertising and other \npublications issued by the various special interest groups in the next \nelection. This reveals something that should be very disconcerting to \neveryone and certainly to the American people.\n  The question that perhaps people who are paying attention, if there \nare people paying attention to my remarks today, would ask is: So what? \nWhat\n\n[[Page S15954]]\n\ndoes this mean? Why should we care? In the brief moments remaining, I \nwill address why the American people should care and why we should \ncare.\n  We have too often seen an unelected, lifetime-tenured judiciary make \ndecisions based on dubious constitutional grounds that would never \nenjoy the support of the vast majority of the American people. Just one \nthat comes to mind is a recent ruling of the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals saying that the words ``under God'' in the Pledge of Allegiance \nmay not be uttered in classrooms because it violates the \nfirst amendment separation of church and state.\n\n  That does not make any sense. It certainly cannot be the law. Yet we \nhave lifetime-tenured judges who are stating that as if it were the \nlaw. Thank goodness that decision will be reviewed, and I hope \nexpeditiously reversed, by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  We have all sorts of strange things happening today. One recent \narticle caught my attention: When current Supreme Court Justices in a \nrecent speech said the decisions of other countries' courts should be \npersuasive authority in America's courts when interpreting what our law \nis, we ought to look to the law of the European Union or other \ncountries, perhaps, to guide these American judges in interpreting \nAmerican law and the American Constitution. Justice Breyer recently \nfound useful, in interpreting the American Constitution, decisions by \nthe Privy Counsel of Jamaica and the Supreme Courts of India and \nZimbabwe. Later, Justice Kennedy of the United States Supreme Court \ncited a decision of the European Court of Human Rights in a decision \nhanded down this month. Justice Ginsburg, joined by Justice Breyer, \ncited a decision by the International Convention on the Elimination of \nAll Forms of Racial Discrimination in a recent case. It goes on and on.\n  Anyone who is paying attention to what Federal judges are doing today \nand what they view in terms of their obligation to interpret the law \nhave to ask the question: What is going on? What would James Madison, \nAlexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson--what would our Founding Fathers \nsay about what is happening in our Federal Judiciary today? We all know \nthe answer. They would be shocked. We should be shocked as well.\n  Finally, this is an important debate because this determines what \nkind of country we are and what kind of country we will become. My hope \nand prayer is that in the intervening 2 months, when we come back, this \ndebate will take on a new civil tone, we will deplore and avoid these \ntactics of the past and embrace the fresh start we so earnestly sought \njust a few short months ago.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, after the Senate adjourns for the year, \nthe plan is for the Senate to reconvene on January 20 of next year. \nUnless Congress acts to extend Federal unemployment benefits, the so-\ncalled Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Program, before we \nadjourn, hundreds of thousands of unemployed Americans face the \nholidays with the prospect of losing their unemployment benefits on \nJanuary 1. This lack of action would put us in exactly the same \nsituation as last year: going home to our loved ones without helping \njobless Americans during the holiday season.\n  At a minimum, we should extend the current Federal Unemployment \nAssistance Program for 6 months. At a minimum, we should stand by \nAmerica's workers and help the unemployed during this holiday season.\n  According to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, in January, \nabout 90,000 current unemployed workers are likely to exhaust their \nregular State benefits each week. Absent congressional action, starting \nJanuary 1 next year, workers who exhaust their regular State benefits \nwill no longer be eligible for the additional Federal benefits. The \nonly people who will continue to receive those benefits will be those \nwho have begun to receive their Federal benefits by January 1.\n  This chart shows where we are in terms of the Federal benefits. In \nthe recession of 1974-1975, there were Federal benefits accumulating to \n29 weeks. That is in addition to the 26 weeks of State benefits. In the \n1981-1982 recession, again, 29 weeks of Federal benefits. In the 1990-\n1991 recession, 26 weeks of Federal benefits. Currently, until December \n31 of this year, there will be 13 weeks of Federal benefits that are \noffered in addition to the 26 weeks in each of our States. That is what \nwill disappear December 31.\n  This is a very modest program we have going. This is half of what we \nhave done in the prior two recessions in terms of Federal benefits, \nslightly less than half of what we did in the recessions of 1974-1975 \nand 1981-1982, but exactly half of what we did in the 1990-1991 \nrecession.\n  Currently, we only have 13 weeks of Federal benefits. This is going \nto run out on December 31 unless we act before we leave.\n  Some contend the issue of whether or not to extend the program and in \nwhat form can be dealt with when we return on January 20. I believe, \nhowever, by the time January 20 rolls around, it is going to be too \nlate. In fact, we know it will be too late for thousands of unemployed \nwho will have exhausted their benefits. So action is needed today. It \nis needed now or else this Federal benefit program, which is a modest \nprogram--again, I emphasize, half of what we have done in prior \nrecessions--unless this is reauthorized today, it is going to run out \nand hundreds of thousands of unemployed Americans are going to see \ntheir benefits exhausted without the benefit of the Federal program.\n  In the month of January alone--this coming January--as many as \n400,000 unemployed workers are going to exhaust their State benefits if \nwe don't act.\n  The number of long-term jobless--that is the people who have been \njobless 6 months or more--grew in October to over 2 million workers for \nthe first time since this recession began. That represents an increase \nof over 700,000 workers compared to March 2002 when the current Federal \nunemployment program was most recently authorized.\n\n  The Federal extended benefits program which was implemented in the \nlast recession did not end until the economy had added nearly 3 million \njobs to the prerecession level. The current unemployment program is \nscheduled to end, although there are 3 million fewer private sector \njobs than when this recession began.\n  Renewing this Temporary Emergency Unemployment Compensation Program, \nthis Federal benefits program, is essential under these circumstances. \nThe comparison on this chart is dramatic between what we did in prior \nrecessions and this recession.\n  In prior recessions, we had twice the level of Federal benefits as we \ndo now. We have a modest 13 weeks, half the level, and in the prior \nrecession we waited to end the Federal program until millions of new \njobs had been created.\n  Unless we act today, we will have lost 3 million jobs and still will \nbe ending a Federal program which is so critically essential to those \npeople who are unemployed.\n  The Department of Labor's announcement that 125,000 jobs were created \nin October and that the unemployment rate dropped to 6 percent, the \nfirst decline since I don't know how long--I don't have the exact date \nhere, but in a long time--presents a glimmer of hope. It is a glimmer \nof hope at least in some places, but in my home State of Michigan the \nunemployment rate is 7.6 percent.\n  We, like most other States, are very dependent upon a minimum level \nof unemployment benefits. It would be unconscionable for this Congress \nto leave without renewing this program.\n  Factory employment in America declined for the 39th consecutive month \nby eliminating approximately 24,000 manufacturing jobs. So even though \nwe had that slight increase in jobs in October, for the first time \nreally, we are seeing a slight up-tick in the total number of jobs. We \nhave at least some jobs being created. In the manufacturing sector, for \nthe 39th consecutive month, we lost tens of thousands of manufacturing \njobs.\n  America's manufacturing core has shed an average of over 50,000 jobs \na month for the last 12 months. These manufacturing jobs, which build \nand sustain America's middle class, are disappearing. A total of over \n2.5 million\n\n[[Page S15955]]\n\nmanufacturing jobs have been lost in the last few years. These are jobs \nthat are good paying jobs, provide good health benefits and good \nretirement security. We simply cannot afford to let these jobs leave \nour country or be lost for good.\n  In the meantime, while we are fighting the battle for manufacturing \njobs, we should not go home for the holidays having failed to act to \nmaintain the very modest Federal unemployment benefits program. I know \nthere are many in this body who are determined to see us have the \nopportunity to act to extend this program before we leave for the \nrecess.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15955-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15955-S15956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1839\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise to echo the comments of the \nSenator from Michigan. I think it critically important that Congress \nnot adjourn for the year without addressing unemployment benefits for \nAmericans who, unfortunately, have been out of work for some time now.\n  The Senator from Michigan is very conscious of the fact that his \nState, with 7.6 percent unemployment, has not seen much economic relief \nin this jobless recovery. I can tell him that the State of Washington \nhas seen very little relief, as we are at 7 percent unemployment rate. \nThe States around us--Oregon is at 7.6 percent unemployment; Alaska is \nat 7.3 percent unemployment--also continue to suffer.\n  The Pacific Northwest has been very hard hit by the downturn in our \neconomy. While some people would like to say that is part of the \nprocess, I would argue that losing jobs in the aerospace industry after \n9/11--35,000 jobs just at Boeing alone--is no fault of individual \nworkers.\n  I guarantee you, individual workers in my State would rather have a \npaycheck than an unemployment check. But if they are not getting an \nunemployment check, if they do not have the ability to take care of \nmortgage payments and other bills, it affects our overall economy. That \nis why for a long period of time, not only have people believed that \nthose who pay into unemployment benefits should get a package for \ntaking care of them during downturns in our economy but they also think \nunemployment benefits are a great stimulus for an economy that is \nsagging.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to refuse to \nbring up an extension of unemployment benefits. That means by that \nDecember 31 of this year, some 90,000 unemployed people per week will \nexhaust their regular benefits. That means in the first 6 months of \n2004 there may be as many as 2 million people affected by this loss of \nbenefits.\n  This issue is so important to me because we were in this same \nsituation last year. This side of the aisle said, given that this \ncountry has lost so many jobs, we must do something to take care of \nlaid off workers. We must extend the Federal unemployment benefits \nprogram. We were successful in convincing the Senate, with Senator \nNickles' help, to pass a bill out of the Senate extending unemployment \nbenefits, but the Republicans in the House refused to take up the \nmeasure and people in my State were without unemployment benefits at \nthe end of the year.\n  If somehow my colleagues think that people didn't make very tough \ndecisions because we left them without any guarantee that the program \nwould continue, they did. I had constituents who took money out of \ntheir pension plans--at a 30 percent penalty--at the end of December to \nlive on because they thought their benefits had been exhausted. They \nwere forced to trade off long-term security for short-term economic \nneed, only because the Federal Government did not stand up and do its \njob.\n  We had a similar situation in the 1990s in which we had high \nunemployment. What did we do to act responsibly? For 30 months, the \nFederal program offered to unemployed Americans a richer benefit than \nwe are offering today--20 weeks in the 1990s, compared to 13 weeks \ntoday. Well, guess what was different in the 1990s. During that time \nperiod, 2.9 million net jobs were created. Since this recession \nstarted, we've lost 2.4 million jobs.\n  The 1990s recession covered both a Republican administration--the \nfirst Bush administration--and a Democratic administration. Both those \nadministrations committed--for 30 months, and with a richer Federal \nprogram of 20 weeks--to take care of Americans until this economy \nrecovered. As the economy recovered and 2.9 million new jobs were \nadded, then we ended the program.\n  How do our actions today compare to that recession? Well, we have \nonly had 22 months of this program, so it has not lasted as long as the \nprevious program of Federal unemployment benefits. It has been 8 months \nshorter. The benefits are less, only 13 weeks instead of 20. So it is \nnot as rich a program.\n  The bottom line is what has happened to our jobs during the time \nperiod. In this time period, instead of adding 2.9 million jobs, we \nhave actually lost 2.4 million jobs. So if the argument is that it's \ntime to stop the Federal extension program when new jobs have been \ncreated and Americans are going back to work, then obviously 22 months \nhas not been enough. People are not going back to work. We have lost \n2.4 million jobs. If somebody thinks it is time to cut off this \nprogram, they are dead wrong. To do this, going into the holiday \nseason, is just like giving American workers a lump of coal in their \nstocking. It's like saying, no, thank you, for the hard work you have \nprovided to American companies in the past and for paying into the \nunemployment insurance system.\n  It is totally irresponsible for us, as a legislative body, to pass \nall of these tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, do all of these \nprograms for special interests, give subsidies, and then leave American \nworkers without the benefit program that was designed to help them in \neconomic downturns.\n  This is not a Republican or Democrat issue. We have had a Republican \nadministration and a Democratic administration--the first Bush \nadministration and the Clinton administration--who said this is a great \npolicy, but somehow this policy is now falling on deaf ears. During the \n1990s, when we ran this program for 30 months at richer benefits, we \nhad an improvement in the unemployment rate of 1.2 percent before we \nended the program. It was yet another sign, in addition to the 2.9 \nmillion net jobs added that it was time to end the program.\n  As I said earlier, we have lost 2.4 million jobs during this time \nperiod and the unemployment rate has improved less than 1 percent--only \n.4 percent. So we do not have the data, we do not have the evidence \nthat things are getting better. And yet somehow now, even though we \ncannot demonstrate that things are really getting better for workers, \nsome people on the other side of the aisle want to hedge their bets and \nsay, too bad for you. And they want to say this at the end of the year \nthe holiday season, when people are making some of their most important \nfinancial decisions and expenditures.\n  I think it is outrageous. It is outrageous that this body is so cold \nhearted to the hard-working men and women of America. Let's remember \nhow we got into this situation. Through no fault of their own, and in \nparticular for New York and Washington State, resulting from the \nunfortunate circumstances of 9/11 and downturns of specific industries \nas a result of that--laid-off workers are being left high and dry.\n  Somehow we want to put American workers out in the cold just because \na very tragic event happened to us at the national level? We do not \nwant to say to those companies and to those individuals, we understand \nthe hard economic times they have fallen on? That is what the Federal \nunemployment extension program is about.\n  There are additional reasons we are crazy not to extend this program. \nOne is that we have yet to see the economic results we want. \nUnemployment insurance is an economic stimulus. For every dollar spent \non unemployment benefits, it generates $2.15 of economic stimulus. I \nargue that one of the best economic stimulus programs we have had in \nthe last 22 months has likely been Federal unemployment benefits. These \nbenefits have allowed millions of Americans to make their house \npayments, to pay their medical bills, to\n\n[[Page S15956]]\n\npay for the various essentials they need to do to exist. And that is \nwhat they are basically doing. They are just getting by. They are just \ngetting by until new jobs are created.\n  I say to the administration: Where are all of these new jobs? The \nbottom line is still 2.4 million jobs lost. If the administration wants \nto curtail this economic program, at least stand up and be as \nresponsive as the last two administrations were and create the new \njobs. In that recession, 2.9 million jobs were created and so, of \ncourse, Americans could go back to work and, of course, they could get \noff the Federal program.\n  We have a big challenge before us. And although this bill does not \ndirectly address this, we must recognize that parts of our economy are \nretooling. Parts of our economy are demanding a more creative approach \nto jobs that are lost as industries are transitioning. It will take \nalmost 2 years to regain the jobs we have lost. Why not prop up our \neconomy by adding needed stimulus? Why not give American workers a \nreturn on a program they paid into, and why not honor them by admitting \nthey would rather have job creation than unemployment checks and get \nabout going back to stimulating our economy with real job creation?\n  None of that is happening. We are all now about ready to adjourn to \nsome date uncertain. I do not know if it is January or a sooner time, \nbut America was listening last year. At the holiday season, as December \n31 rolled around, Americans were furious that this program was being \ncurtailed. People made very serious decisions. Why make them live \nthrough those circumstances again and then come back in January or \nFebruary? After we have all made it clear this was a program that was \nmuch needed, why not do the responsible thing now and pass these \nunemployment benefits.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Finance Committee be discharged from \nfurther consideration of S. 1839 and that the Senate then proceed to \nthe immediate consideration of that legislation; that the Cantwell \namendment, which is at the desk, be considered and agreed, and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that the bill, as \namended, be read three times, passed, and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). On behalf of the leadership, in my \ncapacity as the Senator from the State of Idaho, I object.\n  The objection is heard.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I do not know how many more objections we are going to \nhear before we give American workers their right to unemployment \nbenefits. We need to own up to the fact that this body cannot pass tax \ncuts for the wealthiest, incentivize other programs, and then not take \ncare of our obligation to workers in America--all of whom would, in the \nend, certainly rather have a paycheck.\n\n  I hope this body will come to its senses, address this very important \nissue, and not leave any Americans at the end of the year without the \nresources to pay their bills and without helping them be an effective \npart of our economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I rise to honor the Screaming Eagles of \nthe 101st Airborne, Air Assault Division, based at Fort Campbell, KY. \nAs you all know, two Black Hawk helicopters from the 101st Airborne \ncollided in the night sky over Mosul, Iraq on November 15, 2003. \nTragically, all 17 soldiers on board the helicopters perished in the \nincident. This last Saturday, two additional soldiers from the Division \nwere killed while they patrolled the streets of Mosul.\n  These tragic incidents bring the total number of Screaming Eagles \nlost in Iraq to 55. My prayers and deepest sympathies go out to the \nfamilies and friends of these brave Americans.\n  Last month, in one of the most moving experiences of my career, I met \nwith some of these soldiers in Mosul, where the 101st is responsible \nfor keeping the peace in the northern part of Iraq.\n  These heroes shared with me their thoughts about America's struggle \nto bring peace and security to a long-oppressed nation, and their \npatriotism and passion for their mission shone through the dust and \ngrime that accumulates with sustained operations far from the comforts \nof home.\n  Truth be told, I did not expect to encounter the extraordinary high \nlevels of dedication and morale I witnessed in Mosul and elsewhere in \nIraq. Throughout that country, I conversed with soldiers who witnessed \nfirst-hand the reality of war, and who knew friends injured or killed \nin combat.\n  It was obvious that the thoughtful young men and women I met in Iraq \nhave spent long hours coming to grips with these harsh realities, yet \nremain committed to their mission and deeply believe that what they are \ndoing is right and just. An example: at the 101st Airborne's \nheadquarters in Mosul, I witnessed a video that detailed the Division's \noperations in Iraq. The moving video is dedicated to--and features \nfootage of--Screaming Eagles who have lost their lives during the \nliberation of Iraq, and it is clear these lost heroes are never far \nfrom the thoughts of the soldiers of the 101st. Indeed, these heroes \nremain a source of poignant motivation for their comrades.\n  For our Armed Forces, sad memories of fallen colleagues are \ninescapable, but so too is the evidence that the Screaming Eagles are \non the right side of history. From water coolers in Washington, DC to \nNew York City newsrooms, many of us forget that our troops were present \nat the moment Iraq was liberated from the tortuous grip of Saddam \nHussein. They have since witnessed firsthand the birth of a democratic \nprocess and the reawakening of a people enslaved for generations by \nfear and oppression. The Screaming Eagles have worked side by side with \nIraqis to help rebuild a shattered country, and their joint success in \nthis regard is truly remarkable.\n  The brave soldiers I met in Mosul know America is in Iraq for the \nright reasons, and that despite setbacks and tragic incidents we are \nwinning the peace in Iraq, just as surely as we won the war.\n  At one point during my visit, one of the Screaming Eagles came up to \nme and introduced himself as a captain who hailed from my hometown of \nLouisville. In the entryway of one of Saddam's former palaces--now \nserving as the 101st Airborne's division headquarters--he presented me \nwith a flag of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and recalled how he \nbrought it with him as the division left Fort Campbell and fought north \nfrom Kuwait, up through Baghdad, and on to Mosul.\n\n  This captain spoke with well-earned pride about the role he and his \nfellow soldiers played in liberating the Iraqi people and winning the \nwar. And he spoke of the progress they were making in winning over the \nhearts and minds of these newly free people by treating the Iraqis with \na level of dignity and respect they have not received for generations.\n  While in Mosul, I met with the newly elected governing council of \nIraq's Nineveh Province, and I can tell you that the respect and \nappreciation these democratically elected leaders have for the U.S. \nefforts is ample evidence the Screaming Eagles are indeed winning the \nhearts and minds of the Iraqi people.\n  Indeed, both this democratically elected new government and that \nyoung captain would want us all to understand that America did the \nright thing to help 25 million Iraqis to realize a life without fear. I \ncan assure you that this captain and his fellow soldiers--although \nmindful of the great risks and danger inherent in their work--are \ncommitted to finishing the job by winning the peace and helping the \nIraqis to get back on their feet.\n  I keep this soldier's flag--still covered in dust and dirt from its \nhistoric travels--in my office as a reminder that when America sets out \nto accomplish a difficult task, it finishes the\n\n[[Page S15957]]\n\njob. And when I hear discouraging or saddening news from Iraq, I think \nof this young captain's dedication to this mission, and know that \nAmerica must--and will--stay the course.\n  Mr. President, the entire Fort Campbell community grieves the loss of \nevery single Screaming Eagle, and we long to welcome the division home \nto the fertile farmland of western Kentucky.\n\n  But when the division returns to Kentucky, it will have left an \nindelible mark on the memories of the people of northern Iraq. The \n101st has treated the Iraqi people with respect and honor. They have \nacted not as occupiers, but as allies to the victims of Hussein's \nbrutal reign. When the Screaming Eagles come home, Iraqis will see \ntheir legacy around every corner: in the hundreds of newly refurbished \nschools, in the electricity that now is available 24 hours a day, in \nthe swimming pool renovated for Iraqi kids by the division, in the \nrepaired irrigation canals that bring water to the wheat fields near \nMosul, in the soccer fields that are no longer killing fields, and in \nthe proud Iraqis now patrolling the streets of a free Iraq as policemen \nrespectful of the human rights and dignity of their fellow citizens.\n  Mr. President, Iraq is now free--and an evil despot no longer \nthreatens the United States and his neighbors--because of the selfless \nactions of the individual soldiers of units like the 101st Airborne. I \npray that the families of those Americans who have lost their lives in \nthis conflict find comfort and solace in their time of need. Their \nloved ones are American heroes, and I will never forget their \nsacrifice.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as the first session of the 108th \nCongress draws to a close, the score of accomplishments of this Senate \ncomes into clearer view. By any historical comparison, this Senate's \nrecord of accomplishments is remarkable. But when one considers the \nslender majority that this party holds in the Senate, and the numerous \nunforeseen challenges that have risen, the record of accomplishments is \ntruly extraordinary.\n  Our efforts, the efforts of this Senate in the first session of the \n108th Congress, have improved the security of America and the lives of \nall Americans in significant ways.\n  While the homeland and national security of America has been \nstrengthened, the economic and retirement security of all Americans has \nalso dramatically improved.\n  America's security has benefited from the first funding of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, the confirmation of the first \nSecretary of Homeland Security, full funding of the war on terrorism, \npassage of a modern-day Marshall plan for Iraq, and passage of both the \nDefense authorization and appropriations bills.\n  The security of the American people in their work and their \nretirement has dramatically improved as well. The economic growth \npackage passed earlier this year has pushed the economy to the highest \nquarterly growth rate in almost 20 years, while the promise of \nprescription drugs for our seniors on Medicare, thwarted for 38 long \nyears, is just hours--just hours--away from becoming the law of the \nland with the stroke of the President's pen.\n  These major legislative victories have been as demanding as they have \nbeen time consuming. Yet that did not stop the majority leader from \ngetting the work of the people done.\n  In an extraordinarily tenacious manner that should make all \nTennesseans proud, our leader, Bill Frist, confronted not just the \nchallenges of last year's business but also the present demands of the \nwar on terrorism.\n  As I think back on the first year of Senator Frist's position as our \nleader, I think we can all feel extraordinarily proud of his many \naccomplishments in holding this somewhat fractious body together in \norder to advance the agenda.\n  The Senate, as we all know from working here, and as many Americans \nknow from studying the history books, was basically constructed not to \nfunction very well or certainly not very quickly. At one time or \nanother, virtually every Senator takes advantage of that opportunity. \nThen you add on top of that the fact that the American people dealt a \nvery narrow majority to the majority party.\n  Many thought at the beginning of the year the prospect of very much \nsuccess was quite limited indeed. But as you look back over the year, \nunder Senator Frist's extraordinary leadership, we have been able to \nmake enormous progress for the American people.\n  It all began back in January, when we had to pass 11 appropriations \nbills, uncompleted from the previous year. Under Senator Frist's \nleadership, we completed the emergency wartime supplemental \nappropriations bill. He brought to a successful conclusion the fires \nand NASA disaster supplemental appropriation. Then he pulled together \nthe conference to pass a very tough Iraq reconstruction supplemental \nappropriations bill--all of this in the past year.\n  Even though, as of today, it is not exactly clear when our remaining \nappropriations bills will be approved, what we can say is this: That \nunder Senator Frist's leadership, all but 1 of the 13 appropriations \nbills have gone through the Senate. Six bills are the law of the land \nand the remaining seven could be just hours away from being \nsuccessfully concluded, or might be concluded in a couple of weeks. \nBut, in any event, they are largely completed and are awaiting the \ndesire of the Senate to pass this omnibus report and move it along.\n  When that happens, the Senate will have passed 27 normal and \nsupplemental appropriations bills into law--not a bad year's work.\n  With this record on appropriations, with passage of the economic \ngrowth package, and with passage of the Medicare prescription drug \nbill, expecting anything more from this Senate would not be reasonable. \nBut in fact much more has been delivered to the American people by this \nSenate under the leadership of Senator Bill Frist. We have banned the \nhorrific practice of partial-birth abortion. We have passed the Do Not \nCall Registry at the Federal Trade Commission. We provided tax relief \nto military families. We passed the Healthy Forests Act to stop the \ncatastrophic wildfires we have witnessed raging across the western \nlands. I might say, the occupant of the chair, the Senator from Idaho, \nwas right in the middle of that debate from the beginning to the end, \nhelping steer it to a successful conclusion. I commend him for his \nextraordinary work on the Healthy Forests proposal.\n  We have enacted free trade agreements with Chile and with Singapore. \nThe Senate has passed the Federal Aviation Administration \nreauthorization to revitalize an air transport industry suffering from \nthe effects of the terrorist attack of 9/11. We pushed a comprehensive \nEnergy bill to within two votes of breaking a filibuster.\n  One thing we can say today: This is only the end of the first \nsession. We have a second session of the 108th to go. We have not given \nup on the prospect of getting an Energy bill. We are going to have a \nvery cold winter. We have the potential for blackouts, all kinds of \nproblems that could be dealt with substantially by the passage of this \nEnergy bill. I believe there will be two additional Senators who will \nsee their way to supporting an Energy bill something like the one we \ncurrently have before us in order to prevent America from having \nanother experience like we had last summer with the blackout.\n  After more than a decade of repression, the Senate has passed the \nBurmese Freedom and Democracy Act. In addition, we secured resources to \nimprove our Nation's elections systems and, hopefully, we will finish \nthe job through the omnibus appropriations bill currently being \nnegotiated. We made a commitment to our States to be a partner in this \nendeavor, and we took the first step to honor that commitment.\n  I want to linger a moment on this whole election reform issue. \nSenator\n\n[[Page S15958]]\n\nChris Dodd of Connecticut deserves an enormous amount of credit, as \ndoes Senator Kit Bond of Missouri. The three of us worked long and hard \nto produce an election reform bill, the theme of which was to make it \neasier to vote and tougher to cheat. There is, in the context of \npassing the final omnibus, an additional billion dollars going out to \nthe States to guarantee that we have the cleanest and the most \nefficient election in American history next November of 2004.\n  That money must get out the door, and that is another reason we need \nto wrap up this omnibus appropriation at the earliest possible moment. \nStates and localities all over America are waiting so they can \nimplement this mandate, which is a funded mandate--not an unfunded \nmandate, a funded mandate--only when the money gets to the States. The \nsooner we pass the omnibus, the sooner that will happen, and the more \nlikely it is that we will have the most honest, the most efficiently \nconducted election in American history next November of 2004.\n\n  Numerous other legislative accomplishments have been reached during \nthis session. Specifically, the Senate has passed the President's \nfaith-based initiative. We have funded the efforts to eradicate the \nscourge of global AIDS. We acted to guard our children against \nabduction and exploitation by passing the PROTECT Act. We improved \nsafeguards from foreign terrorists by enacting the FISA bill. We \nexpanded NATO to include almost all of the former Warsaw Pact \ncountries. We also passed a significant arms reduction treaty with our \nformer enemy, turned ally, Russia. We took steps to bridge the digital \ndivide by providing needed funds to historically Black colleges.\n  We awarded a congressional gold medal to U.K. Prime Minister Tony \nBlair and affirmed the constitutionality of using the term ``under \nGod'' in the Pledge of Allegiance.\n  We have a solemn responsibility to the American people to improve \ntheir lives, to protect their homeland, and build a future filled with \nhope and opportunity. This year, we have made excellent progress in \nfulfilling our obligations to the American people. Next year, it is our \nhope and intention to do even more.\n  Let me say in closing, again, how much I admire and how much all of \nus appreciate the extraordinary leadership of our majority leader, \nSenator Frist. He has been very skillful in advancing our legislative \nagenda in a body which is designed to thwart almost every initiative. \nHe has done it with a very narrow majority. So as we wrap up the first \nsession, plaudits to the leader, to all of our colleagues, not only on \nthe Republican side but throughout the Senate, who have worked \nextraordinarily hard this year.\n  We had 459 votes this year. We were doing a lot of voting on a lot of \nissues during the course of the year. In fact, we had more votes in the \nSenate this year than any time since 1995, the first year of the \nContract with America. We had a lot of very close votes, a lot of \ndramatic experiences in the Senate.\n  Back during the budget, we had three votes on which the Vice \nPresident had to break the tie in the chair. So for those who were \ninterested in drama and who typically think of the Senate as a place \nwhere you to go watch paint peel, there was a good deal of excitement \nthis year at various intervals in our legislative consideration.\n  I hope all Members will enjoy the Thanksgiving holiday and Christmas \nwith their families and come back to Washington refreshed to tackle the \nagenda that remains in the second session of the 108th Congress.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15958-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15958-S15959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        INTERNET TAX MORATORIUM\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, some of us are barely old enough to recall \nthe end of World War II. And we remember that it was an effort that \ninvolved the entire Nation in a monumental struggle against the evil of \nfascism.\n  During World War II the United States sent more than 250,000 nurses \nto the front lines to care for our wounded Allied troops.\n  By 1942, the country was experiencing a shortage of nurses for \ndomestic medical needs. In fact, the shortage was so severe that many \nclinics were forced to close.\n  To alleviate our domestic medical crisis, Congresswoman Frances Payne \nBolton introduced legislation creating the United States Cadet Nurse \nCorps in 1943. Over the next 5 years, the Corps recruited about 125,000 \nyoung women to assume the duties of nurses who had been dispatched to \nthe front lines. Throughout World War II, cadet nurses accounted for 80 \npercent of the nursing staff in our domestic medical facilities.\n  Cadet nurses completed rigorous training under the jurisdiction of \nthe Public Health service. They also pledged to serve at any time \nduring the war, at any hospital or clinic where they might be needed. \nThey were often required to leave their families and fill vacant \npositions across the country. They acted as both caregivers and medical \ndoctors--as there was also a scarcity of doctors--to the sick and \nwounded.\n  The Cadet Nurse Corps provided the support of health care system \nneeded. By putting the needs of the Nation ahead of their own, these \nyoung women made it possible for Allied troops to receive the best \npossible medical care during a time of war.\n  Although the uniforms of these dedicated cadet nurses were decorated \nwith patches certified by the Secretary of the Army, and they served \nunder the authority of commissioned officers, the Cadet Nurse Corps has \nnever been recognized as a military organization.\n  Today, many of these cadet nurses are no longer living. Those who do \nsurvive are in their seventies and eighties. Ironically, they are not \nentitled to use the veterans health care system, nor do they receive \nother benefits such as disability pay.\n  Even more important, they rarely receive the recognition they deserve \nfor their service to their country. And every year, as more of the \ncadet nurses pass away, it becomes too late to recognize them.\n  These women served their country in a time of war. I believe they \ndeserve to be recognized as veterans of that war effort. Therefore, I \nsupport veterans status for members of the Cadet Nurse Corps.\n  I have introduced legislation that would accomplish this goal. I hope \nmy colleagues will support this effort so we can finally properly \nrecognize the cadet nurses for their outstanding service to this \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15959-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SUPPORTING OUR TROOPS AND THEIR FAMILIES\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as we approach the Thanksgiving Day \nholiday, we as Americans have much for which to be thankful. Around \ndinner tables this year, there will be added joy of loved ones \nreturning home especially in the case for those families of members of \nour Armed Forces. Other homes may not be as joyful, as those who have \nchosen to defend their Nation are stationed abroad, particularly in \nIraq and Afghanistan. Both of these scenes will occur in my home State, \nNM.\n  We as a Nation are ever grateful to the men and women of our military \nand the families they leave behind to serve. Today, I rise in support \nof an important effort to assist these dedicated military personnel and \ntheir families.\n  The Armed Forces Relief Trust, AFRT, is a non-profit fund established \nto help ease financial burdens on our military personnel and their \nfamilies. With so many of our troops on extended overseas deployments, \nthe benefit provided by the Trust is needed more than ever.\n  Today nearly 140,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines are \ndeployed overseas in the war on terror. Thousands more are stationed \nabroad guarding our freedom. For the families left behind, the \nfinancial burden of caring for children and meeting other demands can \nbe a strain. And with an increased number of National Guardsmen and \nReservists currently overseas, the number of families facing such \nhardship is even greater.\n  In my own home State of New Mexico, many have been affected by the \nfrequent and lengthy deployments associated with the war on terror. \nMost recently, 60 National Guardsmen from the 515th Corps Support \nBattalion out of Springer, NM, were activated to support combat forces \nin Operation Iraqi Freedom. They join more than 900 other New Mexico \nGuardsmen already deployed worldwide, including those from the Army's \n717th Medical Company and the 720th Transportation Company--both from \nSanta Fe. And only recently did we welcome home to Las Cruces the 281st \nTransportation Company following its service in the Persian Gulf. These \nmany deployments from New Mexico represent what is happening all over \nthe country.\n  Clearly, many military members and their families face burdens that \nare compounded by months of separation and tight budgets. For example, \na soldier overseas might face the unexpected cost of airfare to attend \nhis father's funeral; a deployed airman's expectant wife might incur \ncosts for special medical care; or a sailor's child may need assistance \nto cover burdensome costs associated with attending college. These \nsituations are what the Armed Forces Relief Trust is designed to \naddress.\n  It seems to me that these are the sorts of things that we ought to be \ndoing to help boost the morale of our troops. Many endure months away \nfrom home and, in some cases, face the pressure of operating daily in a \ncombat zone. The kind of benefit provided by the Trust gives them some \npeace of mind and allows them to focus on their vital mission. I salute \nthe Military Aid Societies representing the Army, Navy, Air Force and \nMarine Corps for coming together to create the Armed Forces Relief \nTrust. Perhaps more importantly, I salute all those who have donated to \nthe Trust and are helping to ensure that the needs of our brave \nmilitary personnel and their dedicated families are being met.\n  As we all gather with our families this Thanksgiving and count our \nblessings, I believe we should remember our brave men and women in \nuniform, and consider supporting the Trust and its work to these \npersonnel and their families in need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15959-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15959-S15960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      AIR POLLUTION CLOSE TO HOME\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to ask my colleagues and \nthe American public some serious questions today--questions about air \npollution and its impacts closer to home.\n  Many of us listening today have children and grandchildren. How many \nof them have asthma? How many of us have taken children to the \nemergency room in the middle of the night, desperate to put a stop to \ntheir terrifying asthma attacks?\n  How many of the Nation's growing number of asthmatic children have to \ncarry inhalers to school, and wish they could run, play, and breathe \nfreely like the other kids?\n  How many Americans know young children who depend on their asthma \ninhalers to get safely through a simple game of baseball? Their asthma \nattacks could be some of the six hundred thousand caused by air \npollution every year.\n  How many of our own children or grandchildren yearn to play outdoors \nduring school recess, only to have their teachers warn them the air is \ntoo unhealthy?\n  How many of us have parents or siblings with emphysema? Or chronic \nlung disease? Reduced lung function, or lung cancer? Air pollution \ndecreases lung function and causes asthma and asthma attacks, lung \ndisease, emphysema, lung cancer, and heart problems.\n  Do Americans ever worry that their own lives may be shortened by \nthree or four years, just because the air is so dirty?\n  Sixty thousand people die prematurely in this country every year \nbecause of air pollution. It's hard to believe, isn't it? Let me put it \nanother way.\n  Air pollution is responsible for more deaths than breast cancer, \ncolon cancer, pancreatic cancer, skin cancer, prostate cancer, brain \ncancer, lymphoma, or leukemia.\n  Half of the deaths caused by air pollution are due to power plants \nalone. In\n\n[[Page S15960]]\n\nfact, power plant-related deaths are so numerous that they far \noutnumber drunk driving fatalities in all but one of the 15 dirtiest \nStates.\n  Have Americans ever wondered how close they live to a powerplant? A \nHarvard University study showed that those who live near powerplants, \nwho are often the poorer, less educated, uninsured, or minority \npopulations, tend to be the most affected by pollution. Fortunately for \nsome of us here, we are probably less vulnerable. We live further away, \nwe live more comfortably, and we have access to quality health care.\n  But does that sound like a fair and equitable distribution of the \nimpacts of pollution? Hardly.\n  Americans can experience pollution very differently. Although 58 \npercent of white Americans live in counties violating Federal air \npollution standards--an unacceptably high percentage--71 percent of \nAfrican Americans do. Even worse, twice as many African Americans die \nfrom pollution than whites. Does that sound like a fair allocation of \nthe impacts?\n  If these appeals do not strike a chord, perhaps the economic impact \nof all these health problems will.\n  I have mentioned before that over 30,000 premature deaths can be \nblamed on powerplant pollution every year. An EPA consulting firm using \nEPA methodology estimated that this loss of life hurts the U.S. economy \nby $170 billion each year. I ask unanimous consent that a table from \nthis firm's recent report be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  ESTIMATED ANNUAL HEALTH AND MORTALITY COSTS DUE TO PARTICULATE MATTER\n                       POLLUTION FROM POWER PLANTS\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     Attributable        Mean economic\n          Health effect                incidence            impact\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMortality.......................              30,100    $170,000,000,000\nChronic Bronchitis..............              18,600       6,130,000,000\nCOPD--Hospitalization...........               3,320          41,000,000\nPneumonia--Hospitalization......               4,040          59,000,000\nAsthma--Hospitalization.........               3,020          21,000,000\nCardiovascular--Hospitalization.               9,720         179,000,000\nAsthma ER Visits................               7,160           2,000,000\nAcute Bronchitis................               59,00           3,000,000\nUpper Respiratory Symptoms......             679,000          16,000,000\nLower Respiratory Symptoms......             630,000          10,000,000\nAsthma Attacks..................             603,000          25,000,000\nWork Loss Days..................           5,130,000         543,000,000\nMinor Restricted Activity Days..          26,300,000       1,270,000,000\n                                 ---------------------------------------\n    Total.......................                         178,000,000,000\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: Abt Associates, ``The Particulate-Related Health Benefits of\n  Reducing Power Plant Emissions,'' October 2000.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. When you add in the economic impact of the tens of \nthousands of cases of asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, heart problems, \nand lost work days, you reach a pretty staggering conclusion.\n  Powerplant pollution alone is responsible for $178 billion in damage \nto our health and our economy each year, burdening our already taxed \nMedicare program and draining American productivity.\n  There are even more ways in which air pollution hurts our way of \nlife.\n  How many Americans seek peace and enjoyment in our national parks, \nonly to find the vistas clogged with haze? Do families go hiking in our \nnational forests, only to reach bald stands of trees that have been \nkilled by acid rain?\n  I know many people from my State of Vermont and other States are avid \nskiers. Do they wonder why ski resorts must make their own snow more \nnow than ever before, and why the ski season continues to come later \neach year? Global warming will threaten more than ski vacations in the \nvery near future. Global warming and rising sea levels could mean life \nand death to those in our society who live on the margins.\n  Do those listening today enjoy fishing trips with their families? Do \ntheir husbands and wives, daughters and sons, and grandchildren eat the \nfish that are caught?\n  I am sorry to say that the fish being caught may contain unhealthy \nlevels of mercury, likely due to dirty powerplants. Coal-fired \npowerplants emit mercury emissions. Mercury contaminates rainwater. It \nsettles in waterways. It poisons fish. The contaminated fish create a \nhealth risk.\n  Powerplants are responsible for one-third of all U.S. mercury \nemissions. Amazingly, they are currently unregulated.\n  Are doctors warning pregnant women not to eat fish because mercury \nendangers fetuses? I hope they do, because one in 12 women in this \ncountry--that is 5 million women--have blood levels of mercury above \nEPA's safe health threshold. That means that over 300,000 newborns each \nyear face increased risk of nervous system damage due to mercury \nexposure in the womb.\n  How many Americans have children or grandchildren with learning \ndisabilities, speech problems, attention disorders, loss of muscle \ncoordination, memory problems, poor visual spatial skills, vision \nproblems, hearing loss, seizures, mental retardation, or cerebral \npalsy? Have they ever wondered whether these disorders could be due to \nmercury exposure?\n  We all saw what happened when a teen spilled less than a cup of \nmercury at Ballou High School in Southeast Washington. The metal is so \ntoxic to humans that officials closed the school for over a month and \nevacuated 17 nearby homes.\n  Do we feel comfortable knowing that U.S. powerplants emit 50 tons of \ntoxic mercury into the air every year, so that it may fall in our \nbackyards, in our grandchildren's sandboxes, and in the lakes where we \nfish?\n  How many Americans depend on fishing in tainted waters for their \nlivelihood? Chances are, they live in one of the 44 States in the \nNation with fish advisories for mercury and other toxic pollutants. \nChances are also likely that they are unaware that eating fish poisoned \nby mercury can damage their nervous system, cardiovascular system, \nkidneys, and immune system.\n  Sadly, some ethnic groups and anglers who rely on high amounts of \nfish in their diets face two to five times the health risk. \nUnfortunately, these Americans may lack health insurance and access to \nproper medical care to deal with these problems.\n  I have made an appeal today to my distinguished colleagues and to my \nfellow Americans. I know my colleagues are compassionate and they do \neverything possible to represent their constituents, their States, and \nthe Nation well. I only hope they are moved by some of what I have said \ntoday to take swift and serious action to protect our air quality.\n  Unfortunately, this administration's recent and upcoming actions to \ndismantle our clean air laws mean we all have to be vigilant. I will \nfight to protect those 60,000 lives and those 300,000 newborns. I will \nfight to bring down the $178 billion in costs to human health and to \nour precious environment. But Americans will need all of my colleagues' \nhelp, too.\n  Senators should send a message to the President and EPA Administrator \nLeavitt right now. It needs to be loud, and it needs to be clear.\n  The Clean Air Act says utility emissions of air toxics, especially \nmercury, have to come down drastically. EPA is already years behind in \nregulating. There should be no further delay.\n  In the coming weeks, EPA is likely to propose a rule on mercury that \nis not legal or sanctioned by the Clean Air Act. Senators should tell \nAdministrator Leavitt and the President that these ongoing assaults on \nair quality have to stop.\n  I call on the President to do the right thing for once on clean air--\ncut toxic air emissions from powerplants. Do it right. Do it as the law \nrequires. And do it now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15960-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15960-S15961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I express my support for an amendment \noffered by my colleagues Mr. Hatch, Mr. Harkin, and Durbin earlier this \nyear that provides funding for the Food and Drug Administration to \nimplement the dietary supplements law.\n  I sponsored and voted for the Dietary Supplement Health and Education \nAct, DSHEA, of 1994 and continue to support it today because it gives \nconsumers the power to make informed decisions about whether they want \nto use dietary supplements. Millions of Americans take vitamins, \nminerals, and other dietary supplements every day, knowing that if \nthere is a problem with a particular product the FDA has the authority \nto step in to protect the public.\n  Ever since the tragic death of Baltimore Orioles pitcher Steve \nBechler earlier this year there has been increased interest in the \npotential dangers of taking ephedra. In the wake of that tragedy, the \nFDA has opened an investigation into the use of ephedra.\n  I support the enforcement efforts and urge the FDA to act as \nexpeditiously as possible. I know some of my colleagues\n\n[[Page S15961]]\n\nwould simply like to see ephedra banned by legislation. My own view is \nthat we already have a review process in place under DSHEA and now it \nis important for Congress to help the agency do its job.\n  I support the amendment offered by my colleagues because it does just \nthat. We must continue to provide consumers with informed choices about \ndietary supplements and one way to do that is to make sure the FDA has \nthe resources to do the job as expeditiously as possible.\n  The FDA should conclude its rulemaking on ephedra, as well its ``good \nmanufacturing practices'' rules, and move forward as quickly as \npossible so that consumers can be better informed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15961-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  On Saturday, October 25, 2003, an off-duty officer in Austin, TX, was \nattacked in an apparent anti-gay hate crime. The victim, his partner, \nand a friend were at a stop sign in a vehicle with a rainbow sticker on \nthe license plate. Two pedestrians in the crosswalk blocked the vehicle \nwhile six to eight other men approached and began pounding the car. \nWitnesses say one man struck the victim in the face and pulled him from \nthe passenger seat while yelling, ``faggot.'' The officer fell to the \nground, and the attackers picked him up only to beat him again. He \nsuffered broken teeth and puncture wounds on his lower lip.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15961-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HONORING OUR TROOPS AND LOCAL BROADCASTERS\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a program that \nprovides an important service to the men and women serving in our \nmilitary. With our Armed Forces deployed for extended tours of duty in \nboth Iraq and Afghanistan, the pressures placed on family members left \nbehind can be enormous. While the military is dedicated to taking care \nof its own, the need continues to escalate.\n  Today, more than 140,000 troops are fighting the war on terrorism in \nIraq, in Afghanistan, and around the world.\n  Many of our brave men and women have now been deployed much longer \nthan expected. Some active units served in Afghanistan, returned home \nfor 6 months, and were immediately redeployed to Iraq\n  Reservists are facing extended deployment as well. Arkansas \nreservists in the 39th Infantry Brigade, for instance, were recently \ncalled up for what could be a 1-year rotation in Iraq beginning early \nnext year. In many cases, the sole breadwinner in a family is deployed, \nmaking it difficult for the families left behind to cope with medical \nbills or other unexpected expenses.\n  Today, I would like to recognize an effort undertaken by local radio \nand television stations to help address these issues. The National \nAssociation of Broadcasters is leading its local television and radio \nstations in a partnership with the Armed Forces Relief Trust to raise \nfunds for military families in need.\n  By producing, distributing, and airing radio and television public \nservice announcements, the NAB and its radio and television broadcast \nmembers are helping raise funds for those military families in need.\n  Last year, the four emergency assistance programs representing the \nArmy, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps distributed more than $109 \nmillion in interest free loans and grants to military families. Now \nthat the four programs have joined together into the one trust, and \nmore importantly, now that the trust is receiving generous access to \nthe airwaves to get out its message, they will undoubtedly be able to \nprovide yet more assistance.\n  All of us count on our service people who are far from home \nprotecting us. Their families are enduring hardship enough in waiting \nfor them to return. It is incumbent upon all of us to ensure their \nfamilies do not want financially during this most difficult time. I \nwould like to compliment the local radio and television stations that \nare involved in this effort. As small business people, they are \ndedicating a valuable resource--airtime--to a timely and important \ncause. I salute their efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15961-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15961-S15962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO CPT RANDALL L. ZELLER\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a dedicated \npatriot, sailor, husband and father, CPT Randel L. Zeller, USN. By the \ntime the Congress reconvenes in January, Captain Zeller will have \nretired from active duty after 27 years in uniform with the U.S. Navy. \nCPT Randy Zeller has served the Navy and the Nation faithfully and well \nover these many years, most recently as the legislative director for \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  Captain Zeller deserves our recognition and gratitude. He has been \nassociated with the Congress in a variety of positions for over seven \nyears. His career accomplishments reflect the type of military officer \nthis Nation has depended upon for over 225 years, during peace and \nconflict. I would like to take a moment to highlight Captain Zeller's \ncareer.\n  The son of a career Army soldier, Randy Zeller was born at Fort \nBelvoir, VA. Continuing this family tradition of service, Randy earned \nan appointment to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, \ngraduating in 1975 with a bachelor of science degree in marine \nengineering. Following commissioning, he completed the nuclear power \ntraining program and the Submarine Officer Basic Course.\n  This promising young officer was assigned to four tours aboard \nnuclear attack submarines, one tour on an aircraft carrier, a tour as \ncommander of the USS Gato (SSN 615) and, as commander of the Trident \nSubmarine Refit Facility. His tours of duty have included assignments \nto the USS Groton (SSN 694) as Division Officer in 1977; Submarine \nTraining Department Head and submarine tactics instructor at the Fleet \nAnti-Submarine Warfare Training Center Atlantic in Norfolk, Virginia, \n1980-1982; and, Chief engineer on the USS Phoenix (SSN 702), from \nFebruary 1983-1985. In November 1985, he reported to Carrier Group Two \n(CCG-2) aboard the USS Coral Sea (CV-43), as a Tactical Action Officer \nand the Battle Force Anti-Submarine Warfare Officer. While assigned to \nCCG-2, he served on the Fleet Strike Warfare Commanders' staff during \nthe surface action and contingency air strikes against Libya in 1986. \nIn December 1987, he returned to the USS Groton as Executive Officer, \nserving until July 1990. During this tour, the USS Groton earned the \nCOMSIXTHFLT ``Hook' em Award'' for anti-Submarine Warfare excellence \nand played a key role in contingency operations near Lebanon.\n  Captain Zeller's first command was the USS Gato in March 1992. Not \nsurprisingly, his ship executed several ``First of their kind'' \nmissions, demonstrating the utility of the attack submarine in the post \ncold war era. For her service during the U.N. embargo of Haiti, USS \nGato was awarded the Joint Meritorious Unit commendation. The USS Gato \nwas also awarded the Navy Meritorious Unit commendation for exemplary \nperformance from June 1993 to June 1994. In June 1994, Captain Zeller \nwas the Naval Submarine League RADM Jack Darby national award recipient \nfor inspirational leadership and excellence of command.\n  After Captain Zeller left command in November 1994, he served in \nseveral important staff positions, during which he began his \nassociation with the congress. From January 1995 to March 1997 he \nserved in the Department of the Navy's Office of Legislative Affairs in \nthe Pentagon (OLA). At OLA he was instrumental in the Navy's successful \neffort to gain Congressional authorization for the third and final \nSeawolf class submarine, as well as the first ship of the Virginia \nAttack Submarine class. Recognizing his leadership talents and \npotential to assume greater\n\n[[Page S15962]]\n\nresponsibilities, Captain Zeller was selected to command the Trident \nRefit Facility (TRF), Kings Bay, Georgia, a 2000-man Fleet Maintenance \nActivity. During his tour, TRF was awarded the Meritorious Unit \nCommendation for outstanding Trident submarine maintenance performance. \nFollowing this highly successful command tour, Captain Zeller returned \nto service on the Secretary of the Navy's staff as the Deputy Chief of \nLegislative Affairs, from May 1999 to June 2000. Captain Zeller was \nthen selected to be the Legislative Director for the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff. During this tour of duty from June 2000 until \nhis retirement, Captain Zeller served the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nand the Congress during an especially demanding time in U.S. history \nthat included the attacks of September 11, 2001 on the World Trade \nCenter and the Pentagon, and subsequent military operations in \nAfghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere in the Global War on Terrorism. His \nimportant contributions were of great importance in keeping the \nCongress fully informed regarding worldwide military developments and \nrequirements. Captain Zeller's timely, responsive support was critical \nto the success of global U.S. military efforts.\n  A successful military career is not accomplished without dedication \nand sacrifice. Captain Zeller is fortunate to have the devoted support \nof his wife, the former Deborah Lee Chairman of Dayton, OH, and their \ntwo children Alexandra (11) and Nathaniel (8). For their support, \nservice and sacrifice, they have my profound appreciation, and that of \na grateful Nation.\n  It is a great honor and personal privilege for me to recognize the \nexemplary service of CPT Randel L. Zeller and his family today. Their \nselfless service to country, to the Navy, to their community, and to \nfamily serve as an inspiration to those whose lives they have touched, \nand who now carry on the proud traditions of our Armed Forces. As the \nZeller family moves into a new chapter in their lives as valued \ncitizens of the Commonwealth of Virginia, I wish them the continued \nsuccess and happiness they so richly deserve. May they always enjoy \nfair winds and following seas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15962-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  DELAWARE'S BILL OF RIGHTS COMES HOME\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, it is with tremendous pride that I rise \ntoday to commemorate that after 213 years, Delaware's original copy of \nBill of Rights ratified in 1790, is returning home.\n  This is a story steeped in history, mixed with some modern-day \npolitical negotiations--worth celebrating.\n  While Delaware holds the distinction as the first State to ratify the \nConstitution, on December 7, 1787, it was the sixth State to ratify the \nBill of Rights--on January 28, 1790. The two signors of this historic \ndocument were Jehu Davis and George Mitchell. And they were quite \nefficient. Instead of drafting a separate letter, as most States did, \nto notify Congress of Delaware's ratification of the Bill of Rights, \nthey simply penned their signatures on the Bill of Rights document and \nreturned it whole cloth to Congress. Thus, Delaware had no copy of what \nDavis and Mitchell signed.\n  The National Archives, to its immense credit, conserved Delaware's \noriginal copy of the Bill of Rights in pristine condition for more than \ntwo centuries. However, two years ago Delaware's Public Archives, State \nHouse Majority Leader Wayne Smith, and the Delaware General Assembly \nasked the congressional delegation to help negotiate the return of our \nBill of Rights document. We all agreed that this historic document \nshould be displayed for all to see in Delaware, not stored in the \nbasement of the National Archives in Washington, DC.\n  The National Archives is, justifiably, quite protective of its \ndocuments. Suffice to say that it took ten months of negotiations, \nmeetings, letters and conference calls to come to terms on an agreement \nthat returns this document to Delaware, while retaining the National \nArchives legal and preservation rights to it.\n  Starting this December 7, on my State's 216th birthday, its original \nBill of Rights will be on display for all to see. It will be on view at \nour new, state-of-the-art Public Archives Building in Dover, DE. And \nthat is exactly where this document belongs--on public display where \nschool students and adults alike can appreciate its historic \nsignificance.\n  We should all be proud of this accomplishment because it's part of \nour history. The Bill of Rights is a symbol of who we are and the \nvalues we hold dear. It ties us to our past and reminds us of those \nprinciples that will guide us into the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15962-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15962-S15966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS'S NEW AMERICAN STRATEGIES FOR SECURITY AND \n                            PEACE CONFERENCE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in the end of October, the Center for \nAmerican Progress, in conjunction with The American Prospect magazine \nand The Century Foundation, held a conference on U.S. national security \ntitled, ``New American Strategies for Security and Peace.'' Three of my \nfellow senators--Senator Hillary Clinton, Senator Joe Biden, and \nSenator Chuck Hagel--and Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski made incisive remarks \nat this conference about the direction of our country's foreign policy \nand its effects on Americans at home and abroad. They also spoke about \nhow to restore America to respected international leadership. I ask \nunanimous consent that the remarks of Senator Clinton and Dr. \nBrzezinski be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Remarks of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton\n\n       Washington, Oct. 29, 2003.--Thank you, John for that \n     introduction. I want to compliment you for all the hard work \n     that you have put into the creation of the Center for \n     American Progress, an institution that I am convinced will be \n     a tremendous force in engaging in the war of ideas so \n     critical to our country's future. And there is no better \n     leader for that effort than John Podesta who has the warrior \n     spirit and strategic mind needed for such an endeavor. I also \n     want to thank Bob Kuttner at the American Prospect and Dick \n     Leone at the Century Foundation for their work on this \n     conference.\n       Today's conference, ``New American Strategies for Security \n     and Peace'' comes at a critical point in our nation's history \n     and I commend the Center for American Progress, the American \n     Prospect and the Century Foundation for putting together from \n     what is, by all accounts, an outstanding program.\n       Today is a critical moment, not just in our history, but in \n     the history of democracy. As we seek to build democratic \n     institutions in Iraq, and we in this room push for us to \n     reach out to our global partners in this endeavor, this \n     nation must remember the tenets of the democratic process \n     that we advocate.\n       The issue I'd like to address is whether we apply the \n     fundamental principles of democracy--rule of law, \n     transparency and accountability, informed consent--not only \n     to what we do at home but to what we do in the world. There \n     can be no real question that we must do so because foreign \n     policy involves the most important decisions a democracy can \n     make--going to war, our relations with the world, and our use \n     of power in that world.\n       But the fact is that new doctrines and actions by the Bush \n     administration undermine these core democratic principles--\n     both at home and abroad. I believe they do so at a severe \n     cost.\n       In our efforts abroad, we now go to war as a first resort \n     against perceived threats, not as a necessary final resort. \n     Preemption is an option every President since Washington has \n     had and many have used. But to elevate it to the organizing \n     principle of American strategic policy at the outset of the \n     21st century is to grant legitimacy to every nation to make \n     war on their enemies before their enemies make war on them. \n     It is a giant step backward.\n       In our dealings abroad, we claim to champion rule of law, \n     yet we too often have turned our backs on international \n     agreements. The Kyoto Treaty, which represents an attempt by \n     the international community to meaningfully address the \n     global problem of climate change and global warming. The \n     biological weapons enforcement protocol. The Comprehensive \n     Test Ban Treaty. This unwillingness to engage the \n     international community on problems that will require \n     international cooperation sends a clear signal to other \n     nations that we believe in the rule of law--if it is our law \n     as we interpret it. That is the antithesis of the rule of \n     law. The administration argues that international agreements, \n     like the Kyoto Treaty, are flawed. And the fact is they have \n     some good arguments. When the Clinton administration signed \n     the Kyoto Protocol it said that, working, inside the tent, it \n     would try to make further improvements. But rather than try \n     to make further improvements from inside the process, the \n     Bush administration stomped out in an effort to knock over \n     the tent. That is not the prudent exercise of power. It is \n     the petulant exercise of ideology.\n       In our dealings abroad, we more often than not have \n     promoted, not the principles of\n\n[[Page S15963]]\n\n     international cooperation, but the propensity for an \n     aggressive unilateralism that alienates our allies and \n     undermines our tenets. It deeply saddens me, as I speak with \n     friends and colleagues around the world, that the friends of \n     America from my generation tell me painfully that for the \n     first time in their lives they are on the defensive when it \n     comes to explaining to their own children that America truly \n     is a good and benign nation. Their children, too often, have \n     seen an America that disregards their concerns, insists they \n     embrace our concerns and forces them to be with us or against \n     us. Our Declaration of Independence calls for `` a decent \n     respect for the opinions of mankind,'' yet this \n     administration quite simply doesn't listen to our friends and \n     allies. From our most important allies in Europe to relations \n     with our neighbors in this hemisphere, this administration \n     has spanned the range of emotions from dismissive to \n     indifferent. Ask President Vincente Fox, who staked his \n     Presidency on a political alliance with Mexico's historically \n     controversial ally to the north, only to discover that he got \n     no farther north than Crawford, Texas.\n       If we are to lead this world into a wholly democratic \n     future, we must first be consistent in the principles we \n     champion and the ones we pursue.\n       Nowhere is this more apparent than in the transparency of \n     government decisions. Without such transparency, how can \n     leaders be accountable? How can the people by informed? \n     Without such transparency--openness and information--the \n     pillars of democracy lose their foundation.\n       Of course in a democracy, there always is tension between \n     the information that the Executive Branch needs to keep \n     secret and the information that must be provided to the \n     public to have an informed citizenry. There are no easy \n     answers to striking the right balance. But we must always be \n     vigilant against letting our desire to keep information \n     confidential be used as a pretext for classifying information \n     that is more than political embarrassment than national \n     security. Let me be absolutely clear. This is not a \n     propensity that is confined to one party or the other. It is \n     a propensity of power that we must guard against. Because \n     when that happens, we move away from the bedrock principle of \n     informed consent that governs all State actions in a \n     democracy. Getting back, once again, to our founders who I \n     think were not only extraordinary statesmen, but brilliant \n     psychologists--they understood profoundly the dangers and \n     temptations of power. The balance of power that they \n     enshrined in our Constitution and our system of \n     government was a check on all of our human natures and the \n     propensity for anyone, no matter how convinced they are of \n     the righteousness of their cause and view of the world, to \n     be held in a check and a balance by other institutions.\n       Since 9/11, this question has much more salience since the \n     War on Terror will often be fought in the shadows outside the \n     public limelight. New doctrines of preemption raise profound \n     questions about democratic oversight by making decisions \n     effecting war and peace. They also raise profound questions \n     about the quality of the intelligence information that is not \n     open to public scrutiny. One of the most critical issues that \n     we confront is what is wrong with our intelligence, the \n     gathering and the analysis and the use?\n       Anybody who follows what is going on on Capitol Hill is \n     aware that we are locked in a partisan conflict as to how far \n     to go in analyzing the intelligence with respect to Iraq--\n     with the other side complaining that we can look to the \n     intelligence community, but we cannot look at the decision \n     makers. We can't look at the uses to which the intelligence \n     was put and we can't look at the particular viewpoint that \n     was brought to that analysis. I think that is a profound \n     error and undermining to our democratic institutions.\n       The American people, and indeed the international \n     community, need to have confidence that when the U.S. \n     government acts, it is acting in good faith--sharing \n     information where appropriate and developing appropriate \n     mechanisms to insure that power is not being abused. A \n     perception that our government is not providing honest \n     assessments of the rationale for war or is unwilling to admit \n     error will diminish the support for U.S. foreign policy of \n     the American people and the international community. The \n     American people will be far more willing to accept the \n     administration's statement's about what is going right in \n     Iraq if they believe that the administration is more \n     forthright about what is going wrong. It is difficult to \n     convince people that everything is fine when we are asking \n     them to essentially shelve their common sense and human \n     experience.\n       An example that hits close to home for me can be found in \n     the administration's approach to the investigation \n     surrounding 9/11. As Senator of New York, there is no more \n     searing event than what happened to us on September 11th. My \n     constituents have a right to know all the facts of how our \n     government was prepared--or not--for the attacks. Yet, over \n     the weekend, we learned that the 9/11 Commission, charged \n     with the important task of investigating how 9/11 happened, \n     complains that it isn't getting access to all the documents \n     that it needs. This is a hugely important issue and one that \n     must be addressed. The lack of transparency on the part of \n     the Bush administration has forced Governor Kean, the former \n     Republican governor of New Jersey, to threaten subpoenas. \n     This should not be happening.\n       As bad as it was for Vice President Cheney to keep secret \n     how the administration developed its energy policy--this is \n     far worse. The 9/11 commission is not trying to embarrass the \n     President, any former Presidents, or anyone else. It is \n     trying to learn what happened--what went wrong--in hopes that \n     we can become better prepared to protect ourselves from \n     future attacks. In taking this action, the administration \n     unnecessarily raises suspicions that it has something to \n     hide--that it might use national security to hide mistakes. \n     That is not necessary or appropriate.\n       Meanwhile, on Iraq, the Bush administration describes \n     progress on many fronts in direct contravention to what we \n     are hearing every day. There undoubtedly are many instances \n     where U.S. efforts in Iraq are successful. But what is going \n     right should not delude us about what is going wrong. There \n     is too much at stake to treat war as a political spin zone.\n       We need to level with the American people--the good, the \n     bad and the ugly. For the simple fact is that we cannot fail \n     in Iraq. On that fundamental principle, I am in full and \n     profound agreement with the President. The stakes are simply \n     too high. That means we need to improve our transparency and \n     credibility in Iraq. In the recent $87 billion supplemental \n     appropriations bill passed by the Senate, an amendment that I \n     offered, and which was included in the final bill, would \n     require GAO audits of these opaque supplemental \n     appropriations. Another amendment that I co-sponsored with \n     Senator Harkin would require the GAO to examine the level of \n     profits being made by U.S. contractors in Iraq. This is a \n     historic mission that our government has encouraged, going \n     back to George Washington, to make sure that no private \n     company profited off the spoils of war. We need to assure the \n     American people that their money is being spent wisely, \n     assure the Iraqi people that it is being spent in their \n     interest and assure the world that it is not being spent for \n     profiteering by American companies. I understand both of \n     these amendments, my amendment and the one I co-sponsored \n     with Senator Harkin, are the subject of some dispute by the \n     administration. And in fact, I understand that the majority \n     party has been advised to ensure the final package doesn't \n     include those amendments. I can only hope that they have a \n     change of mind. They are creating a level of mistrust in our \n     government by our citizens for which we will reap the \n     consequences for years to come.\n       As we discuss and debate these issues, let us remember the \n     simple fact that we remain at war. That is not a fact lost on \n     the men and women stationed in Iraq. It is not a fact lost on \n     their families who sit at home worrying about their well-\n     being. It should not lead to the administration refusing to \n     release injury figures. We should be willing to admit the \n     price that is being paid by these brave young men and women \n     to pursue this policy. I believe that the Executive Branch \n     has a strong prerogative on national security issues. As \n     Senator, I have supported that prerogative. But the men and \n     women elected to serve in the Congress also have a great deal \n     of wisdom to bring to bear. And quite honestly, my friends, \n     things, have not gone so well in Iraq that we have a single \n     mind to waste.\n       Recent articles in The New York Times and Newsweek report \n     that many Republicans share the frustration that comes from \n     lack of genuine consultations--failure to construct a genuine \n     bipartisan consensus for the sacrifices we are asking \n     Americans to make. My Republican colleagues Senator McCain \n     and Senator Hagel, who is speaking at this conference, have \n     cautioned the administration of the dangers of a failure to \n     be open and honest with the American people on the situation \n     in Iraq.\n       As Senator Hagel and others have suggested, Congress needs \n     to be more than just a rubber stamp for the administration's \n     policies. Tell me what war America has won without seeking, \n     achieving, and maintaining a bipartisan consensus.\n       President Truman worked closely with Senator Vandenberg \n     after WWII to secure U.S. support for the United Nations. \n     President George H.W. Bush consulted closely with Democratic \n     congressional leaders during the first Gulf War. My husband \n     consulted closely with Senator Dole and other Republican \n     leaders during the military action in Bosnia and Kosovo.\n       In giving Iraqis more of a say and in making transactions \n     and contracting more open, the U.S. simply is practicing the \n     habits of democracy--inclusion, empowerment and openness. \n     Fundamentally, this is about trust--winning and earning the \n     trust of the Iraqi people and trusting in the Iraqi people \n     who eventually are going to be left to govern themselves and \n     keeping the trust of the American people. I cannot stress \n     strongly enough how significant it is that the American \n     people across the board, are beginning to ask such serious \n     questions about our direction in our efforts to pursue a \n     course in Iraq, but also from the Middle East to North Korea \n     as well. An unwillingness of the administration to be more \n     forthright can undermine the greatest capital we have, the \n     capital of human trust between a government and the governed. \n     I think we're on the edge of losing both the confidence of \n     the Iraqi people and of the American people. We can prevent \n     that from happening with a heavy dose of straight talk.\n       At the same time that we are trying to build a democratic \n     society in Iraq, we must\n\n[[Page S15964]]\n\n     abide by those basic principles that we hold dear and \n     demonstrate that we are willing to be open and have \n     partnerships and build coalitions that are more than just in \n     a name.\n       I think this moment in American history is wrought with \n     danger and challenge. If you look back at our security and \n     goals in WWII they were clear, the Cold War was clear, the \n     post Cold War era, prior to 9/11, was a little more muddy \n     because it wasn't as obvious what our strategic objectives \n     were and how we would achieve them.\n       Now we do have, once again, a very clear adversary. But \n     just proclaiming the evil of our adversary is not a strategy; \n     just assuming that everyone will understand that we are well \n     motivated and people to be trusted is beyond the range of \n     human experiences that I understand. This administration is \n     in danger of squandering not just our surplus which is \n     already gone in financial terms, but the surplus of good \n     feeling and hopefulness and care and that we had in almost \n     global unanimity after 9/11. We are a resilient, optimistic \n     and effective people and I'm confident that we can regain our \n     footing, but it needs to be the first order of business, not \n     only for the administration, but also for Congress and the \n     American public. It is my hope this conference will provide \n     more ammunition and more support for those of us who are \n     trying to get back on track and to give America the chance to \n     lead consistent with our values and ideals. Thank you very \n     much.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     Remarks of Zbigniew Brzezinski\n\n       Washington, Oct. 28, 2003.--Ladies and gentlemen, 40 years \n     ago almost to the day an important Presidential emissary was \n     sent abroad by a beleaguered President of the United States. \n     The United States was facing the prospect of nuclear war. \n     These were the days of the Cuban Missile Crisis.\n       Several emissaries went to our principal allies. One of \n     them was a tough-minded former Secretary of State, Dean \n     Acheson whose mission was to brief President De Gaulle and to \n     solicit French support in what could be a nuclear war \n     involving not just the United States and the Soviet Union but \n     the entire NATO Alliance and the Warsaw Pact.\n       The former Secretary of State briefed the French President \n     and then said to him at the end of the briefing, I would now \n     like to show you the evidence, the photographs that we have \n     of Soviet missiles armed with nuclear weapons. The French \n     President responded by saying, I do not wish to see the \n     photographs. The word of the President of the United States \n     is good enough for me. Please tell him that France stands \n     with America.\n       Would any foreign leader today react the same way to an \n     American emissary who would go abroad and say that country X \n     is armed with weapons of mass destruction which threaten the \n     United States? There's food for thought in that question. \n     Fifty-three years ago, almost the same month following the \n     Soviet-sponsored assault by North Korea on South Korea, the \n     Soviet Union boycotted a proposed resolution in the U.N. \n     Security Council for a collective response to that act.\n       That left the Soviet Union alone in opposition, stamping it \n     as a global pariah. In the last three weeks there were two \n     votes on the subject of the Middle East in the General \n     Assembly of the United Nations. In one of them the vote was \n     133 to four. In the other one the vote was 141 to four, and \n     the four included the United States, Israel, Marshall Islands \n     and Micronesia.\n       All of our NATO allies voted with the majority including \n     Great Britain, including the so-called new allies in Europe--\n     in fact almost all of the EU--and Japan. I cite these events \n     because I think they underline two very disturbing \n     phenomena--the loss of U.S. international credibility, the \n     growing U.S. international isolation.\n       Both together can be summed up in a troubling paradox \n     regarding the American position and role in the world today. \n     American power worldwide is at its historic zenith. American \n     global political standing is at its nadir. Why? What is the \n     cause of this? These are facts. They're measurable facts. \n     They're also felt facts when one talks to one's friends \n     abroad who like America, who value what we treasure but do \n     not understand our policies, are troubled by our actions \n     and are perplexed by what they perceive to be either \n     demagogy or mendacity.\n       Maybe the explanation is that we are rich, and we are, and \n     that we are powerful, and we certainly are. But if anyone \n     thinks that this is the full explanation I think he or she is \n     taking the easy way out and engaging in a self-serving \n     justification. I think we have to take into account two \n     troubling conditions.\n       Since the tragedy of 9/11 which understandably shook and \n     outraged everyone in this country, we have increasingly \n     embraced at the highest official level what I think fairly \n     can be called a paranoiac view of the world. Summarized in a \n     phrase repeatedly used at the highest level, ``he who is not \n     with us is against us.'' I say repeatedly because actually \n     some months ago I did a computer check to see how often it's \n     been used at the very highest level in public statements.\n       The count then quite literally was 99. So it's a phrase \n     which obviously reflects a deeply felt perception. I strongly \n     suspect the person who uses that phrase doesn't know its \n     historical or intellectual origins. It is a phrase \n     popularized by Lenin when he attacked the social democrats on \n     the grounds that they were anti-Bolshevik and therefore he \n     who is not with us is against us and can be handled \n     accordingly.\n       This phrase in a way is part of what might be considered to \n     be the central defining focus that our policy-makers embrace \n     in determining the American position in the world and is \n     summed up by the words ``war on terrorism.'' War on terrorism \n     defines the central preoccupation of the United States in the \n     world today, and it does reflect in my view a rather narrow \n     and extremist vision of foreign policy of the world's first \n     superpower, of a great democracy, with genuinely idealistic \n     traditions.\n       The second condition, troubling condition, which \n     contributes in my view to the crisis of credibility and to \n     the state of isolation in which the United States finds \n     itself today is due in part because that skewed view of the \n     world is intensified by a fear that periodically verges on \n     panic that is in itself blind. By this I mean the absence of \n     a clearly, sharply defined perception of what is transpiring \n     abroad regarding particularly such critically important \n     security issues as the existence or the spread or the \n     availability or the readiness in alien hands of weapons of \n     mass destruction.\n       We have actually experienced in recent months a dramatic \n     demonstration of an unprecedented intelligence failure, \n     perhaps the most significant intelligence failure in the \n     history of the United States. That failure was contributed to \n     and was compensated for by extremist demagogy which \n     emphasizes the worst case scenarios which stimulates fear, \n     which induces a very simple dichotomic view of world reality.\n       I think it is important to ask ourselves as citizens, not \n     as Democrats attacking the administration, but as citizens, \n     whether a world power can really provide global leadership on \n     the basis of fear and anxiety? Can it really mobilize support \n     and particularly the support of friends when we tell them \n     that if you are not with us you are against us?\n       I think that calls for serious debate in America about the \n     role of America in the world, and I do not believe that that \n     serious debate is satisfied simply by a very abstract, vague \n     and quasi-theological definition of the war on terrorism as \n     the central preoccupation of the United States in today's \n     world. That definition of the challenge in my view simply \n     narrows down and over-simplifies a complex and varied set of \n     challenges that needs to be addressed on a broad front.\n       It deals with abstractions. It theologizes the challenge. \n     It doesn't point directly at the problem. It talks about a \n     broad phenomenon, terrorism, as the enemy overlooking the \n     fact that terrorism is a technique for killing people. That \n     doesn't tell us who the enemy is. It's as if we said that \n     World War II was not against the Nazis but against \n     blitzkrieg. We need to ask who is the enemy, and the enemies \n     are terrorists.\n       But not in an abstract, theologically-defined fashion, \n     people, to quote again our highest spokesmen, ``people who \n     hate things, whereas we love things''--literally. Not to \n     mention the fact that of course terrorists hate freedom. I \n     think they do hate. But believe me, I don't think they sit \n     there abstractly hating freedom. They hate some of us. They \n     hate some countries. They hate some particular targets. But \n     it's a lot more concrete than these vague quasi-theological \n     formulations.\n       I think in the heat of debate Democrats should not be nay-\n     sayers only, criticizing. They certainly should not be \n     cheerleaders as some were roughly a year ago. But they should \n     stress a return to fundamentals in so far as American foreign \n     policy is concerned. Above all else in stressing these \n     fundamentals, Democrats particularly should insist that the \n     foreign policy of a pluralistic democracy like the United \n     States should be based on bipartisanship because \n     bipartisanship is the means and the framework for formulating \n     policies based on moderation and on the recognition of the \n     complexity of the human condition.\n       That has been the tradition since the days of Truman and \n     Vandenberg all the way until recent times. That has been the \n     basis for American foreign policy that has been remarkably \n     successful and has led us not only to a triumph in the Cold \n     War but to emerging as the only global superpower with \n     special responsibilities.\n       Bipartisanship helps to avoid extremes and imbalances. It \n     causes compromises and accommodations. So let's cooperate. \n     Let's cooperate and challenge the administration to cooperate \n     with us because within the administration there are also \n     moderates and people who are not fully comfortable with the \n     tendencies that have prevailed in recent times.\n       That has a number of specific implications that are of a \n     policy type. The first and most important is to emphasize the \n     enduring nature of the alliance relationship particularly \n     with Europe which does share our values and interests even if \n     it disagrees with us on specific policies. But the sharing of \n     values and interests is fundamental, and we partake of the \n     same basic beliefs.\n       We cannot have that relationship if we only dictate or \n     threaten and condemn those who disagree. Sometimes we may be \n     right. Sometimes they may be right. But there is something \n     transcendental about shared values that shouldn't be \n     subordinated to tactical requirements. We should seek to \n     cooperate with Europe, not to divide Europe to a fictitious \n     new and a fictitious old.\n       And we should recognize that in some parts of the world \n     Europeans have more experience and more knowledge than we and \n     certain interests as important as ours. I think particularly \n     of the Middle East. We should be therefore supporting a \n     larger Europe, and in so doing we should strive to expand the \n     zone of peace and prosperity in the\n\n[[Page S15965]]\n\n     world which is the necessary foundation for a stable \n     international system in which our leadership could be \n     fruitfully exercised.\n       Part of the process of building a larger zone of peace \n     involves also engaging Russia and drawing it into a closer \n     relationship simultaneously with Europe and with the Euro-\n     Atlantic community. But we can only do that if we are clear \n     as to what we are seeking in pursuing that strategy. I would \n     say that what we ought to be seeking unambiguously is the \n     promotion of democracy and decency in Russia and not tactical \n     help of a very specific and not always all that very useful \n     type purchased at the cost of compromising even our own \n     concept of what democracy is.\n       I am troubled by the unqualified endorsements of a \n     government in which former KGB types are preponderant as a \n     successful democracy. That has been the judgment rendered at \n     the highest levels again within the last few weeks without \n     any qualification. But in fairness we have to say that some \n     of that happened before this administration assumed office as \n     well.\n       We should be aware of that. If we are going to pursue a \n     bipartisan policy let's be willing also to accept some \n     shortcomings on our part. But if Russia is to be part of this \n     larger zone of peace it cannot bring into it its imperial \n     baggage. It cannot bring into it a policy of genocide against \n     the Chechens, and cannot kill journalists, and it cannot \n     repress the mass media.\n       I think we should be sensitive to that even if they do \n     arrest oligarchs with whom some of our friends on K Street \n     have shared interests. That is not to be approved. It is to \n     be condemned, but surely there are deeper causes for \n     emphasizing that it is important that Russia should move \n     towards democracy.\n       To increase the zone of peace is to build the inner core of \n     a stable international zone. While America is paramount it \n     isn't omnipotent. We need the Europeans. We need the European \n     Union. (Applause) We have to consistently strive to draw in \n     Russia while at the same time being quite unambiguous in what \n     it is that disqualifies Russia still from genuine membership \n     in the community of democratic, law abiding states.\n       Secondly, we have to deal with that part of the world which \n     is a zone of conflict and try to transform it into a zone of \n     peace, and that means above all else the Middle East. In Iraq \n     we must succeed. Failure is not an option. But once we say \n     that we have to ask ourselves what is the definition of \n     success? More killing, more repression, more effective \n     counter-insurgency, the introduction of newer devices of \n     technological type to crush the resistance or whatever one \n     wishes to call it--the terrorism?\n       Or is it a deliberate effort to promote by using force a \n     political solution? And if there's going to be a political \n     solution in Iraq, clearly I think it is obvious that two \n     prerequisites have to be fulfilled as rapidly as feasible \n     namely the internationalization of the foreign presence in \n     Iraq regarding which too much time has been lost and which is \n     going to be increasingly difficult to accomplish in spite of \n     the somewhat dialectical successes with which we are defining \n     progress in Iraq lately.\n       In addition to the internationalization of Iraq we have to \n     transfer power as soon as is possible to a sovereign Iraqi \n     authority. Sovereignty is a word that is often used but it \n     has really no specific meaning. Sovereignty today is nominal. \n     Any number of countries that are sovereign are sovereign only \n     nominally and relatively. Ultimately even the United States \n     is not fully sovereign as we go around asking for more men \n     and money to help us in Iraq.\n       Therefore there's nothing to be lost in prematurely \n     declaring the Iraqi authority as sovereign if it helps it to \n     gain political legitimacy in a country which is searching to \n     define itself, which has been humiliated, in which there is a \n     great deal of ambivalence, welcoming on the one hand the \n     overthrow of Saddam as the majority does, and on the other \n     hand resenting our presence and our domination.\n       The sooner we do that the more likely is an Iraqi authority \n     under an international umbrella that becomes itself more \n     effective in dealing with the residual terrorism and \n     opposition that we continue to confront. We will not \n     understand what is happening right now in Iraq by analogies \n     to Vietnam because I think they are all together misplaced, \n     and one could speak at length about it.\n       If you want to understand what is happening right now in \n     Iraq I suggest a movie that was quite well known to a number \n     of people some years ago. Maybe not many in this audience, \n     given the age of some present, but it's a movie which deals \n     with a reality which is very similar to that that we confront \n     today in Baghdad. It's called ``The Battle For Algiers.'' It \n     is a movie that deals with what happened in Algeria after the \n     Algerian Liberation Army was defeated in the field by the \n     French army and the resistance which used urban violence, \n     bombs, assassinations, and turned Algiers into a continuing \n     battle that eventually wore down the French.\n       I do not expect we'll be worn down, but I think we want to \n     understand the dynamics of the resistance. This provides a \n     much better analogy for grappling with what is becoming an \n     increasingly painful and difficult challenge for us. A \n     challenge which will be more successful in meeting if we have \n     more friends engaged in meeting it and if more Iraqis begin \n     to feel that they are responsible for the key decisions \n     pertaining to their country.\n       We will not turn the Middle East into a zone of peace \n     instead of a zone of violence unless we more clearly identify \n     the United States with the pursuit of peace in the Israeli/\n     Palestinian relationship. Palestinian terrorism has to be \n     rejected and condemned, yes. But it should not be translated \n     de facto into a policy of support for a really increasingly \n     brutal repression, colonial settlements and a new wall.\n       Let us not kid ourselves. At stake is the destiny of a \n     democratic country, Israel, to the security of which, the \n     well-being of which, the United States has been committed \n     historically for more than half a century for very good \n     historical and moral reasons. But soon there will be no \n     option of a two-state solution.\n       Soon the reality of the settlements which are colonial \n     fortifications on the hill with swimming pools next to \n     favelas below where there's no drinking water and where the \n     population is 50 percent unemployed, there will be no \n     opportunity for a two-state solution with a wall that cuts up \n     the West Bank even more and creates more human suffering.\n       Indeed as some Israelis have lately pointed out, and I \n     emphasize some Israelis have lately pointed out, increasingly \n     the only prospect if this continues is Israel becoming \n     increasingly like apartheid South Africa--the minority \n     dominating the majority, locked in a conflict from which \n     there is no extraction. If we want to prevent this the United \n     States above all else must identify itself with peace and \n     help those who are the majority in Israel, who want peace and \n     are prepared to accept peace.\n       All public opinion polls show that and the majority of the \n     Palestinians, and I believe the majority of the Jewish \n     community in this country which is liberal, open-minded, \n     idealistic and not committed to extremist repressions.\n       The United States as the government, but all of us as \n     citizens and Democrats particularly, will soon have an \n     opportunity to underline their commitments to a peaceful \n     solution in the Middle East because in the next two weeks a \n     group of Israelis and Palestinians are going to unveil a \n     detailed peace plan on which they have been working for \n     months and months. It's a fifty-page document with maps and \n     detailed compromise solutions for all of the major \n     contentious issues, solutions which opinion shows 70 percent \n     of the Israelis would accept.\n       When that happens what will be the stance of the United \n     States? Sharon has already condemned it, and not \n     surprisingly. I hope we do not decide to condemn it. I hope \n     we will show at least a positive interest, and many of us as \n     citizens, as people concerned, should I think endorse it \n     because if we count on the people who want peace eventually \n     we will move towards peace. But they have to be mobilized and \n     given support.\n       I think one of the reasons that that support from the \n     United States has not been forthcoming is in fact political \n     cowardice which I think is unjustified because I have real \n     confidence in the good judgment, both of the Israeli people \n     and of the American Jewish community and more basically of \n     the basic American preference for a moderate peaceful \n     solution.\n       The last third area pertains more broadly to strategic \n     doctrine and to strategic commitment. It involves trying to \n     deal with nuclear proliferation, and we are learning \n     fortunately that we can only deal with that problem when it \n     comes to North Korea or to Iran by cooperation with other \n     major powers.\n       That we have to support, and if the administration moves in \n     that direction or is prodded to move in that direction that \n     is all to the good because there is no alternative. If we to \n     resolve the North Korean problem by arms alone we will \n     produce a violent reaction against the United States in South \n     Korea--and don't underestimate the growing anti-American \n     tendencies in South Korean nationalism--and will precipitate \n     a nuclear armed Japan and thereby create a whole duel \n     strategic dynamic in the Far East.\n       In the case of Iran it is also in our interest that the \n     theocratic despotism fade. It is beginning to fade. It is in \n     its thermidorian phase. The young people of Iran are \n     increasingly alienated. The women of Iran are increasingly \n     assertive and bold. Notice the reception given to the Nobel \n     Peace Prize winner when she returned to Tehran. That is a \n     symptom of things to come.\n       And if we take preemptory action we will reinforce the \n     worst tendencies in the theocratic fundamentalist regime, not \n     to speak about the widening of the zone of conflict in the \n     Middle East. But beyond that we still have one more challenge \n     in the area of strategic doctrine which is how to respond to \n     the new conditions of uncertainty of weapons of mass \n     destruction perhaps eventually being available to terrorist \n     groups.\n       Here I think it is terribly important not to plunge \n     headlong into the tempting notion that we will preempt \n     unilaterally on suspicion which is what the doctrine right \n     now amounts to. The reason for that being we simply do not \n     know enough to be able to preempt with confidence. That to me \n     involves one fundamentally important lesson. We have to \n     undertake a genuine national effort to revitalize and \n     restructure our intelligence services.\n       For four years I was the principal channel of intelligence \n     to the President of the United States. We had a pretty good \n     idea of the nature of the security challenge that we faced \n     because the challenge itself was based on a highly advanced \n     scientific technological system of arms. Today the problem is \n     much more difficult.\n\n[[Page S15966]]\n\n       It's more elusive. We're not dealing with nuclear silos and \n     coordinated structures necessary for an effective assault on \n     American security, structures that we could begin to decipher \n     and also technologically seek to undermine or in the event of \n     warfare paralyze. We were really remarkably well informed and \n     in some respects prepared for a central nuclear war to a \n     degree to which we certainly are not today in dealing with \n     the new challenges of security.\n       These can only be addressed if we have what we do not have, \n     a really effective intelligence service. I find it appalling \n     that when we went into Iraq we did not know if they had \n     weapons of mass destruction. We thought they had weapons of \n     mass destruction based largely on extrapolation. But that \n     also means that our commanders in the field went into battle \n     without any knowledge of the Iraqi WMD order of battle.\n       They did not know what units, brigades or divisions in the \n     Iraqi armed forces were equipped with what kind, allegedly, \n     of weapons of mass destruction. Were there chemical weapons \n     on the battalion level or on the brigade level or were there \n     special units in the different divisions that were supposed \n     to use chemical weapons?\n       What about the alleged existence of bacteriological \n     weapons? Who had them? Who had the right to dispose of them? \n     What about the allegedly reconstituted nuclear program? At \n     what level of development was it? Where were these weapons to \n     be deployed? The fact is none of that was known regarding a \n     country that was permeable, that was not as isolated as the \n     Soviet Union.\n       All of that cumulatively testifies to a fundamental \n     shortcoming in our national security policy. If we want to \n     lead we have to have other countries trust us. When we speak \n     that have to think it is the truth. This is why DeGaulle said \n     what he did. This is why others believed us. This is why they \n     believed us prior to the war in Iraq.\n       It isn't that the Norwegians or the Germans or whoever else \n     had their own independent intelligence services. They \n     believed us, and they no longer do. To correct that we have \n     to have an intelligence that speaks with authority, that can \n     be trusted, and if preemption becomes necessary can truly \n     tell us that as a last resort preemption is necessary. Right \n     now there's no way of knowing.\n       Ultimately at issue, and I end on this, is the relationship \n     between the new requirements of security and the traditions \n     of American idealism. We have for decades and decades played \n     a unique role in the world because we were viewed as a \n     society that was generally committed to certain ideals and \n     that we were prepared to practice them at home and to defend \n     them abroad.\n       Today for the first time our commitment to idealism \n     worldwide is challenged by a sense of security vulnerability. \n     We have to be very careful in that setting not to become \n     self-centered, preoccupied only with ourselves and \n     subordinate everything else in the world to an exaggerated \n     sense of insecurity.\n       We are going to live in an insecure world. It cannot be \n     avoided. We have to learn to live in it with dignity, with \n     idealism, with steadfastness. Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15966-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               FAIR AND ACCURATE CREDIT TRANSACTIONS ACT\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, this past Saturday, November 22, 2003, \nthe Senate passed the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of \n2003. Section 214 of the conference report, entitled ``Affiliate \nSharing,'' adds a new requirement for a notice and an opportunity for a \nconsumer to opt-out of receiving solicitations from a person based on \ninformation that has been shared from an affiliate of that person\n  Several exceptions to the notice and opt-out requirement are included \nin the bill. The first, and most logical one, is an exception for a \nbusiness sending solicitations to its own customers. The conference \nreport defines this as a ``pre-existing business relationship.''\n  The conference report further defines categories of relationships \nthat qualify as a ``pre-existing business relationship'' and directs \nthe regulators, including the Federal Trade Commission, to use their \nregulatory discretion to deem any ``any other pre-existing customer \nrelationship'' as qualifying for the definition that may be appropriate \nbut not clear from the statute.\n  The first category of relationships that the conference report \ndefinition of ``pre-existing business relationship'' lists is a \nrelationship based on ''a financial contract between a person and a \nconsumer which is in force.'' ``Financial contract,'' however, is not \ndefined and it is not clear on its face what the term describes. In any \ncase, I believe the operative concern is that it must be a contract in \nforce.\n  As a conference, I believe the conference report intends that the \nterm ``pre-existing business relationship'' includes a contractual \nrelationship between a consumer and a person, where the consumer has \nrequested the provision of a good or service, or affirmatively \nregistered to receive a service, whether or not a fee is assessed.\n  Certain business models, such as those in the online world, do not \nfollow the traditional fee for services model that characterizes the \nbrick and mortar world. Financial consideration may not exchange up \nfront with a customer, or at all for that matter. Accordingly, I urge \nthe regulators to factor in new and innovative business models when \nissuing the regulations implementing section 214 of the Fair and \nAccurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, particularly with regard to \nthe definition of ``pre-existing business relationship.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15966-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15966-S15968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ENERGY POLICY ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have raised concerns about the \ntroubling environmental provisions contained in the energy bill \nconference report several times during the course of debate on the \nmeasure, but I also wanted to share my concerns regarding the energy \nprovisions of the bill. Energy policy is an important issue for America \nand one which my Vermont constituents take very seriously. The bill \nbefore us seeks to address important issues, such as the role of \ndomestic production of energy resources versus foreign imports, the \ntradeoffs between the need for energy and the need to protect the \nquality of our environment, and the need for additional domestic \nefforts to support improvements in our energy efficiency, and the \nwisest use of our energy resources. Given the importance of energy \npolicy, this bill is a very serious matter and I do not take a decision \nto oppose such a bill lightly. In my view, this conference report does \nnot achieve the correct balance on several important energy issues, as \nwell as on a number of environmental issues.\n  In my work on this legislation, I have heard from large numbers of my \nconstituents. They generally regard the bill as legislation written by \na handful of people with the purpose of rolling back environmental \nprotections and providing big corporations with giveaways at the \nexpense of average Americans. Wally Elton from Springfield, VT called \nmy office last Tuesday to voice his many concerns about the bill. Mr. \nElton is skeptical about many facets of this legislation. ``It makes \nenergy the top priority for public lands, it relaxes clean air and \nclean water standards, which will have bad effects on public health. \nThere is nothing for conservation--it is all about giving companies \nsubsidies and granting them everything on their 'wish list'. In a time \nof deficit, we should not be doing this.''\n  In short, Mr. Elton has deep concern regarding all aspects of this \nbill, right down to the way it was produced. ``The bill is not a \nreconciliation of two bills, and was not the product of bipartisan \neffort,'' he said. ``They just started over.''\n  Many people echo Mr. Elton's concern about this bill being written \nbehind closed doors, in ``secret.'' My constituents tell me that a bill \nwritten without the valid contributions of a wide range of people will \nnot reflect the feelings of the majority of Americans. It is widely \nknown as ``Cheney's bill.''\n  Carol Groom of Warren said ``They are rolling back our environmental \nprotections and cleanup of MBTE will be put on the taxpayers.'' Mary \nLou Treat of Putney, VT is worried about respiratory diseases caused \nfrom pollutants from coal-burning factories, while Catherine Audetter, \nalso of Putney, said ``wary of this legislation's unusual support of \noil'' and lack of focus on renewables. Susanna Liepmann of South \nStrafford is concerned about wildlife protection.\n  An energy expert in my State likened this bill to a horror movie: \n``My strong recommendation is to oppose this bill in any way you can. \nThis bill should have been released on Halloween--it's a Frankenstein \nmonster of mismatched body parts, most of them bad in and of \nthemselves, and even worse when patched together.''\n  For example, in the electricity title, it strengthens the hand of \nFERC by permitting mandatory reliability standards, which is fine, but \nnot as big an improvement as some claim. But it weakens the hand of \nFERC to require transmission companies to join RTOs, and blocks FERC's \nhand on moving to better market structures. In New England, this means \nthat transmission\n\n[[Page S15967]]\n\ncompanies now rule the roost, and can essentially dictate terms to the \nISO--because their participation in the regional pool is voluntary. \nThese are the regional monopolists--why is our ability to regulate them \non a regional basis made subject to their voluntary agreement?\n  For another example, this bill is deferring to States by holding back \nFERC from mandating regional markets; but it harms States by repealing \nPUHCA without any meaningful replacement. Two years after the Enron \ndisaster, and associated revelations and bankruptcies of many other \nmajor players, why are we are repealing PUHCA without any serious look \nat what would be needed instead?\n  Of course, at a more fundamental level, a bill that gives enormous \nbenefits to fossil extraction industries and does not improve CAFE \nstandards is an embarrassment. The failure is mirrored on the \nelectricity side, where it gives incentives for supply side electricity \nproduction and delivery with merely face-saving measures to advance \nefficiency and renewables. The list could go on.\n  My recommendation to the Senate is to put the Frankenstein bill out \nof its misery. Stop it any way you can. A filibuster is in order--and \nit should be about a lot more than MBTE.\n  These examples serve to express my constituents' frustration with \nthis legislation. And their concern is reflected by communication that \nI have had with other energy sector experts as well. Ralph Nader, long \nregarded as an expert in vehicle fuel economy, is deeply concerned that \nthis bill does nothing to increase the average fuel efficiency of our \npassenger cars, which is the worst in 20 years.\n  Steven M. Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an \nEnergy-Efficient Economy, said in the New York Times on November 21, \n2003, that the vehicle and energy efficiency provisions of the current \nenergy bill ``are only a Band-Aid.'' The 3-month investigation released \nby a joint U.S.-Canada government task force on the blackout documents \na significant and overriding reason for the cascading outage that \nknocked out electricity from New York to Toronto to Detroit: No one was \nin charge of the sprawling, heavily loaded and trouble-prone part of \nthe transmission grid running around Lake Erie. The portion of the \nmidwestern grid centered in Ohio has long worried industry regulators, \nand the energy bill does create operating rules to lessen the risk of \nblackouts. But this conference report could do much more for \nreliability such as establishing uniform net metering requirements, \npromoting the upgrade of existing infrastructure rather than creating a \nfrenzy over the construction of new lines, and investing in the \ndeployment of new transmission technologies.\n  Finally, I have heard from Norman Milleron, former member of \nBerkeley's Energy Commission in the 1970s, that the country could be \ndoing much more to capture natural gas that is lost or inefficiently \ncombusted at centrally located powerplants, promote the use of \ndistributed generation, and advance research to promote energy \nefficiency and more effectively generate electricity from biomass.\n  This bill should have contained a renewable portfolio standard \nrequiring electric utilities to generate or purchase a percentage of \nthe electricity they sell from renewable sources. Fifty-three Senators \nsupport such a requirement, more than a majority of this body. We can \nand should do better on renewable energy sources. This bill should have \nset a serious target, we should have had a floor debate on this issue, \nand it should have been in the conference report.\n  In addition, this bill repeals the pro-consumer Public Utility \nHolding Company Act, among the Federal Government's most important \nmechanisms to protect electricity consumers. The conference report \nfails to protect electricity consumers, investors, and small businesses \nfrom abusive transactions between utilities and affiliate companies \nwithin the same corporate family. It also failed to include an \namendment that I cosponsored, offered by the Senator from Washington, \nMs. Cantwell, to the fiscal year 2004 Agriculture Appropriations bill, \nwhich banned all of the Enron-like trading schemes. The Cantwell \namendment passed with the support of 57 Senators, and should have been \nadded to this bill.\n  As I have said before, the American people deserve better than this \nbill, and I cannot vote in favor of it as currently drafted. Both the \nenvironmental and the energy provisions of this measure will need to be \ngreatly improved when we return next year to get my vote.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, this past Friday I voted against the \nEnergy bill conference report that was before the Senate. I did this \ndespite having worked for many years on some of the bill's components \nthat I believe will be good for West Virginia and the Nation, such as \ntax incentives and related research and development of clean coal \ntechnologies, incentives to increase domestic energy production through \nan expansion of existing credits for production from non-conventional \nsources, and incentives to promote greater use of alternative fuel \nvehicles. However, presented with the complete package under \nconsideration, I had no qualms about voting to continue debate and to \nstop a vote on final passage.\n  As a Senator from a State where coal is not merely a home state \nindustry, but a part of the spirit of the place, I did not come to this \nconclusion easily. Many parts of this bill will have little or no \ndirect impact on my State, while parts of the bill could help West \nVirginia. My first concern when looking at any bill is how it will \naffect West Virginians. Only then do I look at the broader scope of \nlegislation. In this instance, these concerns coincide. Balancing all \nthat is good against all that is bad in a large and complex bill, I \nbelieve this energy bill will do more harm than good to my state, \nespecially to its coal industry, and to the nation as a whole.\n  The failure to produce a bill the Senate could pass is especially \nfrustrating to me because I have argued for my entire Senate career \nthat the country desperately needs a comprehensive and responsible \nenergy policy. Recently this need has become obvious even to the casual \nobserver. Huge portions of the population suffer blackouts, high \nnatural gas prices threaten our manufacturing base, and highly volatile \ngasoline prices hurt so many of our citizens. Factors like these compel \nCongress to make prudent energy policy decisions for our nation. These \ninclude developing our domestic energy resources where it can be done \nwithout harming the environment, such as is the case with natural gas \nexploration in the Appalachian Basin that I have promoted by working to \nextend tax incentives for the types of non-conventional terrain common \nthere. It should include funding advancements in technology, as I have \nadvocated with my support for clean coal tax incentives and related \nR, to preserve the long-term viability of our coal industry. It \nshould include common-sense programs to protect miners and other energy \nindustry workers who do the dangerous work that allows our economy to \ngrow. An energy policy we can all support would do more than pay lip \nservice to improving the reliability of our electrical grid, or to the \nefficiency and conservation measures that must be part of an effective \nnational energy strategy.\n  I am sad to say that the Energy conference report misses the mark. We \nwould have done better to simply pass the much more balanced bill the \nSenate passed in 2002, and again this year. I encourage my Republican \ncolleagues in the strongest terms possible to use that bill as a guide, \nand to move quickly, with active bipartisan cooperation, on this \nimportant issue early next year. This will produce a bill that will \nenjoy support on both sides of the aisle. I will not hesitate to oppose \nanother flawed bill, like the one we rejected last week that I believe \nwould hurt my State of West Virginia, no matter how many times the \nmajority seeks to shut off debate.\n  This is a bill I had hoped would help sustain the long-term health of \nthe coal industry. I recognize that the bill contains some clean coal \ntax incentives, which I have worked hard for years to enact into law, \nand related research and development. Unfortunately, an Energy \nconference closedout to Democrats made damaging cuts of 20 percent or \nmore to Senate provisions designed to move the utility industry toward \nemission-free coal-fired power plants in the foreseeable future. The\n\n[[Page S15968]]\n\nR goal of $2 billion over 10 years was cut, and then further diluted \nby including earmarked loan guarantees, including one to strip clean \ncoal technology out of an Alaska demonstration project and reconfigure \nit as a conventional coal plant. The tax provisions, already reduced \nfrom a level coal and utility industry experts project as necessary to \ntruly drive technological development, were cut further. That money was \nshifted to allow the oil and gas industries to receive almost 49 \npercent of all tax incentives, while coal, which produces more than 50 \npercent of the nation's electricity, has to be satisfied with only \nabout 10 percent of the benefit of the bill.\n  What is probably most troubling for my State of West Virginia is that \nthis bill would tilt a playing field that is far from level already \ndramatically in the direction of western coal. Under this legislation, \ncompanies out west that mine coal on public lands will be required to \nconduct much less stringent environmental analysis, and then be \nreimbursed by taxpayers for any costs incurred. At the same time, these \ncompanies will be able to mine this coal the taxpayers' coal--and pay \nlower royalties than have been required until now. Coal from the Powder \nRiver Basin is already cost-competitive in parts of the eastern United \nStates with coal mined in Appalachia. Finally, this bill includes a \ncompletely unjustified repeal of a 4.3 cent per gallon excise tax \nrailroads pay on diesel fuel, which will make it even cheaper for \nwestern coal companies to flood the eastern United States with their \nproduct.\n  Further, I am simply astonished that in a bill that gives an \nunprecedented amount of taxpayer money to special interests, and which \npurports to support coal, that House conferees not from coal states \ndemanded that a small but critical provision of mine from last year's \nSenate bill be removed. This provision, which would have added no \nadditional cost to the bill, called upon the Secretary of Labor to \nhire, train, and deploy as many Mine Safety Inspectors as she is \ncurrently authorized to have. This was meant to overcome a decline in \nthe number of mine inspectors, and therefore, in mine inspections, that \npredates this administration. This situation, where mine inspectors \nspend far more time on the road traveling between mines than they ever \nspend inspecting them for compliance with federal health and safety \nrules, will become untenable if the nearly 25 percent of inspectors \nscheduled to retire in the next three to five years actually leave the \nalready-depleted workforce. Let me reiterate: No new authorization; no \ndemand for additional personnel to make sure the coal mines in this \ncountry are safe for the miners producing the fuel that generates more \nthan half our electricity. Just hire and train them now so that planned \nretirements do not leave our miners unprotected by qualified Mine \nSafety Inspectors. Secretary Chao signed off on the provision last \nyear, and in 2003, Senator Domenici included it in his version of the \nbill. But it's not in the conference report. I wonder how, in an energy \nbill that is supposed to be about maximizing our domestic production, \nwe can look the other way at miners' safety.\n  I would be remiss, if I did not give credit where credit is due. I \nhave worked for many years on incentives to promote natural gas \ndevelopment from non-conventional sources. These so-called section 29 \ncredits, including incentives for the capture of coalmine methane and \nthe production of coke, would, respectively, reinvigorate natural gas \ndrilling in the Appalachian Basin, lower the production costs and \nincrease the safety of coal mining, and help the struggling American \nsteel industry get back on its feet. I have advocated for these \nincentives during my entire career because I understand how much they \nwould help my State of West Virginia. I was proud, both last year and \nin 2003, to lead a broad bipartisan coalition in the Senate pushing for \nextension and expansion of section 29. With regard to these provisions \nI commend the conferees. Unlike many pieces of our bill that went into \nconference with the House, I believe the section 29 provisions in the \nconference report have been greatly improved.\n  I trust that few Senators cast many votes that are decided purely on \nthe numbers. How much something costs, or how much are we willing to \ngive to this industry or that one play into our decisions, to be sure. \nBut for this Senator, at least, figures tend to be obliterated by the \npeople our actions are helping. We had a chance in this conference \nreport to help a group of people I have taken into my heart, and for \nwhom I probably have spent more hours working than any other. I am \nspeaking of retired coal miners and their surviving spouses.\n  The Coal Act was created to protect the promise of lifetime health \nbenefits for coal miners, who fueled the nation's post World War II \neconomic growth, and who made salary and pension concessions in \nexchange for those health benefits. The Coal Act fulfilled a promise \nfirst made by President Truman in his 1946 agreement with legendary \nUMWA President John L. Lewis. In response to a coal strike in the late \n1980s and a looming crisis in the miners' health funds, the first Bush \nadministration created the Coal Commission to find a long term \nsolution. Those recommendations became the basis for the Coal Act, \nwhich protected the health benefits of more than 100,000 retired \nminers. Today, there are almost 50,000 retired miners and widows who \ndepend on the Coal Act for their health care security--their average \nage is about 78. Since enactment, the Coal Act has faced many \nchallenges, but the combination of sharply escalating drug costs and a \nseries of negative court decisions have resulted in a serious deficit \nin the Funds. That deficit will mean a cut in health benefits next year \nif Congress does not act to stop it.\n  We had a chance, in the Energy conference, to shore up the Combined \nBenefit Fund while also helping make states whole with regard to what \nwas owed them in outstanding Abandoned Mine Land contributions. I have \nheard promises that both Senate and House Chairmen have made to deal \nwith this issue next year, when the AML Fund is up for reauthorization. \nFor the 80-year old miners' widows who are facing a benefit cut next \nFebruary, they have heard promises before, but in their behalf I must \nsay that I sincerely hope that next year is not too late.\n  I am not happy that I must vote against this bill. I am sorry for my \nState of West Virginia, because it deserves better than this bill gives \nit. I'm sorry that our balanced bill of 2002 has been replaced with \nthis lopsided monstrosity. I will continue to push my colleagues for a \nbalanced and responsible energy policy for this nation, and I look \nforward to a time, hopefully soon, when I can vote for such a bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15968-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15968-S15969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           AGROTERRORISM: THE THREAT TO AMERICA'S BREADBASKET\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss how to prepare our \nNation against a terrorist attack on our agriculture. Senator Collins, \nchairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, is to be commended for \nholding a hearing last week on a critical issue which has received \nlittle congressional attention. I am deeply concerned about our \nagricultural security. In July and October 2001, I held two hearings on \nthe Nation's preparedness for a bioterror attack. The threat to our \nagricultural industry by potential terrorists is not imagined; it is \nvery real.\n  One expert likened the American agricultural industry to a large \nbulls-eye stamped across the United States. Dr. Peter Chalk, a RAND \npolicy analyst, testified that an attack on American livestock could be \nextremely attractive to a terrorist for the following four reasons: (1) \na low level of technology is needed to do considerable damage, (2) at \nleast 15 pathogens have the capability of severely harming the \nagriculture industry, (3) a terrorist would not need to be at great \npersonal risk in order to carry out a successful attack, and (4) a \ndisease could spread quickly throughout a city, state, or even the \ncountry.\n  In Afghanistan, hundreds of pages of U.S. agricultural documents were \ndiscovered in al-Qaeda's possession. A recent unclassified CIA report \nconfirmed that the September 11th hijackers were attempting to gain \nknowledge and access to crop-dusting aircraft which could be used to \neasily contaminate America's food supply.\n  An agroterrorisk attack would have severe economic costs to \nagricultural producers, State and Federal Governments, and exporters of \nU.S. food products. The widespread contamination of\n\n[[Page S15969]]\n\nAmerican produce or livestock could cause mass panic and long-lasting \nfear of American produced food products. Dr. Chalk cited a study \nconducted in California that concluded that ``each day of delay in \ninstituting effective eradication and control measures would cost the \nstate $1 billion in trade sanctions.'' The economic repercussions are \nalmost unimaginable.\n  Yet within the Federal Government, no agency has the clear \nresponsibility for preventing and containing an agroterrorist attack. \nOver 30 Federal agencies have jurisdiction over some part of the \nresponse process. This bifurcation of jurisdiction contributes to \nconfusion among local and State officials as to where to turn for \nassistance and advice. According to a recent General Accounting Office, \nGAO, report Federal agencies are confused about the chain of command. \nThe report states that neither the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, \nnor the Department of Agriculture, USDA, believe that they have the \nauthority to enforce security at U.S. food processing plants. GAO \nstates that ``both FDA and USDA have instructed their field inspection \npersonnel to refrain from enforcing any aspects of the security \nguidelines because the agencies generally believe that they lack such \nauthority.''\n\n  When questioned at the Governmental Affairs Committee hearing last \nweek, Dr. Penrose Albright, Assistant Secretary for Science and \nTechnology in the Department of Homeland Security, DHS, indicated that \nthe responsibility of leadership would likely fall to DHS in the event \nof an intentional attack on the Nation's agriculture and stated that \nDHS ``takes these responsibilities seriously,'' but stopped short of \nasserting that the new department had overall responsibility. I have \nasked DHS for clarification on this issue.\n  Dr. Albright also said that an unintentional contamination of \nAmerican agriculture would not involve DHS. His response demonstrates a \nserious deficiency in the Federal Government's crisis response \nprocedure. If there were an incident, who would lead the response in \nthe hours or days before the cause of an outbreak was known? One agency \nmust shoulder the responsibility for coordinating an immediate response \nregardless of the cause.\n  To address these concerns, I introduced two bills, S. 427, the \nAgriculture Security Assistance Act, and S. 430, the Agriculture \nSecurity Preparedness Act, to increase the coordination in confronting \nthe threat to America's agriculture industry and provide the needed \nresources. My legislation provides for better funding and a better \ncoordinated response and defense to an agroterrorist attack.\n  The Agriculture Security Assistance Act would assist States and \ncommunities in responding to threats to the agriculture industry. The \nmeasure authorizes funds for communities and states to increase their \nability to handle a crisis. It also encourages animal health \nprofessionals to participate in community emergency planning activities \nto assist farmers in strengthening their defenses against a terrorist \nthreat.\n  The Agriculture Security Preparedness Act would enable better \ninteragency coordination within the Federal Government. The legislation \nestablishes senior level liaisons in the Departments of Homeland \nSecurity and Health and Human Services to coordinate with USDA on \nagricultural disease emergency management and response. The bill also \nrequires DHS and USDA to work with the Department of Transportation to \naddress the risks associated with transporting Animals, plants, and \npeople between and around farms.\n  No doubt a terrorist attack on American agriculture could have a \ndevastating effect on the United States. Our Nation's capability to \ncounter such an attack is increasing, but more needs to be done. My two \nbills would help our Nation act now so that a future agroterrorist \nattack can be avoided or quickly responded to before the damage in \nlives or livestock is too great. I urge my colleagues to support this \noverdue legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15969-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              OVERTIME PAY\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we are sent here to do the people's \nbusiness, but one critical piece of the people's business is missing in \nthis omnibus bill that was filed today. There is one shameful omission.\n  Both Houses of Congress, on a bipartisan basis, voted for my \namendment to block the administration's proposed new rule on overtime. \nBoth Houses voted to block the administration's radical rewrite of the \nNation's overtime laws. That amendment passed 54 to 45 in the Senate, \nand 221 to 203 over in the House. The Congress of the United States \nspoke up--clear as a bell--and said, ``No, the administration must not \nstrip overtime rights from 8 million American workers.''\n  The administration refused to accept this act of defiance by \nCongress. The administration ordered its foot soldiers in the House of \nRepresentatives to strip this provision from the omnibus. Senator \nSpecter and I fought to keep it in, but the administration refused any \ncooperation or compromise. In the end, just like that, the \nadministration nullified the clear will of both Houses of Congress and \nthe American public.\n  I believe this is an abuse of power, and there is a clear pattern to \nthis abuse of power. Time and again, we see this administration \ndictating to Congress, nullifying the work of Congress, running \nroughshod over the will of Congress.\n  This administration seems to believe in Government by one branch--the \nexecutive branch. When the executive branch speaks, the \nadministration's allies in Congress must obediently fall in line. And, \ntime and again, they do. They act as a rubber stamp. They give the \nPresident a blank check.\n  This is dangerous to our constitutional system. The Founding Fathers \ndid not talk about blank checks. They talked about checks and balances. \nIn the Federalist Papers they specifically talked about the danger of \nallowing any one branch to reign supreme.\n  Instead of independent, coequal branches of Government, today the \nexecutive branch does, indeed, reign supreme. Time and again, this \nadministration dictates to Congress, and Congress submits--even when \nboth Houses of Congress have previously voted to the contrary.\n  The problem with having the executive branch dictating to the \nlegislative branch--the problem with discarding checks and balances--is \nthat it results in bad public policy, and that is exactly what we see \nhere, today.\n  Both Houses of Congress, with bipartisan majorities, voted to block \nthe administration's proposed overtime rule. This was the right thing \nto do. It was the correct public policy choice because this new rule is \na stealth attack on the 40-hour workweek, pushed by the White House \nwithout a single public hearing. It will effectively end overtime pay \nfor dozens of occupations, including nurses, police officers, \nfirefighters, clerical workers, airtraffic controllers, social workers, \nand journalists.\n  This proposal is a slap in the face to the millions of American \nworkers who depend on overtime pay to support their families and make \nends meet. We're not talking about spare change, here. We are talking \nabout taking away some 25 percent of the income of many American \nworkers.\n  Now that Congress's vote and voice have been nullified, we are \nhearing that the Department of Labor could issue this new rule in the \ncoming weeks. But I am here to serve notice that I will not give up, \nnor will others who have fought this.\n  The American people will not allow us to drop this issue. They have \nbeen watching this issue closely, because it hits so close to home. I \npledge that I will offer the overtime amendment to every piece of \nlegislation until we succeed.\n  Let's be clear. This is not just about reversing a destructive, \nmisguided measure. It is also about this Congress asserting its \nindependence and refusing to have its votes nullified at the whim of \nthis administration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15969-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15969-S15970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        BLOCKING THE ENFORCEMENT OF OUR NATION'S GUN SAFETY LAWS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the House-passed version of the Commerce, \nJustice and State Departments Appropriations Bill included provisions \nthat, if adopted, would severely hamper efforts of the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) to enforce our \nnation's gun safety laws.\n\n[[Page S15970]]\n\n  Under current law, dealers are required to notify the BATFE of the \nsale of two or more handguns to the same person within five business \ndays. The House-passed provisions would prohibit the public release of \ninformation related to multiple handgun sales. The House language would \nalso prohibit the release of information related to tracing requests on \nguns used in crimes. Eliminating the public availability of this data \nwould make it more difficult to monitor the activities of reckless gun \ndealers.\n  In addition, the House-passed language would prohibit the BATFE from \nissuing a rule requiring Federal Firearm Licensees to take a physical \ninventory of their firearms. A physical inventory recently revealed \nthat a Tacoma, WA, gun dealer could not account for the sniper rifle \nused by the Washington, D.C. area sniper and more than 200 other guns. \nThe House language would have required the immediate destruction of \nrecords of approved firearms purchases and transfers generated by the \nNational Instant Criminal Background Check System. The retention of \nthese records has assisted law enforcement officials trying to prevent \nguns from getting into the hands of criminals and identifying gun \ntrafficking patterns.\n  The House-passed provisions were never the subject of hearings and \nare not supported by any major law enforcement organizations. They \ncould shield reckless and negligent gun dealers from public scrutiny \nand weaken the BATFE's oversight and enforcement authority. They should \nnot be adopted by the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15970-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nRECOGNIZING THE 1ST ANNUAL MARCH OF DIMES RADIO BROADCASTERS FOR BABIES \n                                 EVENT\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I recognize the St. Louis radio \ncommunity for joining together to pioneer the 1st Annual March of Dimes \nRadio Broadcasters For Babies Event at the Saint Louis Galleria on \nNovember 8, 2003. This was the first event of its kind nationwide. \nTogether, Clear Channel Radio, Emmis Broadcasting, Bonneville St. Louis \nRadio Group, KTRS The Big 550, 1380 THE TEAM, Q95.5 Radio One, Classic \n99 and Infinity Radio raised almost $300,000 to support research and \nprograms to save babies from premature birth, the leading cause of \nbirth defects and infant mortality.\n  One out of every eight babies in the U.S. is born prematurely, some \nso tiny they can't even cry. In nearly half of these cases, no one \nknows why. With their 5 year, $75 million Prematurity Campaign--no one \nis working harder than the March of Dimes to find out why babies are \nborn too soon. I commend the St. Louis radio community for their \nsupport of the March of Dimes. With their help we will find the causes \nof premature birth and gain more knowledge to save more babies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15970-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        OREGON HEALTH CARE HERO\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to salute a trio of \nOregon Health Care Heroes. Three agencies, El Programa Hispano, the \nDesarrollo Integral de la Familia, and the Oregon Council for Hispanic \nAdvancement, are working together to provide much needed mental health \nservices to Oregon's growing Latino community. Their combined effort is \nhelping clients improve relationships, find a listening ear and access \nthe services they need to live healthier lives.\n  Funded by a grant from Multnomah County, the agencies work with \nLatino families and individual clients facing a variety of challenges: \nfrom depression and anxiety to post-traumatic stress and domestic \nabuse. Part of the success of this project is that counselor and client \nshare language and culture. Before these agencies began serving \nclients, finding a counselor who speaks Spanish or understands Mexican \nand Latin American cultures was next to impossible.\n  In a recent profile published by the Portland Oregonian, counselor \nMarcos T. Sanchez discussed the importance of sharing language and \nculture with clients.\n\n       It makes such a big difference when you come in and the \n     receptionist can speak to you in Spanish. People walking by \n     can say, ``Have you been helped?'' When you go to the clinic, \n     you're already feeling alienated. But if you don't have to \n     risk as much to get these services, you are much better off.\n\n  The project is also successful because it networks within the Latino \ncommunity and employs nontraditional methods to help clients. \nTherapists conduct home visits to work with whole families and to \nbetter understand the needs of individual clients. This individualized \napproach to care, combined with culturally sensitive services, will \nensure that quality care reaches those who need it most. As the service \nexpands, it will serve as a national model for bringing together the \nbest in community care and mental health services.\n  Through the vision of the Latino Network and the resources of \nMultnomah County, these agencies are reaching people in need. They \nconnect with people and care for clients in a unique way that is making \na real difference in the lives of Latino Oregonians. I thank El \nPrograma Hispano, the Oregon Council for Hispanic Advancement and the \nDesarrollo Integral de la Familia for their excellent work. They are \nheroes to the people they serve and to all Oregonians.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15970-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO C. BOOTH WALLENTINE\n\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I give tribute to my dear friend C. \nBooth Wallentine, who, just days ago, began a very well earned \nretirement after serving for 41 years in the Farm Bureau. Thirty-one of \nthose years he served as the executive director of the Utah Farm \nBureau.\n  Booth is an institution in my State, and I have to say that when \nagriculture issues come up, my first question often is, ``What's \nBooth's take on this?'' Even on rare occasions when we have disagreed \non an issue, I found it valuable to understand his perspective. As far \nas I am concerned, nobody knows agriculture in Utah like Booth \nWallentine, and I dare say that no state Farm Bureau director knows \nCongress and the legislative process like Booth Wallentine, either.\n  This combination of expertise in the substance and in the process of \nagriculture policy-making has helped to set Booth apart as a highly \neffective advocate on behalf of Utah agriculture interests. It has also \nhelped him to provide service in various other ways. He served as vice \nchairman of the Salt Lake Chamber of Commerce as well as chairman of \nthe board of Utah State University. Remarkably, both institutions \nawarded him their respective distinguished service awards. He also \nserved as the president of the Utah Council on Economic Education and \nchaired the Utah Farm Service Agency Committee on Risk Management. \nSomehow he found the time to help establish the National Mormon Pioneer \nTrail Foundation and was asked to chair the Department of the \nInterior's Historic Trail Commission.\n  But wait a minute, there's more. Booth Wallentine was Utah State \nUniversity's very first inductee in their Agriculture Hall of Fame, he \nwas named the Future Farmers of America Farm Leader of the Year, a \nFriend of the Cattlemen, a Friend of Utah Wool Growers, and he earned \nthe Utah State Extension Leadership Award. Booth was also officially \nrecognized by the Environmental Protection Agency for his environmental \nleadership in helping farmers to improve Utah's water quality.\n  I should point out that this is not a complete list, but it serves to \nmake the point that Booth Wallentine is a great American. He has helped \nUtah in so many ways.\n  I know that I will miss him dearly, but I gain some comfort knowing \nthat while he goes into retirement, we continue to benefit from the \nwisdom he shared with us and the legacy he has left. I thank my friend, \nBooth Wallentine for serving so long and so well. I pray that the Lord \nwill bless him and his sweet wife, Raeda, in their retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15970-4", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15970-S15971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO PHILIP SHANNON\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in tribute to Philip J. \nShannon, of Norwich, CT, passed away on Tuesday, November 11, 2003, at \nthe age of 85. Philip was a dedicated public servant, a loyal Democrat, \nand above all, a good friend.\n  He was a Norwich native who would dedicate much of his life to \nserving the people of his hometown. He graduated from St. Patrick's \nSchool and the Norwich Free Academy. Like so many in\n\n[[Page S15971]]\n\nNorwich and across the State of Connecticut, he would go on to work in \nthe manufacturing industry as a machinist at Pratt and Whitney and as a \npartner at the Norwich Machine and Tool Company.\n  During his decades of work as a public official in Norwich, Philip \nwas never one to stay silent on any issue that he felt was important to \nthe citizens of that city. That approach won him many allies, and it \ncertainly earned him his share of critics. But everyone admired the \npassion and the dedication that Philip Shannon brought to his many \nyears of public service.\n  He helped spearhead a series of important local projects, including \nthe Norwich Golf Course and development along route 82. He also had the \nforesight to successfully campaign against selling the city's public \nutilities department to a private corporation. The decision to keep the \ndepartment ultimately made the city more money than it would have \nreceived from the sale.\n  Those are only a few of Philip Shannon's many accomplishments. In the \nwords of Bill Stanley, a former State Senator, ``he did more for \nNorwich than anyone will ever know.''\n  His work on behalf of the Democratic Party in Norwich was so tireless \nthat he became known as ``Mr. Democrat.'' He served as Democratic town \nchairman for 20 years and represented Connecticut's 19th District on \nthe Democratic State Central Committee. In his role as a party leader, \nhe recruited numerous candidates who went on to hold local and State \noffices.\n  Philip was as good to his friends as he was to the Democratic Party. \nHe was a longtime friend of my father, and I will never forget how he \nsupported me when I first ran for the Senate back in 1980.\n  Norwich is a better place today because of the efforts of Philip \nShannon. He will be greatly missed, both by the people he served and by \neveryone who knew and loved him.\n  I offer my most heartfelt sympathies to Philip's wife Cresencia, his \nfour children, six grandchildren, three great-grandchildren, and his \nentire family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15971-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JOSEPH W. McCRACKEN\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the \npassing of Joseph W. McCracken on October 26, 2003.\n  For over 4 decades, Mr. McCracken represented the forest products \nindustry in Oregon and other western States, as the Executive Vice \nPresident of Westen Forest Industries Association. Mr. McCracken \nrepresented a sector of the industry that I hold in particularly high \nesteem--a sector comprised of small, family-owned sawmills and plywood \nplants.\n  These are the mills that traditionally depended on our Federal forest \nlands for their supply of timber. These are the mills that are located \nin small rural communities where they provide the backbone of the local \neconomy.\n  During his years of service to his industry, Joe McCracken was a \nfixture in his town and served as an advisor and mentor to many of our \npredecessors in this body. Warren Magnusen, Scoop Jackson, Mark \nHatfield, Bob Packwood, Frank Church, Jim McClure, Jim Melcher, and \nother stalwarts of our western Senate delegation looked to Joe for \ncounsel and advice on public land issues affecting his constituents.\n  He represented them with a passion and commitment that was exemplary. \nJoe McCracken was a visionary and was responsible for creating and \ninfluencing countless pieces of legislation and regulations that \nbenefitted his industry, the people that work in it and the communities \nthat depend on it.\n  The Small Business Set Aside Program, as just one example, assured \nsmall, family-owned mills a fair share of the Federal timber sold from \nour national forests and lands manager by the Bureau of Land \nManagement.\n  Joe McCracken was a pioneer in crafting the policies and regulations \naffecting the Oregon and California Railroad lands in western Oregon, \ntoday known as the ``O & C'' lands. He did this both as a professional \nstaff person for the Department of the Interior and as an advocate for \nhis trade association.\n  Under Joe McCracken's representation, the small, family-owned mills \nthroughout the west prospered. Many of them are under second and even \nthird generation management. Unfortunately, many of them no longer \nexist.\n  After Joe's retirement in the early 90s, a sea change in Federal \npolicies regulating the management of public forests unfolded to the \npoint that very little timber is being provided from these forest lands \nand many of the mills have closed.\n  Unfortunately, these were the mills Mr. McCracken fought so hard to \npreserve. Those that have survived owe their existence largely to Joe \nMcCracken.\n  Joe was born in Butte, MT in 1925. He served his country as a \nlieutenant in the United States Marines. He attended Princeton \nUniversity where he earned a masters degree in political science.\n  He had a distinguished career with the Department of Interior, and \nspecifically, the Bureau of Land Management prior to taking the \nleadership position with the Western Forest Industries Association.\n  Joe McCracken was a unique individual who left a profound imprint on \nthe growth and evolution of public forest policy and the industry that \nis so closely dependent on public forest lands. His contributions to \nthis body in assisting us in the thoughtful debate and deliberation of \nthese important matters are worthy of our formal recognition.\n  I extend my heartfelt sympathy to Joe McCracken's wife Janet and his \ntwo children, Jon and Tamsen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15971-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE LIFE OF BRIAN HOWELL\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a friend \nwho lived his life in the service of his community and his family.\n  Brian Howell was a committed journalist, and his activities reached \nfar beyond reporting and editing. He wrote eloquently about the \nimportance of honest government, and voiced outrage when news broke of \npolitical corruption in Wisconsin's State legislature.\n  Brian worked his way to become editor of Madison Magazine, a position \nhe took after serving as features editor of the Wisconsin State \nJournal.\n  Brian Howell's dedication extended to the University of Wisconsin-\nMadison, where he taught a course on public campaigns and publicity. \nShortly after the attacks of September 11, Brian worked closely with \nstudents to publish an issue of their student magazine that captured \nthe circumstances, changes, and emotions surrounding the attacks. \nAlways eager to engage young writers, Brian knew the power of good \njournalism.\n  Brian's voice remained strong, even into his last days. He wrote \nopenly about his disease, lung cancer. In calling for increased \nresearch about the disease, Howell knew that despite lung cancer's \nstigma and common association with tobacco, its sufferers deserved the \nsame scientific dedication that other patients received.\n  Right before he passed, Brian received by telephone the UW-Madison \njournalism school's Director's Award for Distinguished Service to \nJournalism. He greatly deserved this high honor.\n  My wife Mary and I will truly miss Brian. He was a friend of ours for \nmany years and my wife had the distinct pleasure of working with him at \nMadison Magazine. His friendship is something we will always treasure \nand hold close to our hearts.\n  Brian's death is a great loss to the Madison community and to \nWisconsin as a whole. I am saddened by his passing and join in honoring \nhis achievements. I know that he will live on through all that he \naccomplished, and through everything that he taught those of us \nfortunate enough to call him a friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15971-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15971-S15972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO PAUL WALLACE-BRODEUR\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Paul \nWallace-Brodeur, an outstanding Vermonter and a national leader in the \narea of health care reform. As he prepares to retire from his position \nas director of the Office of Vermont Health Access in Waterbury, VT, it \nis important to reflect on how much one person can accomplish in \nserving others.\n  Paul has been on the forefront of providing individuals with greater \naccess to the health care delivery system. As the State Medicaid \ndirector, which is\n\n[[Page S15972]]\n\nVermont's second largest insurance program, Paul helped Vermont obtain \nthe distinction of having one of the lowest uninsured rates in the \ncountry. Under Paul's leadership, Vermont broadened its eligibility \nstandards and was one of the first States in the country to expand \nMedicaid services to children under the Dr. Dynasaur program. During \nhis tenure, Medicaid programs grew to cover 143,313 Vermonters.\n  Paul began his career in Vermont as a social worker at the Brandon \nTraining School. He quickly rose to leadership positions as a direct \nprovider and then consultant in the field of mental health, followed by \nhis position as the chief social worker for the Vermont State Hospital. \nIt came as no surprise to those of us who know Paul that he was \nselected in the mid-1980s to lead the State of Vermont's efforts in \ncreating universal access to health care as the executive director of \nthe Vermont Health Policy Council and through his work for the Vermont \nHealth Care Authority. Also during the mid-1980s he spearheaded the \ncreation of the Vermont Ethics Network, an organization dedicated to \nincreasing the understanding of ethical issues, values, and choices in \nhealth and health care.\n  Over the course of 40 years, Paul has been involved with virtually \nevery health policy initiative in Vermont, particularly the State's \nefforts to expand health coverage. He is personally responsible for \nauthoring Vermont's 1115 waiver, which over the years, and with many \namendments, has provided more expansive and flexible Medicaid services \nto Vermonters. In his quiet unassuming way, Paul is an integral part of \nthe health care delivery system in Vermont and has gained recognition \nfor being a national health policy leader and mentor. He has always \nbrought a steadfast commitment and institutional knowledge to solving \nthe problem at hand while maintaining a vision for improving Vermont's \nhealth care system.\n  Paul's unwavering commitment toward improving the health status of \nevery Vermont citizen is a great lesson for all public servants. \nVermont is truly indebted to him.

BILLINGTON\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased today to draw the \nSenate's attention to a public servant who has given meritorious \nservice to Rhode Island and to the Nation.\n  Since 1981, Albert W. Billington has been a Special Agent with the \nNaval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS). In December, Mr. \nBillington will retire from the NCIS. He leaves a record of \nachievement, and his service will be missed.\n  Al Billington graduated from Northeastern University in 1977 with a \nbachelor's degree in Criminal Justice. Beginning his career as a \nSpecial Agent, his first assignment was the San Francisco office where \nhe investigated general criminal matters. Just 2 years later, he began \na one-year assignment as the Special Agent Afloat aboard the USS \nEnterprise (CVN 65). During the tour, he led several high-profile \ninvestigations while the ship and battle group were deployed in the \nWestern Pacific, and for this he received the NCISRA San Francisco \nSpecial Agent of the Year Award for Distinguished Service.\n  Later, Mr. Billington graduated from the Department of Defense \nPolygraph Institute in Anniston, AL, and was reassigned as a Special \nAgent Polygraph Examiner to the NIS Northeast Region Polygraph Site in \nNew London, CT. He rose through the ranks first as the Site Manager and \nlater as the Special Agent in Charge of The Polygraph Office.\n  As Division Head at NISHQ, he conducted oversight of all polygraph \nmatters for the Department of the Navy.\n  In 1994, Al Billington was appointed Assistant Special Agent in \nCharge of the Northeast Field Office in Newport, RI, handling all \ncriminal and fraud investigations.\n  In 1997, he was promoted and reassigned as the Special Agent in \nCharge of the NCIS Middle East Field Office in Bahrain. He served with \ndistinction during this time of heightened alert and terrorist activity \nand was awarded the Navy Superior Civilian Service Award by VADM C.W. \nMoore, Commander Fifth Fleet, USN.\n  Two years later, he was transferred to NCIS Headquarters and served \nas the Deputy Assistant Director for Investigative Support.\n  In 2001, Mr. Billington assumed his present position as the Special \nAgent in Charge of the NCIS Washington, DC, Field Office.\n  Upon his retirement, Mr. Billington will be returning to his home in \nPortsmouth, RI, spending time with his wife, Bonnie, and son, Matthew.\n  I join with Al Billington's colleagues in expressing thanks for his \ndedication and valuable service to our Nation, and in wishing him \nsuccess in all his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15972-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      70TH BIRTHDAY OF SAM MAYNES\n\n Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Sam \nMaynes of Durango, CO, on his 70th birthday, although it would be more \nappropriate to congratulate those with the good fortune to have had Sam \nfor an advocate or friend over the years. I have been lucky enough to \ncount him as both.\n  While others have lived as many years, very few have achieved a \nlegacy as significant and lasting as his will prove to be. The Southern \nUte Tribe, Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, and all of southwestern Colorado \nwill be enjoying the fruits of Sam's hard work long after the struggles \nand acrimony he endured these past decades have been forgotten. Those \nwho time and again pronounced Animas-La Plata a lost cause obviously \ndidn't know the stuff Sam was made of. I knew--and I knew that so long \nas there was any chance at all, he would keep fighting. Sam has a \nwarrior's heart, and it was an honor to do battle alongside him.\n  There are generations of Coloradoans not yet born, who may never know \nthe name of Sam Maynes, but who will live better lives because of his \ntenacity. So congratulations to them, Sam, and happy birthday to \nyou.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15972-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO VERMONT ASSOCIATES FOR TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT, INC.\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I would like to pay tribute \nto Vermont Associates for Training and Development as it celebrates 20 \nyears of service in meeting the employment needs of Vermonters, age 55 \nand older, who are ready, willing, and able to work.\n  I also acknowledge the organization's founding executive director, \nPat Elmer, for her vision, leadership, and management skills as she has \nguided the organization during the past two decades. The agency has \ndeveloped a number of programs related to career counseling, job \nsearch, and computer training in order to prepare individuals for the \nwork place. In addition, they provide on-the-job training stipends to \nallow people the opportunity to build their resumes through real-life \nwork experiences.\n  Too often employers may overlook this valuable, and often untapped, \nresource, which older workers have to offer the workplace. I commend \nVermont Associates for leading the way in changing the mindset of many \ncompanies by creating new opportunities for employees and employers \nalike.\n  As a member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions, HELP, which has jurisdiction over the Older Americans Act, I \ncommend Vermont Associates for their wise and prudent use of funding \nfrom this act. Vermont Associates, and their colleagues across the \ncountry, were very helpful to me as I chaired the HELP Committee during \nthe long-awaited reauthorization of this legislation.\n  I have a strong admiration for Pat's dedication and the many others, \nincluding board members and volunteers, who have built Vermont \nAssociates. Vermont is grateful to Vermont Associates for their \nsteadfast commitment to equal access to employment. Collectively, they \nhave greatly improved the quality of life in our small State. For that, \nVermont owes a great deal of gratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15972-4", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15972-S15973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO JOHN R. (JACK) CHAILLET\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \noutstanding\n\n[[Page S15973]]\n\nVirginian and patriotic American who died of lung cancer on November 8, \n2003--John R. (Jack) Chaillet, of Fairfax, VA.\n  Jack, age 69, was a retired D.C. Police detective, who investigated \nmany of the high-profile murder cases of the 1960's and '70's. He \nserved 21\\1/2\\ years on the Metropolitan Police Department before he \nretired in 1978, serving most of his career as a detective in the \nHomicide Division.\n  In 1977, he was a lead investigator in the Hanafi Muslim murders in \nwhich seven persons were slain and then D.C. Council member Marion \nBarry and two others were wounded after 12 Hanafis seized the District \nBuilding and two other facilities to avenge the death of members of \ntheir sect. Over two days, the group held 134 people hostage.\n  Among hundreds of other cases, he and his partner were first on the \nscene of the car-bomb murder in 1976 at Sheridan Circle of Chile's \nformer Ambassador to the United States, Orlando Letelier. This case was \ntaken over by the FBI. In one of his cases involving the murder of a \nyoung female child, he collected the largest number of pieces of \nevidence ever gathered in a homicide case in D.C. including doorframes \nand bathtub.\n  During his years in the Homicide Division, Mr. Chaillet developed a \nreputation as an investigator with patience and thoroughness in the \nvital collection of evidence. After retirement, he was told that many \nhomicide detectives reviewed his reports for guidance in their cases \nand considered him a legend in homicide investigation. He was profiled, \nalong with others, in a Washington Post weekend magazine article as one \nof the most outstanding D.C. homicide detectives. He worked many round-\nthe-clock days and nights knowing the case must be pursued while the \ntrail was hot. There was no overtime pay and the reward was in knowing \nthe case was closed and another criminal was taken off the streets.\n  Mr. Chaillet helped organize and lectured in a homicide school \nsponsored by the D.C. Police Department which detectives from all parts \nof the country attend and, therefore, made his name known through \ndepartments across the U.S. In these classes, he had a flair for \npresentations in slide shows which kept the classes interesting, \ndramatic and shocking. He also lectured at Criminal Justice classes at \nseveral community colleges and universities.\n  Prosecutors liked to work with him as they knew they could count on \nhim to help make their case with his meticulous notebooks, eloquent \nspeaking voice and unflappability. He developed many contacts in the \nstreet and at Lorton Reformatory who provided him with information on \nopen cases even after his retirement.\n  After retiring from the Police Department, he performed security work \nfor Drug Fair, former Regency Hotel, and the National Press Building. \nHe also did background investigations of Federal job applicants, field \ninvestigations for the Environmental protection Agency, and court \nsecurity assignments for the U.S. Marshal's Office.\n  He was a native of Washington and a graduate of Anacostia High \nSchool, where he was an outstanding football player and received the \nAll-Metro Award for two consecutive years. He served in the Army as a \nmilitary police officer in Germany.\n  He was a Member of the American Legion, Almas Temple Shriners, \nScottish Rite, Masons, and the Fraternal Order of Police. He was a \nfootball coach for the Camp Sprints (Maryland) Boys Club for many years \nand a volunteer for charitable golf tournaments sponsored by the \nFraternal Order of Police and Heroes, Inc.\n  Survivors include his wife, Marie, of Fairfax; his sons, Kurt of \nFairfax and Kyle of Berryville, daughters-in-law Karolyn and Caroline; \nand one grandchild, Logan James as well as many other relatives and a \nhost of friends in the metropolitan area.\n  My sincerest condolences are offered to his family and \nfriends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15973-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DEDICATION OF THE BURCH TRIBAL OFFICE BUILDING\n\n Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I rise to observe the \ndedication and naming of a building by the Southern Ute Indian Tribe in \nIgnacio, CO, a place I am privileged to call home.\n  On December 1, 2003--about a week from now--the Tribe will dedicate a \nnew tribal office building to the memory of its former chief, Mr. \nLeonard Burch, who passed away earlier this year. The building will \nbear his name.\n  Leonard Burch was a quiet man of enormous vision, who led the \nSouthern Ute Indian Tribe for nearly three decades, from a little-\nknown, mostly poor tribe to the pre-eminent energy-producing Indian \ntribe in the world--a leader among tribes, just as Leonard was a leader \namong men.\n  Leonard's dream for the Tribe was audacious, but he persisted where \nothers might have faltered and he believed--believed in his vision, but \nmore important, believed in his people: his faith in the inherent \nstrength of the Southern Utes was unshakeable.\n  it speaks well of the Southern Ute Tribe that they were perceptive \nenough to know a great leader when they saw one, and continued \nfollowing his lead even when the way was difficult. Leonard and the \nTribe deserved each other, and their mutual commitment was rewarded in \na community transformed.\n  Leonard Burch will be missed by the Southern Ute Indians, by me, and \nby all who call southwest Colorado home. He remains in our hearts and, \nwith the dedication of the Southern Ute Indian Tribal Office Building, \nhis memory will be forever honored by the tribe he loved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15973-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING LTC DARWIN EDWARDS\n\n Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I wish to speak about my friend, \nDarwin Edwards, curator of the Museum of Aviation at Robins Air Force \nBase for the past 14 years who passed away Saturday after a lifetime of \nservice.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Edwards was born in Whigham, Georgia 67 years ago. \nInterested in flight from a young age, he attended the United States \nAir Force Academy in Colorado as a member of its fourth class. He then \nserved in the Air Force for 33 years, including a tour in Vietnam where \nhe earned the Silver Star, the Distinguished Flying Cross and many \nother honors from the United States and foreign governments.\n  Darwin Edwards was able to combine his love of aviation and his \ndesire to serve his fellow Americans by joining the Museum of Aviation \nat Warner Robins. This museum, with 93 aircraft and missiles, is a \nfirst-rate facility with aircraft spanning World War II though the Cold \nWar, including fighters, bombers, and cargo and trainer aircraft. It \nalso includes helicopters and missiles.\n  Darwin Edwards worked hard to build up the museum. His personal touch \nwas a big reason the museum has developed into the fourth largest \naviation museum in the United States. Until he was stricken ill at his \nhome several weeks ago, he was working on its $30 million Century 2000 \nNext Generation expansion program.\n  I have known Darwin Edwards for many years and sincerely express my \nadmiration and respect for him. Several times, I used the museum to \nhold Christmas receptions for cadets who had received nominations to \nthe service academies. Each time, Darwin took the time to take the \nyoung men and women on a personal guided tour of the museum, providing \nhis insight and detailed knowledge of this outstanding facility.\n  Darwin Edwards leaves behind his wife, Sheila, his two sons, Richard \nand Howard, as well as a granddaughter, and six sisters and three \nbrothers. He also leaves behind many friends as well as a grateful \nNation.\n  We will miss Darwin Edwards greatly and we extend to his family and \nfriends our heartfelt condolences.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S15973-3", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15973-S15974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO NORMAN TOBIN\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG.

A bill to direct the United States Trade Representative to \nenforce Special Agent rights, under certain trade agreements with \nrespect to Mexico, pursuant to title III of the Trade Act of 1974; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Mexican \nAgricultural Trade Compliance Act. This bill directs the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative to retaliate against Mexico over that country's de facto \nprohibition on the importation of U.S.-produced high fructose corn \nsyrup.\n  I introduce this bill reluctantly. For months I have made it clear, \nthrough letters, floor statements, a hearing, and a trade roundtable, \nthat if the Mexican Congress did not lift its illegal 20 percent tax on \nsoft drinks containing high fructose corn syrup, I would be forced to \nconsider introducing retaliatory legislation, such as this ``tequila \ntariff'' which also covers other agricultural products.\n  We're at the end of our legislative session and there has been no \naction by the Mexican Congress. So, I'm faced with no alternative but \nto introduce this bill.\n  Let me explain how we got to where we are today. Mexico was formerly \nthe largest export market for U.S.-produced high fructose corn syrup. \nBut since 1997, Mexico has engaged in a concerted effort to restrict \nU.S. imports of this product. Throughout this time, Mexico has \nconsistently violated its NAFTA and WTO commitments.\n  Let me give you a short history of Mexico's unjustified actions. In \nFebruary 1997, Mexico initiated an antidumping investigation of U.S. \nhigh fructose corn syrup, followed by the imposition of an antidumping \norder the following year. The United States challenged Mexico's \nantidumping order under the NAFTA. On two different occasions, NAFTA \npanels determined that Mexico's actions violated its NAFTA obligations.\n  The United States also challenged Mexico's antidumping order at the \nWortd Trade Organization. On two separate occasions, the Dispute \nSettlement Body of the WTO held that Mexico's actions violated its \ninternational trade commitments.\n  But Mexico continued to ignore its NAFTA and WTO obligations. In \nfact, Mexico went one step further and in effect threw gasoline onto \nthe fire. On January 1, 2002, in a transparent attempt to evade the \nNAFTA and WTO determinations against it, Mexico imposed a 20 percent \ntax on soft drinks containing high fructose corn syrup. The intent and \neffect of this tax was to continue Mexico's antidumping order on U.S. \nproduced high fructose corn syrup by other means.\n  In April 2002, with its tax now in place, and in a continuous event \nwith the imposition of this tax, Mexico lifted its antidumping order on \nhigh fructose corn syrup. These actions enabled Mexico to make the \ndisingenuous claim that it had come into compliance with the findings \nadopted by the NAFTA and the WTO regarding its antidumping order.\n  The effects of the import restrictions of Mexico's antidumping order \ncontinue, with even more egregious results. Because of Mexico's tax, \nU.S. exports of high fructose corn syrup to Mexico are now at almost \nzero levels.\n  This is an extraordinary situation. Mexico lost under the NAFTA, and \nit lost at the WTO commitments, Mexico responded by imposing a de facto \nban on imports of U.S. high fructose corn syrup. Mexico is not only \nviolating its international trade commitments, but also causing \nsignificant harm for Iowa's corn farmers. Iowa's producers of high \nfructose corn syrup are suffering as well. I know of no other U.S. \nagricultural product that has been shut out of its largest export \nmarket for so long.\n  The United States has worked diligently, and patiently with Mexico on \nthis issue. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick and Ambassador \nAllen Johnson, our Chief Agricultural Negotiator, have put in countless \nhours trying to convince Mexico to come into compliance with its trade \nobligations regarding high fructose corn syrup. But still, the tax \nremains in place. My colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and\n\n[[Page S15978]]\n\nin both the Senate and the House, have repeatedly contacted Mexican \nofficials reminding them of Mexico's trade commitments with regard to \nthis issue. But still, the tax remains in place.\n  I too have worked hard, since the beginning, to try to convince \nMexico to lift its de facto ban on the sale of U.S.-produced high \nfructose corn syrup. As I have mentioned, I've written letters to \nMexican officials, delivered floor speeches, conducted a Finance \nCommittee hearing, and held an agricultural roundtable, all in an \neffort to convince Mexico to lift its de facto ban on imports of U.S. \nhigh fructose corn syrup. During a hearing of the Finance Committee on \nSeptember 23, I stated clearly that if the Mexican tax on soft drinks \ncontaining high fructose corn syrup was not lifted--and soon--I would \nbe forced to consider introducing retaliatory legislation. But still, \nthe tax remains in place.\n  So now, at the end of our legislative session, I see no alternative \nbut to introduce the Mexican Agricultural Trade Compliance Act.\n  The Mexican Agricultural Trade Compliance Act establishes that the \nGovernment of Mexico has engaged in a pattern of activity that has \ncontinuously denied the rights of U.S. exporters of high fructose corn \nsyrup under existing trade agreements. Further, the denial of these \nrights is unjustifiable and burdens or restricts U.S. commerce. \nTherefore, Mexico's actions meet the statutory criteria under section \n301 of the Trade Act of 1974 for retaliatory action.\n  The Mexican Agricultural Trade Compliance Act requires the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative to retaliate, pursuant to section 301, against imports \nfrom Mexico within 60 days of enactment of the Act. However, the U.S. \nTrade Representative shall not take such action if he certifies, within \n30 days after enactment of the Act, that Mexico has eliminated its tax \non soft drinks containing high fructose corn syrup and is according the \nU.S. high fructose corn syrup industry the benefits of all applicable \ntrade agreements.\n  I fully hope that prior to the return of the U.S. Senate in January, \nthe Mexican Congress will act rationally and bring Mexico into \ncompliance with its international trade obligations regarding high \nfructose corn syrup. If it does not, I'll work hard to advance the \nMexican Agricultural Trade Compliance Act through the Senate. Given the \nlarge number of unjustified barriers imposed by Mexico over the past \nmonths against imports of U.S. agricultural products, Mexico has not \nbeen earning goodwill with Members of the Senate. I expect that my \nlegislation will receive broad support.\n  I also intend to work with the U.S. Trade Representative to designate \nMexican products upon which retaliatory duties will be imposed. The \nproducts on this list will consist first and foremost of Mexican \nagricultural products that are prospering on account of their access to \nthe U.S. market. These Mexican products will likely include bottled \ntequila, tomatoes, bell peppers, avocados, limes, asparagus, mangos, \npapayas, watermelons, honey, pecans, and shrimp and prawns. The total \namount of duties imposed on these Mexican products will equal the lost \nsales being experienced by U.S. producers of high fructose corn syrup \non account of Mexico's de facto ban of this product, an amount which--\naccording to U.S. industry--could be as high as $465 million annually.\n  Let me conclude by stating that I know that some in Mexico are \nworking constructively to try to resolve this issue. Earlier this month \nPresident Fox of Mexico sent to the Mexican Congress a formal request \nto repeal the tax on high fructose corn syrup. I hope that his request \nbecomes law. I appreciated the offer of Mexico's Secretary of \nAgriculture, Javier Usabiaga, to speak with me regarding the tax, and I \nregret that our schedules have not permitted us to meet personally. I \nalso note that U.S. and Mexican private sector representatives have \nbeen negotiating over access for U.S. high fructose corn syrup to the \nMexican market.\n  Regardless of these efforts, Mexico's de facto ban on imports of U.S. \nhigh fructose corn syrup remains in place. Meanwhile, Iowa's corn \ngrowers and Iowa's high fructose corn syrup producers continue to \nsuffer on account of Mexico's NAFTA and WTO illegal actions. Again, I \nstrongly hope that Mexican legislators will remove Mexico's tax on soft \ndrinks containing high fructose corn syrup prior to the return of the \nU.S. Senate next January. But if this tax is not repealed by January, I \nhave every intention of working to advance this legislation through the \nSenate.\n  I'm a strong believer in free trade. I fought hard for passage of the \nNAFTA. I did so because I know free trade benefits farmers in Iowa and \nother states. U.S. agriculture certainly benefits from the NAFTA, as \ndoes Mexican agriculture. But Mexico has engaged in a blatantly illegal \nact against U.S. agriculture for too long. Mexico's action is having a \nparticularly negative impact on my State of Iowa. If we are to maintain \nsupport for free trade in this country, we must ensure that our trading \npartners live up to their obligations. If they do not, we must take \naction. I hope the introduction of this bill sends a strong message to \nmy Mexican counterparts that we are ready and willing to stand up for \nU.S. agriculture. I sincerely hope that they will do the right thing \nand repeal their illegal tax on high fructose corn syrup.\n  I hope they repeal their illegal tax to demonstrate their commitment \nto living up to the letter and spirit of Mexico's promises under NAFTA \nand the WTO. I hope they repeal their illegal tax to improve relations \nbetween the United States and Mexico and to bring the benefits of free \ntrade to consumers and producers in both countries. And, Mr. President, \nI hope they repeal their illegal tax so the Mexican Agricultural Trade \nCompliance act is no longer needed. But, if that's what it takes, then \nthat's what we should do.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 1955.

A bill to provide assistance to States and nongovernmental \nentities to initiate public awareness and outreach campaigns to reduce \nteenage pregnancies; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I am proud to introduce the HOPE \nYouth Pregnancy Prevention Act.\n  While teen pregnancy rates in the United States have dropped \nsignificantly in the last decade, we still have one of the highest \nrates among industrialized nations. American teens are twice as likely \nto become pregnant as teenagers in Great Britain and four times more \nlikely than teens in Sweden and France. At the same time, the teen \npregnancy rates for Hispanic and other minority teens in the United \nStates are significantly higher than the national average.\n  The HOPE Youth Pregnancy Prevention Act would provide resources to \nhelp prevent teen pregnancy among at-risk and minority youth.\n  Specifically, my bill would provide grants to States, localities, and \nnon-\n\n[[Page S15982]]\n\ngovernmental organizations for teenage pregnancy prevention activities \ntargeted to areas with large ethnic minorities and other at-risk youth. \nThese grants could be used for a number of activities, including youth \ndevelopment, work-related interventions and other educational \nactivities, parental involvement, teenage outreach and clinical \nservices. The bill would authorize $30 million a year for five years \nfor these grants.\n  The bill would also provide grants to States and non-governmental \norganizations to establish multimedia public awareness campaigns to \ncombat teenage pregnancy. These campaigns would aim to prevent teen \npregnancy through TV, radio and print ads, billboards, posters, and the \nInternet. Priority would be given to those activities that target \nethnic minorities and other at-risk youth. The bill would authorize $20 \nmillion a year for 5 years.\n  Over the past 10 years, we have made progress reducing teen \npregnancy. But out work is not done. We need to strengthen our efforts, \nespecially among Hispanic and other minority youth. I encourage my \ncolleagues to support this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 1957. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to \ncooperate with the States on the border with Mexico and other \nappropriate entities in conducting a hydrogeologic characterization, \nmapping, and modeling program for priority transboundary aquifers, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nUnited States-Mexico Transboundary Aquifer Assessment Act.\n  This bill is the result of a field hearing I conducted in Las Cruces, \nNM two years ago during my tenure as the Chairman of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee. The focus of the hearing was water \nresource issues that were developing along the U.S.-Mexico border--\nparticularly the area encompassing Las Cruces, El Paso, Texas, and \nJuarez, Mexico.\n  There had long existed an ongoing effort to address water quality \nissues and waste-water infrastructure needs in the border region, but I \nwas concerned that issues regarding the availability of future water \nsupplies were growing. The testimony at that hearing made clear that \nthere exists little consensus on how growing communities in the border \nregion will address their future water needs. In particular, I was \nstruck by the lack of agreement on the long-term viability of future \ngroundwater sources, many of which involve aquifers underlying \ncommunities in both the United States and Mexico. Given the rapid \npopulation growth along the U.S.-Mexico border and the increasing \ndemand for water, there is a strong need to gain a common understanding \nof the limits of our shared groundwater resources. A thorough \nunderstanding of the resource is the first step to avoiding conflicts \nsimilar to those that have arisen between the United States and Mexico \nover shared surface waters--e.g. the Rio Grande.\n  The United States-Mexico Transboundary Assessment Act is intended to \naddress the lack of binational consensus regarding the source and \navailability of future water supplies along the border. It will do this \nby establishing a scientific program, involving entities on both sides \nof the border, to comprehensively assess priority transboundary \naquifers. The information and scientific tools developed by this \nprogram will be extremely valuable to State and local water resource \nmanagers in the border region. This effort is to be led by the United \nStates Geological Survey (USGS) working closely with the border states \nand local entities. Over the last several years the USGS has been \nworking with key stakeholders in the border region to design this \ntechnical program.\n  I understand that establishing this scientific program and accurately \nassessing our shared water resources is just a step towards developing \nthe long-term plans and solutions that will help avoid future \ninternational disputes concerning scarce water supplies. This small \nstep, however, is an important one, and is recognized by a number of \norganizations familiar with the need for cooperative efforts between \nthe United States and Mexico on shared water resources. In its 6th \nReport on the U.S.-Mexico Border Environment, the Good Neighbor \nEnvironmental Board, an independent federal advisory committee managed \nby the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, recommended the initiation \nof a ``border-wide groundwater assessment program to systematically \nanalyze priority trans-boundary aquifers.'' Also, the Center for \nStrategic and International Studies, in a January 2003 report of its \nU.S.-Mexico Binational Council, included as one of its recommendations \nthat Mexico and the United States ``improve data collection, \ninformation gathering, and transparency as the first step to developing \na long-term strategy for water management.''\n  Ultimately, the necessary long-term strategy will have to be \ndeveloped by the communities and other water users who reside along the \nborder. Working with each other and their state water resource \nagencies, I believe successful strategies can be developed so long as \nthe information that is the basis for the plans is the most accurate \npossible. In that respect, the USGS has a strong and important role to \nplay. This bill will ensure that the USGS will be able to fulfill this \nrole which, in turn, will enhance the prospects for our border \ncommunities to plan for their future and manage their growth in a \nmanner that ensures their long-term viability and prosperity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1957\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``United States-Mexico \n     Transboundary Aquifer Assessment Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) rapid population growth in the United States-Mexico \n     border region over the last decade has placed major strains \n     on limited water supplies in the region;\n       (2) water quantity and quality issues are likely to be the \n     determining and limiting factors affecting future economic \n     development, population growth, and human health in the \n     border region;\n       (3) increasing use of groundwater resources in the border \n     region by municipal and other water users has raised serious \n     questions concerning the long-term availability of the water \n     supply;\n       (4) cooperation between the United States and Mexico in \n     assessing and understanding transboundary aquifers is \n     necessary for the successful management of shared groundwater \n     resources by State and local authorities in the United States \n     and appropriate authorities in Mexico, including management \n     that avoids conflict between the United States and Mexico;\n       (5) while there have been some studies of binational \n     groundwater resources along the United States-Mexico border, \n     additional data and analyses are needed to develop an \n     accurate understanding of the long-term availability of \n     useable water supplies from transboundary aquifers; and\n       (6) the Border States--\n       (A) are primarily responsible for the management and \n     allocation of groundwater resources within the respective \n     boundaries of the Border States; and\n       (B) should have a cooperative role in the analysis and \n     characterization of transboundary aquifers.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to direct the \n     Secretary of the Interior to establish a United States-Mexico \n     transboundary aquifer assessment program to--\n       (1) systematically assess priority transboundary aquifers; \n     and\n       (2) provide the scientific foundation necessary for State \n     and local officials to address pressing water resource \n     challenges in the United States-Mexico border region.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to prevent the practice of late trading by mutual \nfunds, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as the world's largest economy, I \nbelieve the United States must have the fairest, most transparent and \nefficient financial markets in the world. Our financial services \ncompanies must live up to the highest standards of accountability. This \nis critical to ensure that the United States remains strong, \ncompetitive and safe in the global economy. Unfortunately, recent \nreports of late trading and market timing have brought into question \nwhether mutual fund companies have lived up to the highest standards of \naccountability. They have also shown that the Bush Administration \nfailed to provide effective oversight and examination of mutual fund \ncompanies, while poorly enforcing our securities laws. The inaction of \nthe Bush Administration has dangerously eroded the trust and confidence \nof the American people in mutual funds and may have allowed mutual fund \ncompanies and big investors to engage in fraudulent behavior against \nindividuals and pension funds.\n  New York and Massachusetts regulators have uncovered a scheme in \nwhich some of America's top mutual fund companies let big investors \nprofit illegally at the expense of small investors with so-called \n``late trades'' and ``market timing.'' The scam appears to be \nwidespread. Today, roughly half of all American households own mutual \nfunds either directly or through a retirement account or pension fund. \nIt's been reported that as much as one quarter of mutual fund companies \nmay be involved in late trading and market timing and that such schemes \nmay cost investors as much as $5 billion annually.\n  In a late trade, big investors purchase mutual fund shares after the \nclose of the market but at the closing price, allowing them to take \nadvantage of late-breaking financial news. A mutual fund manager might \nallow a big investor to buy shares in a technology fund at the 4 p.m. \nclose price after learning at 5 p.m. that a major technology company \nhas reported unexpectedly strong earnings. The investor is almost \nguaranteed a profit when the market opens the following day and share \nprices climb. In return for this illegal access, the big investor might \npledge to continue to invest in the fund.\n  Market timing exploits the unique way that mutual funds set their \nprices. While it is not illegal, most mutual fund companies assure \ninvestors that they discourage such practices and that they are working \nto prevent fund timing. Under a market timing trade, big investors \ntrade in and out of certain mutual funds in order to exploit the \ninefficient way mutual funds price their shares and ensure a profit.\n  In 2002, individuals who invested in mutual funds paid approximately \n$70 billion in advisory and management\n\n[[Page S15984]]\n\nfees, an average of more than $700 per investor. There is a significant \ndisparity between the rate of advisory fees charged to mutual fund \ninvestors and the rate paid by institutional investors, even though \nthey provide the similar services. Currently, mutual fund managers are \nunder no obligation to negotiate advisory and management fees that are \nin the best interest of their shareholders. In some instances, mutual \nfund managers has a financial relationship with the contractor which \nreceives a no-bid contract from the same mutual fund.\n  In a September 2003 complaint, New York Attorney General Spitzer \nalleged that Canary Capital Partners, a New Jersey hedge fund, engaged \nin illegal and unethical trading in mutual funds, such as late trading \nand market timing. After the New York State complaint, the SEC ordered \na preliminary investigation, which found that half of the 88 mutual \nfund companies and brokerage firms had arrangements to make market-\ntiming trades. These arrangements occurred even though about half of \nthe fund companies have policies specifically barring market timing. \nOther investigations of mutual fund companies have begun, and it \nappears as though many mutual fund companies have been involved \ndirectly or indirectly in late trading and market-timing schemes.\n  I am very concerned that the actions of the SEC in response to the \nState investigations of late trading and market timing have been \ninadequate and show a bias in favor of mutual fund companies at the \nexpense of small investors.\n\n  For example, earlier this year the SEC conducted a four-month \ninvestigation of Putnam Investments' record keeping, internal controls, \nand ability to comply with Federal securities laws. During that review, \na Putnam employee informed the SEC that the company had failed to stop \nimproper market-timing trades. Despite the tip, SEC examiners did not \nidentify any problems with market timing in its report on Putnam. The \nPutnam employee, after being rejected by the SEC, brought the same \ninformation to the Massachusetts Secretary of State's office, which \nbegan an investigation. Only after the Commonwealth of Massachusetts \nbegan an investigation did the SEC begin its own investigation of \nmarket timing at Putnam. In October, both the Commonwealth of \nMassachusetts and the SEC charged Putnam with securities fraud, only \nmonths after the SEC gave Putnam a clean bill of health. Only a few \nweeks later, Putnam reached a partial settlement of the securities \nfraud charges with the SEC which did not include the Commonwealth of \nMassachusetts. Under the settlement, Putnam agrees to make restitution \nonly for losses to investors attributable to excessive short-term and \nmarket-timing trading by its employees and to make structural reforms. \nUnder the agreement, Putnam neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing and \nthe SEC still has not investigated whether outside investors were \nengaged in market-timing activities. New York Attorney General Eliot \nSpitzer said that Putnam's agreement with the SEC does not address \ncrucial issues involving restitution to fund holders, fees and \npenalties. William Galvin, the Massachusetts Secretary of State said \nthat the agreement clearly demonstrates that the SEC is more interested \nin protecting the mutual fund industry than the average investor.\n  These actions by the SEC highlight a fundamental problem in the Bush \nAdministration's hands-off approach to regulating financial markets and \nthe danger it poses to small investors and the national economy.\n  Compounding this danger and lack of responsible leadership, President \nBush has repeatedly nominated individuals to important economic \npositions notable for their corporate sympathies. The President \nselected a lobbyist for financial deregulation as the chief regulator \nof the federal mortgage lender Freddie Mac. His first SEC chairman was \nan accounting industry who was forced to resign in a storm of public \noutrage over his lenient treatment of his former business.\n  Even after the accounting scandals that felled Enron and WorldCom, it \nwas last year's Democratic Senate that pushed to enact an historic \ncorporate reform law and the President who joined the effort only once \nits passage was all but ensured. It was state attorneys general who \nexposed dubious conflicts of interest at brokerage houses. And when \nenergy companies gauged ratepayers in the West through questionable \ntrades, the Administration sat on its hands for months.\n  The message from the White House to the regulatory agencies, in \nactions if not words, is don't ask and don't tell when it comes to \nprotecting investors and consumers.\n  Justice demands that we fully prosecute Wall Street insiders that \nsteal from Americans saving for retirement, education or simply a \nbrighter future. And we can only hope to revive our economy if we \nrestore investor confidence in the markets so that capital flows to \nbusiness growth and job creation.\n  To stop the erosion of trust in our financial markets and to help \nrestore the American investor's faith in the mutual fund industry, I am \nintroducing the Mutual Fund Investor Protection Act to update federal \nsecurities laws to curb late-trading and market-timing abuses and \ninstitute new limits on mutual fund fees paid by investors.\n  The actions by the SEC show that it is incapable of protecting \ninvestors from securities fraud by mutual fund companies and will not \nprosecute this type of fraud to the full extent of the law. Therefore, \nwe must take the day-to-day oversight of mutual funds away from the SEC \nand develop a new Mutual Fund Oversight Board to provide oversight, \nexamination and enforcement of mutual funds. This new board will be \nsimilar to the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board developed in \nthe Sarbanes-Oxley Act. It will be charged with identifying potential \nproblems in the mutual fund industry and ensuring that fund boards are \nactively addressing these problems--before they spread. It would \npromulgate guidance regarding current regulatory issues and best \npractices regarding how to deal with them, and it would examine mutual \nfunds to ensure that they are taking necessary steps to protect \nshareholders. The Board itself would determine how to provide an \nadequate and reliable source of funding for its investigations.\n\n  I believe that every investor has the right to know how much their \nmutual fund takes away from their investment to pay for advisory, \nmanagement, and investment service fees. Under this legislation, each \ninvestor will receive in their statement a regular accounting as to \nwhat types of fees they are paying to invest in their mutual fund. This \nwill help investors shop around and find the mutual funds that have the \nlowest fees. Mutual funds will have to respond to the changing \nmarketplace and only charge fees that are absolutely necessary to the \nmanagement of the fund. Also, this legislation requires mutual fund \nmanagers to negotiate fee contracts that are reasonable and in their \ninvestors' best interest and to report on any significant or material \nbusiness or professional relationship with companies that the mutual \nfund provides contracts. Finally, the bill requires each mutual fund to \nhire a compliance officer to ensure that the mutual fund complies with \nall relevant laws and makes sure that they provide any information on \nscams to the independent mutual fund directors to stop abuse. Taken \ntogether, these provisions will help investors by making it much more \ndifficult for mutual funds to charge unreasonable and unnecessary fees.\n  Today, mutual funds are valued once a day, called the Net Asset Value \nor NAV, usually at 4 p.m. EST, when the New York market closes. The \nbill will require that all mutual fund companies receive an order prior \nto the time the fund sets a share price or NAV for an investor to \nreceive that day's price. This will make it much more difficult for big \ninvestors to use brokers to send in trades after the 4 p.m. deadline.\n  We should include late-trading laws as an offense under the Racketeer \nInfluenced and Corrupt Organization (RICO) provisions of the criminal \ncode. First used to prosecute the Mob, RICO should now be used to stop \nand punish organized crime on Wall Street. This will help limit mutual \nfund employees and big investors from attempting to defraud small \ninvestors. It will also help investors who lose money due to late-\ntrading schemes to recover treble damages, costs and attorneys' fees.\n  The SEC recently found that many mutual fund companies and brokerage\n\n[[Page S15985]]\n\nfirms had arrangements with big investors allowing them to make market-\ntiming trades even though these fund companies have policies \nspecifically barring market timing. My legislation bars mutual fund \nemployees from engaging in market timing trades. It requires each \nmutual fund prospectus to explicitly disclose market-timing policies \nand procedures to stop abuse. Then, it increases penalties for mutual \nfunds which do not follow their own policies and procedures to limit \nabuse.\n  In order to help stop mutual fund abuse, this legislation increases \nthe penalties and jail time for current securities laws including: \ndefrauding the offer or sale of securities, failing to keep current and \nappropriate records of brokerage transactions, and not selling or \nredeeming fund shares at a price based on current Net Asset Value \n(NAV). These changes will make criminals think twice before committing \nviolations of securities laws. The proceeds of the additional fines \ncollected by this legislation will be put into a fund to assist the \nvictims of their crimes.\n  Today, individual mutual funds are effectively dominated by their \nadvisers. My legislation strengthens the influence of independent \ndirectors on fund boards by requiring that independent directors \ncomprise at least three-quarters of the board. It will also require \nmutual funds to have an independent chairman with the authority and \nability to demand and receive all information from the fund advisory \nand management companies. This will increase the voice investors have \nin fund management and limit mutual fund abuses.\n  By developing a new structure to provide appropriate oversight and \nenforcement mechanisms to fight abuse in the mutual fund industry, this \nlegislation restores the confidence of investors in mutual funds. \nUltimately, investor confidence will increase investment and enhance \neconomic growth. I ask all my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself, Ms. Landrieu, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. \n        Allen):\n  S. 1959. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and \nthe Water Resources Development Act of 1992 to provide for the \nrestoration, protection, and enhancement of the environmental integrity \nand social and economic benefits of the Anacostia Watershed in the \nState of Maryland and the District of Columbia; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nbolster efforts to restore the Anacostia River. Joining me in \nsponsoring this measure are my colleagues Senators Landrieu, Mikulski \nand Allen. A companion bill has also been introduced in the House, \nsponsored by Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton and other members of \nthe Washington metropolitan area Congressional Delegation.\n  Mr. President, the Anacostia River is a resource rich in history and \nwith tremendous natural resources and recreational potential. It is \nhomes to 43 species of fish, some 200 species of birds, as well as more \nthan 800,000 people whose neighborhoods border the watershed. Flowing \nthrough Montgomery and Prince George's Counties in Maryland and \nemptying into the Potomac at the District of Columbia, the watershed \nconsists of a 176-square-mile drainage area. One of the most urbanized \nwatersheds in the United States, the Anacostia suffers a series of \nproblems including trash, toxic pollution from urban runoff, sewage \npollution from leaking sewer lines and combined sewer overflows, \nsediment pollution from erosion, and loss of fish and wildlife and \nrecreational resources. It is a resource that has long been abused and \nneglected, but one that, in my view, can and must be protected and \nrestored.\n  Efforts to begin rejuvenating the Anacostia watershed began formally \nin 1987 when the State of Maryland, Montgomery and Prince George's \nCounties, and the District of Columbia signed an Anacostia Watershed \nRestoration Agreement. The agreement authorized the Washington Area \nCouncil of Governments, COG, to manage the restoration program and the \nInterstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin, ICPRB, to protect the \nresources and facilitate public participation. COG created an Anacostia \nWatershed Restoration Committee, AWRC, to coordinate and implement \nrestoration projects throughout the watershed. Since that time, local, \nState, and Federal Government agencies, as well as the Anacostia \nWatershed Society, the Anacostia Citizens Advisory Committee and other \nenvironmental organizations and dedicated private citizens have \ncontributed significant resources toward re-establishing the Anacostia \nwatershed ecosystem.\n  Thanks to this cooperative and coordinated Federal, State, local and \nprivate effort, we are beginning to make some progress in restoring the \nwatershed. A Six Point Action Plan was signed in 1991 setting ambitious \nand broad-reaching goals for the river's restoration. In 1993 we \ncelebrated the successful restoration of 32 acres of emergent tidal \nwetlands by the Army Corps of Engineers at Kenilworth marsh. The \nproject has shown significant results in improving tidal water flow \nthrough the marsh, and reducing the concentration of nitrogen and \nphosphorus in the area and demonstrates what can be achieved in urban \nriver restoration. There have been other success stories as well in \nurban stream restoration in Montgomery and Prince George's counties, \nremoving barriers to fish passage and reforestation efforts throughout \nthe watershed, to name only a few. In 1999, a new Anacostia Watershed \nAgreement was signed to strengthen the regional governmental commitment \nto Anacostia restoration. There are today more than 60 local, State and \nFederal agencies involved in Anacostia watershed restoration. And more \nthan $100 million has been spent cleaning up the river. There is \nclearly much for which we can all be proud. But the job of restoring \nthe Anacostia watershed is far from complete. The Anacostia is still \none of North America's most endangered and threatened rivers. It is \ndesignated one of three ``regions of concern'' for toxics in the \nChesapeake Bay watershed.\n  The legislation which we are introducing authorizes more than $200 \nmillion in Federal assistance over the next 10 years to restore the \nAnacostia. Of these funds, $170 million is authorized to address the \nbiggest pollution problems in the watershed--stormwater runoff and \nfailing wastewater infrastructure. As the builder of much of the \noriginal infrastructure and a major user, the Federal Government has an \nimportant responsibility to help stem the flow of this pollution and \ncomply with the Clean Water Act. The remaining funds will allow the \nadministrator of EPA, working together with an ``Anacostia Watershed \nCouncil'' of State and local officials, to develop a comprehensive \nenvironmental protection and resource management plan for the \nwatershed, for several Federal agencies to join in the implementation \nof the plan.\n  Mr. President, the Anacostia River suffers from centuries of impacts \nand changes. Once a healthy, thriving river, it is today severely \ndegraded. This legislation is urgently needed if we are to achieve the \ngoal of making the Anacostia and its tributaries swimmable and fishable \nagain. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure and \nask unanimous consent that a section-by-section analysis of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the analysis was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSection-by-Section Analysis of the ``Anacostia Watershed Initiative Act \n                               of 2003''\n\n       Section 1--Title--``The Anacostia Watershed Restoration Act \n     of 2003''\n       Section 2--Findings--Describes the attributes and \n     challenges of the watershed, addresses the economic and \n     natural potential of the watershed to Maryland, DC and the \n     United States; relates the history of efforts to restore the \n     Anacostia River and watershed; and suggests that the \n     importance of the Anacostia River combined with the need for \n     concerted sustained actions among the affected jurisdictions, \n     requires the development of comprehensive environmental \n     protection and resource management action plan.\n       Section 3--Anacostia Watershed Initiative--Amends Federal \n     Water Pollution Control Act (Clean Water Act) by adding a new \n     section 123 that:\n       a.

Establishes the Anacostia Watershed Council (comprised \n     of the Administrator of the EPA, the Interior Secretary, the \n     Secretary of the Army, the Governor of Maryland, the Governor \n     of Virginia, the Mayor of the District of Columbia, and the \n     County Executives from Prince Georges and Montgomery \n     Counties) and provides minimum meeting requirements.\n       d. Establishes objectives and guidelines for the \n     development, review and approval, within one year after \n     enactment, of a 10-year multi-jurisdictional Comprehensive \n     Action Plan for restoration of the Anacostia watershed. \n     Directs that the comprehensive action plan shall incorporate \n     the goals of the 1991 Anacostia Watershed Restoration \n     Agreement; provide for public input; identify annual \n     restoration targets, describe the duties of federal, state \n     and local agencies, and suggest methods, schedules, and \n     amounts of funding required for programs, activities, and \n     projects. Directs that the plan shall promote implementation \n     of a federally approved combined sewer long term control \n     plan. Allows the plan to be amended as appropriated.\n       e. Requires the Anacostia Watershed Council to report \n     annually to the Congressional authorizing and appropriating \n     committees.\n       f. Permits the Administrator, in consultation with the \n     Anacostia Watershed Council, to provide financial and \n     technical support to local public and non-profit entities to \n     develop and implement the Comprehensive Action Plan.\n       g. Directs Under or Assistant Secretaries of the EPA, \n     Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Army, HUD, and \n     Transportation acting through designed agencies to support \n     the Initiative and Comprehensive Action Plan.\n       h.

A bill to exempt airports in economically depressed \ncommunities from matching grant obligations under the Airport \nImprovement Program; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, last summer I visited Del Norte County--in \nthe most northern part of my State. Del Norte County has been hit \nparticularly hard during these tough economic times. Unemployment in \nthe county tops 7.6 percent. Local officials are working hard to \nrevitalize the economy, and one of their top priorities is to renovate \nDel Norte County's airport. And they would like federal assistance.\n  However, under the federal Airport Improvement Program, federal \ngrants must be matched with local funds. In general, I support that \npolicy. But, for communities facing severe economic problems, this \nmatch is prohibitive. It's a bit of a Catch-22. The Federal funds that \nwould help the local economy rebound are not available because the \nlocal economy is in such bad shape that the community can't match the \nfederal grants.\n  The bill that I am introducing today would address this by \neliminating the match required under the Airport Improvement Program \nfor economically depressed communities.\n  To be considered an economically depressed community, a community \nwould have a variety of ways to quality. First, for the last two years, \nthe unemployment rate could be one percent higher than the nation's \nunemployment rate. Second, the per capita income of the community could \nbe 80 percent or less of the nation's per capita income. Or third, the \nSecretary of Transportation could decide that a particular community \nhad a special needs. These criteria are consistent with other \nprovisions of federal law.\n  I believe that by waiving the matching grant in communities that have \na high unemployment rate or low per capita income, we will help to \nrejuvenate their business climate and reinvigorate their local \neconomies.\n  With a little bit of help, I am very optimistic about the future of \nDel Norte County and other areas in California and across the Nation \nthat are facing tough economic times. This bill will provide that \nlittle bit of help.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Carper, Mr. \n        Specter, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. Biden):\n  S. 1961. A bill to provide for the revitalization and enhancement of \nthe American passenger and freight rail transportation system; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the American \nRailroad Revitalization, Investment, and Enhancement Act of the 21st \nCentury, better known as ``ARRIVE-21.'' This legislation is of vital \nimportance to rail transportation because it provides steady, \ndependable funding for our beleaguered national passenger rail system. \nIt also provides funding for infrastructure investment in the railroad \nindustry as a whole, including freight railroads. And it establishes a \nfinancing mechanism to ensure that our rail system benefits from a \nsteady stream of funding, just like our airline industry, our transit \nsystems, and our national highway system.\n  For the past 30 years, Amtrak has provided us with a valuable public \nservice, even though it was forced year after year to come beg for \nmoney from the Congress. And year after year, the Congress gave it just \nenough money to barely survive another 12 months. Sometimes Congress \ndidn't appropriate even enough money to last 12 months, and Amtrak had \nto come back and beg for a supplemental appropriation just to remain in \nbusiness until the end of the fiscal year. Never mind having enough \nmoney to grow the railroad; never mind having enough money to run a \nfirst-class passenger railroad. And never mind having enough money to \nkeep the infrastructure in a state of good repair. All Amtrak has been \nable to do for 30 years is stay alive. It's time to give Amtrak the \ntools and funding it needs to do the job we keep asking it to do.\n  Last year I introduced the National Defense Rail Act of 2002 which \nwas approved by the Senate Commerce Committee by a vote of 20-3. We \nhave shown that bipartisan support exists for authorizing a strong rail \nprogram, however the main obstacle we have faced has been securing \nfunding to live up to the authorized amounts. This legislation attempts \nto address the lack of a guaranteed revenue stream for passenger rail \nprograms and establishes a framework to address freight needs where \nthere is a clear public benefit.\n  It's a foregone conclusion that transportation development requires \nmoney. We somehow figured this out a long time ago with regard to every \nother mode of transportation. We federally funded the development of \nthe interstate highway system; we subsidized airport construction; we \ndredged harbors and channels; and we built locks and dams. And the \nresult of all that investment is that our citizens and our goods can \nmove across the country, from big cities and from small towns, \nefficiently and relatively cheaply. We have today a national \ntransportation system with many impressive components.\n  You might even say we have been a little too successful with these \nmodes of transportation because many of them are now strained to \ncapacity in many areas of the country. This situation presents not only \nan economic dilemma, but also a genuine security risk. The atrocious \nevents of September 11th, and the aftermath that followed, exposed the \nvulnerability of our society and our economy when transportation \nchoices become limited and our mobility is diminished. Effective \ntransportation security means that, as a Nation, we nurture all \ntransportation options and we do not allow ourselves to be overly \ndependent on only one or two particular modes. In effect, that's what \nwe have done by favoring highways and aviation, where we have directed \nthe flow of billions of dollars. Ironically, rail passenger service is \nmore environmentally-friendly, more fuel-efficient, and more capable of \nmitigating the impacts of population congestion to help foster regional \neconomic growth than any of the other modes. But in the process of \nshoring up those other transportation modes for all those years, we \nlost our focus on passenger rail and we sadly neglected investing in \nits development.\n  For passenger rail to be successful, its infrastructure must be \ndeveloped through the kind of bold Federal leadership we exercised for \nour other modes of transportation. That's why my colleagues and I are \npleased to introduce this landmark piece of legislation designed to \nchange the way we think\n\n[[Page S15987]]\n\nabout financing passenger rail service and designed to grow our \npassenger rail system into the world-class system it should be. The \nbill creates Federal/State and public/private partnerships to promote \ninfrastructure development for both freight and passenger rail. It \nprovides $20-$25 billion in grants over six years to States and State \ncompacts for rail capital projects to provide for a safe, secure, and \nefficient rail transportation system. It enhances Federal and State \nrail transportation policy, and it promotes intermodal transportation \ninvestment.\n  ARRIVE-21 creates a non-profit Rail Infrastructure Finance \nCorporation (RIFCO) to issue $30 billion in tax-credit bonds over six \nyears for the purpose of providing grants to States for capital \ninvestment in freight and passenger rail infrastructure and facilities. \nRIFCO will establish a trust account made up of bond proceeds and \ncontributions from States that receive RIFCO grants. Bond proceeds and \nState contributions in excess of the amount required to maintain the \ntrust account will then be available for grants to the States through a \ncompetitive process.\n  Although my first choice would be to fully fund the needs authorized \nin this legislation by straight federal spending, it has become clear \nthat over the last thirty years that there is no pot of gold at the end \nof the rainbow when it comes to Amtrak. There is not enough money in \nthe scant pot available for discretionary spending on transportation \nprograms. We have established dedicated trust funds for the airlines \nwith their ticket taxes, and we have the trust fund for the highways \nand transit programs which are funded through the gas tax, but when it \ncomes to passenger railroads, there is no such revenue stream. The \nestablishment of RIFCO was not my first choice to finance the publicly \nneeded improvements of the railroad system, but it is an option for the \nCongress to debate and consider as we attempt to address what we need \nthe rail system to do for this country.\n  RIFCO is set up to assist the States fund both passenger and freight \nprojects that benefit the public on a State, regional or national \nbasis. State or State compacts may apply for RIFCO funds for \ndiscretionary and formula funds for capital projects in four \ncategories: State Intercity Passenger Rail Corridor Development, \nincluding equipment, stations, and facilities. State Freight Rail \nInfrastructure Development Projects, including capital projects that \nprimarily benefit freight rail transportation. States may use a \npercentage of these formula funds to manage State rail programs. \nNational System Improvement Projects, including projects that \nsignificantly benefit the national passenger rail system, Amtrak-\nsponsored projects and Northeast Corridor projects. High Priority \nProjects, including projects with major public policy benefits to the \nnational rail system or significantly expand rail intermodal capacity \nin connection with maritime, aviation, and highway facilities.\n  Eligible capital projects would include new rail line development, \nplanning and environmental reviews, track upgrades and restoration, \nhighway-rail grade crossing improvements and eliminations, relocation \nof track, infrastructure and facilities, construction of intermodal \nfacilities and passenger rail stations, tunnel and bridge repairs, \ncommunication and signaling improvements, environmental impact \nmitigation, acquisition of passenger rail equipment, and security \nimprovements. Projects to receive discretionary funding would be \nselected by RIFCO according to selection criteria contained in the \nbill. The projects would require a 20 percent non-Federal contribution \npaid to RIFCO for bond repayment.\n  ARRIVE-21 also directs the Federal Railroad Administration to develop \na National Rail Plan and to work with States in developing State rail \nplans, so that we have a comprehensive and coordinated long-range plan \nfor rail development for the whole country. The bill also directs the \nOffice of Intermodalism in the Department of Transportation to create a \n``50-Year Blueprint'' for the development of a national intermodal \ntransportation system and provide a vision of emerging trends and \nopportunities for the future of passenger and freight rail \ntransportation.\n  Before I close, I would be remiss if I did not recognize the work of \nNancy Lummens Lewis, a detailee from the Federal Railroad \nAdministration, who has worked on the Commerce Committee since January. \nWe have appreciated her professionalism, competency, and her \nwillingness to work and share her time with us. I thank Nancy for her \ntime spent on this bill, as well as her efforts on the reauthorization \nof the Transportation Equity Act of the 21st Century, The Federal \nRailroad Safety Improvement Act, and The Surface Transportation Board \nAct of 2003. We wish her well in her future endeavors.\n  ARRIVE-21 presents a smart and efficient solution to a very important \ntransportation dilemma. I am joined by several of my colleagues, \nincluding Senators Collins, Specter, Carper and Jeffords, in \nintroducing this bipartisan legislation. As we have passed legislation \nthis week providing approximately $15 billion annually for aviation for \nthe next 4 years, and plan to take up a highway bill next year which \nwill spend $40 to $60 billion annually on highways and transit over six \nyears, we must not leave rail out. It is critical that the Senate take \nthis bill up, and pass it, to ensure that our railroad transportation \nsystem, especially our passenger rail system, can grow and develop to \nmeet our current and future transportation needs.\n  Attached is an amendment that the sponsors of ARRIVE-21 intend to \noffer during floor consideration of the bill. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the amendment and the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the amendment and the bill was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n\n                               amendment\n\n            TITLE VIII--RAIL INFRASTRUCTURE TAX CREDIT BONDS\n\n     SEC. 801.

Mr. President, I rise today to join Senators Hollings, \nCollins, Specter, Jeffords and Lautenberg in introducing ``ARRIVE 21,'' \nthe American Railroad Revitalization, Investment, and Enhancement Act \nof the 21st Century. ARRIVE 21 is a comprehensive proposal that creates \na new public/private partnership to fund rail infrastructure \ndevelopment, reauthorizes and improves Amtrak, and enhances Federal and \nState rail policy and planning efforts.\n  As our Nation faces a mobility crisis of staggering proportions, with \nfreight movements expected to double and our highways and airways \nalready overburdened with congestion, ARRIVE 21 will give our States a \nnew and powerful tool to unlock the potential of intercity passenger \nrail, bringing high-speed rail to viable corridors across the country \nwhile providing capital funding for freight rail projects that deliver \npublic benefits. Today's passenger and freight railroads are already \nessential components of our surface transportation system and I believe \nthat greater use of rail offers one of the best opportunities to \naugment the capacity of our existing transportation network, while \nbenefiting the environment and reducing our dependency on foreign oil.\n  Historically, railroads have been built, maintained and operated \noutside of the publicly funded programs that finance our other \ntransportation modes, relying almost exclusively on the private sector \nto fund their infrastructure. However, today's railroads face \nrestricted access to capital and capacity constraints that limit \nservice quality and expansion, all the while facing ever-growing modal \ncompetition financed by federally funded trust funds. If rail is to \nremain viable or increase its share of the intercity passenger and \nfreight markets--necessary developments if we are to reach other \ntransportation and public policy goals including highway infrastructure \npreservation, highway and air congestion relief, energy efficiency, \nenvironmental stewardship and smart growth development--then the pubic \nsector, through arm's length voluntary partnerships with private \nrailroads, must play a more active role in financing the development of \nfreight and passenger rail infrastructure, as it has with all other \nmodes.\n  Today, America's freight railroads carry 16 percent of the nation's \nfreight by tonnage and intercity passenger rail carriers roughly 23 \nmillion passenger annually. But, the ability of our passenger and \nfreight rail systems to generate the sufficient investment capital \nneeded to maintain this market share, or expand it to handle the \nexpected increases in passenger and freight traffic over the next 20 \nyears, is limited or in jeopardy. According to the America Association \nof State Highway and Transportation Officials' (ASSHTO) ``Freight Rail \nBottom Line Report,'' the nation's freight railroads will need an \nadditional $2.65 billion of public sector annual capital investment \nover the next 20 years above and beyond what they can finance \nthemselves just to maintain their current share of the freight tonnage.\n  Without this additional investment, freight traffic is likely to \nshift from rail to our highways, resulting in an additional 450 million \ntons of freight and 15 billion truck VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled) on \nour roads and $162 billion in increased shipper costs, $238 billion in \nincreased highway user costs, and approximately $20 billion in direct \nadditional highway infrastructure costs. Alternatively, ASSHTO has \nconcluded that with a public investment of $4 billion annually in \nfreight rail infrastructure over the next 20 years, freight rail's \ntonnage share would increase 1 percentage point to 17 percent. This \nshift would thereby relieve our highways of an estimated 600 million \ntons of freight traffic and 25 billion VMT, while saving shippers $239 \nbillion and highways users $397 billion, and reducing direct highway \ninfrastructure costs by $17 billion.\n  For intercity passenger rail, ASSHTO similarly concludes that roughly \n$3 billion in annual public sector investment over the next 20 years is \nneeded to expand intercity passenger rail services and advance the many \nviable high speed rail corridors that could reduce highway and aviation \ncongestion. The Texas Transportation Institute's ``2003 Urban Mobility \nReport,'' which looks at transportation mobility in 75 cities of \nvarying sizes, concludes that the average annual transportation delay \ntime per person climbed from ``16 hours in 1982 to 60 hours in 2001'' \ndue to the congestion of our surface system.\n  High-quality and high-speed intercity passenger service, especially \nin intercity corridors of 500 miles or less where rail can offer \ncompetitive trip times, offers a tremendous opportunity to relieve such \ncongestion by shifting travelers who current drive and fly onto trains. \nToday, roughly 80 percent off all trips of more than 100 miles are less \nthan 500 miles in length. Successful rail corridors in California, the \nPacific Northwest, and in the Northeast have shown that rail can be \nviable option for travelers in such markets, capturing significant \nmarket share and in same cases becoming the dominate mode when frequent \nand high-quality service\n\n[[Page S16003]]\n\nis offered. Where intercity passenger rail is successful, congestion in \nour airports and on our highways is reduced, smart development is \ninduced, jobs are created and citizens' safety and quality of life are \nimproved.\n  Theses facts lead to the obvious conclusion that leveraging modest \npublic investment in our rail system will reap benefits to our entire \nsurface transportation system and to our Nation as a whole. In my State \nof Delaware, we have clearly seen the value that high-quality passenger \nand freight rail service brings and we have made significant \ninvestments to upgrade both Amtrak facilities and infrastructure and \nenhance freight capacity for the railroads that serve Delaware \nindustries. But despite of all the good reasons to invest in our \nrailroad infrastructure, Delaware and other States are limited in what \nthey can do on there own without the benefit of the financing \npartnership that our Federal Government provides the State for all \nother transportation investments. ARRIVE 21 is designed to change that.\n  ARRIVE 21 will empower our States to make rational investments in our \nrail system when such investments provide significant pubic benefits. \nThrough the creation of the Rail Infrastructure Finance Corporation \n(RIFCO) a non-profit, non-Federal, congressionally-chartered \ncorporation that can issue $30 billion in tax-credit bonds over 6 \nyears, States will have a new partner to assist them in undertaking \nrail capital projects. RIFCO will award, using a portion of the \nproceeds from the bond issuance, discretionary capital matching grants \nto States and Amtrak for high-speed rail and intercity passenger rail \nprojects and State formula matching grants for freight capital \nprojects. Prior to issuing grants, a portion of the bond proceeds will \nbe deposited in a secure and continually monitored repayment fund \nmanaged by the RIFCO investment trust to retire the debt over the life \nof the bonds.\n  Passenger and freight rail projects eligible for funding through \nRIFCO include planning and environmental review, rail line \nrehabilitation, upgrades and development, safety and security projects, \npassenger equipment acquisition, station improvements, and intermodal \nfacilities development. In order to receive grants, States must prepare \na State rail plan and provide a 20 percent non-Federal match to RIFCO, \nthereby replicating the cost sharing relationship our States currently \nhave for investments in other modes.\n  ARRIVE 21 will promote jobs and economic growth through the \nrehabilitation and expansion of rail infrastructure, the manufacture \nand procurement of new rail equipment and the enhancement of mobility \nand development in and around or cities and towns. Our bill provides a \ntotal $42 billion investment in U.S. rail infrastructure and service to \nexpand high-speed passenger rail in congested corridors, strengthen \nAmtrak, and improve freight mobility. Such investment will revitalize \nthe U.S. rail supply industry and create thousands of jobs. According \nto U.S. Transportation Secretary Mineta, every $1 billion invested in \ntransportation infrastructure creates roughly 47,500 jobs. That means \nARRIVE 21 stands to create roughly 2 million jobs, if enacted.\n  ARRIVE 21 reauthorizes and reforms Amtrak. Designed to improve upon \nAmtrak's current congressional and State funding processes, our bill \nauthorizes approximately $1.5 billion annually for 6 years to Amtrak \nfor the basic capital and operating needs required to run and maintain \nthe current system. In addition to these funds, the States and Amtrak \ncan pursue major capital improvements and equipment acquisition through \nRIFCO, with reductions in Amtrak's capital authorizations for projects \nfunded through RIFCO capital grants. Through this process, the amount \nneeded for annual Amtrak appropriation for capital will be reduced over \nthe life of the reauthorization, as RIFCO begins to finance a growing \nshare of Amtrak's capital needs. As is the case today, operating costs \non long distance trains will be covered by Amtrak's annual \nappropriation, while States will share the costs with Amtrak for \noperations of short distance corridors.\n  For such shot distance corridors, ARRIVE 21 infuse fairness into the \ncurrent system by requiring parity between Amtrak and all States for \ncost sharing, putting an end to disparate treatment among the States \nthat contract with Amtrak to provide corridor service. Furthermore, it \nauthorizes a study of new methodologies to determine Amtrak routes and \nservices while defining the national passenger rail system based on \nexisting service and high-speed rail corridors. ARRIVE 21 also requires \na whole host of new reforms including accounting transparency measures, \nthe establishment of a quarterly grant process for Amtrak through the \nU.S. Department of Transportation to ensure accountability, and the \ncreation of new service metrics that will improve the monitoring and \nquantification of Amtrak service performance and quality.\n  ARRIVE 21 helps to coordinate rail-planning efforts across the U.S. \nat the national and State level and increases the Federal Railroad \nAdministration's advocacy role in promoting a safe, secure, efficient, \nenvironmentally sound rail transportation system nationwide. The bill \ndirects the Federal Government to develop a national rail plan in \ncoordination with State rail plans and creates a rail cooperative \nresearch program through the National Academies of Sciences. It also \nauthorizes additional funds for planning of high-speed rail projects \nthrough the U.S. Secretary of Transportation and addresses rail safety \nneeds by authorizing funding for emergency passenger safety improvement \nprojects. In light of the security risks facing our railroads, ARRIVE \n21 authorizes $515 million in 2004 for rail security threat assessments \nand grants through the Department of Homeland Security.\n  In total, ARRIVE 21 provides the needed funding for the more than $5 \nbillion annual shortfall in U.S. rail infrastructure investment cited \nby AASHTO Bottom Line Report without involving the Highway Trust Fund \nor sapping funds away from other important transportation priorities. \nThis bill will provide our States and the Nation with a fiscally \nresponsible and innovative opportunity to enhance our entire \ntransportation system. We owe it to the American people to support this \nbill and move towards the type of high-quality, high-speed intercity \npassenger rail service that Americans desire and deserve, while meeting \nthe ever-growing demands that trade and our economy are placing on our \nfreight system. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting ARRIVE 21.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have frequently reiterated my \nconviction that investment in transportation is a means to an end. Our \nnational transportation policy must be designed to serve the public \ngood. In my view, the outcomes we seek are a strong economy, safe and \nhealthy communities, and a clean environment. A balanced transportation \nsystem, including a strong freight and passenger rail system, is \nnecessary for us to attain these goals.\n  As ranking member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, I \nhave been highly involved in the Senate's effort to reauthorize the \nnation's surface transportation program. Over the past two years, I \nhave traveled around the country, visiting local examples of national \ntransportation challenges. I have heard critiques and suggestions from \ndozens of transportation officials, users, and advocates.\n  In order to best serve the needs of this country, we must redouble \nour investment in an efficient, intermodal transportation system. I \nhave often expressed my view that the success of our surface \ntransportation program rests on four fundamental `pillars':\n  First, asset management. We must maintain and preserve existing \ninfrastructure. Second, we must enhance access and mobility, \nparticularly for Americans living in our most congested urban areas.\n  The third pillar is freight and trade. We need new and improved \nfacilities to accommodate the quantity of goods moving through our \nsystem.\n  Fourth, I believe that rail is the final component of a successful \nsurface transportation system. We are not currently meeting the \nnation's freight and passenger rail needs. We must invest in a modern \nnational rail system, comparable to our highway and aviation systems. \nThe bill that we are introducing today will help us achieve that goal.\n  The American Railroad Revitalization, Investment, and Enhancement\n\n[[Page S16004]]\n\nAct of the 21st Century (ARRIVE 21) strives to provide sustainable, \nmeaningful, and continuous funding opportunities for states that want \nto improve and expand their rail systems. Currently, the federal \ngovernment provides few funding sources to assist states in their \nefforts to maintain and improve freight and passenger rail service. \nThis bill creates a nonprofit, public-private partnership--the Rail \nInfrastructure Finance Corporation (RIFCO)--with the authority to issue \n$30 billion in tax-credit bonds over six years. With the resulting \nrevenue, RIFCO will award capital grants to states and to Amtrak.\n  My State of Vermont has long displayed a commitment to maintaining an \neffective and efficient freight and passenger rail system. This \nlegislation would provide Vermont a significant new source of revenue \nto fund capital projects such as rail line rehabilitation, safety and \nsecurity projects, and development of intermodal facilities. In fact, \ngrants awarded by RIFCO could be used to reimburse States for the \ncapital investments they've already made, a provision that is \nparticularly helpful to States, like Vermont, that have invested State \nmoney into eligible projects.\n  For Amtrak, this legislation introduces financial and policy \ncommitments to dramatically improve passenger rail service in this \ncountry. We envision a future that includes a healthy and efficient \npassenger rail system and provide the resources to move Amtrak in that \ndirection.\n  ARRIVE 21 authorizes approximately $1.5 billion per year, for six \nyears, for capital and operating expenses. We have under-funded Amtrak \nfor too long. This funding level will provide Amtrak the resources it \nneeds to address urgent infrastructure needs and system-wide service \nimprovements.\n  Amtrak will also benefit from provisions in this bill that encourage \nlong-term sustainability and enhanced operations. ARRIVE 21 requires \nimproved accounting procedures and oversight. Additionally, states that \ncurrently share responsibility with Amtrak for supporting services \nthrough or within their states will see changes to equalize their cost \nburden. This bill requires that Amtrak, in collaboration with the \nDepartment of Transportation, adopt fair and uniform standards for cost \nsharing on short-distance services that states contract with Amtrak to \nprovide.\n  ARRIVE 21 also directs an independent study to research Amtrak's \ncurrent and past procedures for determining intercity passenger rail \nroutes and services. The study will recommend changes to that process \nto improve the efficiency, accessibility, and effectiveness of our \nnational rail service.\n  I have long been a strong advocate for rail. I firmly believe that \nnation-wide investment in freight and passenger rail infrastructure \nwill invite rewards in the form of reduced congestion, improved \nenvironmental quality, and improved mobility options for our nation's \ntravelers. ARRIVE 21 encourages States, and the Federal Government, to \nmore fully integrate freight and passenger rail into the surface \ntransportation system. Improved rail planning policy, at both the \nFederal and State levels, will enhance the efficiency and longevity of \nour transportation system and will promote safe, efficient, and \nenvironmentally sound transportation options.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of \nARRIVE-21. I believe rail is a vital component of our national \ntransportation system, and investment in our Nation's rail \ninfrastructure is necessary for our economy, our security, and the \neffective and safe movement of people and goods in our country.\n  The importance of rail service became apparent in the Northeast long \nago, as we dealt with the myriad transportation planning and congestion \nissues that many other States are now just facing. These States are \njoining us Northeasterners in looking to the Federal Government to \nprovide the leadership needed to ensure that passenger rail is given \nthe priority it deserves.\n  It took Federal money, not just gasoline taxes, to build the Dwight \nD. Eisenhower Interstate Highway System. It took Federal money to build \nour national aviation system.\n  Here in the Northeast, the first part of the country to become \ndensely populated, we faced congestion problems long ago, and passenger \nrail service became a mainstay. In the Northeast, we rely heavily on \nAmtrak's high-speed service between Boston and Washington, D.C. The \nNortheast Corridor serves cities with four of the Nation's seven most \ncongested airports: Logan, LaGuardia, Newark, and Reagan National. \nAmtrak carries more passengers between New York and Washington than all \nof the airlines combined and, unlike airline passengers, rail travelers \nare able to stop in Trenton and Newark, New Jersey, and in other places \nalong the way.\n  Next month, New Jersey Transit will open for service a new rail \nstation in Secaucus, NJ. As a result of this opening, more than 15,000 \ncars will be diverted from our roads each day by 2010. That will reduce \ncarbon monoxide emissions by nearly 277,000 pounds each year. New \nJersey riders who switch to rail because of this one station will cut \ntheir gasoline consumption by 1.3 million gallons each year.\n  Also, in this post-9-11 environment we have a new perspective about \nthe national security interest in ensuring that there is more than one \nway to get from here to there, and this includes passenger rail. \nSeptember 11 underscored just how important passenger rail is to \nAmerica's economy and security.\n  New Jersey's economy is so dependent on passenger rail and mass \ntransit as a result of being the most densely populated State in the \nNation. New Jersey needs federal assistance for passenger rail \ninfrastructure. But New Jersey is not alone. As metropolitan areas \nacross the country continue to swell with people, our roads and \nairports become more and more congested. I think the prudence of \nincreasing our investment in another way to move people--passenger \nrail--has become more and more obvious. And ARRIVE-21 provides this \ninvestment opportunity.\n  The benefits of rail service are not limited to urban areas. In rural \ntowns across America, passenger trains may be the only option for \nintercity travel for many people.\n  From 1987 through 2000, I was the Chairman or Ranking Member of the \nSenate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation. During that time, \nI helped to secure 10.3 billion dollars in operating funds for AMTRAK \nand an additional 2.2 billion dollars in tax-advantaged financing for \ncapital improvements. Unfortunately, during that time, we have not been \nable to make the capital investments necessary to bring Amtrak's \ninfrastructure up to a state of good repair.\n  ARRIVE-21 gives the Federal Government the impetus to step up and \ntake charge with a strong program to invest in our rail infrastructure. \nThe States are interested, the traveling public is interested. This \nkind of investment will lay the tracks for the future of all Americans \nto have travel options, provide a national security role, and support \nour economy.\n  For these reasons, I am proud to cosponsor ARRIVE-21.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 1963. A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to protect \nthe privacy right of subscribers to wireless communication services; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Wireless \nConsumer Privacy Protection Act.\n  As every Senator is aware, consumers today rely on their wireless \ntelephones as a vital and important means of communication. Wireless \ntelephones enable families to stay connected, permit commerce to be \nconducted anywhere at any time, and provide a vital link in the event \nof an emergency. Some people have even abandoned traditional telephones \nand now use their wireless phones as their primary phone service. In \nfact, just this month, the Federal Communications Commission began \nrequiring number portability for wireless phones so that consumers, if \nthey wish, can make their wireless phone their only phone.\n  The wireless industry is on the verge of introducing a ``wireless \nwhite pages'' service, and though this step could have positive \nbenefits, it raises concerns about how consumers' expectation of \nprivacy will be protected. The\n\n[[Page S16005]]\n\nlegislation I am introducing today along with Senator Boxer ensures \nthat consumers expectations will be preserved.\n  An important reason that Americans increasingly trust their cell \nphone service is that they have a great deal of privacy on their cell \nphone numbers. For more than 20 years of cellular service, consumers \nhave become accustomed to not having their wireless phone numbers \navailable to the public. The protection of wireless telephone number is \nimportant. For example, wireless customers are typically charged for \nincoming calls. Without protections for wireless numbers, subscribers \ncould incur large bills, or use up their allotted minutes of use, \nsimply by receiving calls they do not want--from telemarketers and \nothers. Because consumers often take their cell phones with them \neverywhere, repeated unwanted calls are particularly disruptive, and \nmay even present safety concerns for those behind the wheel.\n  It may surprise my colleagues that today, no federal or state law or \nregulation prohibits a carrier from divulging your wireless telephone \nnumber. And with the industry poised to introduce wireless director \nassistance services, it is important for Congress to act now to \npreserve the expectation of privacy that consumers have in their \nwireless phone numbers. Because wireless directory assistance offer \ngreat benefits as well as posing significant privacy concerns, the \nlegislation I am introducing today strikes an important balance. It \nenables those consumers who want to be reached to be accessible, while \nproviding privacy protections that are important to consumers.\n  First, this legislation permits wireless subscribers to choose not to \nbe listed in wireless directory assistance databases. This feature \ngives consumers the ultimate ability to keep their numbers entirely \nprivate. Second, for those in the directory assistance database, the \nbill requires wireless providers to use systems that give users privacy \nprotections and control over the use of their wireless numbers. These \nservices must not divulge a subscriber's wireless number (unless the \nsubscriber consents to disclosure), the service must provide \nidentifying information to the wireless subscriber so that the \nsubscriber knows who is calling through the forwarding service, and the \nservice must give a subscriber the option of rejecting or accepting \neach incoming call. Finally, this legislation prohibits wireless \ncarriers from charging any special fees to consumers who wish to \nreceive the privacy protections provided by the bill. Customers should \nnot have to pay extra for the privacy protections that they have come \nto expect. There should be no ``privacy tax'' for consumers to continue \nthe privacy protection they have long enjoyed, and this bill ensures \nthat will be the case.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1963\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Wireless 411 Privacy Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) there are roughly 150 million wireless subscribers in \n     the United States, up from approximately 15 million \n     subscribers just a decade ago;\n       (2) wireless phone service has proven valuable to millions \n     of Americans because of its mobility, and the fact that \n     government policies have expanded opportunities for new \n     carriers to enter the market, offering more choices and ever \n     lower prices for consumers;\n       (3) in addition to the benefits of competition and \n     mobility, subscribers also benefit from the fact that \n     wireless phone numbers have not been publicly available;\n       (4) up until now, the privacy of wireless subscribers has \n     been safeguarded and thus vastly diminished the likelihood of \n     subscribers receiving unwanted or annoying phone call \n     interruptions on their wireless phones;\n       (5) moreover, because their wireless contact information, \n     such as their phone number, have never been publicly \n     available in any published directory or from any directory \n     assistance service, subscribers have come to expect that if \n     their phone rings it's likely to be a call from someone to \n     whom they have personally given their number;\n       (6) the wireless industry is poised to begin implementing a \n     directory assistance service so that callers can reach \n     wireless subscribers, including subscribers who have not \n     given such callers their wireless phone number;\n       (7) while some wireless subscribers may find such directory \n     assistance service useful, current subscribers deserve the \n     right to choose whether they want to participate in such a \n     directory;\n       (8) because wireless users are typically charged for \n     incoming calls, consumers must be afforded the ability to \n     maintain the maximum amount of control over how many calls \n     they may expect to receive and, in particular, control over \n     the disclosure of their wireless phone number;\n       (9) current wireless subscribers who elect to participate, \n     or new wireless subscribers who decline to be listed, in any \n     new wireless directory assistance service directory, \n     including those subscribers who also elect not to receive \n     forwarded calls from any wireless directory assistance \n     service, should not be charged for exercising such rights;\n       (10) the marketplace has not yet adequately explained an \n     effective plan to protect consumer privacy rights;\n       (11) Congress previously acted to protect the wireless \n     location information of subscribers by enacting prohibitions \n     on the disclosure of such sensitive in formation without the \n     express prior authorization of the subscriber; and\n       (12) the public interest would be served by similarly \n     enacting effective and industry-wide privacy protections for \n     consumers with respect to wireless directory assistance \n     service.\n\n     SEC. 3. CONSUMER CONTROL OF WIRELESS PHONE NUMBERS.\n\n       Section 332(c) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n     332(c)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(9) Wireless consumer privacy protection.--\n       ``(A) Current subscribers.--A provider of commercial mobile \n     services, or any direct or indirect affiliate or agent of \n     such a provider, may not include the wireless telephone \n     number information of any current subscriber in any wireless \n     directory assistance service database unless--\n       ``(i) the mobile service provider provides a conspicuous, \n     separate notice to the subscriber informing the subscriber of \n     the right not to be listed in any wireless directory \n     assistance service;

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Specter in \nintroducing the Wireless 411 Privacy Act of 2003.\n  About 150 million Americans subscribe to wireless telephone service. \nThey rely on wireless service to stay in touch with friends, family, \nand the workplace. As a cellular phone user myself, I value the privacy \nof my wireless number. I want to have control over who can reach me on \nmy cell phone.\n  However, the wireless phone industry is planning to list customers in \na wireless phone directory starting sometime next year. The Specter-\nBoxer bill would protect consumers by providing them with the right not \nto have their cell phone number listed in the directory and the right \nnot to be charged a fee for being unlisted.\n  As we saw with the strong consumer support for the right to keep a \ncell phone when you switch carriers, consumers consider their cell \nphone number their property. It is not the property of the carrier to \nhand out to whomever the carrier wishes, and the carrier should not be \nallowed to charge consumers for the right to keep that number private.\n  This is especially important when you consider that wireless users \npay for both their incoming and outgoing calls. Having your number \nlisted could easily lead to receiving calls that you did not want but \nfor which you will have to pay. That seems wrong to me.\n  To date, the wireless phone industry has been unclear on how they \nwill address these valid concerns when they move forward with their \ndirectory plans next year. To avoid any confusion or uncertainty, \nCongress must make clear to the cell phone companies that the rights of \nconsumers to keep their cell phone numbers private is paramount.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. STABENOW (for herself and Mr. Graham of South Carolina):\n  S. 1964. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to comply \nwith the World Trade Organization rulings on the FSC/ETI benefit in a \nmanner that preserves jobs and production activities in the United \nStates, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nManufacturing Opportunities to Revitalize our Economy's JOBS Act, or \nthe MORE JOBS Act. We are facing a manufacturing job crisis in this \ncountry, and that is why I am introducing this bill to help our U.S. \nmanufacturers to create manufacturing jobs here at home.\n  Since January of 2001, the State of Michigan has faced devastating \nlosses in the manufacturing sector. While the U.S. has lost 3.3 million \nprivate sector jobs--2.5 million in the manufacturing sector, Michigan \nhas lost 162,300 manufacturing jobs. That is 18 percent of the state's \nmanufacturing employment. In other words, 1 in 6 Michiganians has lost \ntheir manufacturing job in the last 2 years.\n  It is an unfortunate fact that Michigan is one of the leading states \nin the country in manufacturing job loss. Indeed, while the U.S. \nemployment rate is around 6 percent, Michigan's unemployment rate is \ncurrently around 7.6 percent. In some parts of Michigan, the \nunemployment rate is as high as 12 percent.\n  The people of Michigan and the people of the United States need \nrelief to help revitalize our economy. In the midst of these troubling \ntimes, we are faced with a new challenge: complying with a World Trade \nOrganization (WTO) decision finding that our Foreign Sales Corporation \n(FSC) and Extraterritorial Income (ETI) tax code must be reformed to \nmeet international trade law requirements. I understand that our \ncolleagues on the Senate Finance Committee have been and continue to \nwork diligently on this issue. Our country is one that plays by the \nrules and we will ultimately fix our tax code.\n  The tax benefits of the FSC and ETI, however, are valued at nearly \n$50 billion over 10 years. We cannot just take away these benefits to \nour American manufacturers without creating new tax relief for them. \nThe practical effect of that would be a $50 billion tax increase. And, \nthat is why we must create a new tax credit for our U.S. manufacturers.\n  The MORE JOBS Act that I am introducing today lays out a vision on \nhow I believe we should reform the code. First of all it, it phases out \nthe non-compliant FSC/ETI tax code over the next three years.\n  Then, to help our U.S. manufacturers, the bill creates a \nManufacturers' Tax Credit for domestic companies. A company, under my \nproposal, would be allowed to deduct 9 percent of its domestic \nproduction income before it has to figure its tax liability. In effect, \nthis would result in a new tax rate for our U.S. manufacturers that are \n3 percent lower--32 percent instead of 35 percent. And, my bill would \nmake this effective immediately, not phased in as others have \nsuggested.\n  The credit would be extended to a wide array of companies: small \nbusinesses, large businesses and agricultural cooperatives. So whether \nit is a small furniture manufacturer in western Michigan, a tool and \ndie company in Grand Rapids, or one of our automakers in metro Detroit, \ncompanies will be rewarded for their domestic production. And, our \nfarmers will benefit, too.\n  I often say that we in Michigan pride ourselves on what we make and \nwhat we grow. These two activities are vital to a strong economy, and \nour farmers would also benefit under my bill.\n  Farmers themselves, if they have at least one employee, will directly \nbenefit under my bill, since they qualify for the tax benefit as \nmanufacturers. In addition, agricultural cooperatives would also \nreceive this tax benefit. Farmers often belong to an agricultural \ncooperative which is covered under my bill. Agricultural cooperatives \ndo the processing, handling, storing, and marketing for their members. \nFor example, a farmer will sell his specialty crop to the cooperative. \nThe cooperative then takes the farmer's crop and puts it with other \nfarmers' produce and then stores and prepares the produce for sale to a \nfood processing company. The coop passes its profits on to the members \nof the cooperative based on the amount of business each member does \nwith the cooperative. So the tax benefits for the cooperative can be \npassed-through to farmer members of the coop.\n  Finally, one of the cornerstones of my legislation is that my bill \nwould create incentives for companies to keep jobs in the U.S. and to \nbring more jobs to our country. The MORE JOBS Act would encourage \ncompanies to keep their manufacturing in the U.S. by basing the amount \nof their tax credit on how much of their manufacturing is done in the \nU.S. Companies that have all of their manufacturing in the U.S. would \nreceive the full 3 percent tax credit. Companies that have much their \nmanufacturing outside of the U.S. would receive a reduced credit in \nproportion to their U.S. manufacturing. While other proposals being \ncirculated eventually eliminate this incentive, my bill would make this \nincentive permanent.\n  Why would we want to reward companies if they send their jobs \noverseas? We want to reward those who are contributing to our economy \nand putting Americans to work here at home.\n  I want to work closely with my colleagues to reform our manufacturing\n\n[[Page S16007]]\n\ntax code. In doing so, we will make our country stronger, our economy \nmore resilient, and we can create millions of new good jobs in the \nmanufacturing and agricultural sector. But we must do it carefully and \nwith a priority on our U.S. manufacturing base. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the MORE JOBS Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAYH:\n  S. 1965.

A bill to require a report on the detainees held at \nGuantanamo Bay, Cuba; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to speak for just a few minutes \ntoday on an issue on which I have introduced a bill. The bill is S. \n1966. It is a bill to require a report on the detainees being held at \nGuantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to shed some light on the process \nthat is being used by this administration to determine the status of \nso-called enemy combatants who are held by our Government at Guantanamo \nBay Naval Base. It has now been nearly 2 years since the first \ndetainees arrived at Guantanamo as prisoners of the United States. Yet \nthese individuals are still being held in what most would refer to as \nlegal limbo.\n  My colleagues will recall that on July 16, I urged the Senate to \nadopt an amendment to the Defense appropriations bill. That amendment \nwas tabled 52 to 42. It is essentially the same provision--it contained \nthe same provisions I have now put into S. 1966, this freestanding \nlegislation I have introduced.\n  The day after that amendment was defeated I sent a letter to \nSecretary Rumsfeld expressing my concern over the apparent lack of any \nkind of legal process being extended to the detainees being held at \nGuantanamo. Only recently I received a reply from the Department of \nDefense. In that letter, the Department of Defense maintains that it:\n\n       . . . reviews on a regular basis the continued detention of \n     each enemy combatant and assesses the appropriate disposition \n     of each individual case.\n\n  According to the Defense Department, at the time they wrote back to \nme, they said that the review had resulted in the release of 64 \ndetainees who were determined to no longer pose a threat to the United \nStates, and more releases were expected.\n  However, the letter fails to address the more important question, \nwhich is whether the Department's review of these detainees is being \ndone in accordance with any recognized civilian or military legal \nprocess.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the letter printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. What prompted me to come to the floor of the Senate \ntoday was an article I saw in the morning paper. This appeared in \nvarious papers around the country, but the one I have here in front of \nme is from the Boston Globe. It says:\n\n       The U.S. military sent home 20 ``enemy combatants'' last \n     weekend who were being held without trial at Guantanamo Bay \n     Naval Base in Cuba, only to replace them with the same number \n     of new prisoners.\n  It has a quotation from a spokesperson for the military saying:\n\n       We cannot talk about any of the individuals that may have \n     departed the island due to security concerns.\n\n  According to this article, all those transferred last week have been \nreturned, many of them to Pakistan, and all of those transferred last \nweekend, according to representatives from the countries they are \ncitizens of, said they will be released once they have arrived in those \ncountries.\n  The figure now, as I understand it, is there are 88 suspects who have \nbeen transferred out of Guantanamo Bay. Four were released, 4 were \nhanded over to Saudi Arabia, and the remaining 650 or 700 are still \nthere. As this article indicated, we continue to add additional people \nto this prison we are operating there at Guantanamo.\n  There are various complaints described in the article by foreign \ndiplomats about the process we are following. There is a statement by \nthe attorney for one of the human rights organizations that has \ncomplained bitterly about the improvisational policy decisions and the \narbitrary power over prisoners at the base.\n  My motives for offering this legislation are very simple. While I \nobviously have concerns about judicial treatment and the failure of any \nkind of legal process being followed in the treatment of these \ndetainees in Guantanamo, I am even more concerned about the \nimplications of this treatment we are affording these individuals for \nour own fighting forces as well as our international reputation.\n  The bill I filed here in the Senate today requires the Secretary of \nDefense to report on the status of these detainees, including the \nprocess that was utilized to determine that status for those who have \nalready been released from Guantanamo. The bill requires the Secretary \nto provide information related to this release, how long they were \ndetained, the conditions of their release, if any, the explanations of \nwhy the Department of Defense has now determined these individuals \ncould be released after what has in many cases been a very long \ndetention.\n  For the remaining detainees--those who are still at Guantanamo--the \nadministration has still refused to provide ``access to an impartial \ntribunal to review whether any basis exists for [detainees] continued \ndetention.'' The detainees have not been allowed to speak with their \nfamilies or their counsel, nor have they been informed of any charges \nagainst them, as far as I am informed.\n  The bill I filed requires that within 90 days of its enactment the \nSecretary of Defense provide the Senate with information related to the \nprocess used to categorize and hold these detainees. It does not call \nfor release of the detainees. It does not in any way, shape, or form \nrequire the release of any classified information other than to the \nchairman and vice chairman of the Senate and House committees. The \namendment merely seeks to clarify for the Senate and for the Congress \nthe process by which the detainees' status is determined.\n  Like most Americans, I have always thought that what distinguished \nour country in the history of the world was our commitment to \nindividual freedom and to the rule of law; that the bedrock of a free \nsociety is the obligation taken by the Government to afford individuals \nwith certain legal protections, and as a Nation committed to these \nprinciples we have been instrumental in the formulation and enforcement \nof international law, particularly when it came to the treatment of \nprisoners of war. For over 75 years, the United States has adhered to \nthe Geneva Convention. Even during conflicts with insurgents and \nirregular forces, we have adhered to the Geneva Convention. Whenever \nour Nation has gone to war, we have taken pride in going above and \nbeyond the requirements of international law as set out in the third \nGeneva Convention of 1929. In fact, the Department of Defense has \nadopted its own detailed regulations and doctrine and field manuals \nbuilt on the provisions of the Geneva Convention which have guided our \nmilitary through many conflicts regardless of size and scope and \nduration.\n\n  These regulations we have in our own military, like international \nlaw, do not contemplate the legal limbo we are holding these detainees \nin at Guantanamo. Neither the Geneva Convention nor the established \nmilitary regulations define or use the term the President is using \nhere. This term, unlawful combatant, is a new term which has come up in \norder to sidestep the requirements both of the Geneva Convention and of \nour own military regulations. Army Regulation 190-8 provides an \neffective and efficient process to\n\n[[Page S16009]]\n\ncategorize the detainees on the battlefield. According to that \nprovision, detainees must be classified either as an enemy prisoner of \nwar, a recommended retained person entitled to enemy prisoner-of-war \nprotections, an innocent civilian who should be immediately returned to \nhis or her home or released, or a civilian internee who, for reasons of \noperational security, or probable cause incident to criminal \ninvestigation, should be retained. Such internees have the right to \nappeal the order directing their internment by challenging the \nexistence of imperative security reasons that led to their detention.\n  The President's unilateral determination of the detainee's status at \nGuantanamo Bay signals a significant departure from the spirit of the \nGeneva Convention and a significant departure from the letter of \nestablished military regulations. In stark contrast to our Government's \nprevious commitment to adherence to the rule of law and human rights, \nthis administration has adopted a position that once the President \ndesignates that a person is a so-called enemy combatant or unlawful \ncombatant, a term created by the administration, that person can be \nlocked up and held incommunicado as long as the President desires, with \nabsolutely no legal rights; no right to review of that decision. This \nmeans even if the administration makes a mistake or is given faulty \ninformation, it is virtually impossible for the person involved to \nprove his or her innocence because not only can they not talk to a \nlawyer or to family members, but they do not have the right even to \nknow what they are being charged with.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to consider the narrow question of \nwhether the Federal courts have the power to hear challenges to the \ndetainees' imprisonment. This is a significant move towards restoring \nthe system of checks and balances, which needs to be restored--the \nsystem of checks and balances our Founders felt was essential to \npreserving liberty in the country. Similarly, the bill I have filed \nbegins to fulfill Congress's constitutional responsibility to oversee \nwhat the executive branch does. It calls on the administration to tell \nus whether its actions are in accordance with military regulations and \ndoctrine.\n  Our goal is to bring transparency to the issue and to fulfill \nCongress's constitutional role of oversight of the executive. We should \nknow what process the administration is using to determine the status \nof these detainees.\n  My concern is much broader than what happens to these particular \ndetainees. I am concerned about the impact of our treatment of these \ndetainees on the treatment of our own military personnel who are \ncaptured in future conflicts. Former U.S. diplomats and judge advocate \ngenerals and even former U.S. prisoners of war filed ``friend of the \ncourt'' briefs in the Supreme Court questioning the legality and wisdom \nof the administration's policy of open-ended detentions at Guantanamo. \nSome of those briefs were extremely thoughtful, in my view. One former \ndiplomat wrote:\n\n       It has been the experience of each of us that our most \n     important diplomatic asset has been this Nation's values. . . \n     . The hint that America is not all that it claims, that it . \n     . . can accept that the Executive Branch may imprison whom it \n     will and do so beyond the reach of due process of law demeans \n     and weakens this Nation's voice abroad.\n\n  In their brief, former judge advocate generals, the military's legal \nprosecutors and those most familiar with the law as it applies to enemy \nprisoners of war, strongly argue:\n\n       To be sure, this is a perilous time, as the President has \n     stated. But that does not justify indefinite confinement \n     without any type of hearing or judicial review. The United \n     States played a major role in the development and adoption of \n     the Geneva Conventions. The requirements of those \n     Conventions. The requirements of those Conventions are \n     incorporated directly into American Military Regulations. \n     American failure to provide foreign prisoners with the \n     protections of the Geneva Conventions may well provide \n     foreign authorities, in current or future conflicts, with an \n     excuse not to comply with the Geneva Conventions with respect \n     to captured American military forces.\n\n   Just as compelling are the stories told in the ``friends of the \ncourt'' brief filed by former prisoners of war. They argue that as a \nresult of their own experience as prisoners of war, the United States \nhas an interest ``in fostering the development, acceptance and \nenforcement of international norms pursuant to which prisoners of war \nand others captured during armed conflicts will be treated humanely and \nin accordance with the rule of law.'' They emphasize, that in \nparticular, they ``wish to ensure that the treatment by the Untied \nStates of foreign detainees . . . is such that the United States and \nformer American POWs retain the moral authority to demand fair and \nhumane treatment for any future Americans detained by foreign \ngovernments.''\n\n  However, nothing more clearly demonstrates this point than the actual \nstories themselves. Leslie H. Jackson, Edward Jackfert, and Neal \nHarrington are former prisoners of war. Mr. Jackson was captured by the \nGermans, who adhered to the Geneva Conventions. Mr. Jackfert and Mr. \nHarrington were held by Japan, which had not ratified and did not \npurport to follow international law.\n  If you will allow me to read them their brief:\n\n       Mr. Jackson was captured by the German Army on April 24, \n     1944, when his B-17 bomber crashed. Jailed and interrogated \n     for approximately one week, he was then transported to Stalag \n     17, a converted concentration camp. In his 13 months of \n     captivity, Mr. Jackson was granted the bare necessities: \n     shelter, minimal food, and the ability to socialize with \n     other American POWs. While the experience was harsh and \n     unpleasant, Mr. Jackson was never tortured or otherwise hurt \n     by the German guards. To follow the terms of the Geneva \n     Conventions of 1929, to which Germany was a party, Mr. \n     Jackson's German captors placed the appropriate Geneva \n     Convention signage in the barracks, permitted the \n     international Red Cross to ship basic necessities to POWs, \n     and allowed a Geneva inspector to survey the premises. Mr. \n     Jackson believes that his survival and relatively good health \n     while in captivity are the result of the German Army's \n     adherence to the 1929 Geneva Conventions.\n       The experiences of Mr. Jackfert and Mr. Harrington in the \n     custody of Japan, which had not ratified and did not purport \n     to follow the 1929 Geneva Conventions, offer a sharp \n     contrast. Both men were serving with the U.S. Army in the \n     Philippines when it surrendered to the Japanese in 1942, and \n     both subsequently served several years of hard captivity \n     beyond the reach of any Geneva Convention protections. Both \n     were part of the Bataan Death March and its well-documented \n     horrors. Mr. Harrington was forced into slave labor in a \n     Japanese coalmine, and saw his compatriots starved, beaten \n     and killed. Mr. Jackfert was also forced into slave labor \n     and suffered the extreme effects of heavy labor, cruelty \n     and inadequate nourishment, going from 125 pounds to 90 \n     pounds in a matter of months. There was no Geneva signage, \n     no recognition of prisoner rights, and virtually no Red \n     Cross access.\n       Nor were the experiences of Mr. Harrington and Mr. Jackfert \n     atypical. Studies have determined that the death rate of U.S. \n     Military personnel interned by Japan was as high as 40 \n     percent while the death rate of personnel captured and \n     interned by Germany was little more than 1 percent. . . . \n     Moreover, while it was rare for American POWs detained in \n     Germany to be tortured, the opposite was true for American \n     POWs in Japan. No one can adequately impart the suffering \n     most allied prisoners endured [in Japan]. . . . They were \n     beaten, kicked, robbed . . . and were buried alive. . . . \n     [T]he overwhelming majority endured ``hell on earth.''\n\n  Again, let me say, I am in no way suggesting that the detainees are \nnot being treated humanely. In fact, from all information I have \nreceived, they are being treated humanely. But what I and these briefs \nthat were filed in the Supreme Court are suggesting is that our failure \nto adhere to some recognized legal process in determining the status of \nthese detainees opens the door for other countries to refuse to adhere \nto any legal process as well. It may very well result in arbitrary \nconfinement and harsh treatment or other inhumane practices applied to \nour own citizens.\n  This bill will help Congress fulfill its duties and obligations as \noutlined in the Constitution and in U.S. law and regulation.\n  I hope we can quickly pass this legislation when we return for the \nsecond session of the Congress in January.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, Nov. 25, 2003]\n\n          US Releases 20 Detainees, Transfers 20 More to Cuba\n\n                          (By Charlie Savage)\n\n       Washington.--The U.S. military sent home 20 ``enemy \n     combatants'' last weekend who were being held without trial \n     at Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba--only to replace them \n     with the same number of new prisoners.\n       The prisoner transfer, the first such movement since mid-\n     July, followed a determination by senior military and \n     intelligence officials that the outgoing group ``either no\n\n[[Page S16010]]\n\n     longer posed a threat to U.S. security or no longer required \n     detention by the United States,'' according to a statement \n     the Department of Defense released yesterday.\n       ``We can't talk about any of the individuals that may have \n     departed the island due to security concerns,'' said \n     Lieutenant Colonel Pamela Hart, a spokeswoman for the \n     isolated facility at which the United States detains and \n     interrogates suspected terrorists.\n       But a high-ranking Pakistani official, who said yesterday \n     that at least five of the outgoing transferees were Pakistani \n     citizens, offered a chilly reaction to the Pentagon's news.\n       ``The government is happy, but this is too damn late,'' \n     said Imran Ali, second secretary of the Pakistan Embassy, \n     adding that 21 Pakistanis have been released from Guantanamo, \n     but another 37 are still there.\n       ``Their lives have been destroyed. Their families have gone \n     through psychological trauma, since they were not terrorists; \n     they were just low-level Taliban fighters.''\n       The Pakistani official's reaction illustrated the pressure \n     on the United States to resolve the situation--especially \n     from allies in the war on terrorism who have expressed \n     concern for their citizens who are among the 660 prisoners \n     from 42 countries being held at the base.\n       Although the State Department has been negotiating with a \n     number of countries to continue the detention of some, all \n     those transferred last weekend will be released by their \n     countries, U.S. officials said.\n       The Pentagon statement said that ``at the time of their \n     detention, these enemy combatants posed a threat to U.S. \n     security.'' It offered little information about the new \n     arrivals, except that they were transferred from U.S. Central \n     Command in the Middle East.\n       Navy Lieutenant Commander Barbara Burfeind, a Pentagon \n     spokeswoman, said none of the new detainees were captured in \n     Iraq.\n       The weekend transfers of the detainees bring to 88 the \n     number of Al Qaeda or Taliban suspects who have been \n     transferred out. Of those, 84 were released and four were \n     handed over to Saudi Arabia.\n       Ruth Wedgwood, an international law professor at Johns \n     Hopkins University, said the arrival of the 20 new detainees \n     follows a flare-up of fighting by Taliban insurgents in \n     Afghanistan.\n       Wedgwood has defended the Bush administration's position \n     that the rules of the Geneva Conventions do not apply to the \n     detainees because they were not soldiers of a regular Afghan \n     army.\n       ``Dismayingly, the Taliban have become very active again in \n     the southern area, so really . . . the war isn't over in that \n     area,'' she said.\n       Not among those who were transferred for release, according \n     to a senior Pentagon official, were the three ``juvenile \n     enemy combatants''--Afghans ages 13 to 15 who were captured \n     fighting alongside the Taliban and whose detention at the \n     prison has attracted particularly intense international \n     criticism. The commander of Guantanamo operations, Major \n     General Geoffrey Miller, had recommended that they be sent \n     home in August.\n       U.S. officials say they have been coordinating with UNICEF \n     in the event that the young fighters are released. UNICEF, a \n     United Nations agency that has offered to handle the juvenile \n     combatants, runs a program to ease the reintegration of \n     former child soldiers back into their home societies.\n       ``The State Department and UNICEF will make sure that if \n     they're returned to Afghanistan, they won't just be plopped \n     down,'' a Pentagon official told The Boston Globe last week.\n       Ken Hurwitz of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, a \n     New York-based organization, said that the surprise release \n     reflected the military's ``improvisational'' policy decisions \n     and its arbitrary power over the prisoners at the base.\n       ``It's the rule of law that's the point,'' he said. \n     ``They're saying, `Trust us, and we'll do the right thing.' \n     But there is no right thing unless it's pursuant to some kind \n     of ordered, lawful proceeding.''\n       Challenges to the detentions that have been filed in \n     federal court have so far been dismissed because the base is \n     located on Cuban soil--it has been leased and controlled by \n     the United States for a century--and outside the jurisdiction \n     of U.S. sovereignty. Two weeks ago, the Supreme Court said it \n     would review the question of whether federal court \n     jurisdiction may extend there.\n       In a related development, the lawyer for Army Captain James \n     ``Yousef'' Yee, the former Muslim chaplain at Guantanamo who \n     was arrested in September in the alleged mishandling of \n     classified material, sent a letter to President Bush \n     yesterday asking that his client be released from pretrial \n     detention for Thanksgiving and his daughter's birthday.\n       ``These charges do not warrant pretrial confinement of any \n     kind,'' Eugene Fidell wrote in the letter. ``While military \n     sources initially reported a wild laundry list of suspected \n     offenses, such as spying or aiding the enemy, these have now \n     been reduced to two relatively minor [charges]. . . . \n     Nonetheless, he is being treated as if the original laundry \n     list of charges was the legal basis for his confinement. This \n     is totally wrong and unfair.''\n       Sean McCormack, a spokesman for the National Security \n     Council, said he would look into the letter, but had no \n     comment on the president's behalf.\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HAGEL (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1967.

A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to enhance \nliteracy in finance and economics, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, it wasn't all that long ago that a good \neducation consisted of providing our children with a strong background \nin reading, writing and arithmetic skills, mixed with an understanding \nof history and a good hard look at civics and how our government works. \nWe thought, if our sons and daughters had taken courses in those \nsubjects and mastered them, they were as prepared as they could be to \nface the real world, get good jobs, and one day, live happily ever \nafter. Unfortunately, we left one vital skill out of the mix.\n  As an accountant, I have become increasingly concerned about the lack \nof knowledge we have as a society, and especially, the lack of insight \nwe share with our children about money and how to properly handle it, \nbudget it, and use it to plan for their retirement. The numbers are \nquite startling when you take a close look at how many of our children \nare leaving college already saddled with credit card debt and school \nloans that need to be repaid. It wasn't like that when many of us were \nin college. School didn't seem to cost nearly as much as it does now, \nand the scourge of a strong economy, easily available credit, hadn't \nreached the ranks of our schools yet.\n  This is a problem at the present time, but if we don't act quickly to \nmake sure our Nation's young people receive the advice and education \nthey need on handling money and planning their finances for the future, \nwe will have a disaster on our hands. Young men and women, in their \nprime earning years, are facing a mountain of personal debt at high \ninterest rates, with little hope of paying it off anytime soon. \nClearly, that is something we must take every action to help future \ngenerations of students avoid.\n  That is why I am introducing the Financial Literacy in Higher \nEducation Act with my colleague, Senator Akaka. Senator Akaka and I \nshare many of the same ideas with respect to the importance of \nfinancial literacy and ensuring our children have a grasp of the \nimplications of their actions when they use the credit they have been \nextended by banks eager to make quick loans at high interest rates. \nSenator Akaka and I worked together on language included in the No \nChild Left Behind Act to ensure elementary and secondary students would \nhave more access to financial literacy training that we hope will make \nour children wiser and better users of consumer credit.\n  This bill builds on the activities we helped authorize in No Child \nLeft Behind. It emphasizes financial literacy for students enrolled in \ninstitutions of higher education, or students who will soon be \nenrolled. With the training and real life advice they will receive in \nthese courses we will be able to reduce the number of our children who \nleave high school and head out into the world on their own with little \nor no preparation for the demands that will be placed on their limited \nincomes.\n  Our legislation would include financial literacy and personal finance \nin the list of permissible activities of several programs authorized \nunder the Higher Education Act. These programs are set up to support \nstudents, and I believe financial literacy should be an important \naspect of the support process. Attending college is a necessary step \nthat must be taken if our young adults are to succeed in the work \nforce, and learning how to make a personal budget and meet individual \nfinancial obligations should be a priority in that process.\n  Our bill would also emphasize financial literacy in exit counseling \nfor college students receiving federal student financial assistance. \nToday's undergraduate students are leaving school with an average of \nnearly $17,000 in student loan obligations. This can be a large burden \nto bear, but it becomes impossible to address if a young man or woman \nis unable to successfully manage their own finances.\n  The answer to this challenge is to start educating students before \nthey experience financial difficulty. Students who are faced with the \npossibility of accruing larger and larger levels of debt must be taught \nthe full meaning and significance of concepts as simple as compound \ninterest, credit scores, and minimum payments. That way, when they \nleave school with their lives before them, they will be able to plan \nhow to pay back their student loans, and keep credit card debt to a \nminimum. Taking the initiative while these students are in school will \nhelp them avoid some of the serious problems that can develop when \nsomeone has little or poor financial skills. These problems can \nliterally have lifelong implications for those who overextend their \nresources or fail to learn to live within the limits of a budget.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1968\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S16012]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Financial \nLiteracy in Higher Education Act with Senator Enzi and original \ncosponsors of S. 1800, the College LIFE, Literacy in Finance and \nEconomics Act, Senators Sarbanes and Corzine.\n  This is truly a bipartisan compromise on the provisions of S. 1800, \nthe College LIFE Act, and I appreciate Senator Enzi's willingness to \ncollaborate on this matter. As in S. 1800, the Financial Literacy in \nHigher Education Act proposes a pilot program for five higher education \ninstitutions to encourage students to take a personal finance course \nand participate in preventive annual credit counseling, working in \nconjunction with State or local public, private, and nonprofit entities \nselected by the local education agency or the school, and measuring the \neffectiveness of efforts in any behavioral changes that may result.\n  The bill emphasizes the importance of personal finance and economic \neducation and counseling by authorizing these activities as allowable \nuses in existing Higher Education Act programs, such as TRIO, GEAR UP, \nand title III and title V Serving Institutions. These are programs that \nhave been successful in expanding higher education access to \npopulations with unique needs and, therefore, are ideal avenues through \nwhich we can further the important components of financial and economic \nliteracy, such as wise budgeting, saving, debt management, tax \npreparation, and avoiding predatory or abusive practices.\n  The bill promotes greater collaboration with and support from Federal \nagencies in the higher education arena with respect to economic and \nfinancial literacy, including coordination with the Financial Literacy \nand Education Commission, which was created by title V of H.R. 2622, \nthe Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003. The conference \nreport of H.R. 2622 was adopted recently by this Chamber and the other \nbody. For those who may not be familiar with the Commission, the new \nentity will work to improve financial literacy and education in the \nUnited States through the development of a national strategy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan effort to increase \nthe financial and economic literacy of our college students. I will \nalso work with my colleagues on advancing the grant programs in S. 1800 \nthat are not in our compromise package, because I feel that those, too, \nare important parts of our overall effort. Students in higher education \nare some of our Nation's best and brightest, and we must work to give \nthem the tools that will help them succeed. Not the least among these \nis literacy in personal finance and economics.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n\n[[Page S16014]]\n\n  S. 1970. A bill to amend title 11, United States Code, to increase \nthe amount of unsecured claims for salaries and wages given priority in \nbankruptcy, to provide for cash payments to retirees to compensate for \nlost health insurance benefits resulting from the bankruptcy of their \nformer employer, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, over the last several years as the \neconomy came down from the high of the 1990s, we have seen how \ndevastating it can be for workers when their companies declare \nbankruptcy. From the enormous Enron bankruptcy at the end of 2001 to \nthe bankruptcies of Wheeling-Pitt and then Weirton Steel in my own home \nState, every bankruptcy has brought heartache for workers who had \ndedicated themselves to their employers. In many cases, employees and \nretirees have very limited ability to recover the wages, severance, or \nbenefits they are due when their companies seek protection from \ncreditors.\n  Workers deserve better. So today I am introducing the Bankruptcy \nFairness Act to strengthen workers' rights in bankruptcy and to provide \ngreater authority to bankruptcy courts to ensure a fair distribution of \nassets. Specifically, my bill will do three things. It will ensure that \nretirees whose promised health insurance is taken away receive at least \nsome compensation for their lost benefits. Second, my legislation would \nallow employees to recover more of the back-pay or other compensation \nthat is owed to them at the time of the bankruptcy. And lastly, I would \nprovide bankruptcy courts the authority to recover company assets in \ncases where company managers flagrantly paid excessive compensation to \nfavored employees just before declaring bankruptcy.\n  I am proposing this legislation as a way to start a dialogue about \nhow we can better protect workers whose companies file for bankruptcy. \nI do not pretend to have all the answers. But I do know that we must do \na better job of easing the burden that bankruptcy imposes on employees \nand retirees. And I believe that we can do so in creative ways that do \nnot make it more difficult for companies to successfully reorganize and \nemerge from bankruptcy. I look forward to the ideas and suggestions of \nmy colleagues.\n  In the simplest economic terms, employees sell their labor to their \ncompanies. They toil away in offices, plants, factories, mills, and \nmines, because they are promised that at the end of the day they will \nreceive certain compensation. One of the most important types of \ncompensation that workers earn is the right to enjoy certain benefits \nwhen they retire. Pensions, life insurance, or health care coverage are \nearned by workers in addition to their weekly paychecks. Yet, sadly we \nhave seen many companies in the last few years abandon these promises \nwhen they declare bankruptcy.\n  More and more we see companies taking the easy road to profitability \nby abandoning commitments that they made to workers. For retirees who \nhave planned for their golden years based on the benefits they have \nearned, losing health insurance can be a devastating blow. Retirees \nmust have the right to reasonable compensation if the company seeks to \nbreak its promise to provide health insurance. Under current law, these \nretirees receive what is called a general unsecured claim for the value \nof the benefits they lost. As any creditor will tell you, a general \nunsecured claim is essentially worthless in most bankruptcies. It means \nyou are at the end of the line, and there are not enough assets to go \naround. This law allows companies to essentially rescind compensation \nthat retirees have earned with virtually no cost to the company. Of \ncourse that is a great deal for the company, but it is spectacularly \nunfair to the retirees.\n  Recognizing that so-called legacy costs are often an impossible \nburden for a company that is trying to emerge from bankruptcy, my \nlegislation would still allow companies in some circumstances to alter \nthe health coverage offered to retirees. However, it would require that \nthe company pay a minimum level of compensation to retirees. Under this \nbill, each retiree would be entitled to a payment equal to the cost of \npurchasing comparable health insurance for a period of 18 months. Of \ncourse, 18 months of health insurance coverage is a lot less than many \nof these retirees are losing, but it can ease the transition as \nretirees make alternative plans, and it will discourage companies from \nthinking that terminating retiree health coverage is an easy solution. \nThe retirees would still be entitled to a general unsecured claim for \nthe value of the benefits lost in excess of this one time payment. This \nchange would ensure that retirees, while still not being made whole on \nlost benefits, will at least receive some compensation for the broken \npromises.\n  Many active workers, too, have a difficult time recovering what is \nowed to them by their employer when the company files bankruptcy. Under \ncurrent law, employees are entitled to a priority claim of up to \n$4,650. But that figure is usually not enough to cover the back-wages, \nvacation time, severance pay, or benefit payments that the employees \nare owed for work done prior to the bankruptcy. Congress needs to \nupdate the amount of the priority claim to ensure that more workers are \nable to receive what is rightfully theirs. The Bankruptcy Fairness Act \nwould establish a priority claim for the first $15,000 of compensation \nowed to an employee.\n  In most cases, employees have been working their hardest to help the \ncompany avoid the nightmare of bankruptcy, only to find that they will \nnot be compensated for their services as promised. As we saw so clearly \nwith the Enron case, employees are often left holding the bag when \ntheir company declares bankruptcy. In that case, employees were owed an \naverage of $35,000 in back-wages, severance, and other promised \ncompensation. They deserved to recover more than a mere $4,650 of what \nwas owed them. Let me be clear, this bill does not establish any new \nobligation for a company to pay severance or other compensation to \nemployees caught up in a company's bankruptcy. It merely ensures that \nemployees can recover more of what is already owed to them through the \nbankruptcy process.\n  I understand that many creditors or investors are not able to recover \nwhat is rightfully owed to them in bankruptcy, but employees deserve \nprotection that recognizes the unique nature of their dependence on \ntheir employer. Any smart investor diversifies his or her portfolio so \nthat a bankruptcy at one company does not bankrupt the investor. \nLikewise, suppliers and creditors that do business with a company \ntypically have many other clients. This is not the case with workers. \nThey cannot diversify away from the risk of working for a bankrupt \ncompany, and the financial hardship a bankruptcy brings is more \ndevastating to the average worker than the average creditor or \nsupplier.\n\n  Now, I know that some of my colleagues listening to this may be \nworrying that this legislation is insensitive to the needs of companies \nthat are trying to reorganize in order to emerge from bankruptcy and go \nforward as successful businesses. I am fully aware that sometimes, too \noften in the real world, the bankruptcy process can help companies stay \nopen and maintain jobs by restructuring obligations to creditors. Too \nmany companies in West Virginia have had to go through the painful \nprocess of Chapter 11 reorganization. I completely understand the need \nto keep the factories open. And I have always worked side by side with \ncompanies to help them recover.\n  I will continue that important work, and I have included a provision \nin this bill to help bankrupt companies that are struggling to survive \nto recover assets that have been pilfered from the corporate coffers. \nIn too many cases, company executives reward themselves even as their \ncompanies careen toward bankruptcy. The most egregious recent example \nis at Enron in 2001. In the days and weeks leading up to the bankruptcy \nfiling, executives granted large bonuses to themselves and their \nfavored employees. Millions of dollars were paid to a select group of \nemployees just before the company declared bankruptcy. It is \nunconscionable that executives would grant themselves undeserved \nbonuses and then weeks later claim that the company did not have the \nresources to pay its rank and file employees.\n  My legislation provides bankruptcy courts greater authority to \nrecover excessive compensation that was paid just prior to the \nbankruptcy filing. If\n\n[[Page S16015]]\n\nthe court finds that compensation was out of the ordinary course of \nbusiness or was unjust enrichment, the court can recover those assets \nfor the bankrupt company, ensuring that more creditors, employees, and \nretirees can receive what is rightfully owed to them by the company.\n  The reforms I have outlined are modest. They will not take the sting \nout of bankruptcy. By definition a bankruptcy is a failure, and it is \npainful for the company's employees, retirees, and business partners. \nBut the Bankruptcy Fairness Act I am introducing today would make \nprogress toward ensuring that bankruptcies are more fair to the workers \nwho gave their time and energy and sweat to the company in exchange for \ncertain promised compensation. And by helping a company recover assets \nthat should not have been paid out as undeserved bonuses just before \nbankruptcy the bill ensures that more of a company's assets are paid to \nthe employees, retirees, and creditors who are rightfully owed.\n  It is my hope that this legislation will receive serious \nconsideration from my colleagues, and that this can open an important \ndebate about how workers and retirees can be better protected from the \nugly side of prolonged economic downturns.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 1971. A bill to improve transparency relating to the fees and \ncosts that mutual fund investors incur and to improve corporate \ngovernance of mutual funds; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today, with my colleague from New \nJersey, to introduce a measure that is critical to improving the \ninvesting public's faith in our capital markets. This legislation, the \n``Mutual Fund Investor Confidence Restoration Act'' will fundamentally \nstrengthen protections for the millions of investors who rely on mutual \nfunds for their financial security.\n  America is the land of opportunity. Millions of Americans and \ncountless others around the world seek the opportunity to participate \nin the economic life of our nation. Mutual funds are a principal \npathway through which most investors achieve financial security. Mutual \nfunds have in the past not only lived up to, but in many cases \nexceeded, the grand expectations of investors. They are a true success \nstory of our securities markets and our system of securities \nregulation.\n  However, in recent months, a series of revelations has shaken \ninvestor confidence in the promise of mutual funds. We must restore the \nfaith of investors in mutual funds and those who manage them. This \nlegislation is designed to address some of the abuses and shortcomings \nwhich have received so much recent attention.\n  There are five broad areas which this legislation addresses: \ncorporate governance, disclosures to investors, late trading and market \ntiming, increased regulatory oversight, and financial literacy.\n  This legislation significantly improves corporate governance \nstandards at mutual funds. Investors have begun to lose faith that \ntheir hard earned savings are not being managed with their best \ninterests in mind. Mutual fund boards must have greater independence \nfrom fund managers and be more accountable to shareholders of the fund. \nDirectors and chairmen must exercise greater oversight to ensure that \nfunds are run in the interest of their shareholders--and be accountable \nto shareholders for failing to do so. Additionally, this legislation \ndirects the SEC to determine whether directors and chairmen need \nadditional tools to carry out that job.\n  This legislation mandates that corporate governance requirements \ncreated in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, such as director independence \nrequirements, financial expertise, and certification measures apply to \nmutual funds. Of particular note, this legislation mandates that funds \nemploy a chief compliance officer to ensure that internal controls, \npolicies and procedures are met by the fund in the interest of \nshareholders.\n  We need to improve the disclosures to investors about the fees and \ncosts associated with mutual funds. Current disclosures are inadequate \nin providing investors the information necessary to understand the true \ncosts of investing through mutual funds. The current expense ratio by \nno means includes all of the fund's expenses.\n  This legislation requires that currently unaccounted for expenses, \nsuch as brokerage commissions, advertising fees and research costs, \namong others, are fully disclosed.\n  Additionally, the legislation requires the breakout of these \nrespective costs to be displayed as a graph provided to shareholders \nthat will enable them to compare the costs associated with owning \nshares of different mutual funds. The ability to compare the total \ncosts of mutual funds with each other will drive competition and lower \ncosts for investors.\n  Investors deserve to know if their broker has a financial incentive \nto steer them into particular mutual funds. This legislation mandates \ngreater disclosure of financial incentives provided to intermediaries \nand requires fund companies and investment advisers to fully disclose \ncertain sales practices, including revenue-sharing and directed \nbrokerage arrangements and disclose the value of research and other \nservices paid for as part of brokerage commissions.\n  The recent abuses that we have seen with respect to late trading and \nmarket timing must be stopped to restore investors faith in mutual \nfunds. Insider dealings at mutual funds must never recur. Fund insiders \nmust be prohibited from trading against their own shareholders' \ninterest. Neither fund insiders nor preferred customers must enjoy \nprivileges like market timing that are denied to the millions of \naverage mutual fund investors.\n  Late trading is already illegal, but we now know it isn't isolated. \nThe system for prohibiting late trading in mutual funds must be \nstrengthened, so all mutual fund investors are treated fairly. This \nlegislation creates new requirements for intermediaries and funds to \nensure that illegal late trading activities are stopped.\n  As a result of the recent widespread scandals in this area, we must \nrededicate our regulatory oversight of the mutual fund industry. Due to \nthe tremendous size of mutual funds and how critical of an investment \ntool they are to small investors, this legislation directs the General \nAccounting Office to consider the value of creating a new self \nregulatory body and/or independent regulator for mutual fund oversight.\n  Lastly, this legislation calls for improved efforts to promote \nfinancial literacy among mutual fund shareholders. Ensuring that \ninvestors have the resources available to them to understand the \nbenefits and costs of mutual funds is a fundamental importance.\n  The Mutual Fund Investor Confidence Restoration Act is an important \nstep in the right direction of restoring the integrity of the mutual \nfund industry and will greatly improve the basic protections given to \ninvestors who rely upon these investment vehicles for their economic \nsecurity.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise along with my colleague from \nConnecticut, Senator Dodd, to introduce the Mutual Fund Investor \nConfidence Restoration Act of 2003, a bill that would improve the \noversight of the mutual fund industry, enhance fund governance, and \nprotect the millions of Americans who invest in these funds.\n  Mutual funds are the primary means for investors to participate in \nthe market. Approximately 95 million Americans invest in mutual funds, \nand investments total near $7 trillion dollars. The industry, one of \nour oldest and most-revered, is entrusted by those shareholders with \ntheir dreams of a comfortable retirement, the ability to pay their \nchildren's college tuition, buy a first home or pursue other life-long \ndreams.\n  It's not a stretch to say that in many ways the mutual fund industry \nhas been the standard bearer for ethical behavior, strong oversight and \ngovernance committed to investor protection in our capital markets. \nFew, if anyone, would dare to have suggested that our mutual fund \nindustry could become fertile ground for the types of `infectious \ngreed' we witnessed during the governance and accounting scandals a few \nyears ago.\n  But that is just what has happened.\n  Today, the mutual fund industry faces its own litany of scandals \ncentered on allegations of investor fraud,\n\n[[Page S16016]]\n\nflawed corporate governance, financial conflicts of interest and \noutright investor abuse. Names like Putnam and Canary Capital have \nbecome synonymous with Enron, Tyco and WorldCom in terms of the \nfinancial harm inflicted upon investors, undermining their confidence \nand trust in America's financial markets.\n  The vast majority of those who work in this industry are decent, \nhard-working individuals who make a significant contribution to the \nbetterment of our nation.\n  Unfortunately, there are also far too many associated with this \nprofession--including some investment advisors, fund board members, and \nthose in fund company management--who are all too willing to disregard \ntheir fiduciary obligation to shareholders in order to pursue their own \npersonal self-enrichment.\n  Investors should not perceive that the deck is stacked against them. \nThey should not think that there are different rules--one that applies \nto them and a different and considerably less stringent set that \napplies to wealthy industry insiders.\n  The legislation we are introducing today, The Mutual Fund Investor \nConfidence Restoration Act will make sure that the playing field stays \nlevel.\n  This bill has five primary themes: improving mutual fund governance; \nenhancing cost, fee and other important disclosures to shareholders; \npreventing abusive mutual fund practices such as late trading and \nmarket timing; strengthening mutual fund industry oversight; and \npromoting fund shareholder literacy.\n  Let me give a more detailed summation of what this legislation would \ndo and why it is so important.\n  Boards of directors for mutual funds have been criticized recently \nfor the high number of directorships that members hold, the lack of \nboard independence from fund management and the failure of several to \nfulfill their fiduciary responsibility to shareholders. This \nlegislation would strengthen fund governance by establishing truly \nindependent mutual fund boards, chairmen, nominating committees and \nindependent audit committees that conform to Sarbanes-Oxley Act \nrequirements for those at publicly traded companies.\n  The bill would also improve fund governance by requiring Sarbanes-\nOxley-like ``certification'' from Board Chairmen and newly-designated \nChief Compliance Officers that shareholders safeguards are in place \nwithin the fund.\n  Also, it would ensure that accurate disclosures to shareholders, \nincluding cost and fee information, are contained in the prospectus.\n  The legislation includes other `certifiable' requirements for board \nchairmen and chief compliance officers, including disclosures that \ninternal controls, a code of ethics and personnel designated to \nensuring adherence to stated polices and compliance with relevant \nsecurities laws, including measures preventing market-timing and late \ntrading abuses, are in place at the fund and with the investment \nadviser. Additionally, the legislation calls for the disclosure of \ninsider transactions by mutual fund managers and Board notification of \nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) deficiency letters.\n  Another issue of concern with the mutual fund industry is the \ninadequate and confusing disclosure provided to shareholders regarding \nexpenses. Fund shareholders are responsible for paying various fees and \ncosts related to the operation and trading activity of the fund. While \nfunds provide investors with certain fee-related disclosure, \nshareholders are largely in the dark about many other costs that impact \nthe value of their fund's assets.\n  The legislation includes numerous provisions aimed at improving the \ncost, fee and other disclosures shareholders receive from mutual funds. \nThese would include requirements that funds disclose the actual cost \nborne by each shareholder for the operating expenses of the fund and \nthe estimated expenses paid for costs associated with management of the \nfund that reduces the fund's overall value, including brokerage \ncommissions, revenue sharing and directed brokerage arrangements, \ntransactions costs another fees.\n  The legislation would require a breakdown of these respective costs \nto be displayed graphically, in order to provide shareholders with the \nrequisite information to compare the costs associated with owning \nshares of various mutual funds.\n  In addition these requirements, the legislation would require fund \ncompanies and investment advisers to fully disclose certain sales \npractices, including revenue-sharing and directed brokerage \narrangements, shareholder eligibility for breakpoint discounts and the \nvalue of research and other services paid for as part of brokerage \ncommissions, directing the SEC to study so-called ``soft-dollar'' \narrangements.\n  As I mentioned earlier, Mr. President, this bill includes measures \naimed at preventing abusive mutual fund practices, such as late trading \nand market timing, that diminish the shareholders' assets of a \nparticular fund. First, the legislation seeks to ensure that fund \ncompanies and investment advisers have adequate shareholder safeguards \nin palace, and that they `certify' these internal control procedures. \nThose would include establishing a code of ethics, improving the \naccurate disclosure of fund company policies, and ensuring compliance \nefforts are overseen by the chief compliance officer.\n  The bill also would also take steps aimed at directly preventing \nabusive practices and conflicts of interest. The recent scandals \nsurrounding mutual funds primarily focus on brokers and fund officials \nthat have engaged in the improper trading of mutual fund shares through \nlate trading and market timing. Late trading refers to the practice of \nplacing orders to buy or sell mutual fund shares after 4 p.m., and \nmarket timing is short-term trading in and out of stocks in the hope of \nexploiting an inefficiency in the fund's share price.\n  To address the issue of market timing, the legislation requires the \nSEC to ensure that fund companies are in compliance with the Investment \nCompany Act rules requiring them to use fair value calculation to \ndetermine the net asset value a fund company's securities when market \nquotations are otherwise unavailable or do not accurately reflect the \ncompanies fair market value. This provision would eliminate the stale \npricing that allows market timers to profit, often illicitly, from the \ninaccurate pricing of a fund's shares.\n  The legislation would also require the SEC to establish a rule \nrequiring fund companies and investment advisers to develop and \ndisclose formal policies related to market timing and short term \ntrading. Certification by fund company management would further ensure \nthat policies are being adhered to.\n  To address late trading, the bill requires the SEC to issues rules \nand establishes guidelines for trades in fund securities that go \nthrough newly established ``permitted intermediaries'', such as broker-\ndealers. The rules would allow these permitted intermediaries to \nexecute trades of a fund after the funds net asset value has been \nderived, if the intermediary has; a policy in place that the company \ndoes not permit late trades, mechanisms in place to detect late-trades \nand if that intermediary make those procedures available for inspection \nby the SEC. Non-permitted intermediaries would be required to submit \ntheir transactions to the fund company prior to market close.\n  To reduce other conflicts, the legislation would prohibit mutual fund \nmanagers from jointly managing a hedge fund, and would prohibit short-\nterm trading by fund and investment company management and requires \ndisclosure of insider transactions.\n  In seeking to bolster mutual fund industry oversight, this \nlegislation would require the SEC to review the allocation of the \nresources it has dedicated to industry oversight and the General \nAccounting Office (GAO) to study the feasibility of establishing a new, \nindependent regulator--the Mutual Fund Oversight Board. The bill also \nwould direct the SEC to establish incentives and protections for \nwhistleblowers and would require the GAO to independently review and \nreport to Congress on the coordination of enforcement efforts between \nthe SEC, its regional offices, and state regulators.\n  Finally, this bill calls for a study into ways in which we can \nimprove and promote financial literacy among mutual fund shareholders. \nAnd the legislation, through its enhanced disclosures to shareholders, \nalready makes a significant contribution to improving\n\n[[Page S16017]]\n\nshareholder understanding of the policies of the fund and the costs \nassociated with its management and operation.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1971\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor a tax credit for small employer-based health insurance coverage in \nStates in which such coverage is mandated, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the ``Small \nBusiness State Mandated Health Insurance Assistance Act.''\n  The legislation would provide a tax credit to small businesses in \nstates where the law mandates that they provide health insurance to \ntheir employees. The credit would be for 50 percent of the amount the \nemployer spends providing health insurance for his or her employees.\n  In California 6.4 million people are uninsured. That's more than 18 \npercent of the state. To deal with the issue, the state legislature \nrecently passed a law mandating that employers provide their workers \nwith health insurance.\n  Many smaller businesses have told me that they do not object to the \nlaw itself, but that they will have a hard time financially complying \nwith the mandate--especially in these tough economic times. \nFurthermore, there is concern that neighboring States without such a \nmandate will recruit our small businesses entrepreneurs to move to \ntheir states where they would not have to provide insurance for their \nworkers.\n  While businesses can currently deduct from federal taxes, as costs of \ndoing businesses, the costs of the health insurance provided to their \nemployees, this assistance is simply not large enough to provide the \nhelp that small businesses truly need. That is why I am introducing \nthis bill today. I encourage my colleagues to join me in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE:\n  S. 1974. A bill to make improvements to the Medicare Prescriptions \nDrug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, by adopting the Medicare Conference \nReport today, the Senate has done great harm to one of our most \nsuccessful and important social programs. As I have said over the past \nweek, I believe that this will not be the end of the issue. I believe \nthis is just the end of the first chapter.\n  And I predict that the call from beneficiaries and future \nbeneficiaries to repair this damage will be so loud that Congress will \nbe compelled to act. We are hearing already from seniors in South \nDakota and all across the country. For that reason, I am introducing \ntoday the Medicare Preservation and Drug Price Fairness Act. It is only \na first step in addressing some of the many problems in the Republican \nMedicare bill--but it is an important step.\n  This summer, the Senate passed a prescription drug bill. It was not \nperfect. But it was a start at providing the most necessary reform \nMedicare needs--covering prescription drugs for the program's 41 \nmillion beneficiaries. And I reluctantly supported it.\n  What came back from the Conference was no longer a bill to add a drug \nbenefit to Medicare. It was a vehicle for Republicans to harm Medicare \nunder the guise of ``reforms.''\n  I am introducing a bill today to address some of the main weaknesses \nin the Conference bill. It will not be the last of these bills \nintroduced. And it does not repair all of the damage done to Medicare \nby the Conference bill.\n  The bill I introduce today is simply an initial effort to carve out \nsome of the more egregious provisions of the Conference bill. It does \nnot address the critical issues of the 2.7 million retirees who will \nlose their good coverage or the 6 million of the lowest-income seniors \nwho will be worse off than they are now. It does not address the \ninadequacy of the drug benefit itself. We will come back to those \nissues in the near future.\n  The Medicare Preservation and Drug Price Fairness Act is a start \ntoward righting the wrongs done to Medicare today. It repeals the \nlanguage in the Republican bill that prohibits Medicare from \nnegotiating lower prices on behalf of beneficiaries. It repeals the \nhighly controversial ``premium support'' demonstration projects that \nwould force beneficiaries who do not want to join an HMO to pay higher \npremiums. It ensures that the guaranteed Medicare fallback is triggered \nwhenever there are not two stand-alone drug plans available in an area \nso that seniors are not forced to join an HMO if the one that is \navailable to them is priced too high. It repeals the $12 billion slush \nfund giveaway to HMOs and the $6 billion tax shelters for the wealthy \nand healthy. And, unlike the Republican bill, it allows Americans to \nobtain US-made drugs at lower prices safely from other industrialized \ncountries.\n  I noted earlier today when we voted on the Conference Report that \nthere were few, if any, seniors looking on expectantly from the \ngallery. And in fact, we have heard from them in large numbers that \nthey do not support the Conference bill. In contrast, the lobbies were \nfull of well-tailored lobbyists--and the big drug companies and the \nHMOs are the ones celebrating the passage of the Conference bill. The \nRepublicans got it backwards. The Medicare Preservation and Drug Price \nFairness Act is a first step toward the bill Congress should have \npassed--a bill that truly benefits America's seniors.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1974\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S16023]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to deny a \ndeduction for securities-related fines, penalties, and other amounts, \nand to provide that revenues resulting from such denial be transferred \nto Fair Funds for the relief of victims; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S16024]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce important \nlegislation designed to ensure that corporate wrongdoers are held fully \nresponsible for their illegal actions and that investors are given fair \ncompensation for such actions.\n  As most of my colleagues are aware, in April of this year, 10 large \nsecurities firms agreed to pay a total of $1.4 billion in fines and \npayments for giving their investment clients tainted and misleading \nadvice--advice which cost those clients hundreds of millions of \ndollars.\n  The ``global settlement'' was initially lauded as a historic victory \nagainst corporate wrongdoers. And indeed, thanks to the efforts of \nFederal and State securities regulators, and New York State Attorney \nGeneral Eliot Spitzer, the settlement has the potential to \nfundamentally change pervasive business practices that were so harmful \nto so many.\n  But the settlement's impact could be significantly weakened by a \nloophole that would allow the firms to avoid paying taxes on nearly \n$900 million of the penalties--by deducting them as standard business \ncosts.\n  Only one-third of the total settlement is specifically prohibited by \nlaw from being tax-deductible. If the firms are able to write off the \nremainder of the costs as business expenses, then the total price tag \nof the settlement will be much smaller than advertised.\n  However, there is much more at stake. America's financial markets are \nthe most vibrant in the world for one reason--investor confidence. The \nsecurities laws of the 1930's built the foundation for the deepest, \nmost liquid markets in the world. They have created a public trust in \nour markets among investors worldwide who know that we have a zero-\ntolerance policy towards corporate malfeasance.\n  If we allow firms to write off fines as the cost of doing business, \nthen we will perpetuate the idea that fraud is no longer a crime, but \nan accepted business practice. And we will compromise the very \nprinciples on which our markets are based--credibility, honesty, and \nresponsibility.\n  We need to send the strongest possible message to corporate America \nthat defrauding people of their life savings can never, under any \ncircumstances, be considered ``business as usual.'' Our tax code should \nnot reward these practices--it should discourage and punish them, to \nthe greatest extent possible. Otherwise, the victims of corporate \nmisconduct will include not only individual investors, but the \ncredibility of our capital markets. And if our markets suffer, so will \nAmerica's place in the world economy.\n  That is why I rise today to introduce my legislation. This \nlegislation takes two important steps towards fixing this problem. \nFirst, it expressly prohibits any tax deduction on payments for \nviolations of securities laws, including those required by the global \nsettlement. Second, it directs all of the tax revenues gained from \nthose payments into existing funds administered by the Securities and \nExchange Commission which repay money to defrauded investors. Under my \nbill, the perpetrators of corporate misdeeds will be fairly punished, \nand the victims will be fairly compensated.\n  Everyone agrees that restoring investor confidence is a crucial part \nof getting our economy back on the right track. The vitality of 10 \nlargest securities firms represent an important piece of this puzzle. \nBut Americans will only be willing to entrust them with their hard-\nearned money if they can be sure that they are being dealt with \nethically and honestly.\n  The global settlement represents a tremendous opportunity to help \nmend the tattered relationship between corporate America and the \nAmerican people. We can't afford to lose that opportunity in a tax \nloophole. We need to show Americans that corporate fraud is a real \ncrime--not business as usual. I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Domenici, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n        Jeffords, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Reed, Mr. Chafee, and \n        Mr. Inouye:\n  S. 1976. A bill to amend title XXI of the Social Security Act to \npermit qualifying States to use a portion of their allotments under the \nState children's health insurance program for any fiscal year for \ncertain medical expenditures, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwith Senators Domenici, Murray, Jeffords, Cantwell, Akaka, Reed, \nChafee, and Inouye entitled the ``Children's Health Equity Technical \nAmendments Act of 2003.''\n  Since the passage of the Children's Health Insurance Program, or \nCHIP, in 1997, a group of States that expanded coverage to children in \nMedicaid prior to the enactment of CHIP have been unfairly penalized \nfor that expansion. States are not allowed to use the enhanced matching \nrate available to other States for children at similar levels of \npoverty under the act. As a result, a child in the States of New York, \nFlorida, and Pennsylvania, because they were grandfathered in the \noriginal act or in Iowa, Montana, or a number of other States at 134 \npercent of poverty is eligible for an enhanced matching rate in CHIP \nbut that has not been the case for States such as New Mexico, Vermont, \nWashington, Rhode Island, Hawaii, and a number of others, including \nConnecticut, Tennessee, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Wisconsin, and \nMaryland.\n  As the health policy statement by the National Governors' Association \nreads, ``The Governors believe that it is critical that innovative \nstates not be penalized for having expanded coverage to children before \nthe enactment of S-CHIP, which provides enhanced funding to meet these \ngoals. To this end, the Governors support providing additional funding \nflexibility to states that had already significantly expanded coverage \nof the majority of uninsured children in their states.\n  For six years, our group of States have sought to have this inequity \naddressed. Early this year, I introduced the ``Children's Health Equity \nof 2003'' with Senators Jeffords, Murray, Leahy, and Ms. Cantwell and \nwe worked successfully to get a compromise worked out for inclusion in \nS. 312 by Senators Rockefeller, and Chafee. This compromise extended \nexpiring CHIP allotments only for fiscal years 1998 through 2001 in \norder to meet budgetary caps.\n  The compromise allowed States to be able to use up to 20 percent of \nour State's CHIP allotments to pay for Medicaid eligible children about \n150 percent of poverty that were part of our State's expansions prior \nto the enactment of CHIP. That language was maintained in conference \nand included in H.R. 2854 that was signed by the President as Public \nLaw 108-74. Unfortunately, a slight change was made in the conference \nlanguage that excluded New Mexico and Hawaii, Maryland, and Rhode \nIsland needed specific changes so an additional bill was passed, H.R. \n3288, and signed into law as Public Law 108-107, on November 17, 2003. \nThis second bill included language from legislation that I introduced \nwith Senator Domenici, S. 1547, to address the problem caused to New \nMexico by the conference committee's change.\n  Unfortunately, one major problem with the compromise was that it \nwould allow the 10 States flexibility with its CHIP funds for \nallotments between 1998 and 2001 and not in the future. Therefore, the \ninequity continues with CHIP allotments last year, this year, and into \nthe future. This legislation would address that problem and ensure that \nall future allotments give these 11 States the flexibility to use up to \n20 percent of our CHIP allotments to pay for health care services of \nchildren above 150 percent of poverty in our respective state Medicaid \nprograms.\n  This rather technical issue has real and negative consequences in \nStates such as New Mexico. In fact, due to the CHIP inequity, New \nMexico has been allocated $266 million from CHIP between fiscal years \n1998 and 2002, and yet, has only been able to spend slightly over $26 \nmillion as of the end of last fiscal year. In other words, New Mexico \nhas been allowed to spend less than 10 percent of its federal CHIP \nallocations.\n  With the passage of H.R. 2854 and H.R. 3288, that situations will \nimprove somewhat. Unfortunately, the change was not made permanent and \ndoes not apply to future CHIP allotments. This legislation would \ncorrect this problem.\n  It is important to note that this initiative includes strong \nmaintenance of effort language as well as incentives for our State to \nconduct outreach and\n\n[[Page S16025]]\n\nenrollment efforts and program simplification to find and enroll \nuninsured kids because we feel strongly that they must receive the \nhealth coverage for which they are eligible.\n  The bill does not take money from other States's CHIP allotments. It \nsimple allows our States to spend our States' specific CHIP allotments \nfrom the Federal government on our uninsured children--just as other \nStates across the country are doing.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1976\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to promote the manufacturing industry in the United \nStates by establishing an Assistant Secretary for Manufacturing within \nthe Department of Commerce, an Interagency Manufacturing Task Force, \nand a Small Business Manufacturing Task Force, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Small \nManufacturers Assistance, and Trade (SMART) Act,'' which responds to \nthe needs of America's small manufacturers. This bill offers a new \nemphasis on programs and services within the Federal Government that \nwill provide small companies a better opportunity to survive in these \nchallenging times and compete in our global economy. The SMART Act \nintroduces new resources, improves existing programs, and expands those \nprograms that work to serve a larger constituency. It is critical that \nwe revitalize our country's manufacturing base and establish an \nenvironment for economic growth and job creation.\n  Small manufacturers constitute over 98 percent of our Nation's \nmanufacturing enterprises, employ 12 million people, and supply more \nthan 50 percent of the value-added U.S. production. It is a sector we \ncannot afford to ignore. In addition, no industry has witnessed a more \nprofound erosion of jobs.\n  The damage manufacturing has sustained is nothing short of alarming. \nSince July 2000, almost 2.8 million U.S. manufacturing jobs have been \neliminated. New England alone lost more than 214,000 jobs between June \n1993 through June 2003, with 78 percent of those losses, 166,000 jobs, \noccurring since January of 2001.\n  In my home State of Maine, we've been shedding jobs at a startling \nrate over the past decade--and even more so in the past 2 years. \nBetween July 2000 and June 2003 an astounding 17,300 manufacturing jobs \nwere lost.\n  The bottom line is that we must bolster our manufacturing industry, \nespecially with the current 6.0 percent unemployment rate in the United \nStates. To ensure that the road to recovery is robust, we have a \nspecial obligation to provide the investment to allow small companies \nto grow. In fact, it has been reported that for every dollar of final \nmanufacturing output, an additional $1.26 is created in other industry \nsectors such as suppliers of raw materials, marketing, and retail \nindustries.\n  Looking even more broadly, a healthy manufacturing base is essential \nto the preservation of our Nation's security and its status as a world \npower. We must end the trend of becoming increasingly dependent upon \nother countries for the products we use and rely upon. Now is the \ncrucial time for everyone--industry representatives, Congress, the \nPresident, Republicans and Democrats alike--to work together toward the \ncommon goal of revitalizing this industry.\n  As the Chair of the Committee on Small Business, I have been focusing \nconsiderable attention on the concerns of small business manufacturers \nand efforts to aid in their recovery. Last month, I held a field \nhearing on this critical subject in Lewiston, ME. I invited Grant \nAldonas, Under Secretary for International Trade of the Commerce \nDepartment, and Pamela Olson, Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy of the \nTreasury Department, to participate and explored with them ways to \nstrengthen and expand this vital industry. Their testimony and comments \nconfirmed that we cannot delay and must act quickly to support our \nsmall manufacturing base.\n  Additionally, I heard from a number of small businesses in the \nmanufacturing industry. Their testimony confirmed the damage sustained \nby our country's manufacturing sector, and the sense of urgency that we \nneed to act immediately to assist them. The SMART Act is a vital first \nstep toward helping them do what they do best--create jobs.\n  The bill I introduce today starts by establishing a strong and \ninfluential voice for manufacturers within the Federal Government \nthrough the creation of an Assistant Secretary for Manufacturing within \nthe U.S. Department of Commerce. The new Assistant Secretary will be \nresponsible for identifying and addressing the concerns of small \nmanufacturers at the highest level of our Federal Government. Senator \nVoinovich has introduced S. 1326, which similarly creates an Assistant \nSecretary for Manufacturing. I support that bill and Senator \nVoinovich's efforts to assisting our country's manufacturers.\n\n  To ensure that the government acts on the needs of manufacturers, the \nSMART Act creates an Interagency Manufacturing Task Force (IMTF). The \nmission of the IMTF will be to encourage the Federal departments and \nagencies to coordinate their efforts by identifying and addressing \nmanufacturing concerns collectively. The IMTF will\n\n[[Page S16026]]\n\nbe chaired by the Commerce Department's new Assistant Secretary for \nManufacturing and will be comprised of representatives from the Federal \ndepartments and agencies that directly affect this sector of our \neconomy. In addition, the IMTF will be tasked with the duty of \nsubmitting an annual report on their findings and recommendations to \nthe President and the Senate and House Small Business Committees.\n  In conjunction with this government-wide task force, the SMART Act \nalso continues to improve the Federal infrastructure supporting the \nindustry by establishing a Small Business Manufacturing Task Force \n(SBMTF) within the Small Business Administration (SBA). The SBA has a \nwide spectrum of programs and services available to small \nmanufacturers. The mission of the new SBMTF will be to refocus the \nagency's programs and services to ensure that they respond to the \nparticular needs of small manufacturers while still serving all aspects \nof the small business community.\n  Adding to the information gained from the Committee's hearing, we \nhave reviewed the SBA's programs and services that are geared \nspecifically toward manufacturing and international trade. I was \nalarmed to learn, during this hearing, that small manufacturers were \nunfamiliar with the SBA programs that can assist them. These findings \nrevealed that the SBA needs to realign its efforts specifically to \ninclude manufacturers in the delivery of the agency's program and \nservices.\n  In order to improve existing SBA small business development programs, \nthe agency needs to take its services beyond the traditional small \nbusiness enterprise. The SMART Act improves the SBA's entrepreneurial \ndevelopment programs and services so that small manufacturers can grow \ntheir business operation, expand their facilities, and purchase new \nequipment--all of which will result in creating jobs throughout the \nindustry and its supply chain.\n  Partnerships developed between SBA related organizations and non-SBA \nrelated entities will be an additional asset for these producers. The \nSMART Act directs the SBA to develop partnerships with the \nManufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP), community economic \ndevelopment organizations, and the agency's resource partners--such as \nSmall Business Development Centers and SCORE--to create new outreach \nand training programs for small manufacturers and small businesses in \nthe manufacturing supply chain.\n  The SMART Act requires SCORE, with its long established expertise in \ncounseling, to extend its reach to small manufacturers and exporters \nthrough its online counseling services and its community based offices. \nThe Act also directs SCORE to recruit more counselors with \nmanufacturing and international trade expertise and increase its \npartnerships with manufacturing and exporting related organizations, \nwhich will help increase the marketing capabilities of these small \nproducers and exporters.\n  I have also learned that small and medium sized companies are often \nhesitant to engage in the export of their product as a way to grow \ntheir small business, because they are often fearful of the many \nunfamiliar intricacies involved in doing business in a foreign market. \nSmall businesses currently account for almost $300 billion of yearly \nexport sales--nearly one-third of total U.S. exports. However, \naccording to an Administration survey through the SBA's Export Trade \nAssistance Partnership, approximately 30 percent of non-exporting small \nbusinesses are interested in exporting their products and services. \nThese businesses hold the potential to be a major source for even more \neconomic activity and job growth.\n  The SBA is a pivotal resource in delivering financial and business \ndevelopment tools to businesses seeking to export. The SMART Act \nimproves the SBA's international trade and exporting programs to assist \nsmall businesses and manufacturers expand into the export market and \nplay an even greater role in the balance of U.S. trade.\n  The SMART Act also requires the SBA to establish annual goals that \nare linked to its trade promotion activities, and to develop programs \nthat will help small businesses compete against imports. This objective \nwill be more easily obtained by incrementally increasing the number of \nSBA representatives at the U.S. Export Assistance Centers (USEACs) over \nthe next 3 years. To ensure that all States have the same services \navailable, the SBA Office of International Trade will have at least one \nfinancial specialist dedicated to the international loan programs and \nproviding oversight of trade financing issues.\n  The SBA's financing programs have helped American small businesses \ncreate and retain jobs, even as other sources of financing have become \nmore scarce. This bill provides improvements to the SBA's 7(a), 504, \nand Surety Bond programs.\n  From Fiscal Year 1999 through Fiscal Year 2002, the 7(a) loan program \nhelped small businesses create more than 1.3 million new jobs by making \n$37.7 billion in financing available to more than 182,000 small \nbusinesses. This bill increases the maximum size of 7(a) loans for \nsmall exporters from $2 million to $2.6 million by increasing the \nmaximum amount guaranteed by the SBA from $1 million to $1.3 million.\n  During that same period, the 504 loan program provided more than \n20,000 new loans to small businesses, allowing those businesses to \ncreate or retain almost 450,000 jobs. The SMART Act increases 504 loan \nsizes in two ways. First, the bill increases the maximum loan size for \nmanufacturing projects by increasing the SBA's maximum guarantee, which \nis 40 percent of the total loan size, from $1 million to $4 million. \nSecond, for loans to exporters, the bill increases the maximum loan \nsize from $3.25 million to $5 million by increasing the SBA's maximum \nguarantee from $1.3 million to $2 million.\n  Finally, the bill clarifies that under the SBA's Surety Bond \nGuarantee Program, the SBA may guarantee bonds for specific contracts \nof $2 million or less, even if the total range of affiliated contracts \nmay exceed $2 million.\n  These SBA financing programs have helped to create millions of jobs \nin America, and manufacturers and exporters have been an important part \nof that success. This bill will increase small companies' and \nexporters' ability to obtain vital capital that will help them compete \nin a very difficult international environment and enable them to create \nmore jobs for American workers.\n  I am drawing these provisions from another bill I have authored, the \nSmall Business Administration 50th Anniversary Reauthorization Act of \n203 (S. 1375), which the Committee and the Senate unanimously approved \nearlier this year. While we are waiting for the House of \nRepresentatives to pass an SBA reauthorization bill, I believe that \ngiven the importance of these financing provisions, they must be \nincluded in this bill as well to increase their chance of being signed \ninto law.\n  Because Federal assistance for small manufacturers should extend \nbeyond the SBA, the SMART Act will also establish a new Assistant \nUnited States Trade Representatives for Small Business within the \nOffice of the United States Trade Representatives (USTR). This office \nwill be tasked with focusing on small businesses', including small \nmanufacturers, concerns in trade negotiations and promoting their \nexports.\n  There are currently 21 Assistant USTRs covering issues from services \nto telecommunications to labor. While small businesses face many of the \nsame issues that serve as barriers to trade as many of the largest \nmultinational corporations, they do not have the same resources to \novercome these barriers, thus blocking them from reaping the benefits \nof international trade. In particular, small businesses do not have the \nresources necessary to settle private trade disputes in a timely and \ncost effective fashion, meet physical presence requirements in other \ncountries, conform to complex customs procedures, or meet off-set \nexclusions in government procurement. By establishing a new Assistant \nU.S. Trade Representative, we will ensure that the views and concerns \nof small businesses will have an appropriate seat at the negotiating \ntable and help secure the competitiveness of our small exporters \nabroad.\n  The Small Manufacturers Assistance, Recovery, and Trade Act answers \nthe call for help that I have heard too often of late from small \nmanufacturers in this country. These improvements to existing resources \nwithin the Federal\n\n[[Page S16027]]\n\ngovernment will give these companies a better opportunity to survive in \nthese challenging times and compete in the global economy.\n  This bill is a critical starting point to revitalize our country's \nmanufacturing base and create an environment that allows them to grow \nand create jobs again. We must help these businesses access the global \nmarketplace through expanded exporting opportunities and assistance. I \nintend to work with all groups and interested parties that are \ncommitted to improving and passing this bill. There are still many \nneeds that face our Nation's manufacturers--and this is just the \nbeginning.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to ensure \nthat the provisions of this bill are enacted so that these companies \ncan continue to grow and reach their full potential.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na section-by-section analysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1977\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The Small Business Manufacturing Task Force.\n       This section establishes a Small Business Manufacturing \n     Task Force (SBMTF) within the Small Business Administration \n     (SBA), which will be comprised of the SBA personnel appointed \n     by the SBA Administrator. The SBMTF will: (a) evaluate and \n     identify whether existing programs and services are \n     sufficient to serve small manufacturers' needs, or whether \n     additional programs or services are necessary; (b) ensure \n     that the SBA implements the small business manufacturing \n     training initiatives referenced in this legislation; (c) \n     actively promote the SBA's programs and services that serve \n     small manufacturers; and (d) identify and study the unique \n     conditions of small manufacturers and develop and propose \n     policy initiatives to support and assist them.

Entrepreneurial development programs and \n         services.\n       This section: (a) directs the SBA to create new outreach \n     and training programs for small manufacturers and small \n     businesses in the manufacturing supply chain by developing \n     partnerships with other manufacturing and business-assistance \n     organizations and SBA's resource partners; (b) directs the \n     SBA to include ``manufacturing'' on their scorecard that \n     tracks the goals of the SBA and to report this information to \n     Congress; (c) directs the SBA to consult with manufacturing \n     and economic development organizations to develop and conduct \n     specialized workshops to address important aspects of the \n     manufacturing business; (d) requires SCORE to expand and \n     improve their present counseling services for small \n     manufacturers and exporters; (e) directs the SBA's Office of \n     Entrepreneurial Development to develop programs\n\n[[Page S16030]]\n\n     and services to strengthen small business vendors and \n     suppliers that participate in the manufacturing supply chain; \n     (f) directs the SBA to review and simplify its reporting \n     requirements for the Small Business Development Centers, \n     SCORE, and Women's Business Centers; and (g) directs the SBA \n     to provide adequate resources to the district offices for \n     outreach and training activities.\n\n\n                subtitle b--small business loan programs\n\n     Section 211. Increased loan amounts for exporters.\n       This section increases the maximum size of a loan that an \n     exporter may receive under the SBA's 7(a) Export Working \n     Capital Program (EWCP) to $2.6 million (instead of the \n     current maximum loan size of $2 million) by increasing the \n     maximum SBA guarantee to $1.3 million (instead of the current \n     maximum SBA guarantee of $1 million). In order to conform the \n     size of the guaranteed portion of an EWCP loan to that of a \n     loan under the SBA's 7(a) International Trade Loan Program, \n     the section also increases the maximum SBA-guaranteed portion \n     of an ITL Program loan from $1.25 million to $1.3 million.\n     Section 212. Debenture size.\n       This section increases the maximum loan guarantee amount \n     from $1.3 million to $2 million for loans that support a \n     public policy goal, which includes loans to exporters. The \n     guaranteed amount of $2 million represents 40 percent of the \n     total loan size, so small businesses will be able to receive \n     loans of up to $5 million for these types of projects. This \n     section also increases the maximum size of the SBA's \n     guarantee from $1 million to $4 million for loans that will \n     be used for manufacturing projects (leading to a maximum loan \n     size of $10 million for small manufacturers, because the \n     guarantee represents 40 percent of the maximum loan size).\n     Section 213. Job creation or retention standards.\n       This section modifies the job retention or creation \n     standard for small manufacturers (currently one job per \n     $35,000 guaranteed by the SBA) so that the small \n     manufacturers must create or retain one job for each $100,000 \n     guaranteed by the SBA.\n     Section 214. Clarification of maximum surety bond guarantee.\n       This section clarifies that the SBA may guarantee surety \n     bonds for specific contracts of $2 million or less when the \n     total range of affiliated contracts exceeds $2 million, or \n     has the potential to exceed $2 million. The surety's bond \n     liability, however, may not exceed $2 million.\n\n\n                    subtitle c--international trade\n\n     Section 221. Office of International Trade.\n       This section: (a) establishes annual goals for the Office \n     of International Trade--specifically, to enhance the export \n     ability of small businesses and small manufacturers, to \n     facilitate technological transfers, to enhance the ability of \n     small business and small manufacturers to compete against \n     foreign corporations, to increase small businesses' access to \n     capital, to disseminate information on programs and \n     initiatives, and to ensure that small businesses are \n     represented in trade negotiations; (b) instructs the Office \n     of International Trade and district office export development \n     specialist to participate in an annual training program that \n     focuses on current small business needs for exporting; (c) \n     instructs the district offices to jointly develop and conduct \n     training programs for exporters and lenders in cooperation \n     with USEACs, the Department of Commerce, Small Business \n     Development Centers and other relevant Federal agencies; (d) \n     amends the Office of International Trade's reporting \n     requirements to include a description and justification for \n     the Office of International Trade's expenditures on travel \n     and participation in trade negotiations; and (e) requires \n     that the SBA increase the number of SBA representatives at \n     the United States Export Assistance Centers (USEACs) over the \n     next 3 years according to the Commerce Department's resource \n     allocation methodology and to designate an individual within \n     the SBA to oversee the agency's participation as well as to \n     work with the USEACs partners to establish annual goals for \n     the Export Centers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 1979. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to prevent \nthe fraudulent avoidance of fuel taxes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today we introduce a bill to fight tax \nfraud. I am not talking about just moving around a few numbers on a tax \nreturn. Today we will begin closing the loop holes that have created \nmillions of gallon and billions of dollars of missing fuel and missing \ntax dollars. This problem not only robs the U.S. Treasury it also robs \nthe American Taxpayer.\n  We rely on these tax dollars to fund not only the Highway Trust Fund, \nwhich is charged with constructing and maintaining our national \ntransportation system, this also robs money from our Airport Trust \nFund.\n  In light of investigations completed since September 11th, the safety \nand soundness of maintaining our nation's transportation infrastructure \nis now more than ever of the utmost importance. These issues are not \njust tax fraud--not only are we concerned with the tax loss, but where \nelse is this money going--is it being used to fund terrorism? We need \nto know where all of this fuel is going. What makes us think that if we \ncannot find the fuel to collect the tax, that we could find the fuel to \nstop the terrorists acts. A missing barge could hold ninety tanker \ntruck loads of fuel, that's about $500,000 in Federal and State excise \ntaxes left uncollected, its also hundreds of thousands of gallons that \nwe cannot account. That cannot happen, and this bill should help our \nenforcement officers close the loop holes and collect the tax that \nbuilds our highways.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today Senator Grassley and I introduce a \nbill that is the essence of good government. For a few years now the \nSenate Finance Committee has been working to increase the revenue into \nthe Highway Fund Trust so we can fund a strong national highway \nprogram.\n  The committee has also been looking at preventing several schemes, \nscams and cons against the federal government. These are schemes that \nare used by participants in the fuel distribution chain to evade \nfederal and state fuel taxes, fuel fraud prevention marries both those \ngoals-fighting fraud and increasing revenue into the Highway Trust \nFund.\n  It is crucial to ensure that all the taxes that are due to the Trust \nFund are actually getting there, not being diverted as part of some \nscam to defraud the Federal Government.\n  That is why I am proud to introduce today the Fuel Fraud Prevention \nAct of 2003.\n  I am aware that this is a very controversial subject, but one that we \nmust address. This fraud represents money that the federal government \nis losing while crooked individuals are getting rich on the backs of \ngood honest citizens.\n  Uncovering this kind of corruption is what we mean by practicing good \ngovernment. We need to catch these folks and make sure the money is \ngoing where it should.\n  This is money that goes to transportation projects and creates \ntransportation jobs. That is important to Montana and to all states.\n  As a result of both TEA 21 and AIR 21, revenues collected by the \nTrust Funds are directly tied to spending on surface and air \ntransportation. Therefore adequately funding the nation's \ntransportation infrastructure--both surface and air--is almost entirely \nbased on actually collecting all the taxes that should be collected by \nlaw.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Sessions, Mr. \n        Bunning, and Mr. Inhofe):\n  S.J. Res. 26. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States relating to marriage; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to submit legislation that \nwould amend the United States Constitution identifying and reaffirming \nthe institution of marriage as a union between a man and a woman. The \nlanguage I submit today is brief and simple:\n  Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the union of a \nman and a woman. Neither this Constitution, nor the Constitution of any \nState, nor State or Federal law, shall be construed to require that \nmarital status or the legal incidents thereof be conferred upon \nunmarried couples or groups.\n  This language is simple, direct and to the point. This union is \nsacred and must remain so.\n  This resolution is a starting point for a more comprehensive \ndiscussion. I look forward to having an involved, informed debate with \nthe other members of this chamber.\n  I am pleased to be joined in this effort by my colleagues Senator Sam \nBrownback and Senator Jeff Sessions who are original cosponsors of this \nResolution.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this Resolution be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J.

Res. 275\n\n       Whereas, marriage is a fundamental social institution that \n     has been tested and reaffirmed over thousands of years;\n       Whereas, historically marriage has been reflected in our \n     law and the law of all jurisdictions in the United States as \n     the union of a man and a woman, and the everyday meaning of \n     marriage and the legal meaning of marriage has always been \n     defined as the legal union of a man and a woman as husband \n     and wife;\n       Whereas, families consisting of the legal union of one man \n     and one woman for the purpose of bearing and raising children \n     remains the basic unit of our civil society;\n       Whereas, in Goodridge v. Department of Public Health, the \n     Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts ruled 4 to 3 that the \n     Constitution of the State of Massachusetts prohibits the \n     denial of the issuance of marriage licenses to same-sex \n     couples;\n       Whereas, the power to regulate marriage lies with the \n     legislature and not with the judiciary and the Constitution \n     of the State Massachusetts specifically states that the \n     judiciary ``shall never exercise the legislative and \n     executive powers, or either of them: to the end it may be a \n     government of laws and not of men''; and\n       Whereas, in 1996, Congress overwhelmingly passed, and \n     President Bill Clinton signed, the Defense of Marriage Act \n     under which Congress exercised its rights under the effects \n     clause of section 1 of Article IV of the United States \n     Constitution: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the Sense of the Senate--\n       (1) Congress should take whatever steps necessary to affirm \n     the fact that marriage in the United States shall consist \n     only of the union of one man and one woman;\n       (2)(A) same-sex marriage is not a right, fundamental or \n     otherwise, recognized in this country; and\n       (B) neither the United States Constitution nor any Federal \n     law shall be construed to require that marital status or \n     legal incidents thereof be conferred upon unmarried couples \n     or groups; and\n       (3) the Defense of Marriage Act is a proper and \n     constitutional exercise of Congress's powers under the \n     effects clause of section 1 of Article IV and that no State, \n     territory, or possession of the United States, or Indian \n     tribe, shall be required to give effect to any public act, \n     record, or judicial proceeding of any other State, territory, \n     possession, or tribe respecting a relationship between \n     persons of the same sex that is treated as a marriage under \n     the laws of such State, territory, possession, or tribe, or a \n     right or claim arising from such relationship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S16031-2", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 276--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING \n FIGHTING TERROR AND EMBRACING EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN \n                                 PEACE\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. \nLeahy, and Mr. Lautenberg) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Res. 278\n\n       Whereas military personnel are asked to risk and even \n     sacrifice their lives and the well-being of their families in \n     defense of the United States;\n       Whereas vaccines are an important factor in ensuring force \n     health protection by protecting the military personnel of the \n     United States from both natural health threats and health \n     threats resulting from biological weapons in overseas \n     conflicts;\n       Whereas vaccines offer significant benefits and protections \n     that must be carefully balanced with the reality that \n     vaccines and drugs generally carry rare but serious adverse \n     events and life-threatening risks;\n       Whereas in 2002, the insert label for the anthrax vaccine \n     required by the Food and Drug Administration was revised to \n     include approximately 40 serious adverse events with \n     information that ``approximately 6 percent of the reported \n     events were listed as serious.'';\n\n[[Page S16032]]\n\n       Whereas in 2002, the Food and Drug Administration also \n     compelled the manufacturer of the anthrax vaccine to \n     substantially revise the package insert and changed the risk \n     to pregnant women from Category C (a possible risk) to \n     Category D (a known risk) because of ``positive evidence of \n     human fetal risk based on adverse reaction data from \n     investigational or marketing experience or studies in \n     humans'';\n       Whereas in 2002, the General Accounting Office reported \n     ``an estimated 84 percent of the personnel who had had \n     anthrax vaccine shots between September 1998 and September \n     2000 reported having side effects or reactions. This rate is \n     more than double the level cited in the vaccine product \n     insert. Further, about 24 percent of all events were \n     classified as systemic--a level more than a hundred times \n     higher than that estimated in the product insert at the \n     time'';\n       Whereas in June 2003, the Advisory Committee on \n     Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention withdrew its support for expanding the smallpox \n     vaccination program for first-responders after finding that 1 \n     in 500 civilians vaccinated for smallpox had a serious \n     vaccine event;\n       Whereas in 2002, the General Accounting Office found that \n     69 percent of experienced pilots and aircrew members in the \n     National Guard and the Reserve reported that the anthrax shot \n     was the major influence in their decision to change their \n     military status in 2000, including leaving the military \n     entirely;\n       Whereas in the war in Iraq that continues as of the date of \n     enactment of this resolution, the British and Australian \n     militaries have conducted voluntary anthrax vaccine programs, \n     and other allies who have been offered the anthrax vaccine \n     have declined;\n       Whereas in March 2000, the National Institute of Allergy \n     and Infectious Disease reported in the ``Jordan Report 20th \n     Anniversary: Accelerated Development of Vaccines 2000'' that \n     no data existed to support the effectiveness of the anthrax \n     vaccine against pulmonary (inhalation) anthrax in humans;\n       Whereas because anthrax can be prevented and treated with \n     antibiotics and other options are either in clinical trials \n     or development, the current anthrax vaccine is not the only \n     choice for force health protection;\n       Whereas in the 2002 State of the Union address, President \n     Bush placed a national priority on developing a new anthrax \n     vaccine and a newer and safer smallpox vaccine is also in \n     development; and\n       Whereas the threat of anthrax and smallpox attacks against \n     the deployed troops of the United States has significantly \n     diminished since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein and the \n     disruption of Al Qaeda activity in Afghanistan: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Secretary of Defense should reconsider the \n     mandatory nature of the anthrax and smallpox vaccine \n     immunization program, pending the development of new and \n     better vaccines that are under development as of the date of \n     enactment of this resolution;\n       (2) the Secretary of Defense and Board for Correction of \n     Military Records should reconsider adverse actions already \n     taken or intended to be taken against servicemembers for \n     refusing to accept the anthrax or smallpox vaccine;\n       (3) the Secretary of Defense and the intelligence community \n     should reevaluate the threat of anthrax and smallpox attacks \n     on troops in Iraq and Afghanistan to reflect operational \n     realities as of the date of enactment of this resolution when \n     considering the continuation of a mandatory military \n     vaccination program; and\n       (4) the Secretary of Veterans Affairs should assess those \n     adverse events being reported with respect to the anthrax and \n     smallpox vaccines, research causal relationships, and \n     estimate a future cost to the Department to treat these \n     conditions.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, throughout the conflict in Iraq, our \nbrave soldiers have carried out their duties with strength, with honor, \nand with courage. They have never faltered in their service to this \nnation or the world. That is why I am so troubled that some of our \nservicemembers and their families believe that current Department of \nDefense policies may be failing them, with grievous consequences.\n  That is why I rise today to submit a Sense of the Senate Resolution \nthat asks for reconsideration of the policies surrounding the current \nsmallpox and anthrax immunization programs. Specifically it asks the \nSecretary of Defense to reconsider the mandatory nature of its smallpox \nand anthrax vaccine immunization programs pending the development of \nnew and better vaccines that are currently under development; \nreconsider adverse actions taken against servicemembers on the basis of \nrefusal to take the smallpox or anthrax vaccines; and reevaluate, with \nthe intelligence community, the current threat of anthrax and smallpox \nattacks on our troops, in an effort to reflect current operational \nrealities when considering the continuation of a mandatory vaccination \nprogram.\n  It also urges the Department of Veterans Affairs to assess these \nadverse events being reported with respect to the smallpox and anthrax \nvaccines, research causal relationships, and estimate a future cost to \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs to treat these conditions.\n  Vaccines are an important factor in ensuring protection of our \nnation's military personnel from health threats--both natural or from \nbiological weapons--in overseas conflicts. However, the current \nsmallpox and anthrax vaccines have real and serious consequences that \nmust be weighed against the potential benefits. This is why the \nPresident has made development of a modern anthrax vaccine a national \npriority in his last two State of the Union addresses and why the \nInstitute of Medicine urged the government to do so in March 2002.\n  What are the consequences of a policy that makes it mandatory that \nmilitary personnel get the anthrax and smallpox vaccines? First, there \nare a growing number of adverse events reported in conjunction with \nthese two vaccines, which is in sharp contrast to other vaccines. \nSecond, there is a morale problem in the military associated with the \nmandatory nature of requiring military personnel to take these shots \nthat has a serious negative impact on the recruitment and retention of \nour military personnel. Third, the long-term consequences of the \nvaccine programs for the health and well-being of our military \npersonnel and our veterans is in question and should be addressed.\n  Ensuring the health and well-being of our military personnel before, \nduring and after serving our country should always be a top priority of \nour nation.\n  The major potential benefit of any vaccine would be force protection. \nUnfortunately, there are major questions that arise with this argument \nconcerning the anthrax and smallpox vaccines. First, even if there was \na threat, such a threat against our troops in the conflicts in Iraq and \nAfghanistan has been significantly diminished. Second, there are other \nmechanisms to address any potential exposure, including post-exposure \nvaccination and antibiotics. This was the effective treatment used in \nthe Senate after the anthrax exposure in 2001. Third, we do not even \nknow if the anthrax vaccine works at all on inhalation anthrax or \nweaponized anthrax, so the vaccine may be completely ineffective \nanyway.\n  For our brave men and women serving in harm's way, all too often the \nfirst threat they face is not when their boots hit the ground in \nBaghdad, Iraq, or Kandahar, Afghanistan--the first threat many \nservicemembers believe they face may be in line at the home station \nwhen they receive their anthrax and smallpox vaccinations.\n  There is a growing number of disturbing reports about how some of our \nservicemembers have contracted health problems shortly after receiving \nthe anthrax and smallpox vaccines. These illnesses include mysterious \npneumonia-like illnesses, heart problems, blood clots, and other \nmedical conditions that have stricken otherwise young, healthy, and \nstrong military personnel. It has even resulted in death.\n  This is not entirely surprising, in light of the fact that the Food \nand Drug Administration, or FDA, has identified a number of adverse \nreactions associated with these two vaccines. With respect to the \nanthrax vaccine alone, in 2002 the FDA required the anthrax vaccine \nproduct label be revised and it now includes approximately 40 serious \nadverse events. As it reads, ``Approximately 6% of the reported events \nwere listed as serious. Serious adverse events include those that \nresult in death, hospitalization, permanent disability or are life-\nthreatening.'' The FDA also raised the rate of systemic reactions by up \nto 175 times over the previous 1999 product label, from 0.2 percent to \n5-35 percent\n  Meanwhile, in light of adverse events that exceed those for other \nvaccines and other concerns about the smallpox vaccine, both the \nInstitute of Medicine and the Advisory Committee on Immunization \nPractices recently issued recommendations calling for a pause in the \nFederal Government's smallpox vaccination program.\n  Meanwhile, both CBS News and UPI have identified a growing number of \ndeaths and severe illnesses that they\n\n[[Page S16033]]\n\nclaim point to the anthrax and smallpox vaccines. These include the \ndeaths of Army SP4 Joshua Neusche, Army SGT Michael Tosto, LTC Anthony \nSherman, Army SP4 Rachel Lacy, Army SP4 Zeferino Colunga, Army SP4 Cory \nHubbell, Army SP4 Levi Kinchen, Army SSG Richard Eaton, Jr., Army PVT \nMatthew Bush, Army SSG David Loyd, and Army SP4 William Jeffries. Eight \nof these 11 Army personnel were under the age of 25.\n  As Dr. Jeffrey Sartin, and infectious disease doctor at the Gundersen \nClinic in La Crosse, WI, said, ``I would say that the number of cases \namong young healthy troops would seem to be unusual.''\n  The numbers of those with adverse health events is significantly \nhigher. There have been around 700 adverse events reported in just the \nfirst 6 months of this year and this is as part of a reporting system \nthat has been found to significantly under-report adverse events.\n  In addition, there are the reports of problems at both Ft. Stewart \nand Ft. Knox with respect to sick and injured soldiers who have been \nwaiting weeks and sometimes months for medical treatment. Senators \nLeahy and Bond should be commended for drawing attention to those \nproblems and getting the military to move to address it. What remains \ndisturbing is that many of those who are ill and on ``medical hold'' \nwere never deployed. At Ft. Stewart, Senators Bond and Leahy found that \none-third of the 650 soldiers awaiting medical care and follow-up \nevaluations were not physically qualified for deployment and therefore \nnever deployed overseas.\n  At Ft. Knox, according to a UPI story, 369 of the 422 soldiers at Ft. \nKnox did not deploy to Operation Iraqi Freedom because of their \nillnesses. This includes, according to the story, ``strange clusters of \nheart problems and breathing problems, as did soldiers at Ft. Stewart \nand other locations.'' These are health problems that are often cited \nas adverse events accompanying the anthrax and smallpox vaccines. Once \nagain, there is a surprising number of such cases in what are otherwise \na strong, healthy, and young group of people.\n  We certainly do not know whether these cases have been caused by the \nanthrax or smallpox vaccines at this point. In fact, these personnel \ndesperately await any medical treatment and that must be addressed. \nWhile the military works to address that problem, they should also \nreconsider the mandatory nature of the anthrax and smallpox vaccines, \nas they may be contributing heavily to the problem.\n  In the case of Army SP4 Rachel Lacy, who loved her country and \nvolunteered to deploy to the Persian Gulf, she was ordered to take the \nanthrax vaccine and did so without objection. Within days, she started \nto suffer pneumonia and flu-like symptoms. Within weeks, she was dead. \nThe coroner listed ``post-vaccine'' problems on the death certificate \nfor Rachel Lacy and said, ``it's just very suspicious in my mind . . . \nthat she's healthy, gets the vaccinations and then dies a couple weeks \nlater.''\n  The Army is, according to published reports, conducting an \ninvestigation of the 100 or more soldiers that have gotten pneumonia in \nIraq and southwestern Asia. Of those 100, 2 have died and another 13 \nhave had to be put on respirators.\n  According to a story published in both the New York Times and \nWashington Post on November 19, 2003, as part of that investigation, \nthe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the Armed Services \nEpidemiology Board said the evidence ``strongly favors'' the belief \nthat vaccines led to the death of Rachel Lacy. It was an important \nadmission and yet the military immediately said its vaccination \npolicies would ``not be changed.''\n  Rachel's father, Moses Lacy, has asked, ``Let's stop this, re-\nevaluate what we're doing, re-evaluate the risks.'' That is a \nreasonable request and our nation's servicemembers and families deserve \nit. We owe it to the Lacy family and to all our military personnel and \ntheir families.\n  As a result of the concerns of servicemembers and their families that \nthese vaccines are having on their health and well-being, it must also \nbe noted that the anthrax and smallpox vaccines are having serious \nconsequences for our nation's military readiness. In September 2002, \nthe General Accounting Office reported that 69 percent of trained and \nexperienced pilots and aircrew members in the Guard and Reserve \nreported that the anthrax shot was the major influence in their \ndecision to change their military status in 2002, including leaving the \nmilitary entirely.\n  Responding to the serious recruitment and retention problems caused \nby the mandatory anthrax vaccine policy, in February 2000, my colleague \nand then Presidential candidate John McCain called for a moratorium of \nthis policy. Unfortunately, the safety concerns Senator McCain noted \nthen have not been resolved. The military continues to deny problems \nwith the vaccine while simultaneously operating a clinic at Walter Reed \nArmy Medical Center to treat the illnesses caused by the vaccine.\n  Instead of reconsidering its policy, the DOD has, instead, \naggressively moved against those who have refused the vaccines. After \nhis testimony before the House Government Reform Committee, Major \nSonnie Bates, the highest ranking officer to refuse the anthrax \nvaccination, was charged under article 15 of the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice and the Department of Defense moved to court-martial \nhim. After accusations of reprisal came from the Congress, the \nDepartment of Defense backed down and discharged Major Bates.\n\n  There is also the case of Air Force Captain John Buck, M.D. He was \ncourt-martialed for refusing the anthrax vaccine in a trial in which \nthe judge refused to allow the jury to hear the doctor's views on its \nsafety and efficacy. After he was convicted, fined $21,000, and denied \na promotion he had earned, Dr. Buck deployed to the Indian Ocean after \nSeptember 11th to support U.S. military operations in Afghanistan. He \nwas awarded a medal for his service in support of Operation Enduring \nFreedom and subsequently given an honorable discharge.\n  In fact, the military has court-martialed soldiers throughout the \nmilitary for refusing the anthrax vaccine, including a case this spring \nin New York of Private Rhonda Hazley who refused the vaccine because \nshe was breast-feeding her child. One of the things this resolution \nasks is for the Department of Defense to reconsider adverse actions \ntaken against servicemembers on the basis of refusal to take the \nsmallpox or anthrax vaccines. The court-martialing of a woman that \nrefused these vaccines because she was breast-feeding is particularly \ndisturbing.\n  It is important to note that the FDA revised the product label for \nthe anthrax vaccine from ``a possible risk'' to a ``known risk'' to \npregnant women because of ``positive evidence of human fetal risk based \non adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience \nor studies in humans.'' While Private Hazley was no longer pregnant, \nthe FDA does believe the ``pregnancy and lactation are a clinical \ncontinuum.'' Once again, the risks of the vaccine would appear to far \noutweigh the benefit to a mother and mechanic in the Army.\n  The DOD's actions in such cases have created a climate of distrust \nand fear within the ranks of the military. This comply or be discharged \nor prosecuted policy is of great concern to our brave young men and \nwomen in uniform, and in the case of Private Hazley, to her child. \nAgain, due to this policy, many soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines \nto reevaluate their commitment to the military.\n  The military has argued that we need a mandatory program with respect \nto our nation's military personnel as part of ensuring force \nprotection. However, I understand that our allies--both the British and \nAustralians--have not made the anthrax vaccines mandatory in the Iraqi \nFreedom Operation. As those two nations weighed the potential \nconsequences of requiring all military personnel to get the vaccines \nversus any potential benefit, they came down on the side of making the \nvaccine voluntary.\n  In the case of the British military, more than half the armed forces \npersonnel deployed in the Gulf have refused to be vaccinated against \nanthrax. The British Ministry of Defense spokesman said that this \npolicy would remain voluntary ``in accordance with\n\n[[Page S16034]]\n\nlong-standing medical practice.'' Of interest, British army units that \nwould be responsible for dealing with suspect chemical and biological \nsites are given the smallpox vaccine but still are not required to get \nthe anthrax vaccine.\n  For those that have agreed to accept the anthrax vaccine among \nBritish troops, they are reporting a large number of adverse events. \nAccording to a report by the British National Gulf Veterans and \nFamilies' Association, they anticipate adverse reaction among ``at \nleast 6,000 new cases as a result of the Iraq conflict--about 30 \npercent of the 22,000 troops who had the anthrax vaccination.''\n  In addition to the policy of our allies that military personnel \nshould be able to make their own decisions regarding the anthrax \nvaccine, another reason they have made the vaccine voluntary is that we \ndo not even know whether the anthrax vaccine is effective against \ninhalation or weaponized anthrax.\n  Furthermore, even if we had truly thought there was strong evidence \nthat the Iraqi government had and was preparing to use biological \nweapons such as anthrax against the United States military, the report \nby Weapons Inspector David Kay in September indicates that threat has \nbeen found to be lacking or non-existent. There appears to be little \nevidence available that Al Qaeda or Saddam have the capability to \ndeliver anthrax or smallpox against our troops in Iraq or Afghanistan. \nEven if there was such a threat, it is likely extremely small at this \npoint. Again, if nothing else, this change in the threat to our troops \nrequires an immediate reevaluation of DOD vaccination policy.\n  Even if you still think there is some potential benefit of these \nvaccinations, it must be further weighed against whether there is \nanother mechanism available that would have the same effect. We in the \nSenate, for example, know very well that the treatment of anthrax \nexposure via antibiotics works very well. The Senate was faced with the \nchoice of having those exposed undergo a course of antibiotics versus \ngetting the anthrax vaccine and the vast majority of those exposed to \nanthrax choose to take the antibiotic treatment rather than volunteer \nto take the anthrax vaccine.\n  In fact, the current Majority Leader, Senator Frist, said at the time \nthe anthrax vaccine was offered to Senate employees potentially exposed \nto anthrax, ``I do not recommend widespread inoculation for people with \nthe vaccine in the Hart Building. There are too many side effects and \nif there is limited chance of exposure the side effects would far \noutweigh any potential advantage.''\n  Again, in weighing the potential benefit of the vaccine versus the \noption of antibiotics, the vast majority decided in support of the \nlatter option. Our military personnel certainly deserve the option that \nmany Senate personnel chose for themselves and what it seems the \nSecretary of Defense chose for himself when he acknowledged on October \n25, 2001--in the midst of the anthrax attacks--that he was not taking \nthe anthrax vaccine.\n  When the President was running for our Nation's highest office, he \nsaid with respect to questions posed to him in the September 2000 issue \nof U.S. Medicine, ``The Defense Department's Anthrax Immunization \nProgram has raised numerous health concerns and caused fear among the \nindividuals whose lives it touches. I don't feel the current \nadministration's anthrax immunization program has taken into account \nthe effect of this program on the soldiers in our military and their \nfamilies. Under my administration, soldiers and their families will be \ntaken into consideration.''\n  Some of our nation's servicemembers and their families believe that \nthe current policy of this Administration does not adequately take \nsoldiers and their families into consideration. They believe we are, in \nfact, failing to ensure the health and well-being of our military \npersonnel and we must do better.\n  Before closing, I would like to particularly note the long-standing \nwork by Congressman Christopher Shays on this issue. In a report issued \nby the House Committee on Government Reform in April 2000, the report \nstates, ``many members of the armed services do not share that faith \n[that the DOD places in the anthrax vaccine]. They do not believe \nmerely suggestive evidence of vaccine efficacy outweighs their concerns \nover the lack of evidence of long term vaccine safety. Nor do they \ntrust DOD has learned the lessons of part military medical mistakes: \natomic testing, Agent Orange, Persian Gulf war drugs, and vaccines. \nHeavy handed, one-sided informational materials only fuel suspicions \nthe program understates adverse reaction risks in order to magnify the \nrelative, admittedly marginal, benefits of the vaccine.''\n  Many of the findings by Congressman Shays, such as the concerns by \nmilitary servicemembers are even more valid today with the introduction \nof the smallpox vaccine to the list of vaccines required by the \nmilitary.\n  Consequently, I urge the passage of this Sense of the Senate urging \nthe Department of Defense to reconsider the mandatory nature of its \nsmallpox and anthrax vaccination programs and to minimize the use of \nthese vaccines pending the current development of new and better \nvaccines.\n  I also plan to introduce legislation early next year, as the \nInstitute of Medicine recommended back in 1999, to establish a National \nCenter for Military Deployment Health Research. Our nation's \nservicemembers deserve our best efforts to assure their health and \nwell-being. As the IOM said in making the recommendation to establish a \nNational Center for Military Deployment Health Research, ``Veterans' \norganizations were instrumental in developing the idea for a national \ncenter for the study of war-related illness and postdeployment health \nissues, and these organizations continue to support the national center \nconcept.'' We owe this to our nation's servicemembers and veterans and \nI look forward to working with them over the coming months in the \ndevelopment of that long-needed legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S16034-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16034-S16035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 86--CONGRATULATING THE PEOPLE AND \nGOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN ON THE TWELFTH ANNIVERSARY OF \n   THE INDEPENDENCE OF KAZAKHSTAN AND PRAISING THE LONGSTANDING AND \n      GROWING FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND KAZAKHSTAN\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself and Mr. Burns) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n       Whereas, on December 16, 2003, the people of the Republic \n     of Kazakhstan will celebrate 12 years of independence, and on \n     December 25, 2003, the United States and Kazakhstan will mark \n     the 12th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two \n     countries;\n       Whereas Kazakhstan in a short period of time has managed to \n     shed totalitarian shackles and become a dynamically \n     developing civil society in which public and private \n     institutions are strong, effective democratic mechanisms and \n     the rule of law are established, and basic human rights are \n     respected;\n       Whereas Kazakhstan, an open country where citizens of more \n     than 100 ethnic groups enjoy equal rights and opportunities, \n     made a significant contribution to promoting global peace and \n     harmony by hosting in September 2003 the Congress of the \n     World and Traditional Religions, which brought together \n     leaders of world religions seeking to bridge religious \n     differences;\n       Whereas the Government of Kazakhstan has toughened \n     legislation and taken other concrete steps to prevent human \n     trafficking and end this cruel form of human mistreatment;\n       Whereas Kazakhstan is confidently moving toward integration \n     with the world economic system by establishing the conditions \n     for developing a true market economy;\n       Whereas the United States Government, recognizing the \n     economic progress of Kazakhstan, granted to Kazakhstan \n     ``market economy status'', the first such designation of any \n     country in the Commonwealth of Independent States;\n       Whereas United States businesses actively participate in \n     the development of one of the world's largest energy \n     resources in Kazakhstan and consider the country to be an \n     alternative and reliable source of energy;\n       Whereas the application to Kazakhstan of chapter 1 of title \n     IV of the Trade Act of 1974 (commonly referred to as the \n     ``Jackson-Vanik amendment'') prevents Kazakhstan from \n     achieving permanent normal trade relations status with the \n     United States;\n       Whereas an independent and democratic Kazakhstan is the \n     cornerstone of peace, stability, and prosperity in the \n     vitally important region of Central Asia;\n       Whereas Kazakhstan voluntarily disarmed its nuclear \n     arsenal, the world's fourth largest, and joined the Treaty on \n     Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, with \n     Annexes, Protocols, and Memorandum of Understanding, signed \n     at Moscow on July 31,\n\n[[Page S16035]]\n\n     1991 (START Treaty), and in so doing provided an example of a \n     responsible national approach to nonproliferation;\n       Whereas the people of Kazakhstan, under the leadership of \n     Nursultan Nazarbayev, are providing unconditional and firm \n     support in the ongoing allied campaign in Afghanistan by \n     allowing coalition forces to use the air space of Kazakhstan \n     and the largest airport in Almaty, Kazakhstan;\n       Whereas Kazakhstan is taking an active part in \n     rehabilitating Iraq and is the only country in the region of \n     Central Asia to send a military contingent of combat \n     engineers who in a few months have neutralized more than \n     300,000 explosive devices in Iraq, thereby saving thousands \n     of lives;\n       Whereas, within the framework of growing military \n     cooperation, the United States and Kazakhstan signed an \n     Article 98 Agreement relating to the International Criminal \n     Court;\n       Whereas the increasing significance of Kazakhstan to United \n     States foreign policy has resulted in the creation of the \n     United States-Kazakhstan Interparliamentary Friendship Group, \n     which is designed to strengthen relations of strategic \n     partnership between the two countries;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Controlling the Assault of \n     Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003'', or the \n     ``CAN-SPAM Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Electronic mail has become an extremely important and \n     popular means of communication, relied on by millions of \n     Americans on a daily basis for personal and commercial \n     purposes. Its low cost and global reach make it extremely \n     convenient and efficient, and offer unique opportunities for \n     the development and growth of frictionless commerce.\n       (2) The convenience and efficiency of electronic mail are \n     threatened by the extremely rapid growth in the volume of \n     unsolicited commercial electronic mail. Unsolicited \n     commercial electronic mail is currently estimated to account \n     for over half of all electronic mail traffic, up from an \n     estimated 7 percent in 2001, and the volume continues to \n     rise. Most of these messages are fraudulent or deceptive in \n     one or more respects.\n       (3) The receipt of unsolicited commercial electronic mail \n     may result in costs to recipients who cannot refuse to accept \n     such mail and who incur costs for the storage of such mail, \n     or for the time spent accessing, reviewing, and discarding \n     such mail, or for both.\n       (4) The receipt of a large number of unwanted messages also \n     decreases the convenience of electronic mail and creates a \n     risk that wanted electronic mail messages, both commercial \n     and noncommercial, will be lost, overlooked, or discarded \n     amidst the larger volume of unwanted messages, thus reducing \n     the reliability and usefulness of electronic mail to the \n     recipient.\n       (5) Some commercial electronic mail contains material that \n     many recipients may consider vulgar or pornographic in \n     nature.\n       (6) The growth in unsolicited commercial electronic mail \n     imposes significant monetary costs on providers of Internet \n     access services, businesses, and educational and nonprofit \n     institutions that carry and receive such mail, as there is a \n     finite volume of mail that such providers, businesses, and \n     institutions can handle without further investment in \n     infrastructure.\n       (7) Many senders of unsolicited commercial electronic mail \n     purposefully disguise the source of such mail.\n       (8) Many senders of unsolicited commercial electronic mail \n     purposefully include misleading information in the message's \n     subject lines in order to induce the recipients to view the \n     messages.\n       (9) While some senders of commercial electronic mail \n     messages provide simple and reliable ways for recipients to \n     reject (or ``opt-out'' of) receipt of commercial electronic \n     mail from such senders in the future, other senders provide \n     no such ``opt-out'' mechanism, or refuse to honor the \n     requests of recipients not to receive electronic mail from \n     such senders in the future, or both.\n       (10) Many senders of bulk unsolicited commercial electronic \n     mail use computer programs to gather large numbers of \n     electronic mail addresses on an automated basis from Internet \n     websites or online services where users must post their \n     addresses in order to make full use of the website or \n     service.\n       (11) Many States have enacted legislation intended to \n     regulate or reduce unsolicited commercial electronic mail, \n     but these statutes impose different standards and \n     requirements. As a result, they do not appear to have been \n     successful in addressing the problems associated with \n     unsolicited commercial electronic mail, in part because, \n     since an electronic mail address does not specify a \n     geographic location, it can be extremely difficult for law-\n     abiding businesses to know with which of these disparate \n     statutes they are required to comply.\n       (12) The problems associated with the rapid growth and \n     abuse of unsolicited commercial electronic mail cannot be \n     solved by Federal legislation alone. The development and \n     adoption of technological approaches and the pursuit of \n     cooperative efforts with other countries will be necessary as \n     well.\n       (b) Congressional Determination of Public Policy.--On the \n     basis of the findings in subsection (a), the Congress \n     determines that--\n       (1) there is a substantial government interest in \n     regulation of commercial electronic mail on a nationwide \n     basis;\n       (2) senders of commercial electronic mail should not \n     mislead recipients as to the source or content of such mail; \n     and\n       (3) recipients of commercial electronic mail have a right \n     to decline to receive additional commercial electronic mail \n     from the same source.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Affirmative consent.--The term ``affirmative consent'', \n     when used with respect to a commercial electronic mail \n     message, means that--\n       (A) the recipient expressly consented to receive the \n     message, either in response to a clear and conspicuous \n     request for such consent or at the recipient's own \n     initiative; and\n       (B) if the message is from a party other than the party to \n     which the recipient communicated such consent, the recipient \n     was given clear and conspicuous notice at the time the \n     consent was communicated that the recipient's electronic mail \n     address could be transferred to such other party for the \n     purpose of initiating commercial electronic mail messages.\n       (2) Commercial electronic mail message.--\n       (A) In general.--The term ``commercial electronic mail \n     message'' means any electronic mail message the primary \n     purpose of which is the commercial advertisement or promotion \n     of a commercial product or service (including content on an \n     Internet website operated for a commercial purpose).\n       (B) Transactional or relationship messages.--The term \n     ``commercial electronic mail message'' does not include a \n     transactional or relationship message.\n       (C) Regulations regarding primary purpose.--Not later than \n     12 months after the date of the enactment of this Act, the \n     Commission shall issue regulations pursuant to section 13 \n     defining the relevant criteria to facilitate \n     the determination of the primary purpose of an electronic \n     mail message.\n       (D) Reference to company or website.--The inclusion of a \n     reference to a commercial entity or a link to the website of \n     a commercial entity in an electronic mail message does not, \n     by itself, cause such message to be treated as a commercial \n     electronic mail message for purposes of this Act if the \n     contents or circumstances of the message indicate a primary \n     purpose other than commercial advertisement or promotion of a \n     commercial product or service.\n       (3) Commission.--The term ``Commission'' means the Federal \n     Trade Commission.\n       (4) Domain name.--The term ``domain name'' means any \n     alphanumeric designation which is registered with or assigned \n     by any domain name registrar, domain name registry, or other \n     domain name registration authority as part of an electronic \n     address on the Internet.\n       (5) Electronic mail address.--The term ``electronic mail \n     address'' means a destination, commonly expressed as a string \n     of characters, consisting of a unique user name or mailbox \n     (commonly referred to as the ``local part'') and a reference \n     to an Internet domain (commonly referred to as the ``domain \n     part''), whether or not displayed, to which an electronic \n     mail message can be sent or delivered.\n       (6) Electronic mail message.--The term ``electronic mail \n     message'' means a message sent to a unique electronic mail \n     address.\n       (7) FTC act.--The term ``FTC Act'' means the Federal Trade \n     Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.).\n       (8) Header information.--The term ``header information'' \n     means the source, destination, and routing information \n     attached to an electronic mail message, including the \n     originating domain name and originating electronic mail \n     address, and any other information that appears in the line \n     identifying, or purporting to identify, a person initiating \n     the message.\n       (9) Initiate.--The term ``initiate'', when used with \n     respect to a commercial electronic mail message, means to \n     originate or transmit such message or to procure the \n     origination or transmission of such message, but shall not \n     include actions that constitute routine conveyance of such \n     message. For purposes of this paragraph, more than 1 person \n     may be considered to have initiated a message.\n       (10) Internet.--The term ``Internet'' has the meaning given \n     that term in the Internet Tax Freedom Act (47 U.S.C. 151 nt).\n       (11) Internet access service.--The term ``Internet access \n     service'' has the meaning given that term in section \n     231(e)(4) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n     231(e)(4)).\n       (12) Procure.--The term ``procure'', when used with respect \n     to the initiation of a commercial electronic mail message, \n     means intentionally to pay or provide other consideration to, \n     or induce, another person to initiate such a message on one's \n     behalf.\n       (13) Protected computer.--The term ``protected computer'' \n     has the meaning given that term in section 1030(e)(2)(B) of \n     title 18, United States Code.\n       (14) Recipient.--The term ``recipient'', when used with \n     respect to a commercial electronic mail message, means an \n     authorized user of the electronic mail address to which the \n     message was sent or delivered. If a recipient of a commercial \n     electronic mail message has 1 or more electronic mail \n     addresses in addition to the address to which the message was \n     sent or delivered, the recipient shall be treated as a \n     separate recipient with respect to each such address. If an \n     electronic mail address is reassigned to a new user, the new \n     user shall not be treated as a recipient of any commercial \n     electronic mail message sent or delivered to that address \n     before it was reassigned.\n       (15) Routine conveyance.--The term ``routine conveyance'' \n     means the transmission,\n\n[[Page S16037]]\n\n     routing, relaying, handling, or storing, through an automatic \n     technical process, of an electronic mail message for which \n     another person has identified the recipients or provided the \n     recipient addresses.\n       (16) Sender.--\n       (A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph (B), \n     the term ``sender'', when used with respect to a commercial \n     electronic mail message, means a person who initiates such a \n     message and whose product, service, or Internet web site is \n     advertised or promoted by the message.\n       (B) Separate lines of business or divisions.--If an entity \n     operates through separate lines of business or divisions and \n     holds itself out to the recipient throughout the message as \n     that particular line of business or division rather than as \n     the entity of which such line of business or division is a \n     part, then the line of business or the division shall be \n     treated as the sender of such message for purposes of this \n     Act.\n       (17) Transactional or relationship message.--\n       (A) In general.--The term ``transactional or relationship \n     message'' means an electronic mail message the primary \n     purpose of which is--\n       (i) to facilitate, complete, or confirm a commercial \n     transaction that the recipient has previously agreed to enter \n     into with the sender;\n       (ii) to provide warranty information, product recall \n     information, or safety or security information with respect \n     to a commercial product or service used or purchased by the \n     recipient;\n       (iii) to provide--\n       (I) notification concerning a change in the terms or \n     features of;\n       (II) notification of a change in the recipient's standing \n     or status with respect to; or\n       (III) at regular periodic intervals, account balance \n     information or other type of account statement with respect \n     to,\n\n     a subscription, membership, account, loan, or comparable \n     ongoing commercial relationship involving the ongoing \n     purchase or use by the recipient of products or services \n     offered by the sender;\n       (iv) to provide information directly related to an \n     employment relationship or related benefit plan in which the \n     recipient is currently involved, participating, or enrolled; \n     or\n       (v) to deliver goods or services, including product updates \n     or upgrades, that the recipient is entitled to receive under \n     the terms of a transaction that the recipient has previously \n     agreed to enter into with the sender.\n       (B) Modification of definition.--The Commission by \n     regulation pursuant to section 13 may modify the definition \n     in subparagraph (A) to expand or contract the categories \n     of messages that are treated as transactional or \n     relationship messages for purposes of this Act to the \n     extent that such modification is necessary to accommodate \n     changes in electronic mail technology or practices and \n     accomplish the purposes of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 4. PROHIBITION AGAINST PREDATORY AND ABUSIVE COMMERCIAL \n                   E-MAIL.\n\n       (a) Offense.--\n       (1) In general.--Chapter 47 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     section:\n\n     ``Sec. 1037.

OTHER PROTECTIONS FOR USERS OF COMMERCIAL ELECTRONIC \n                   MAIL.\n\n       (a) Requirements for Transmission of Messages.--\n       (1) Prohibition of false or misleading transmission \n     information.--It is unlawful for any person to initiate the \n     transmission, to a protected computer, of a commercial \n     electronic mail message, or a transactional or relationship \n     message, that contains, or is accompanied by, header \n     information that is materially false or materially \n     misleading.\n\n     For purposes of this paragraph--\n       (A) header information that is technically accurate but \n     includes an originating electronic mail address, domain name, \n     or Internet Protocol address the access to which for purposes \n     of initiating the message was obtained by means of false or \n     fraudulent pretenses or representations shall be considered \n     materially misleading;\n       (B) a ``from'' line (the line identifying or purporting to \n     identify a person initiating the message) that accurately \n     identifies any person who initiated the message shall not be \n     considered materially false or materially misleading; and\n       (C) header information shall be considered materially \n     misleading if it fails to identify accurately a protected \n     computer used to initiate the message because the person \n     initiating the message knowingly uses another protected \n     computer to relay or retransmit the message for purposes of \n     disguising its origin.\n       (2) Prohibition of deceptive subject headings.--It is \n     unlawful for any person to initiate the transmission to a \n     protected computer of a commercial electronic mail message if \n     such person has actual knowledge, or knowledge fairly implied \n     on the basis of objective circumstances, that a subject \n     heading of the message would be likely to mislead a \n     recipient, acting reasonably under the circumstances, about a \n     material fact regarding the contents or subject matter of the \n     message (consistent with the criteria used in enforcement of \n     section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. \n     45)).\n       (3) Inclusion of return address or comparable mechanism in \n     commercial electronic mail.--\n       (A) In general.--It is unlawful for any person to initiate \n     the transmission to a protected computer of a commercial \n     electronic mail message that does not contain a functioning \n     return electronic mail address or other Internet-based \n     mechanism, clearly and conspicuously displayed, that--\n       (i) a recipient may use to submit, in a manner specified in \n     the message, a reply electronic mail message or other form of \n     Internet-based communication requesting not to receive future \n     commercial electronic mail messages from that sender at the \n     electronic mail address where the message was received; and\n       (ii) remains capable of receiving such messages or \n     communications for no less than 30 days after the \n     transmission of the original message.\n       (B) More detailed options possible.--The person initiating \n     a commercial electronic mail message may comply with sub \n     paragraph (A)(i) by providing the recipient a list or menu \n     from which the recipient may choose the specific types of \n     commercial electronic mail messages the recipient wants to \n     receive or does not want to receive from the sender, if the \n     list or menu includes an option under which the recipient may \n     choose not to receive any commercial electronic mail messages \n     from the sender.\n       (C) Temporary inability to receive messages or process \n     requests.--A return electronic mail address or other \n     mechanism does not fail to satisfy the requirements of \n     subparagraph (A) if it is unexpectedly and temporarily unable \n     to receive messages or process requests due to a technical \n     problem beyond the control of the sender if the problem is \n     corrected within a reasonable time period.\n       (4) Prohibition of transmission of commercial electronic \n     mail after objection.--\n       (A) In general.--If a recipient makes a request using a \n     mechanism provided pursuant to paragraph (3) not to receive \n     some or any commercial electronic mail messages from such \n     sender, then it is unlawful--\n       (i) for the sender to initiate the transmission to the \n     recipient, more than 10 business days after the receipt of \n     such request, of a commercial electronic mail message that \n     falls within the scope of the request;\n       (ii) for any person acting on behalf of the sender to \n     initiate the transmission to the recipient, more than 10 \n     business days after the receipt of such request, of a \n     commercial electronic mail message with actual knowledge, or \n     knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective \n     circumstances, that such message falls within the scope of \n     the request;\n       (iii) for any person acting on behalf of the sender to \n     assist in initiating the transmission to the recipient, \n     through the provision or selection of addresses to which the \n     message will be sent, of a commercial electronic mail message \n     with actual knowledge, or knowledge fairly implied on the \n     basis of objective circumstances, that such message would \n     violate clause (i) or (ii); or\n       (iv) for the sender, or any other person who knows that the \n     recipient has made such a request, to sell, lease, exchange, \n     or otherwise transfer or release the electronic mail address \n     of the recipient (including through any transaction or other \n     transfer involving mailing lists bearing the electronic mail \n     address of the recipient) for any purpose other than \n     compliance with this Act or other provision of law.\n       (B) Subsequent affirmative consent.--A prohibition in \n     subparagraph (A) does not apply if there is affirmative \n     consent by the recipient subsequent to the request under \n     subparagraph (A).\n       (5) Inclusion of identifier, opt-out, and physical address \n     in commercial electronic mail.--\n       (A) It is unlawful for any person to initiate the \n     transmission of any commercial electronic mail message to a \n     protected computer unless the message provides--\n       (i) clear and conspicuous identification that the message \n     is an advertisement or solicitation;\n       (ii) clear and conspicuous notice of the opportunity under \n     paragraph (3) to decline to receive further commercial \n     electronic mail messages from the sender;

or\n       (ii) the electronic mail address of the recipient was \n     obtained using an automated means that generates possible \n     electronic mail addresses by combining names, letters, or \n     numbers into numerous permutations.\n       (B) Disclaimer.--Nothing in this paragraph creates an \n     ownership or proprietary interest in such electronic mail \n     addresses.\n       (2) Automated creation of multiple electronic mail \n     accounts.--It is unlawful for any person to use scripts or \n     other automated means to register for multiple electronic \n     mail accounts or online user accounts from which to transmit \n     to a protected computer, or enable another person to transmit \n     to a protected computer, a commercial electronic mail message \n     that is unlawful under subsection (a).\n       (3) Relay or retransmission through unauthorized access.--\n     It is unlawful for any person knowingly to relay or \n     retransmit a commercial electronic mail message that is \n     unlawful under subsection (a) from a protected computer or \n     computer network that such person has accessed without \n     authorization.\n       (c) Supplementary Rulemaking Authority.--The Commission \n     shall by regulation, pursuant to section 13--\n       (1) modify the 10-business-day period under subsection \n     (a)(4)(A) or subsection (a)(4)(B), or both, if the Commission \n     determines that a different period would be more reasonable \n     after taking into account--\n       (A) the purposes of subsection (a);\n       (B) the interests of recipients of commercial electronic \n     mail; and\n       (C) the burdens imposed on senders of lawful commercial \n     electronic mail; and\n       (2) specify additional activities or practices to which \n     subsection (b) applies if the Commission determines that \n     those activities or practices are contributing substantially \n     to the proliferation of commercial electronic mail messages \n     that are unlawful under subsection (a).\n       (d) Requirement To Place Warning Labels on Commercial \n     Electronic Mail Containing Sexually Oriented Material.--\n       (1) In general.--No person may initiate in or affecting \n     interstate commerce the transmission, to a protected \n     computer, of any commercial electronic mail message that \n     includes sexually oriented material and--\n       (A) fail to include in subject heading for the electronic \n     mail message the marks or notices prescribed by the \n     Commission under this subsection;

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nForeign Relations Committee be discharged from further consideration of \nS. Res. 273 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 273) condemning the terrorist attacks \n     in Istanbul, Turkey, on November 15 and 20, 2003, expressing \n     condolences to the families of the individuals murdered in \n     the attacks, expressing sympathies to the individuals injured \n     in the attacks, and expressing solidarity with the Republic \n     of Turkey and the United Kingdom in the fight against \n     terrorism.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, last week's double set of suicide \nattacks in Istanbul are acts of cowardice targeting both the structures \nand symbols of Turkish coexistence. I grieve for the families of the 58 \nvictims and wish the 750 injured individuals a speedy recovery.\n  The terrorists who have attacked Turkey in the name of Islam and its \nheritage do not know their history. Throughout the Ottoman Empire, \nJews, Christians and other minorities were treated with respect and \nallowed to practice their religion freely. Since Mustafa Kemal Ataturk \nfounded modern Turkey in 1923, Turkey has been admired by western and \nnon-western countries alike as an apotheosis of progressive Muslim \ndemocracy.\n  In Turkey, pride in a rich heritage and faith coexist with a desire \nto globalize and enhance representative democracy and the freedom it \nbrings.\n  During World War II, as Hitler's troops were marching from the \nBalkans and emptying Greek cities of their Jewish populations, Turkey's \npresident, Ismet Inonu, closed its border. The Jews of Turkey were \nspared by the principled leadership of their government, who refused to \nbe complicit in murder. In my own travels through Turkey--from Istanbul \nto Idirdne--I have seen the rich fusion of ancient and modern and of \nreligious and secular. I have enjoyed the renowned hospitality offered \nto all visitors.\n  The terrorists who attacked the synagogues, consulate, and bank in \nIstanbul last week seek to undermine the pluralism, diversity, and \nopenness that have long characterized Turkish culture and society. \nTogether, we will prevent the terrorists from achieving this aim. \nAmericans, and particularly New Jerseyans, are intimately familiar with \nthe pain wreaked by a terrorist attack on our homeland.\n  We in Washington are prepared to offer assistance and support to \nPrime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his government in the days \nahead as Turkey shores up security and begins healing from these \ntraumatic incidents. The U.S.-Turkish friendship continues to be strong \nand will stand united in the face of the global threat of terrorism.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, and any statements relating to the \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 273\n\n       Whereas, in Istanbul, Turkey, on November 15, 2003, two \n     explosions set off minutes apart during Sabbath morning \n     services devastated Neve Shalom, the largest synagogue in the \n     city, and the Beth Israel synagogue, about 3 miles away from \n     Neve Shalom;\n       Whereas the casualties of more than 20 people killed and \n     more than 300 people wounded in the bombing attacks on the \n     synagogues included both Muslims and Jews;\n       Whereas, on November 20, 2003, two bombs exploded in \n     Istanbul at the Consulate of the United Kingdom and the HSBC \n     Bank;\n       Whereas the casualties of more than 25 people killed and \n     450 people wounded in the November 20, 2003, bombing attacks \n     included Muslims and Christians, and Turks, British \n     diplomats, and visitors to the Republic of Turkey;\n       Whereas troops of the United Kingdom are part of the United \n     States-led coalition that liberated Iraq from the regime of \n     Saddam Hussein and are now present in Iraq under the auspices \n     of the United Nations Security Council;\n       Whereas the acts of murder committed on November 15 and 20, \n     2003, in Istanbul, Turkey, were cowardly and brutal \n     manifestations of international terrorism;\n       Whereas the Government of Turkey immediately condemned the \n     terrorist attacks in the strongest possible terms and has \n     vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice at all costs;\n       Whereas the United States, the United Kingdom, and Turkey \n     equally abhor and denounce these hateful, repugnant, and \n     loathsome acts of terrorism;\n       Whereas, in light of the escalation of anti-Semitic \n     activities, the safety and security of Jewish people \n     throughout the world is a matter of serious concern;\n       Whereas, since Turkey cherishes its traditions of \n     hospitality and religious tolerance, and in particular its \n     history of more than 500 years of good relations between Jews \n     and Muslims, the attacks on synagogues, consular premises, \n     and commercial buildings came as a special shock to the \n     people of Turkey and to their friends throughout the world;\n       Whereas the United States and Turkey are allied by shared \n     values and a common interest in building a stable, peaceful, \n     and prosperous world;\n       Whereas Turkey, a predominantly Muslim nation with a \n     secular government, has close relations with Israel and is \n     also the only predominantly Muslim member of the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization; and\n       Whereas the acts of murder committed on November 15 and 20, \n     2003, demonstrate again\n\n[[Page S16045]]\n\n     that terrorism respects neither boundaries nor borders: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns in the strongest possible terms the terrorist \n     attacks in Istanbul, Turkey, on November 15 and 20, 2003;\n       (2) expresses its condolences to the families of the \n     individuals murdered in the terrorist attacks, expresses its \n     sympathies to the individuals injured in the attacks, and \n     conveys its hope for the rapid and complete recovery of all \n     such injured individuals;\n       (3) expresses its condolences to the people and the \n     governments of the Republic of Turkey and the United Kingdom \n     over the losses they suffered in these attacks; and\n       (4) expresses its solidarity with the United Kingdom, \n     Turkey, and all other countries that stand united against \n     terrorism and work together to bring to justice the \n     perpetrators of these and other terrorist attacks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S16045-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PAY AND BENEFITS PARITY ACT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate again is \ntaking up and passing the Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefits Act of \n2003, S. 459. This bill, as amended and passed by unanimous consent in \nthe House, will improve the Department of Justice's Public Safety \nOfficers Benefits, PSOB, program by allowing survivors of public safety \nofficers who suffer fatal heart attacks or strokes while participating \nin nonroutine stressful or strenuous physical activities to qualify for \nFederal survivor benefits.\n  I want to pay special thanks to Congressman Bob Etheridge, the author \nof the House companion bill, and House Judiciary Committee Chairman \nSensenbrenner for their leadership and fortitude while negotiating this \nlegislation. Without their perseverance and willingness to find \nbipartisan compromise language, passage of this bill in the House would \nnot have happened.\n  I also commend Congressman Coble, Congressman Bobby Scott, the \nFraternal Order of Police, FOP, and the Congressional Fire Services \nInstitute, CFSI, for working with us on bipartisan compromise language \nso that we could pass the Senate bill through the House. I thank Senate \nJudiciary Chairman Hatch, Senator Lindsey Graham, the lead Republican \ncosponsor of this bill, and Senate leadership for quickly\n\n[[Page S16053]]\n\npassing the Senate bill, as amended by the House, and to send it to the \nPresident's desk for enactment into law.\n  I thank Senators Collins, Jeffords, Sarbanes, Schumer, Durbin, \nLandrieu, Nelson of Florida, Clinton, Snowe, Kohl, Smith, Stabenow, \nKennedy, Dayton, Miller and Kerry for joining me as cosponsors of this \nmulti-partisan legislation.\n  Public safety officers are our most brave and dedicated public \nservants. I applaud the efforts of all members of fire, law enforcement \nand EMS providers nationwide who are the first to respond to more than \n1.6 million emergency calls annually--whether those calls involve a \ncrime, fire, medical emergency, spill of hazardous materials, natural \ndisaster, act of terrorism, or transportation accident--without \nreservation. Those men and women act with an unwavering commitment to \nthe safety and protection of their fellow citizens, and forever willing \nto selflessly sacrifice their own lives to provide safe and reliable \nemergency services to their communities.\n  Sadly, that kind of dedication can result in tragedy, which we all \nwitnessed on September 11th as scores of firefighters, police officers \nand medics raced into the burning World Trade Center and Pentagon with \nno other goal than to save lives. Every year, hundreds of public safety \nofficers nationwide lose their lives and thousands more are injured \nwhile performing duties that subject them to great physical risks. And \nwhile we know that PSOB benefits can never be a substitute for the loss \nof a loved one, the families of all our fallen heroes deserve to \ncollect these funds.\n  The PSOB program was established in 1976 to authorize a one-time \nfinancial payment to the eligible survivors of Federal, State, and \nlocal public safety officers for all line of duty deaths. In 2001, \nCongress improved the PSOB regulations by streamlining the process for \nfamilies of public safety officers killed or injured in connection with \nprevention, investigation, rescue or recovery efforts related to a \nterrorist attack. We also retroactively increased the total benefits \navailable by $100,000 as part of the USA PATRIOT Act. Survivors of \nfirst responders killed in the line of duty now receive $267,494 in \nPSOB.\n  Unfortunately, the issue of covering heart attack and stroke victims \nunder PSOB regulations was not addressed at that time.\n  Service-connected heart, lung, and hypertension conditions are silent \nkillers of public safety officers nationwide. The numerous hidden \nhealth dangers dealt with by police officers, fire fighters and EMS \npersonnel are widely recognized, but officers face these dangers in \norder to serve and protect their fellow citizens.\n  The intent of the legislation Senator Graham and I introduced earlier \nthis year was to cover officers who suffered a heart attack or stroke \nas a result of nonroutine stressful or strenuous physical activity. As \ndrafted and passed by the Senate by unanimous consent on May 16, \nhowever, members of the House Judiciary Committee felt the bill's \nlanguage would cover officers who did not engage in any physical \nactivity, but merely happened to suffer a heart attack while at work. \nChairman Sensenbrenner, Congressman Etheridge, Congressman Coble, \nCongressman Scott, FOP, CFSI and I worked out a substitute amendment to \naddress those concerns.\n  The substitute amendment to S. 459 will create a presumption that an \nofficer who died as a direct and proximate result of a heart attack or \nstroke died as a direct and proximate result of a personal injury \nsustained in the line of duty if the following is established:\n\n     that officer participated in a training exercise that \n     involved nonroutine stressful or strenuous physical activity \n     or responded to a situation and such participation or \n     response involved nonroutine stressful or strenuous physical \n     law enforcement, hazardous material response, emergency \n     medical services, prison security, fire suppression, rescue, \n     disaster relief or other emergency response activity; that \n     officer suffered a heart attack or stroke while engaging or \n     within 24 hours of engaging in that physical activity; and \n     such presumption cannot be overcome by competent medical \n     evidence.\n\n  For the purposes of this act, the phrase ``nonroutine stressful or \nstrenuous physical'' will exclude actions of a clerical, administrative \nor non-manual nature. Included in the category of ``actions of a \nclerical, administrative or non-manual nature'' are such tasks \nincluding, but not limited to, the following: sitting at a desk; typing \non a computer; talking on the telephone; reading or writing paperwork \nor other literature; watching a police or corrections facility's \nmonitors of cells or grounds; teaching a class; cleaning or organizing \nan emergency response vehicle; signing in or out a prisoner; driving a \nvehicle on routine patrol; and directing traffic at or participating in \na local parade.\n  Such deaths, while tragic, are not to be considered in the line of \nduty deaths. The families of officers who died of such causes would \ntherefore not be eligible to receive PSOB.\n  For the purposes of this act, the phrase ``nonroutine stressful or \nstrenuous physical'' actions will include, but are not limited to, the \nfollowing: involvement in a physical struggle with a suspected or \nconvicted criminal; performing a search and rescue mission; performing \nor assisting with emergency medical treatment; performing or assisting \nwith fire suppression; involvement in a situation that requires either \na high speed response or pursuit on foot or in a vehicle; participation \nin hazardous material response; responding to a riot that broke out at \na public event; and physically engaging in the arrest or apprehension \nof a suspected criminal.\n  The situations listed above are the types of heart attack and stroke \ncases that are considered to be in the line of duty. The families of \nofficers who died in such cases are eligible to receive PSOB.\n  The changes to PSOB law and regulations brought about by the Hometown \nHeroes Survivors Benefits Act will take effect as soon as the President \nsigns the legislation into law. As a result, the survivors of public \nsafety officers who suffer heart attacks or strokes while performing \nnonroutine stressful or strenuous physical actions on or after the date \nthe President signs this bill will be eligible to apply for PSOB.\n  Heart attacks and strokes are a reality of the high-pressure jobs of \npolice officers, firefighters and medics. These are killers that first \nresponders contend with in their jobs, just like speeding bullets and \nburning buildings. They put their lives on the line for us, and we owe \ntheir families our gratitude, our respect and our help. No amount of \nmoney can fill the void that is left by these losses, but ending this \ndisparity can help these families keep food on the table and shelter \nover their heads.\n  I thank the Senate for taking up and passing the Hometown Heroes \nSurvivors Benefits Act, S. 459, as amended and passed by the House, and \nshowing its support and appreciation for these extraordinarily brave \nand heroic public safety officers.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       [This Act may be cited as the ``Pharmacy Education Aid Act \n     of 2003''.\n\n     [SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       [Congress makes the following findings:\n       [(1) Pharmacists are an important link in our Nation's \n     health care system. A critical shortage of pharmacists is \n     threatening the ability of pharmacies to continue to provide \n     important prescription related services.\n       [(2) In the landmark report entitled ``To Err is Human: \n     Building a Safer Health System'', the Institute of Medicine \n     reported that medication errors can be partially attributed \n     to factors that are indicative of a shortage of pharmacists \n     (such as too many customers, numerous distractions, and staff \n     shortages).\n       [(3) Congress acknowledged in the Healthcare Research and \n     Quality Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-129) a growing demand for \n     pharmacists by requiring the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services to conduct a study to determine whether there is a \n     shortage of pharmacists in the United States and, if so, to \n     what extent.\n       [(4) As a result of Congress' concern about how a shortage \n     of pharmacists would impact\n\n[[Page S16055]]\n\n     the public health, the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     published a report entitled ``The Pharmacist Workforce: A \n     Study in Supply and Demand for Pharmacists'' in December of \n     2000.\n       [(5) ``The Pharmacist Workforce: A Study in Supply and \n     Demand for Pharmacists'' found that ``While the overall \n     supply of pharmacists has increased in the past decade, there \n     has been an unprecedented demand for pharmacists and for \n     pharmaceutical care services, which has not been met by the \n     currently available supply'' and that the ``evidence clearly \n     indicates the emergence of a shortage of pharmacists over the \n     past two years''.\n       [(6) The same study also found that ``The factors causing \n     the current shortage are of a nature not likely to abate in \n     the near future without fundamental changes in pharmacy \n     practice and education.'' The study projects that the number \n     of prescriptions filled by community pharmacists will \n     increase by 20 percent by 2004. In contrast, the number of \n     community pharmacists is expected to increase by only 6 \n     percent by 2005.\n       [(7) The demand for pharmacists will increase as \n     prescription drug use continues to grow.]\n\n     [SEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Pharmacy Education Aid Act \n     of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Pharmacists are an important link in our Nation's \n     health care system. A critical shortage of pharmacists is \n     threatening the ability of pharmacies to continue to provide \n     important prescription related services.\n       (2) In the landmark report entitled ``To Err is Human: \n     Building a Safer Health System'', the Institute of Medicine \n     reported that medication errors can be partially attributed \n     to factors that are indicative of a shortage of pharmacists \n     (such as too many customers, numerous distractions, and staff \n     shortages).\n       (3) Congress acknowledged in the Healthcare Research and \n     Quality Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-129) a growing demand for \n     pharmacists by requiring the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services to conduct a study to determine whether there is a \n     shortage of pharmacists in the United States and, if so, to \n     what extent.\n       (4) As a result of Congress' concern about how a shortage \n     of pharmacists would impact the public health, the Secretary \n     of Health and Human Services published a report entitled \n     ``The Pharmacist Workforce: A Study in Supply and Demand for \n     Pharmacists'' in December of 2000.\n       (5) ``The Pharmacist Workforce: A Study in Supply and \n     Demand for Pharmacists'' found that ``While the overall \n     supply of pharmacists has increased in the past decade, there \n     has been an unprecedented demand for pharmacists and for \n     pharmaceutical care services, which has not been met by the \n     currently available supply'' and that the ``evidence clearly \n     indicates the emergence of a shortage of pharmacists over the \n     past two years''.\n       (6) The same study also found that ``The factors causing \n     the current shortage are of a nature not likely to abate in \n     the near future without fundamental changes in pharmacy \n     practice and education.'' The study projects that the number \n     of prescriptions filled by community pharmacists will \n     increase by 20 percent by 2004. In contrast, the number of \n     community pharmacists is expected to increase by only 6 \n     percent by 2005.\n       (7) Regarding access to pharmacy services in rural areas, \n     the study found that ``Remoteness, isolation from other \n     professionals, lower economic returns, reduced opportunities \n     for advancement, and other rural practice characteristics \n     remain obstacles'' to attracting pharmacists.\n       (8) The demand for pharmacists will increase as \n     prescription drug use continues to grow.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 3348 which is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3348) to reauthorize the ban on undetectable \n     firearms.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is gratifying that Congress is finally \nacting to renew one of the Nation's essential protections against \nterrorism.\n  The Undetectable Firearms Act--also known as the ``plastic gun'' \nlaw--makes it illegal to manufacture, import, possess, or transfer a \nfirearm that is not detectable by walk-through metal detectors or \nairport x-ray machines. Only firearms necessary for certain military \nand intelligence uses are exempt.\n  This law was first enacted in 1988, long before the attacks on 9/11, \nand it is more important than ever now. It has been extended once since \nit was first enacted, but it is scheduled to expire on December 10th. \nIts expiration would result in Americans in all parts of the Nation \nbecoming needlessly vulnerable to gun violence in airlines, airports, \nschools, office buildings, and many other places, and even to terrorist \nattacks.\n  The technology of gun manufacturers has significantly improved since \nthe 1980's--and the determination of terrorists to attack Americans has \nsoared. We know that terrorists are exploiting the weaknesses and \nloopholes in our gun laws. In 2000, a member of the Middle East \nterrorist group Hezbollah was convicted in Detroit on gun charges and \nconspiracy to ship guns and ammunition to Lebanon. He had purchased \nmany of those weapons at gun shows in Michigan. In the war in \nAfghanistan, American soldiers discovered a terrorist training manual \nentitled ``How Can I Train Myself for Jihad'' in a house in that \ncountry. One part of the manual stated: ``In other countries, e.g. some \nstates of USA . . . it is perfectly legal for members of the public to \nown certain types of firearms. If you live in such a country, obtain an \nassault rifle legally . . . learn how to use it properly and go and \npractice in the areas allowed for such training.''\n  Last month, I introduced a bill, S. 1774, to renew the Undetectable \nFirearms Act and repeal the sunset provision. The bill now before us, \nH.R. 3348, extends the sunset provision for another 10 years. The \ndanger to security from undetectable firearms won't sunset, and the law \nthat bans them shouldn't sunset either. Nevertheless, I am encouraged \nthat Congress is taking action, and I look forward to the renewal of \nthis gun ban being signed into law.\n  This measure is only one of several steps that Congress should take \nto protect our citizens from gun violence. We also need to strengthen \ncriminal background checks for gun purchases under the Brady Law, renew \nthe assault weapons ban, and close the ``gun show loophole'' once and \nfor all. Each of these gun-safety measures is needed to protect our \npeople in communities across the country. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the pending bill, and to act on these other vital measures as \nwell.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill \nbe read the third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, with no intervening action or debate, and that any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3348) was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S16062-4", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16062-S16063]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BANKRUPTCY EXTENSION\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is passing \nlegislation to extend family farmer bankruptcy protection through June \n30, 2004.\n  Senator Grassley and I introduced S. 1920 to temporarily extend these \nprotections that our farmers have come to rely upon for another 6 \nmonths because Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code is set to expire on \nJanuary 1, 2004. But this is just a short term fix. We need to stop \nplaying politics and permanently reauthorize the Chapter 12 family \nfarmer protections.\n  Too many family farmers have been left in legal limbo in bankruptcy \ncourts across the country because Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code is \nstill a temporary measure. This is the seventh time that Congress must \nact to restore or extend basic bankruptcy safeguards for family farmers \nbecause Chapter 12 is still a temporary provision despite its first \npassage into law in 1986. Our family farmers do not deserve these \nlapses in bankruptcy law that could mean the difference between \nforeclosure and farming.\n  In 2000 and 2001, for example, the Senate, then as now controlled by \nthe other party, failed to take up a House-passed bill to retroactively \nrenew Chapter 12. As a result, family farmers lost Chapter 12 \nbankruptcy protection for eight months. Another lapse of Chapter 12 \nlasted more than six months in the previous Congress. At the end of \nJune, Chapter 12 lapsed once again.\n  It is time to end this absurdity and make these bankruptcy \nprotections permanent. Everyone agrees that Chapter 12 has worked. It \nis time for Congress to make Chapter 12 a permanent part of the \nBankruptcy Code to provide a stable safety net for our Nation's family \nfarmers.\n  I will continue to work hard with Senator Grassley, Senator Feingold \nand others on both sides of the aisle to pass legislation that once and \nfor all assures our farmers of permanent bankruptcy protection to keep \ntheir farms. In the meantime, we should quickly pass this legislation \nand prevent another lapse in this basic bankruptcy protection for our \nfamily farmers.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, we have been working this afternoon \ntrying to clear the Executive Calendar, regrettably with little or no \nsuccess. I had a conversation with the Democratic leader about this \njust a few moments ago. He can represent his own position. But let me \nsay, from my point of view, what is customarily done at the end of the \nsession is we work out understandings under which we are able to, for \nthe most part, except for extremely controversial nominees, clear the \ncalendar. But alas, that will not be the case today. It is a result of \nanother round of obstructionism. As we adjourn today, a grand total of \n95 nominees will be languishing here on the Executive Calendar awaiting \napproval. I hoped that entering the holiday season, we would be able to \nput aside our differences and work together. Instead, the politics \nseems to have overtaken reason once again.\n  This level of obstructionism on the other side has reached a really \nstunning new low. An example of the positions that will be left \nlanguishing here, dealing with the national security of this country, \nis the Deputy Attorney General, the Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, a very \nimportant country in the war on terrorism, the Under Secretary of State \nfor Public Diplomacy and the International Trade Commission--all \nobstructed as we bring this session to an end. From those positions all \nthe way down to such things as members of the African Development \nFoundation, the U.S. Postal Service, the Chemical Safety and Hazard \nInvestigation Board, even the National Commission on Libraries and \nInformation Science--all obstructed.\n  On a day when the Senate delivered on a 38-year-old promise to 40 \nmillion seniors to provide a prescription drug benefit, we end the day \nwoefully short of our obligations. It is somewhat ironic that two of \nthe victims of obstructionist are nominees to the U.S. Institute of \nPeace.\n\n  I hope we can get serious about doing our work around here. Our work \nincludes, at the very least, confirming nominations that are not \ncontroversial. This is disturbing. We have an Executive Calendar full \nof innocent people who are not caught up in any of the games around \nhere who are being held up at the very least until we come back on \nDecember 9. And who knows, maybe until next year and maybe forever, \npositions from extremely important positions such as the Ambassador to \nSaudi Arabia all the way down to boards that are arguably not of any \ngreat consequence. It is a sad conclusion to the session.\n  Hopefully, sometime over the next few weeks we can figure out a way \nto clear these nominations, these people who deserve better treatment \nby the Senate. We abuse people and abuse people and abuse people. It is \na wonder that anyone is willing to enter into public service anymore if \nthey have to go through the confirmation process.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise to note my disappointment with the \nimpasse over nominations. Earlier this afternoon I made clear to the \nRepublican leadership that the Democratic Caucus was ready to confirm \nthe following nominees today for important ambassadorships around the \nworld:\n  David C. Mulford to be Ambassador to India, William Hudson to be \nAmbassador to the Republic of Tunisia, Jon\n\n[[Page S16064]]\n\nPurnell to be Ambassador to the Republic of Uzbekistan, Margaret Scobey \nto be Ambassador to the Syrian Arab Republic, and Thomas Riley to be \nAmbassador to Morocco.\n  These are important posts to the war on terrorism, Mr. President, and \nI regret that the Republicans were unable to clear them in order for \nthe full Senate to give its advice and consent to their confirmation. \nAgain, the record should reflect that these nominees would have been \nconfirmed today but for Republican objections.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S16064-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16064-S16068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ORGAN DONATION AND RECOVERY IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I wish to engage in a colloquy with the \ndistinguished majority leader, the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Frist. I \nappreciate his efforts on the bill before us today, and agree that this \nis a vitally important area. I believe this bill represents a good \nfirst step, but I would point out that minorities comprise over 40 \npercent of the organ transplant waiting list, even though they \nrepresent approximately 25 percent of the population. Half of the \npatients who needlessly die while awaiting a transplant are minorities.\n  African Americans are more likely to have end stage renal disease \nbecause they have the highest rate of hypertension in the world. Almost \n40 percent of Americans on the waiting list for kidneys are African \nAmerican, but they receive only 20 percent of available kidneys.\n  Evidence suggests that African Americans may face discrimination \nduring the transplantation process. White patients are 5 times more \nlikely than African Americans to receive transplants, even when they \nare equally qualified.\n  We must increase our commitment to ending health disparities. I \nbelieve that more must be done to improve the rates of organ donation \namong minority communities and focus specifically among these \npopulations to determine what the barriers to organ donation and \ntransplantation currently are, as well as devise mechanisms to reduce \nor eliminate such barriers.\n  I am disappointed that the legislation did not include provisions to \ndirectly address the disparity in organ donation and transplantation \nand the special needs of minority populations. I had hoped to include \nthese provisions.\n  Nonetheless, the need to enhance organ donation is too compelling to \nignore, and for that reason, I am supporting the current legislation. \nIt is our expectation that recipients of grant awards and contracts \nauthorized under this Act will include consideration of minority \nconcerns in all activities.\n  I hope to work with the majority leader next year to address this \ncritical issue.\n  Mr. FRIST. I appreciate the remarks of the Senator from \nMassachusetts. As the Senator knows, the question of health care \ndisparities is a keenly important issue to me. He and I have \nsuccessfully worked in this area in the past, and I hope will be able \nto similarly collaborate in the future.\n  Much work in the area of minorities and organ donation is happening \ntoday.\n\n[[Page S16068]]\n\nThese issues were strong recommendations of the Secretary's Advisory \nCommittee on Transplantation, and COT in fact went further and \nrequested a study from NIH to define the reasons for African Americans \nto have diminished graft survival. And just earlier this fall, HRSA \nannounced 8 grants that it was funding to test social and behavioral \ninterventions to increase organ and tissue donation--five of these, \ntotaling more than $1.6 million, focused on minority and underserved \npopulations.\n  And we have a bill today that has been developed through a \nbipartisan, bicameral process intended to allow us to make quick action \non the bill. I appreciate the Senator's willingness to support this \nbill, and look forward to working with him in this area next year.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I commend his work and congratulate him on passage of \nthis bill. I look forward to working with the Senator from Tennessee \nand others to build on this important start and draft bipartisan \nlegislation in the next session to address the unique health and health \ncare needs of minority and underserved populations.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I commend Admiral Loy for his \nwillingness to take on the position of Deputy Secretary of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, one of the most important and also \nmost difficult jobs in the federal government. The fledgling Department \nof Homeland Security is a critical undertaking for our government and \nour country. We know that we face real and ongoing threats to our \ndomestic security from terrorism, and the Department is our best hope \nof bringing the critical focus, resources and leadership to bear on \nthese new and insidious threats. It is a momentous undertaking fraught \nwith challenges, and we must give the Department every support we can \nto achieve its vital task. Unfortunately, in the face of numerous \nexpert reports chronicling the terrorist threat to United States \ncitizens)--and the need for a dramatic infusion of new federal funds--\nPresident Bush has consistently failed to embrace the challenge of \nhomeland security with vision or resources.\n  As Deputy Secretary, Admiral Loy will be second-in-command and have \ninfluence over the full array of DHS policies and practices. As such, I \nhope he will work forcefully to close the existing gaps in our \nsecurity--and in the administration's efforts on homeland security. I \nhave detailed some of my concerns in other floor statements and in \nnumerous letters to Secretary Ridge and other DHS officials. We are, to \nquote a distinguished report sponsored by the Council on Foreign \nRelations, ``drastically underfunded, dangerously unprepared'' with \nrespect to our state and local first responders and the federal \ngovernment's efforts here are falling far short. The administration is \nthwarting a critical congressional mandate to create a true \nintelligence fusion center within DHS. On critical infrastructure \nprotection, our government has yet to complete vital threat and risk \nassessments, much less implement forceful measures to protect these \ncritical assets. I will not repeat all those concerns here, but instead \nfocus on the dangerous gaps I perceive with respect to transportation \nsecurity--the issue that has been Admiral Loy's direct responsibility \nas head of the Transportation Security Administration, TSA, and one \nover which he will continue to exercise considerable influence.\n  TSA was created in the aftermath of 9/11 in response to the tragic \nweaknesses in the air security realm that were exposed by the attacks. \nIndeed, TSA has made important strides to improve certain aspects of \naviation security, such as passenger and baggage screening. But \ncritical deficiencies exist in these and other areas of air security, \nand the agency has barely begun to tackle its broader transportation \nsecurity mandate. Although Admiral Loy will be leaving his post as \nAdministrator of TSA, I believe it is essential that he continue to \nplace a high priority on resolving these critical issues.\n  By law, the Transportation Security Administration is responsible for \nsecurity in all modes of transportation. But TSA has thus far focused \nalmost exclusively on commercial aviation, leaving treacherous \nweaknesses in other transportation systems--a problem I outlined in a \nJuly 9 letter to Secretary Ridge. For fiscal year 2004, the \nadministration sought $4.3 billion for passenger aviation security, but \nonly $86 million for TSA's maritime and land security efforts. \nCongressional appropriators added some additional resources for \nmaritime and land security, but there is still very little money \navailable for these critical needs.\n  For instance, with respect to maritime transportation, the Coast \nGuard has identified billions of dollars worth of necessary \nimprovements--and Congress has mandated greater security--yet the \nadministration requested no money for port security grants to help make \nthe changes and only $125 million for this purpose was ultimately \nincluded in the DHS appropriations bill. Indeed, there is not even \nenough funding for Coast Guard employees to review the security plans \nmandated under the Maritime Transportation Security Act. This even as \nexpert upon expert has identified the Nation's 360 commercial ports as \na leading cause for concern on the homeland front--in large part \nbecause of the valuable goods and energy imports channeled through \nthese ports and because the millions of containers that enter this \ncountry by sea can hide untold dangers.\n  Mass transit systems are another grave source of concern. We all \nremember the 1995 attack on the Tokyo subway, when members of a \nJapanese cult released sarin, a lethal chemical nerve gas, on five \nsubway trains during rush hour. Twelve people were killed and thousands \ninjured. Only mistakes by the terrorists kept the death toll from being \nfar higher. Here in the United States, our transit systems remain \nvulnerable to such an attack. In many cases, transit officials have \nalready identified steps to make the system more secure, but simply \ncannot afford to take them. Transit systems typically struggle just to \nmeet operating costs and are simply not in a position to fund major new \nsecurity investments on their own. A December 2002 GAO report concluded \nthat ``insufficient funding is the most significant\n\n[[Page S16070]]\n\nchallenge in making . . . transit systems as safe and secure as \npossible.'' The administration did recently award some grants to help a \nnumber of urban transit systems, but nowhere near the kind of \ncommitment that is needed to confront the problem.\n  Nor do we see a commitment to improve rail security, although vast \nquantities of hazardous materials are shipped by rail.\n  Given this vast amount of work to be done by TSA in all modes of \ntransportation, it is inexplicable to me why the administration \nactually sought to decrease the agency's budget in FY 04.\n  But it is not simply a matter of money. TSA has not formulated the \nessential strategic plans needed to guide transportation security \nefforts. Admiral Loy testified last May that the agency was close to \nfinishing such a document--the National Transportation System Security \nPlan or NTSSP. GAO has testified that this national plan is a \n``prerequisite'' to investing wisely in transportation security. Yet as \npart of the hearing process for this nomination, Admiral Loy stated \nthat such a plan is still months away, at best.\n  Even in the area of passenger aviation, where TSA has focused \nvirtually all its resources, troubling gaps remain. Although TSA spent \nhundreds of millions to recruit and train screeners, thousands of these \nemployees are gone due to layoffs and attrition and we now face serious \nscreener shortages at some airports. While I recognize that this is a \ncomplex question, it simply is not clear that TSA has control of this \nissue and is implementing a staffing level needed to assure adequate \nsecurity. There have been other problems. For example, TSA failed to \ncomplete background checks of many of the screeners hired before they \nwere trained and deployed, resulting in the discovery last spring that \nover 1200 screeners had felony convictions or other disqualifying \nproblems that required their termination. Investigations by the DHS \nInspector General and TSA's Office of Internal Affairs into the baggage \nscreener training program found that trainees were given the questions \nand answers to the final certification exam and that some of the test \nquestions were ``inane'' or simply ``gave away'' the correct response. \nGAO has reported that TSA has not yet fully developed or deployed \nrecurrent or supervisory training programs to ensure that screeners are \neffectively trained and supervised.\n  Moreover, despite considerable attention to the safety of air \npassengers and their baggage, TSA has not developed a reliable system \nto screen commercial cargo loaded onto the very same planes. This cargo \nis still not being screened for explosives and TSA currently is relying \non the airlines to implement a ``known shipper'' program as the primary \nmethod of ensuring the security of this cargo, despite the numerous \nvulnerabilities GAO and the Department of Transportation Inspector \nGeneral have identified in this approach. TSA has still taken only \npreliminary steps toward assessing security technologies that are \nneeded to restrict access to secure areas of airports, despite the \nrequirements of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act that it do \nso. Airport perimeter security also requires significant improvement, \naccording to GAO, including the need to guard against possible \nterrorist attacks using shoulder-fired portable missiles from locations \nnear airports. In addition, GAO has raised substantial concerns about \nthe limited progress TSA has made in shoring up security at general \naviation airports. To date, general aviation pilots and passengers are \nnot screened before takeoff and the contents of general aviation planes \nare not screened at any point, leaving general aviation far more open \nand potentially vulnerable than commercial passenger aviation.\n  I understand that the administration's failure to seek adequate \nfunding and TSA's deadlines have greatly contributed to the challenges \nTSA faces in remedying these and other gaps in our aviation security. I \npledge to continue my efforts to increase the resources we devote to \nthese needs. However, TSA has also exercised inadequate oversight of \nthe contracts it has entered into to perform many of the essential \ntasks needed to improve aviation security. The resulting problems \ninclude the huge cost overrun of its screener hiring contract with NCS \nPearson, which ballooned from an original estimate of $104 million to \nover $700 million. I intend to watch closely to make sure that TSA \nimplements stringent management controls and procedures so that we can \nbe assured TSA's programs are effective, appropriately focused and \nachieving expected results.\n\n                      NOMINATION OF MICHAEL GARCIA\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, although I do not intend to object to \nthe confirmation of Michael Garcia to be Assistant Secretary of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, Bureau of Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement, BICE, I do want to take this opportunity to express my \nconcern about his handling of an issue that arose during the Committee \non Governmental Affairs' consideration of his nomination. Specifically, \nI would like to describe my concerns about the way Mr. Garcia responded \nto questions from the committee related to his bureau's participation \nin a search for a plane belonging to a Texas state legislator. My \nconcerns about the nominees's answers occurred in the context of \nproblems we have been having getting clear and comprehensive answers \nfrom some other nominees for department positions, and from receiving \nsatisfactory answers to inquiries related to our oversight \nresponsibilities. I hope that by calling attention to these concerns, I \ncan encourage the Department of Homeland Security, DHS to work with its \noversight committees in a more straightforward and cooperative fashion.\n  In this statement, I intend to describe in some detail the \ncircumstances that I find troubling. To summarize, I have two main \nconcerns. First, it took Mr. Garcia far too long--until well after the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee reported his nomination--to acknowledge \nwhat until then had been a rather uncontroversial fact: that the \npendency of an investigation by an agency's Inspector General does not \npreclude an official of that agency from responding to congressional \nrequests for information about matters that are the subject of the IG's \ninvestigation. A significant part of Congress' work involves overseeing \nhow agencies do their jobs, and this committee in particular often \nconducts investigations of alleged waste, fraud and abuse by agencies. \nIf the pendency of an internal investigation stood as a per se bar to \ncongressional information requests, our oversight work would often be \nstymied. Mr. Garcia's assertion of virtual immunity from being \nquestioned about matters under internal investigation is unfortunately \nemblematic of this administration's and this Department's frequent \nstinginess with sharing information with Congress about matters that \nare appropriate topics of congressional oversight. That this refusal to \nprovide information occurred in the context of a committee's \nconsideration of a nomination was all the more troubling, because it \nsuggested that even at the moment when the incentive for cooperation \nwas the greatest, the department was urging its officials to resist \nappropriate requests for information. The department and Mr. Garcia now \nconcede that a pending IG investigation is not grounds for refusing to \nprovide Congress with information; as they acknowledge, Congress \nfrequently inquires into--and receives information about--matters under \ninvestigation. Although it came frustratingly late, I appreciate their \nwillingness to revisit their position and look forward to greater \ncooperation from them on such matters in the future.\n  Second, I was concerned that Mr. Garcia's answers to written \nquestions were misleading, whether or not he intended them to be, and I \nam even more disturbed that after I challenged Mr. Garcia's responses, \nhe and his advisers passed up a number of opportunities to clarify his \nresponses. I will describe the back and forth in greater detail below, \nbut in short, Mr. Garcia stated in written answers to the committee \nthat he declined to answer questions about the search for the Texas \nlegislator because the IG's office had directed him not to, even though \nneither he nor his advisers had even contacted the IG's office about my \nquestions until he had twice declined to answer them. Mr. Garcia \ncontinued to maintain that the IG's office directed him not to answer \nmy questions, even after I reported to him that the IG's office did not \nbelieve it\n\n[[Page S16071]]\n\nhad issued such a direction and even after one of his advisers was \nexplicitly told by the Assistant Inspector General heading the Texas \ninvestigation that such an answer was inaccurate. After the committee \nreported his nomination, Mr. Garcia ultimately expressed his regret for \nthese events, explaining that he did not intend to mislead the \ncommittee, which is why I will not stand in the way of his nomination. \nBut I once again am forced to observe that this exchange was nowhere \nnear the frank and honest effort at providing requested information \nthat Congress has a right to expect from agency officials. It instead \nappears to have been an effort at finding any excuse for declining to \nanswer questions and then, when it became apparent that the excuse \ncould not stand, seeking to find any way possible to avoid correcting \nthe mistaken assertion. As mentioned, Mr. Garcia has subsequently \nexpressed his regret for how he answered these questions, and has \npledged to better cooperate with the Committee in the future. I am \nhopeful that both he and the department will live up to that pledge.\n  To provide more detail: when the Committee on Governmental Affairs \nreceived the nomination of Michael Garcia on March 26, 2003, he was \nalready serving as Acting Assistant Secretary for BICE. He was leading \nthe Bureau when, on May 12, 2003, it assisted in a search for the plane \nbelonging to a member of the Texas legislature; the search had been \ninitiated by leaders from the opposing party, as part of a highly \npolitical and partisan intrastate redistricting feud. At the time of \nthese events it struck me as inappropriate that homeland security \nresources were diverted for this purpose, especially as it set a \ndisturbing precedent of misusing the department's powers and authority \nto pursue American citizens who had broken no laws. So, as part of the \ncommittee's consideration of Mr. Garcia's nomination, I submitted a \nseries of written questions about the incident, in my capacity as \nranking member of the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n  Over the course of several weeks, Mr. Garcia provided answers that \nwere unresponsive, unsatisfactory, and inconsistent. Mr. Garcia's legal \nadvisers at the Department of Homeland Security appear to have \ncompounded the problem by looking for ways to avoid the questions \nrather than clear up misunderstandings that became increasingly \napparent.\n  In written questions sent on May 16, 2003, before Mr. Garcia's \ncommittee hearing, I asked the following questions:\n\n       On May 15, 2003, the Bureau acknowledged that its Air and \n     Marine Interdiction Coordination Center, AMICC, had earlier \n     that week participated in the search for the airplane of a \n     Texas legislator.\n       1. What action was requested of the AMICC, and by whom?\n       2. What action, if any, was actually taken by the AMICC? \n     Which federal officials were involved in directing that \n     action be taken?\n       3. What other federal agencies were involved, if any, and \n     what actions did they take?\n       4. If any action was taken by the Homeland Security \n     Department, please explain how these actions fall within the \n     Department's mission?\n       5. If actions were taken in error, or in contravention of \n     Department policy, what steps will be taken to ensure that \n     similar mistakes will not happen again?''\n\n  On May 30, 2003, Mr. Garcia responded that because BICE had referred \nthe underlying issues to the Office of the Inspector General, OIG, ``it \nwould be inappropriate to offer comment on the questions above.'' He \nattached to his answer a press release BICE had earlier issued, \noffering comment on the matter, including conclusions that BICE had \nacted appropriately in the incident. Concerned by the suggestion that \nthe existence of an IG investigation serves as an absolute bar to an \nExecutive Branch official providing any information to Congress, my \nstaff on June 2, 2003, again asked Mr. Garcia about the issue at the \nbipartisan interview Committee staff routinely conduct in the course of \nconsidering nominations. Mr. Garcia again declined to answer the \nquestions. At the staff interview Mr. Garcia was informed that Congress \nroutinely seeks information and testimony about matters under criminal \ninvestigation, and is routinely provided the information.\n  Apparently in response to the concerns raised at the staff interview, \non June 2 the Chief Legal Counselor to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, Lucy Clark, contacted the Counsel to the department's Acting \nInspector General, Richard Reback. According to Mr. Reback, Ms. Clark \ntold him that Mr. Garcia would be appearing for his confirmation \nhearing and asked how he should respond if questioned about the Texas \nmatter. At Ms. Clark's request, on June 4, Mr. Reback sent by e-mail a \nhypothetical question and proposed answer, in which Reback suggested \nthat Mr. Garcia, if asked ``what actions are you taking on the issue of \ndiversion of Department of Homeland Security resources to search for \nTexas State legislators?'', could respond, ``The OIG has asked that any \nquestions relating to this matter be directed to them.'' Mr. Reback \nlater made clear in a letter to me that he was not aware at the time \n``that specific questions were pending or had been posed.'' Ms. Clark \ndid not tell Mr. Reback that Mr. Garcia had already declined to answer \nquestions on two occasions, or that he had been informed by Committee \nstaff that his answer was unsatisfactory. Mr. Reback later explained \nthat he was not directing Mr. Garcia not to answer inquiries from \nCongress. Rather, it was his hope that a referral to his Office could \nbe the beginning of a dialogue with Congress, not the end of the \ndialogue.\n  After Mr. Garcia's nomination hearing, on June 5, 2003, I remained \nconcerned by the suggestion that an IG investigation could immunize \nExecutive Branch officials from Congressional information requests. I \ntherefore submitted post-hearing questions, which included the \nfollowing inquiries about why Mr. Garcia believed he could decline to \nanswer my questions on the Texas matter:\n\n       a. Why do you believe it would be inappropriate to comment?\n       b. Did the Office of Inspector General ask you not to \n     comment?\n       c. Will you refuse to provide Congress with information on \n     any matter being investigated by an inspector general? If \n     your willingness to provide information to Congress would \n     depend on the circumstances, please specify in what \n     circumstances you would refuse to provide information.\n       d. As Acting Assistant Secretary for BICE at the time the \n     incident occurred, do you have any knowledge of the \n     circumstances of your bureau's involvement, either direct or \n     second-hand? Did you take any steps to learn about the \n     bureau's role? Were you involved in deciding how the Bureau \n     should respond to the incident, and to the news reports that \n     described the incident?''\n\n  On Friday, June 13, 2003, Mr. Garcia sent his responses to the post-\nhearing questions. Mr. Garcia stated that he had ``received direction \nfrom the Inspector General's Office to refer all inquiries regarding \nthis matter to that office.'' He also stated that ``the IG's office \ndirected that it would not be appropriate to comment on this issue and \nthat all inquiries be directed to that office,'' and ``in this case I \nwas directed to refer all inquiries to the Inspector General's \nOffice.'' Mr. Garcia's answers did not specify who had directed him not \nto answer, nor did they describe the nature of the communications with \nthe IG's office. In response to the question about whether he would \nrefuse to provide Congress with information on any matter being \ninvestigated by an inspector general, Mr. Garcia responded \n``(g)enerally, I would defer to the IG's office for direction on \ninquiries relating to any matter actively being investigated by that \noffice.'' He declined to answer whether he had any knowledge of the \ncircumstances of his Bureau's involvement in the incident, and what \nactions he took in its aftermath.\n\n  Aware of no law, custom or precedent that would allow an IG to direct \nan Executive Branch official to decline to answer Congressional \ninformation requests, I had my staff contact the Department of DHS \nOffice of Inspector General to learn more about the IG's views of this \nissue. On the afternoon of June 13, Lisa Redman, the assistant \nInspector General responsible for the investigation into the Texas \nincident, denied to my staff that anyone from the IG's office had \ndirected Mr. Garcia not to comment on the issue. She also informed \nCommittee staff that the IG's office had no policy that would have \nprecluded him from answering questions about his role in the incident, \nor from giving answers based on information provided by personnel at \nBICE.\n  Concerned by this discrepancy, on the evening of June 13, I sent Mr. \nGarcia another set of post-hearing questions, seeking clarification \nregarding\n\n[[Page S16072]]\n\nthe apparently contradictory information received from the IG's office. \nMy questions also informed Mr. Garcia that both the Congressional \nResearch Service and the Senate Legal Counsel had confirmed that an \nongoing IG's investigation did not provide a legal basis for someone to \nrefuse to provide information to Congress.\n  As we later learned from Ms. Redman in a letter responding to my \ninquiries, on the morning of June 16, while Mr. Garcia and his staff \nwere preparing answers to my questions, Ms. Redman received a telephone \ncall from Mark Wallace, who was then Mr. Garcia's principal legal \nadviser at BICE. According to Ms. Redman, Mr. Wallace ``was very \nagitated and stated that the OIG had provided answers [to the \nCommittee] inconsistent to those he provided on Mr. Garcia's behalf.'' \nMs. Redman informed Mr. Wallace that no one from the IG's office had \n``directed'' Mr. Garcia not to answer questions from Congress, that the \nIG's office had never been told about Mr. Garcia's written responses to \nmy questions, and that Mr. Wallace should have cleared Mr. Garcia's \nanswers with the IG's office before submitting them. She also pointed \nout that the IG's office cannot direct Mr. Garcia to do anything. \nAccording to Ms. Redman, Mr. Wallace ``became quite angry and demanded \nthat we make our responses consistent with his,'' and he ``said it was \nthe OIG's fault that Mr. Garcia was now in this situation because we \nwere not consistent in our responses.'' Ms. Redman refused to change \nher story.\n  According to correspondence I received from Mr. Reback, Mr. Wallace \nalso contacted Reback on June 16, in an e-mail ``in which [Wallace] \nstated that the OIG had provided inconsistent guidance to Mr. Garcia on \nresponding to questions regarding the Texas matter.'' Mr. Reback said \nthat he responded in an e-mail to Mr. Wallace, in which he said he \nexplained that ``I had been asked for guidance on what Mr. Garcia could \nsay if asked a question [on] the Texas matter at his confirmation \nhearing, and that I had provided guidance reflected in my June 4th e-\nmail to Ms. Clark.'' Mr. Reback also told Mr. Wallace that he was \n``unaware that Mr. Garcia ever had received any written questions on \nthe matter and had not seen or cleared on [sic] any of his written \nresponses.'' Late in the evening of June 16, Mr. Reback was contacted \nby Ms. Clark and another adviser at BICE, Tim Haugh, who provided him a \ncopy of draft responses to the questions I sent Mr. Garcia on June \n13th. Mr. Reback did not review or comment on all of the draft \nresponses, but did request that ``with respect to questions that \nimplicated OIG statements, Mr. Garcia refer to my June 4th e-mail in \nhis responses.''\n  At 11:00 p.m. on June 16, less than 12 hours before the committee met \nto consider his nomination, Mr. Garcia provided additional responses in \nwhich he continued to maintain that he had in fact been directed not to \nanswer. For the first time, he referred the committee to the e-mail \nmessage Mr. Reback sent to Lucy Clark on June 4, 2003, but he made no \nmention of Ms. Redman's different interpretation of that communication, \nor of the IG's authority. Despite Ms. Redman's statements to his \nadviser, Mr. Garcia did not correct his earlier assertions that the \nInspector General has the authority to instruct someone not to \ncooperate with Congress; he cited his legal advisers at DHS and the \nIG's office as the sources of his conclusion.\n  At the committee mark-up on the morning of June 17, I expressed my \nconcerns about Mr. Garcia's refusal to answer questions about the Texas \nincident, and I questioned whether his reliance on supposed \ninstructions from the IG's office were factually accurate or legally \nsound. I entered into an agreement with Chairman Collins that I would \nnot object to the committee reporting Mr. Garcia's nomination, but that \nMr. Garcia's nomination would not go to the Senate floor until my \nquestions and concerns had been satisfactorily resolved.\n  I subsequently sent letters seeking additional information from Mr. \nReback, Ms. Redman, and Mr. Garcia. I have already described the \ninformation I received from Mr. Reback and Ms. Redman. Mr. Garcia, for \nhis part, maintained that all of his answers had been accurate, and \nthat he had reasonably interpreted Mr. Reback's e-mail as equivalent to \nbeing directed by the IG's office not to respond. He concluded that at \nall times he was ``guided by a sincere desire not to in any way \ninterfere with an ongoing criminal investigation'': ``At no time did I \nintend to evade answers or to in any way challenge the authority of \nCongress to inquire into such matters. I responded based on what I \nreasonably believed was the guidance from the OIG and counsel.''\n  Although I am troubled by how Mr. Garcia and his advisers at the \nDepartment dealt with this issue, I have nevertheless decided not to \noppose this otherwise qualified nominee. Still, I felt that the issues \nraised during his nomination process were important enough that they \ndeserved to be fully aired.\n  One of the principal functions of the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs, like all Senate committees, is to ensure that qualified, \ncapable and responsible people are ultimately appointed to the highest \npositions in our government, and to conduct oversight over the \ndepartments and agencies within its jurisdiction. Through both the \nconfirmation and oversight processes, we ensure ourselves and the \nAmerican people that our government is functioning as it should be. As \npart of these processes, we regularly engage in dialogues with \nnominees, including through written questions; the integrity of our \nprocess requires that nominees fully and forthrightly answer the \nquestions asked.\n  It appears to me that Mr. Garcia and his legal advisers at DHS \nprovided answers to the Committee that were misleading factually and \nmisstated the legal reasons a nominee could refuse to answer questions. \nFor example, Mr. Garcia did not have any communications with any \nofficial from the IG's office until June 4, 2003, after he had already, \non two occasions, declined to answer questions about the Texas matter. \nNevertheless, his answers to my post-hearing questions stated that he \nhad declined to answer the questions because ``the IG's office directed \nthat it would not be appropriate to comment on this issue and that all \ninquiries be directed to that office.'' Whatever Mr. Garcia's \nintention, that answer was not a factually accurate way of explaining \nanswers given before he or his advisers spoke with the IG's office \nabout the issue.\n  Furthermore, it is now clear that Mr. Garcia never was ``directed'' \nnot to answer the questions by the Office of Inspector General--an \nassertion he repeatedly made in his written responses to my questions. \nRegardless of whether Mr. Reback's June 4 e-mail could have been \ninterpreted as something stronger than intended, Mr. Garcia's legal \nadviser, Mr. Wallace, knew prior to Mr. Garcia's submission of his \nfinal set of answers that the IG's office was not directing him not to \nanswer questions and had never intended to do so. Nevertheless, Mr. \nGarcia submitted written answers on June 16 in which he continued to \nassert that the IG's office had directed him not to answer the \nquestions, referring to Mr. Reback's e-mail. Nothing in the answers \ngave any indication that the IG's office had explicitly rejected this \ninterpretation of Mr. Reback's e-mail.\n  Mr. Garcia's rationale for not answering the questions raised \nimportant institutional issues. As a general matter, I find it \nunacceptable for agency officials to argue that the pendency of an IG \ninvestigation categorically precludes them from responding to \ncongressional information requests. Congress often seeks information--\nand sometimes even conducts parallel investigations--on matters also \nunder review by IG offices. Were the pendency of IG investigations a \nbasis for an agency official or employee to decline to respond to \nCongressional inquiries, numerous Congressional inquiries conducted by \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee and other Committees would be \ninappropriately stymied.\n  The notion that an Inspector General could ``direct'' a Department \nofficial not to cooperate with Congress was itself troubling. Officials \nat the Inspector General's office understood that they did not have the \nauthority to ``direct'' Department officials not to answer questions, \nbut neither Mr. Garcia nor his legal advisers consulted with IG \nofficials on their choice of words until after they had already sent \nthe Committee Mr. Garcia's answers. I was especially disturbed, in this \ncontext, to\n\n[[Page S16073]]\n\nlearn that Mr. Garcia's legal adviser, Mark Wallace, apparently berated \nthe Assistant Inspector General and attempted to get her to change her \nversion of events to make it ``consistent'' with the answers he had \npreviously prepared. If true, this is highly improper behavior for a \ngovernment attorney, and might itself have been worthy of an \ninvestigation.\n  Subsequent to the Committee's reporting of Mr. Garcia's nomination, \nmy staff met with him to discuss these issues and my concerns about \nthese events as well as with other examples of DHS nominees providing \nless than adequate answers to questions posed during the nomination \nprocess. In light of Mr. Garcia's statement in that meeting that he did \nnot intend to mislead the Committee and now understood the need to \nbetter cooperate with Congress, I am prepared to move forward with his \nnomination. I could not do so, however, without leaving a complete \nrecord of my concern over these events.\n  Mr President, I thank my colleague, Chairman Collins, for working \nwith me towards a satisfactory resolution of this issue. I am glad that \nwe have had the opportunity to share with Mr. Garcia and with other DHS \nofficials our concerns about how this nomination was handled. I hope \nthat in the future the Department of Homeland Security will endeavor to \nwork constructively with all senators to avoid misunderstandings of the \ntype we experienced in this case, and to take seriously its obligations \nto provide Congress with the accurate, timely and complete information \nit needs.\n  In the interest of fairness to all parties, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of letters from Mr. Reback, Ms. Redman, and Mr. Garcia, \nbe printed in the Record following my remarks. Space limitations \nprevent me from including the full text of the pre-hearing and post-\nhearing questions asked of Mr. Garcia, and his answers, but those may \nbe found in the Committee's hearing record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Department of Homeland Security, Office of Inspector \n           General,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 26, 2003.\n     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, Dirsken Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lieberman: Thank you for your letter to me \n     dated June 23, 2003, in which you asked me to clarify a \n     matter before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, \n     specifically the Committee's consideration of the nomination \n     of Michael Garcia to serve as Assistant Secretary in the \n     Department of Homeland Security. The following responses to \n     your questions are below:\n       (1) Did you have any communications with Mr. Garcia about \n     how to respond to questions regarding the Texas matter? If \n     so, please state when each communication occurred, who \n     initiated the communication and who else was present, and \n     please describe the content of the conversation or \n     communication.\n       Response: No.\n       (2) Did you have communications with any DHS official or \n     employees seeking information on Mr. Garcia's behalf on how \n     to respond to Congressional information requests about the \n     Texas matter or otherwise involved in the drafting of Mr. \n     Garcia's responses? If so, please state the person with whom \n     you had each communication (including his or her title), who \n     initiated the communication, when the communication occurred, \n     and describe the content of the communication.\n       Response: Yes. I had telephone conversations with Lucy \n     Clark, DHS Chief Legal Counselor, on the afternoon of June 2, \n     on June 4, and possibly on June 3, 2003. These conversations \n     were initiated by Ms. Clark and each conversation was very \n     brief--I would estimate the total time for all my telephone \n     conversations with Ms. Clark on these days was approximately \n     five to ten minutes.\n       Ms. Clark told me that Mr. Garcia would be appearing for \n     his confirmation hearing and asked me how he should respond \n     if questioned about the Texas matter. I replied that Mr. \n     Garcia should state that the matter was under investigation \n     by the OIG and questions should be referred to the OIG. I \n     told Ms. Clark that since the OIG had an open criminal \n     investigation, we did not want people talking about the case. \n     Ms. Clark subsequently asked me to put my comments in writing \n     and I sent her the e-mail on June 4th that has been provided \n     to you. Ms. Redman, Assistant Inspector General for \n     Investigations, reviewed and concurred with my e-mail before \n     I sent it. Mr. Richard Skinner, Deputy Inspector General, \n     reviewed and concurred with my e-mail after I had sent it.\n       On June 16th, I received an e-mail from Mark Wallace, \n     Principal Legal Adviser to Mr. Garcia, in which he stated \n     that the OIG had provided inconsistent guidance to Mr. Garcia \n     on responding to questions regarding the Texas matter. Mr. \n     Wallace attached a copy of eight questions from Senator \n     Lieberman to Mr. Garcia. I responded to Mr. Wallace via e-\n     mail in which I stated that I had been asked for guidance on \n     what Mr. Garcia could say if asked a question about the Texas \n     matter at his confirmation hearing, and that I had provided \n     guidance reflected in my June 4th e-mail to Ms. Clark. I \n     further stated that I was unaware that Mr. Garcia ever had \n     received any written questions on the matter and had not seen \n     or cleared on any of his written responses. I also stated \n     that I heard nothing more about Mr. Garcia's response to \n     questions on the Texas matter until the afternoon of June \n     13th, when the Assistant Inspector General for \n     Investigations, Ms. Redman, had received oral questions from \n     some of the Committee's minority staff regarding Mr. Garcia's \n     responses. Finally, I stated that the OIG investigation was \n     closed, there was no criminal enforcement action and that Mr. \n     Garcia could answer any questions about the Texas matter. I \n     heard nothing further from Mr. Wallace.\n       Late that evening (June 16th), I had conversations with Ms. \n     Clark and with Mr. Tim Haugh, Director of Congressional \n     Relations, Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, \n     about questions Mr. Garcia had received from the Senate \n     Committee on Governmental Affairs and which Mr. Garcia \n     intended to respond to that day. My conversations were \n     primarily with Mr. Haugh, who provided me a copy of draft \n     responses to those questions. I did not review or comment on \n     all of the responses. I did however, request that with \n     respect to questions that implicated OIG statements, Mr. \n     Garcia refer to my June 4th e-mail in his responses.\n       (3) Please indicate specifically whether any communications \n     you had with persons outside the OIG about Mr. Garcia's \n     responses occurred before June 4, 2003.\n       Response: Please see answer above.\n       (4) Please indicate whether you are aware of any other \n     person employed by the OIG discussing this matter with DHS \n     personnel acting on Mr. Garcia's behalf. If you are aware of \n     any such discussions, please indicate who had the discussion, \n     who initiated it, when it occurred (and specifically whether \n     it was before June 4, 2003) and, to the extent you know, the \n     contents of the discussion.\n       Response: I am unaware of any other person employed by the \n     OIG having such discussions other than my conversations on \n     June 2nd and possibly June 3rd as discussed above.\n       (5) Mr. Garcia attached your e-mail to Lucy Clark to \n     substantiate his assertion that the IG's office ``directed'' \n     him not to respond to the questions sent to him.\n       (a) Please provide in as much detail as you can recall the \n     contents of any communications you had with Ms. Clark that \n     led to you drafting the e-mail provided to the Committee. Who \n     initiated the conversation? What specifically did Ms. Clark \n     tell you about the questions sent to Mr. Garcia? What did she \n     ask you to do?\n       Response: Please see my response to question 2 above. As \n     stated, I did not know that Mr. Garcia had received any \n     written questions nor that he had appeared for a Committee \n     staff interview on June 2, 2003.\n       (b) Was anyone other than Ms. Clark involved in these \n     communications? If so, state who was involved (including the \n     person's title) and the nature and content of their \n     involvement.\n       Response: Please see my response to questions above.\n       (c) Did you tell Ms. Clark that you were ``directing'' Mr. \n     Garcia to refer all inquiries regarding the matter to your \n     office?\n       Response: I did not use the terms ``direct'' or \n     ``directing.'' However, in my conversations with Ms. Clark, I \n     believe it was clear that the OIG did not ant DHS personnel \n     discussing a matter that was under criminal investigation by \n     the OIG without first coordinating with the OIG.\n       (d) Did you believe your e-mail was ''directing'' Mr. \n     Garcia to refer all inquiries regarding the matter to your \n     office?\n       Response: Please see my response above.\n       (e) The question attached to your e-mail does not use \n     language encompassing all questions related to the Texas \n     matter, but rather asks only what action Mr. Garcia is \n     currently taking on it. The bulk of my questions, in \n     contrast, asked about past events, not Mr. Garcia's current \n     actions. Did you tell Ms. Clark that Mr. Garcia should refer \n     all Congressional questions, including seeking Mr. Garcia's \n     knowledge about underlying events, to the IG's office.\n       Response: My conversations with Ms. Clark did not involve \n     that level of specificity. I was unaware of your prior \n     questions to Mr. Garcia at the time I had my conversations on \n     June 2nd-June 4th.\n       (f) Did you believe the attachment to your e-mail suggested \n     that Mr. Garcia should not answer the questions reprinted at \n     the bottom of page 1 of this letter?\n       Response: At the time I sent the e-mail, I was not aware \n     that specific questions were pending or had been posed. My \n     advice was inthe context of a potential inquiry along the \n     lines stated in my June 4th e-mail.\n       (g) Did Ms. Clark (or any other person involved in these \n     communications with you) ask you to provide a different \n     answer than the one you gave to her? If so, that was her or \n     their proposal, and why did you not agree to it? Please \n     describe in full the discussion on this matter.\n\n[[Page S16074]]\n\n       Response: At no time during our conversations on June 2nd-\n     4th did Ms. Clark or anyone else ask me to provide a \n     different answer than the one I provided.\n       (6) Did you ever direct Mr. Garcia or anyone inquiring on \n     his behalf not to answer questions from Congress on the Texas \n     matter? (If your previous answers dispose of this and/or any \n     of the following questions in their entirety, feel free to so \n     indicate).\n       Response: No. Please see my responses to questions above.\n       (7) Are you aware of any other OIG personnel directing Mr. \n     Garcia or anyone inquiring on his behalf not to a answer \n     questions from Congress on the Texas matter? If so, please \n     identify the individuals involved, when they issued the \n     direction, to whom they gave it, and the content of any \n     communications related to such direction.\n       Response: No. Please see my responses to questions above.\n       (8) Do you believe you or anyone in the IG's office had the \n     authority to ``direct'' Mr. Garcia not to answer these \n     questions? If so, please state the basis of that authority.\n       Response: No.\n       (9) Did you ever tell Mr. Garcia or anyone inquiring on his \n     behalf that it would be ``inappropriate to offer comment'' in \n     response to Congressional questions regarding BICE's \n     involvement in the Texas matter? If so, please identify the \n     person to whom you made this statement, when you made it and \n     the basis for your making that statement.\n       Response: I do not remember if I used those exact words. \n     However, it would have been reasonable for Ms. Clark to infer \n     that I believed it would be prudent for Mr. Garcia to check \n     with the OIG before offering comment about the OIG's \n     investigation of BICE's involvement in the Texas matter.\n       At the time, the OIG had an open criminal investigation. \n     Generally, we seek to avoid public discussion of open \n     criminal matters to avoid jeopardizing the success of a \n     potential future prosecution, impeding our ability to gather \n     all relevant information, affecting the impartiality and \n     perceived impartiality of our work, and other such concerns. \n     We also try to discourage speculation about the outcome of a \n     pending investigation.\n       (10) Had you seen Mr. Garcia's answers to the questions \n     sent to him by the Committee prior to receiving this letter? \n     If so, in what context did you see them? Who showed them to \n     you and when? Were you shown any of Mr. Garcia's written \n     responses before he sent them to the Committee? Regardless of \n     when you saw them, did you believe the answers to be accurate \n     in their representation of the IG office's statements and \n     views? If not, did you communicate that belief to anyone in \n     DHS? If so, to whom? When? What were the contents of that \n     conversation?\n       Response: I saw a draft of Mr. Garcia's June 16th answers \n     on the evening of June 16th; I did not see the final document \n     until after it had been sent to the Committee. I believe the \n     responses received by the Committee are accurate in their \n     representation of OIG statements, namely, I sent the June 4, \n     2003, email to Ms. Clark. I did not offer any comment on the \n     responses in any other respect. I did not see the written \n     responses to any of the other sets of questions until \n     provided them by Committee's minority staff in the course of \n     responding to these questions.\n       Examining the responses after the fact, I believe that the \n     scope of the OIG guidance may have been misunderstood. The \n     OIG had not intended, and did not direct that no \n     Congressional requests be answered. Instead, we asked that \n     questions be referred to the OIG because the OIG had an open \n     criminal investigation. We did not intend that to be the end \n     of the dialogue with the Congress.\n       (11) Please provide any additional information you believe \n     might be helpful to clarify the Committee's record on this \n     matter.\n       Response: Legal authority supports the general position \n     that an OIG can withhold certain confidential information \n     from Congress during the course of an open criminal \n     investigation. See 13 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 77 (1989). In my \n     experience, I have found Congressional staff members \n     sensitive to these issues and willing to accommodate OIG \n     concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Richard N. Reback,\n     Counsel to the Acting Inspector General.\n                                  ____\n\n         Department of Homeland Security, Office of Inspector \n           General,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 26, 2003.\n     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lieberman: Thank you for your letter to me \n     dated June 23, 2003, in which you asked me to clarify a \n     matter before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, \n     specifically the Committee's consideration of the nomination \n     of Michael Garcia to serve as Assistant Secretary in the \n     Department of Homeland Security. The following responses to \n     your questions are provided below:\n       (1) Did you have any communications with Mr. Garcia about \n     how to respond to questions regarding the Texas matter? If \n     so, please state when each communication occurred, who \n     initiated it and who else was present, and please describe \n     the content of the communication.\n       Response: No.\n       (2) Did you have communications with any DHS official or \n     employee seeking information on Mr. Garcia's behalf on how to \n     respond to Congressional information requests about the Texas \n     matter or otherwise involved in the drafting of Mr. Garcia's \n     responses? If so, please identify the person with whom you \n     had each communication (including his or her title), state \n     who initiated the communication, indicate when the \n     communication occurred, and describe the content of the \n     communication.\n       Response: No, not until June 16th and that conversation was \n     with Mark Wallace after he had sent responses to the \n     Committee on Mr. Garcia's behalf.\n       (3) Please indicate specifically whether any communications \n     you had with persons outside the OIG about Mr. Garcia's \n     responses occurred before June 4, 2003.\n       Response: I had no communications outside the OIG prior to \n     June 4, 2003, regarding Mr. Garcia's responses.\n       (4) Please indicate whether you are aware of any other \n     person employed by the OIG discussing this matter with Mr. \n     Garcia or with DHS personnel acting on Mr. Garcia's behalf. \n     If you are aware of any such discussions, please indicate who \n     had the discussion, who initiated it, when it occurred (and \n     specifically whether it was before June 4, 2003) and, to the \n     extent you know, the contents of the discussion.\n       Response: I am aware that OIG Counsel Richard Reback was \n     contacted by DHS General Counsel Lucy Clark on June 4th or \n     perhaps June 3rd; during which contact Ms. Clark sought \n     advice from Counsel Reback as to what Mr. Garcia should say \n     if asked about the OIG Texas investigation. Mr. Reback \n     advised me that Ms. Clark initiated contact with him and he \n     provided an email to her in response as to suggested language \n     Mr. Garcia might use. That is the same email previously \n     provided to your staff. Mr. Reback showed me his proposed \n     email before he sent it and I concurred with its contents.\n       (5) Did you ever direct Mr. Garcia or anyone inquiring on \n     his behalf not to answer questions from Congress on the Texas \n     matter? If so, please describe when that happened, to whom \n     you gave that direction, who initiated the communication, and \n     the details of your direction.\n       Response: No direction was provided by me to Mr. Garcia or \n     anyone acting on his behalf on any matter.\n       (6) Are you aware of any OIG personnel directing Mr. Garcia \n     or anyone inquiring on his behalf not to answer questions \n     from Congress on the Texas matter? If so, please describe \n     when that happened, who gave the direction and to whom that \n     direction was given, who initiated the communication, and the \n     details of the direction.\n       Response: I am not aware of any OIG contact with Mr. Garcia \n     or anyone on his behalf directing him as to what to say or \n     not to say.\n       (7) Do you believe you or anyone in the IG's office had the \n     authority to ``direct'' Mr. Garcia not to answer these \n     questions? If so, please state the basis of that authority.\n       Response: No, I do not believe the OIG has the authority to \n     ``direct'' Mr. Garcia or anyone else in DHS to answer or not \n     answer questions from Congress.\n       (8) Did you ever tell Mr. Garcia or anyone inquiring on his \n     behalf that it would be ``inappropriate to offer comment'' in \n     response to Congressional questions regarding BICE's \n     involvement in the Texas matter? If so, please identify the \n     person to whom you made this statement, when you made it and \n     the basis for your making that statement.\n       Response: No, I never made that statement to Mr. Garcia or \n     anyone on his behalf.\n       (9) Had you seen or discussed Mr. Garcia's answers to the \n     questions sent to him by the Committee prior to receiving \n     this letter? If so, in what context did you see them? Who \n     showed them to you and when? Were you shown any of Mr. \n     Garcia's written responses before he sent them to the \n     Committee? Regardless of when you saw them, did you believe \n     the answers to be accurate in their representation of the IG \n     office's statements and views? If not, did you communicate \n     that belief to anyone in DHS? If so, to whom? When? What were \n     the contents of that conversation?\n       Response: the first time I saw any questions for Mr. Garcia \n     was on the morning of June 16th. Those questions were e-\n     mailed to me by Mark Wallace, who identified himself as Mr. \n     Garcia's Principal Legal Advisor. He sought assistance in \n     preparing responses to those questions on Mr. Garcia's behalf \n     and asked for ``urgent'' help at 9:41 am. I did not see any \n     responses he drafted to those questions until the morning of \n     June 17th. A faxed copy of his responses was under my door \n     when I arrived at work. I e-mailed Mr. Reback at 8:32 am on \n     June 17th and advised him that the responses prepared by Mr. \n     Wallace to Questions 2 and 3 were not accurate as they \n     purported to represent a conversation Wallace and I had the \n     morning of June 16th. I was subsequently told by Mr. Reback \n     that those responses did not get sent to the committee; \n     instead a new (second) set of responses was drafted by the \n     night before and those responses were the ones sent to you by \n     Lucy Clark. The set of responses you received was accurate.\n       (10) You indicated to my staff that on Friday, June 13, you \n     had a conversation with the individual who drafted Mr. \n     Garcia's responses to the questions regarding the Texas \n     matter and that you told him that the IG's office had not \n     ``directed'' Mr. Garcia not to respond to the questions. To \n     the extent that you have not already done so in response to \n     the questions above, please answer the following questions \n     with respect to that conversation:\n       (a) With whom did you have this conversation (please \n     identify the individual's name and title)?\n\n[[Page S16075]]\n\n       Response: I did say in a meeting with your staff on June \n     19th that I had such a conversation on Friday, June 13th. \n     However, I was mistaken and realized that mistake in \n     reviewing my e-mails and telephone notes. On the afternoon \n     and early evening of Friday, June 13th I had several \n     telephone conversations with Kevin Landy of your staff from \n     whom I learned for the first time that questions and answers \n     had been provided to the Committee by Mr. Garcia. The \n     conversation to which you refer actually occurred on Monday, \n     June 16th between 9:41 and 9:54 am between myself and Mark \n     Wallace, Principal Legal Advisor to Mr. Garcia.\n       (b) Because Mr. Garcia sent answers to the questions on \n     that date (DHS staff emailed them to Committee staff at 12:29 \n     p.m.), please identify to the most precise extent you can \n     recall when in the day that conversation occurred.\n       Response: as indicated above, I misspoke and I did not have \n     any conversations with Mr. Wallace until Monday, June 16th, \n     not Friday, June 13th. My June 13th conversations were with \n     Kevin Landy, not Mark Wallace.\n       (c) Who initiated the conversation?\n       Response: the conversation on June 16th was initiated by \n     Mark Wallace. He called the main number, asked for Mr. \n     Reback, then Mr. Skinner, and finally me after learning the \n     other two were not available.\n       (d) Who else was involved in it?\n       Response: No one else was involved in this conversation.\n       (e) Please describe in the greatest detail possible, the \n     contents of the conversation.\n       Response: Mr. Wallace was very agitated and stated that the \n     OIG had provided answers inconsistent to those he provided on \n     Mr. Garcia's behalf. I asked him to which questions he was \n     referring and he said he submitted a number of responses for \n     the record on Friday (June 13th) and also prior to Mr. \n     Garcia's hearing. I told him that he should have coordinated \n     those responses with the OIG because his responses, as \n     described to me by Kevin Landy on the 13th, were not \n     accurate. He said his answers were accurate, mine were not, \n     and this inconsistency would only make me and the OIG ``look \n     bad.'' I told Wallace that no one had ``directed'' Garcia or \n     anyone else as to what to say and I was not going to state \n     otherwise. He said we had directed Garcia in the form of Mr. \n     Reback's email to Lucy Clark and I disputed that claim. He \n     became quite angry and demanded that we make our responses \n     consistent with his. I told him that he would not be in this \n     situation if he had cleared his answers with the OIG prior to \n     submission. I further said it is not a good idea to speak for \n     the OIG; that is our job. He insisted that ``direct'' is the \n     same thing as ``ask'' if it comes from the OIG and I told him \n     that was not correct and that it was not his right to \n     interpret what he thought the OIG meant. Further, I told \n     Wallace that Mr. Reback's email was clear as to the position \n     of the OIG. The conversation ended as abruptly as it had \n     begun.\n       (f) Did the individual show you or describe to you my \n     questions to Mr. Garcia or the answers he had given or \n     proposed to give? If so, what did he say about them?\n       Response: Mr. Wallace did not share any prior responses \n     with me. I saw responses for the first time on the morning of \n     June 17th, which were not correct and were not ultimately \n     submitted to the committee. Those responses were to questions \n     Wallace said he received from you sometime between the 13th \n     and the 16th. He did orally confirm during our conversation \n     of the 16th that he was being questioned by you, in writing, \n     as to responses he submitted on Mr. Garcia's behalf on the \n     13th, because I told him I understood that he had submitted \n     questions that we had not seen.\n       (g) Did you tell the individual with whom you spoke that \n     the IG's office had not ``directed'' Mr. Garcia not to \n     respond to questions about the Texas matter?\n       Response: Yes, I was very adamant on that point and that \n     was why he called me on June 16th. He said we needed to be \n     consistent with responses he had already submitted and that \n     we had ``directed'' Mr. Garcia not to answer questions. I \n     told Wallace that was flat-out incorrect and no one in the \n     OIG had had any communication with Mr. Garcia, let alone \n     ``directed'' him on any matter, nor did we know until the \n     13th (from Kevin Landy to me) that any questions had been \n     submitted in the first place.\n       (h) What did you tell the individual with whom you spoke \n     about whether the IG's office had authority to give such a \n     direction?\n       Response: I told Wallace that he well knew from his time in \n     the OIG community (he previously worked at FEMA) that an OIG \n     cannot direct anyone (other than OIG employees) to do \n     anything.\n       (i) What did that individual ask you to do or say?\n       Response: Wallace demanded that we assist him in drafting \n     responses to new questions he had received because it was our \n     fault he had gotten the questions. He said it was the OIG's \n     fault that Mr. Garcia was now in this situation because we \n     were not consistent in our responses.\n       (j) What did you say in response?\n       Response: I told Wallace that if we had seen his draft \n     responses before he sent them then we could have prevented \n     him from using such a poor choice of language. Prior \n     coordination would have resulted in consistent responses.\n       (11) Please provide any additional information you believe \n     might be helpful to clarify the Committee's record on this \n     matter.\n       Response: Mr. Wallace left DHS employ on June 18th. He \n     advised Mr. Reback that he had accepted a position as Deputy \n     Campaign Manager for the President's re-election campaign.\n           Sincerely,\n     Elizabeth M. Redman,\n       Assistant Inspector General for Investigations, Office of \n     Inspector General, Department of Homeland Security.\n                                  ____\n\n         Department of Homeland Security, Bureau of Immigration \n           and Customs Enforcement,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 30, 2003.\n     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lieberman: This letter is in response to your \n     letter of July 8, 2003, requesting further clarification \n     regarding information previously provided in response to \n     questions for the record involving the Air and Marine \n     Interdiction Coordination Center.\n       Please find enclosed responses to each of your questions. \n     Thank you for the opportunity to address your further \n     questions regarding this matter. I would be happy to discuss \n     this matter with you further if you feel such a meeting would \n     be helpful.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Michael J. Garcia,\n                                       Acting Assistant Secretary.\n       Enclosure.\n\n       (1) On May 30, 2003, when you first responded to my \n     questions that because BICE had referred the underlying \n     issues to the Office of the Inspector General, ``it would be \n     inappropriate to offer comment on the questions above,'' did \n     you believe you had been ``directed'' by the IG's office not \n     to answer the questions? If so, what was the basis for that \n     belief? Who told you about such direction and when?\n       Response: I think it would be helpful in clarifying the \n     record to set forth the responses made to your inquiries \n     regarding the Air and Marine Interdiction Coordination Center \n     (``AMICC'') and in doing this to detail the substance and \n     chronology of those answers and the basis for the position \n     taken.\n       On May 30, 2003, I responded to the first set of questions \n     regarding events at AMICC by stating that the matter had been \n     referred to the Inspector General and that ``[t]herefore it \n     would be inappropriate to offer comment on the questions \n     above.'' At this time I based my statement on the fact that \n     this was a potential criminal investigation and on my \n     experience as a Federal prosecutor. In sum, I was motivated \n     by the belief that it would be inappropriate to offer my \n     comments on this ongoing IG matter. I was also aware that \n     before the House Select Homeland Security Committee on May \n     20, 2003, Secretary Ridge had stated, ``we thought it was \n     very appropriate, based on the multiple inquiries that we \n     received from members of Congress, including yours, that we \n     deploy the means with which Congress has given us. And that's \n     an inspector general within our department.'' He went on to \n     say ``. . . it's not appropriate to be passing that \n     information out right now'' when referring to a request to \n     release the audiotapes. My responses were reviewed by the \n     Department of Homeland Security prior to being sent to the \n     Committee. On June 2, 2003, I was interviewed by staff \n     members for the Committee. At that time, Minority Counsel \n     asked me about my May 30 answers to the AMICC questions, \n     specifically my basis for declining to answer with specifics. \n     I explained that I based this response on my experience as a \n     prosecutor and my concern about commenting on an ongoing, \n     potentially criminal, investigation. Minority Counsel \n     disagreed with this analogy--my experience as a Federal \n     prosecutor--and stated that the law regarding inquiries by \n     Congress made such comment possible. I replied that I was not \n     aware of that legal authority.\n       As a result of the statements by Minority Counsel and the \n     continuing interest in this area of inquiry by the Committee \n     as manifested by his questions, I asked my Principal Legal \n     Advisor to get clarification. I understood that he worked \n     through Lucy Clark, Chief Legal Counselor to DHS. I used this \n     avenue of communication with the IG--through counsel--given \n     that the most appropriate medium for communicating with an \n     agency conducting an ongoing criminal investigation into \n     activities by a component of my agency is through legal \n     counsel.\n       A subsequent e-mail (previously provided to the Committee) \n     authorized by the Office of Inspector General stated: \n     ``Attached is the language Mr. Garcia can use if questioned \n     on the Texas State legislators issue.'' The attachment \n     read: ``My office referred this matter to the Department's \n     Office of Inspector General (OIG) on the evening of May \n     15, 2003. The OIG has asked that any questions relating to \n     this matter be directed to them.'' I received a copy of \n     this e-mail prior to my confirmation hearing on June 5, \n     2003. It is my understanding that the OIG counsel who \n     provided this e-mail knew that this guidance was being \n     sought in the context of my confirmation hearing. I also \n     received confirmation from Lucy Clark that it would be \n     inappropriate to make any comments and I should refer any \n     questions on this matter during the confirmation process \n     to the OIG. (See Letter from Lucy Clark to Senator Joseph \n     Lieberman, dated June 16, 2003). The\n\n[[Page S16076]]\n\n     AMICC matter was not raised at the June 5, 2003 hearing.\n       On June 13, I submitted responses to your post-hearing \n     questions. At that time, in response to the question \n     regarding why I believed it inappropriate to comment, I \n     responded, ``I received direction from the Inspector \n     General's (IG's) Office to refer all inquiries regarding this \n     matter to that office.'' In response to the next question, \n     ``Did the Office of the Inspector General ask you not to \n     comment?'' I responded, ``As noted above, the IG's office \n     directed that it would not be appropriate to comment on this \n     issue and that all inquiries be directed to that office.'' I \n     based these answers on the e-mail from the IG counsel \n     referenced above which stated that the OIG ``has asked that \n     any question relating to this matter be directed to them'' as \n     well as the guidance from Lucy Clark, who I knew to be in \n     contact with the IG's office, that it would be inappropriate \n     to make any comments on this matter during the confirmation \n     process other than to refer such questions to the OIG. These \n     answers were again cleared at the Department level.\n       Later that evening of June 13, 2003, I received additional \n     questions on this issue. Those questions referenced a \n     conversation between your staff and the OIG to the effect \n     that referring questions to the OIG regarding an OIG criminal \n     investigation was not consistent with the policy of the OIG \n     and that the Assistant IG conducting the investigation had \n     stated that no one at the IG's office had ever had any \n     communications with me. You then posed several questions \n     related to this ``contradiction.''\n       I responded to the first question related to any \n     communications with the IG's office by providing the e-mail \n     discussed above and outlined the method of communication I \n     used to obtain that guidance, namely through my Principal \n     Legal Advisor and the DHS Chief Legal Counselor. While I \n     never had any direct communication with the OIG on this \n     matter, the communication from the OIG's Chief Counsel \n     clearly was intended as guidance for ``Mr. Garcia'' in the \n     confirmation process. I also noted that my answers were \n     cleared through the Chief Legal Counselor for DHS based upon \n     her understanding of her direct communications with the OIG.\n       This round of questions raised for the first time an issue \n     with respect to the clear guidance offered by that OIG e-mail \n     and the Chief Legal Counselor. Let me state that I believe \n     that this guidance was the topic of much discussion, at \n     the time, in order to attempt to ensure a coordinated \n     approach to Congress. I understood that my Principal Legal \n     Advisor, as well as Tim Haugh of my Congressional Affairs \n     Office, discussed the issue of referring to the OIG \n     questions regarding the investigation with the OIG Chief \n     Counsel in order to clarify the position and to insure \n     that the responses were accurate. At this time, I also \n     answered the substantive questions about the AMICC matter. \n     My understanding is that both the OIG's Chief Counsel and \n     the Assistant IG assigned to investigate this matter agree \n     that the June 16 responses are accurate with respect to \n     communications with that office.\n       (2) According to Richard Reback, Counselor to the Acting \n     Inspector General, Lucy Clark, the DHS Chief Legal Counselor, \n     first called him on the afternoon of June 2, 2003, and spoke \n     with him a final time on June 4, 2003. On June 4, Mr. Reback \n     sent Lucy Clark the e-mail which you provided to the \n     Committee on June 16.\n       (a) Were you aware of these conversations between Lucy \n     Clark and Richard Reback? If so, when did you learn of the \n     conversations, from whom, and what were you told about the \n     conversations?\n       (b) Did you ever see the text of the e-mail that Mr. Reback \n     sent on June 4? If so, when did you first see it, who showed \n     it to you, and how did you interpret the guidance it \n     contained?\n       Response: I was aware that Lucy Clark was in contact with \n     Richard Reback prior to my June 5 confirmation hearing. Prior \n     to my June 5 confirmation, I received a copy of this e-mail, \n     I believe through my Principal Legal Advisor. On advice of \n     DHS counsel, I interpreted this e-mail and the guidance that \n     it would be inappropriate to answer any questions other than \n     to refer the questioner to the OIG as directed in the e-mail.\n       (3) On what did you base your statement that you had been \n     directed not to answer the questions?\n       Response: I based my answer on the e-mail from the OIG \n     counsel stating that I should respond to questions by stating \n     ``The OIG has asked that any questions relating to this \n     matter be directed to them,'' and on advice of the Chief \n     Legal Counselor that ``in the context of his confirmation \n     hearing, the OIG responded [in response to a request from the \n     Office of General Counsel] that Mr. Garcia should refer all \n     questions related to this matter to the OIG.'' Moreover, I \n     was advised ``it would be inappropriate for him to make any \n     comments on this matter during the confirmation process other \n     than to refer such questions to the OIG.'' (See, Letter of \n     Lucy Clark, Chief Legal Counsel to DHS, to Senator Joseph \n     Lieberman, dated June 16, 2003.)\n       (4) Lisa Redman says she told Mark Wallace on the morning \n     of June 16 that he had misrepresented the position of the \n     Office of the Inspector General in preparing your earlier \n     answers. She refused his request to change her responses to \n     make them consistent with your answers. The answers you \n     submitted later that night did not reflect this conversation, \n     but instead held to the answers the IG's office had rejected. \n     The questions I sent you on June 13 specifically noted that \n     the IG's office had denied having the communications you \n     earlier described.\n       (a) Were you ever aware of the conversation between Mark \n     Wallace and Lisa Redman? If so, when did you learn of the \n     conversation, from whom, and what were you told about the \n     conversation?\n       Response: At some point on June 16, I became aware that the \n     ICE Principal Legal Advisor was engaged in conversation with \n     the Office of Inspector General and was in contact with the \n     Department's Chief Legal Counselor. I was not aware of the \n     substance of the particular conversation referenced in your \n     July 8 questions. I was aware of the conflicting \n     interpretations of the OIG policy as outlined in your June 13 \n     letter. As I understood it, the point of the conversations \n     between the Department's Chief Legal Counselor, my Principal \n     Legal Advisor, and the Office of Inspector General were aimed \n     at clarifying the OIG position regarding questions related to \n     the Texas matter and to ensure that the answers submitted on \n     June 16 were accurate. I understand that the OIG agrees that \n     the June 16 answers are accurate.\n       (b) Why did you claim in your answers of June 16 that Mr. \n     Reback's e-mail was the basis for your understanding that you \n     had been ``directed'' not to answer questions on the Texas \n     matter, despite Lisa Redman's disavowal of that claim?\n       Response: Mr. Reback's earlier e-mail (stating that I could \n     use the following questions if asked about the State \n     legislator issue: ``The Office of Inspector General (OIG) has \n     asked that any questions relating to this matter be directed \n     to them.'') was the primary basis for my earlier answers, in \n     addition to the guidance of the Department's Chief Legal \n     Counselor. At the time I answered the June 13 questions, I \n     had no indication that Ms. Redmon or anyone else at the OIG \n     interpreted that guidance in any other way nor, given the \n     plain language of that text, did I have any reason to do so. \n     The June 16 questions were directed to the basis for my June \n     13 answers. I understand that Ms. Redmon of the OIG did not \n     express her view regarding OIG policy until June 16--not June \n     13 as she had erroneously claimed previously.\n       (c) Why did your answers of June 16 refer to the e-mail \n     Lucy Clark received from Richard Reback, but fail to mention \n     the conversation Mark Wallace had with Lisa Redman?\n       Response: The e-mail from Reback appeared to state plainly \n     the OIG position (``The Office of Inspector General (OIG) has \n     asked that any questions relating to this matter be directed \n     to them.''). At no time prior to June 16 did I have any \n     indication that Ms. Redmon interpreted that guidance to mean \n     I was free to answer questions based upon my personal \n     knowledge or what others had said to me. Nor was such leeway \n     in any way apparent from the text of the e-mail. My June 16 \n     answers were in response to questions aimed at tracking the \n     basis for my June 13 responses (and as stated the basis for \n     those was the Reback e-mail and guidance from Lucy Clark).\n       Please indicate whether you are aware of any other person \n     employed by the IG's office discussing this matter with you \n     or with DHS personnel acting on your behalf. If you are aware \n     of any such discussions, please indicate who had the \n     discussion, who initiated it, when it occurred, and, to the \n     extent you know, the contents of the discussion.\n       Response: No, only Lisa Redman and Richard Reback.\n       (6) What role did Mark Wallace play in drafting each set of \n     your written answers? Who else contributed to the drafting of \n     the answers relating to this matter? What efforts did you \n     make to independently confirm the accuracy of the answers you \n     provided on May 30, June 13, and June 16 with respect to the \n     Texas matter?\n       Response: as stated, following standard procedure, the \n     written answers like all testimony were cleared through the \n     following DHS offices: Legislative Affairs, Office of General \n     Counsel, and Office of the Secretary. Additionally, ICE \n     Legislative Affairs (Tim Haugh, Acting Director, and ICE \n     Legal (Mark Wallace, Principal Legal Advisor) reviewed the \n     draft answers. In answering the questions related to the \n     Texas matter, I relied upon the advice of legal counsel, the \n     OIG e-mail, and the fact that the answers were ``cleared'' \n     through DHS.\n       (7) With respect to each of the answers you provided on May \n     30, June 13, and June 16 relating to the Texas matter, do you \n     now believe the answers you submitted were accurate? Please \n     explain the basis for your conclusions.\n       Response: Yes--for the reasons explained above.\n       Based on what you now know, do you still believe that ``the \n     IG's office directed that it would not be appropriate to \n     comment on this issue''? If so, how do you explain the \n     statements to the contrary by officials from the Office of \n     the Inspector General? Please explain the basis for your \n     conclusion.\n       Response: The Office of Inspector General stated in an e-\n     mail in response to a request for guidance as follows: \n     ``Attached is the language Mr. Garcia can use if questioned \n     on the Texas State legislators issue.'' The attachment read: \n     ``My office referred this matter to the department's Office \n     of inspector General (OIG) on the evening of May 15, 2003. \n     The OIG has asked that any questions relating to this \n     matter be directed to them.'' I believe that I took the \n     appropriate step by having counsel seek guidance from the \n     AMICC\n\n[[Page S16077]]\n\n     regarding the appropriate answer to questions related to \n     an investigation the OIG was conducting. Given that the \n     OIG guidance at the time `'asked'' for question to be \n     ``directed to them'' and an OIG only subsequently \n     suggested different guidance, I believe that directing \n     questions to the OIG was appropriate at the time. I also \n     believe that better communication between OIG and ICE, \n     especially when presented with an inquiry from Congress, \n     is critical and I am committed to facilitating such \n     communication in the future.\n       (9) Both the IG's Counsel and the Assistant IG for \n     Investigations have stated that they don't have the authority \n     to direct a Department employee not to answer Congressional \n     inquiries. Do you still believe that an IG's office has the \n     authority to direct you not to provide information to \n     Congress? If so, what is the legal basis for that claim?\n       Response: I will be guided by the OIG's interpretation \n     regarding its authority and will ensure proper coordination \n     with that office.\n       (10) As you may know, Congress has frequently conducted \n     inquiries into agency matters in which there were also IG \n     investigations. Do you nevertheless believe that the pendency \n     of an IG investigation precludes you or other agency \n     officials from responding to Congressional information \n     requests? If so, what is the legal basis for that claim?\n       Response: I would be guided by the OIG with respect to \n     commenting on such matters. Again, I believe better internal \n     coordination on this issue would avoid any conflict in \n     providing responsive answers to Congress.\n       (11) Please provide any additional information you believe \n     might be helpful to clarify the Committee's record on this \n     matter.\n       Response: I would add that at all times in responding to \n     your questions I was guided by a sincere desire not to in any \n     way interfere with an ongoing criminal investigation, one of \n     high sensitivity and one which I had referred to the IG. At \n     no time did I intend to evade answers or to in any way \n     challenge the authority of Congress to inquire into such \n     matters. I responded based upon what I reasonably believed \n     was the guidance from the OIG and counsel. I would be happy \n     to discuss this matter with you further if you feel that such \n     a meeting would be helpful.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as the 108th Congress draws to a close, I \nwould like to take a few moments to reflect on the tremendous progress \nthis Senate has made in moving America forward. Leading the Senate is \nan honor and a pleasure, made all the more so by working with such \ntalented people. I thank my fellow Senators for their dedication. It \nhas been an exceptional legislative year.\n  Back in January, we set an ambitious agenda. We resolved to put the \neconomy back on track; lend critical support to the war on terror; and \npromote public health here at home and abroad. Our mission was to \nexpand freedom and opportunity, and strengthen America's security.\n  In 11 short months we have made major strides towards those goals. \nAnd we did so by respecting the longstanding Senate values of civility \nand trust, by building strong and reliable relationships, and by \ncommitting ourselves to action. Each of us can go home this holiday \nseason proud of our accomplishments.\n  We first set to work passing spending bills left undone by the \nprevious Congress. We passed 11 of those bills in just 3 weeks.\n  We also passed a budget to establish a blueprint for creating jobs, \ninvesting in homeland security and education, providing Medicare \nprescription drug coverage and offering health insurance for our most \nvulnerable citizens, America's children.\n  With that unfinished business of the last Congress complete, we \nturned our attention to the President's jobs and growth agenda.\n  Under the President's leadership, we passed $350 billion in tax \nrelief, the third largest tax cut in history. We cut taxes, across the \nboard, for 136 million hard-working, tax-paying Americans.\n  For America's families, we increased the child tax credit from $600 \nper child to $1000 per child, and made sure that money was sent out \nright away. As a result, this summer, 25 million families received \nchecks from the United States Treasury of up to $400 per child. In \ntotal, we returned $13.7 billion to families across the country.\n  But that was just the start.\n  Under the Jobs and Growth Act of 2003, a family of four making \n$40,000 will see their taxes reduced by $1,133 this year.\n  Of the $350 billion in tax cuts and fiscal relief, nearly $200 \nbillion, fully 60 percent, is provided this year and next.\n  Some critics of the tax cut say $1,300 is not a lot of money, that it \nwould not make much difference if the bureaucrats took it away again. \nTell that to the family working hard to raise their children, keep up \nwith household expenses, and have a something left over for a family \nvacation. I am fairly certain the United States Treasury did not get a \nflurry of child tax credit checks in the mail from families who said \nthey didn't need it.\n  Small business owners, too, got a major boost from the tax package. \nTwenty-three million small business owners who pay taxes at the \nindividual rate saw their taxes lowered. And we quadrupled the expense \ndeduction for small business investment.\n  Small business owners are the heart of the American marketplace. \nWorkers and consumers depend on the small business sector to generate \njobs, products, and services. These innovators create 60 to 80 percent \nof new jobs nationwide, and they generate more than 50 percent of the \ngross domestic product.\n  By cutting their taxes and encouraging investment, we have helped \nunleash their tremendous economic power.\n  Taken together, this year's tax cut and the tax cuts of 2001 are \nproviding an astonishing $1.7 trillion in tax relief over the next \ndecade. And we are already beginning to see the results. We are now in \nthe midst of a strong economic recovery. Consumers have more money in \ntheir pockets. And businesses are, once again, optimistic about the \ndirection of the economy.\n  Economic growth in the third quarter soared at an incredible 8.2 \npercent annual rate. This is the largest third quarter increase since \n1984.\n  Real disposable income is up 7.2 percent for the third quarter, and \nconsumer spending is up a whopping 6.6 percent, the biggest third \nquarter growth since 1988.\n  Last month, sales of previously owned homes hit their third-highest \nlevel on record. The National Association of Realtors reports that \npreviously owned home sales rose 3.6 percent to a record annual rate of \nnearly 7 million units in September. Meanwhile, housing starts are \nnearing a 17 year high.\n  The association credits this phenomenal growth to ``the powerful \nfundamentals that are driving the housing market, household growth, low \ninterest rates and an improving economy.''\n  This is great news for America's families and for America's \nbusinesses. When a family buys a home, that not only benefits the \ncommunity, it sets off a chain of purchases that fuel the economy: \nliving room furniture, kitchen appliances, washer and dryer, and on and \non. In short, many other industries benefit from the one family's \nmomentous and gratifying decision to buy a home.\n  Not only is individual consumption up, the business sector is showing \nimpressive signs of recovery, as well. Non-residential investment is up \nmore than 10 percent. Business investment went up 11.1 percent in the \nthird quarter, and productivity soared by 8.1 percent, its highest \nlevel in two decades.\n  Businesses are rebuilding their inventories and retooling their \nfactories. And all of this economic activity is ultimately leading to \nmore jobs. Indeed, the labor market appears to be stabilizing and the \neconomy is finally creating much needed jobs.\n  Over the past 3 months, 286,000 new jobs have come on line. In \nOctober alone, 126,000 jobs were added.\n  Meanwhile, since the tax cut, initial claims for unemployment \ninsurance have gone down more than 10 percent. For the seek ending \nNovember 1, unemployment claims hit a 34-month low. There is more \nprogress to be made on this front, but we are on our way towards \nputting Americans back to work.\n  And, finally, there is good news for individual State treasuries. \nTheir budget gap of nearly $20 billion at the beginning of last fiscal \nyear has now declined to a budget gap of less than $3 billion for the \nbeginning of this fiscal year. States are beginning to see ``revenue \nsurprises'' in their estimates.\n  Consumers and businesses, alike, are optimistic about the America's \neconomic direction. Inflation and interest rates are low. American \ntaxpayers have more of their hard earned money to spend and save as \nthey choose.\n  We will continue to champion policies that strengthen the economy and \ncreate jobs. We will continue to pursue fair and free trade policies \nthat increase consumer buying power and stoke the economic furnace.\n\n  This session we passed the free trade agreements with Chile and \nSingapore.\n\n[[Page S16078]]\n\nSimultaneously, export grew 9.3 percent in the third quarter, another \nmarker of our renewed economy.\n  We will continue to fulfill our mission to maximize freedom and \nexpand opportunity.\n  Which leads me to national security. Our mission to expand freedom \nand opportunity applies not just to our economy, but to our national \nsecurity, as well. Freedom cannot find its fullest expression under the \nthreat of terror. But, likewise, terror can not spread where freedom \nreigns.\n  That is why, this year, America took the extraordinary action of \ntoppling Saddam Hussein and his terrorist-sponsoring regime. In 3 short \nweeks, the men and women of the United States military, with the \nsupport of 49 nations, swept to Baghdad, ending three decades of \nruthless Ba'ath Party rule and support for terror.\n  In the months since, our soldiers have worked tirelessly, under \ndangerous conditions, to help the Iraqi people build a democracy.\n  Our soldiers have rebuilt schools, hospitals, electrical grids, \npipelines, and roads. They are training Iraqi police forces to patrol \nthe streets and hunt down terrorists. Everyday, our troops are helping \nthe people of Iraq and Afghanistan move toward becoming free and open \nsocieties.\n  To support their efforts, we passed the President's $87 billion war \nsupplemental. We did so because we recognize that investing in the \nfuture of Iraq and Afghanistan is an investment in our security. \nSeptember 11 taught us a cruel lesson. We learned that we cannot wait \nwhile storms gather. As the President has said, ``the Middle East \nregion will either become a place of progress and peace, or it will \nremain a source of violence and terror.''\n  This Senate took bold action to support the war on terror because we \nare determined that progress and peace take root.\n  The Middle East is not the only region where we are working to bring \nstability. This session, we passed the Burmese Freedom Act and the \nClean Diamond Act.\n  And we also took the historic action of dedicating $15 billion to \ndrive back the HIV/AIDS virus.\n  As a Senator, as a doctor, and as a medical missionary, I am \nespecially gratified by the Senate's demonstration of compassion on \nthis issue. Millions of lives around the world have been cut short by \nthe scourge of one tiny virus. Countries have seen entire swaths of \ntheir populations wiped out and children orphaned, because of the HIV \nvirus that causes AIDS.\n  By passing the Global HIV/AIDS bill, we help to prevent 7 million new \ninfections; provide antiretroviral drugs for 2 million HIV-infected \npeople; care for 10 million HIV-infected individuals and AIDS orphans; \nand bring hope to millions of people around the world who are living in \nthe shadow of this devastating disease.\n  Our work in passing this critical legislation demonstrates that we \nare a country that places a high value on life. History will judge how \nwe chose to respond. We can proudly say that we made the right choice \nand took the necessary actions to put an end to one of the worst \nplagues in recorded history.\n\n  We also made the right choice to end partial birth abortion. Partial \nbirth abortion is a fringe procedure. It is not taught in medical \nschools. And now, it never will be. With an overwhelming majority, we \nvoted to end an immoral procedure, and said ``yes'' to life.\n  Indeed, this Senate can be proud of our efforts to protect the most \nvulnerable among us. In January, we passed legislation to establish a \nnational AMBER Alert. Law enforcement will now have another tool to \nwork with the public to find missing children. In June, we passed \nlegislation to protect victims of child abuse. We also voted to extend \nwelfare reform to help lift families out of poverty.\n  But perhaps the most historic and far reaching legislative \naccomplishment of the 108th Senate happened this morning, when an \noverwhelming, bipartisan majority voted to enact prescription drug \ncoverage for our nation's 40 million seniors and individuals with \ndisabilities.\n  For the first time in its 40-year history, Medicare will offer true, \ncomprehensive health care coverage. This worthy program will finally be \nable to keep pace with modern medicine.\n  I am deeply thankful for the cooperation, hard work and dedication of \nmy colleagues to overcome years of partisan gridlock and finally offer \nAmerica's seniors the security they need and the choices they deserve.\n  Medicare reform, the Jobs and Growth tax cuts, the Iraqi war \nsupplemental, the global HIV bill--we set our sights high and we more \nthan exceeded expectations.\n  We are moving America forward, and we will continue to do so in the \ncoming months. There is much yet to be done.\n  Critically, we must pass the energy bill. We have been debating \nnational energy for three years. During the last Congress, we spent a \ntotal of 7 weeks debating energy on the Senate floor. In this Congress, \nwe spent more time debating energy than any other bill. And yet, \ndespite all of this, a few in the Senate continue to obstruct progress. \nAnd while they insist on more debate, natural gas prices continue to \nrise.\n  U.S. chemical companies are closing plants, laying off workers, and \nlooking to expand production abroad. The U.S. is expected to import \napproximately $9 billion more in chemicals than it exports this year. \nAmerican consumers are getting hit with higher electric bills, and \nsmall businesses are struggling to contain costs. All because of rising \nenergy prices. We must pass the energy plan.\n  Not only will it lower prices, it will save jobs and create thousands \nmore. It is estimated that this energy package will create at least \nhalf of a million jobs. The Alaskan pipeline alone will create at least \n400,000. The hundreds of millions of dollars that will be invested in \nresearch and development of new technologies will not only benefit the \nenvironment, but will create new jobs in engineering, math, chemistry, \nphysics, and science.\n  We cannot allow the obstruction of a few in the Senate continue to \nharm the interests of millions of Americans. And I use the word \n``obstruction,'' because we have seen it used to an alarming degree in \nthis Congress, nowhere more so than in the consideration of the \nPresident's judicial nominees.\n  Only 2 weeks ago, we had an historic, around the clock, 40 hour \ndebate. And after 40 full hours of debate, the minority continued to \nblock an up or down vote. This is partisan obstruction pure and simple. \nA minority of Senators is denying all 100 our Constitutional duty to \nadvise and consent.\n\n  When we return in January, we will continue to press this issue. \nNothing less than the United States Constitution is at stake.\n  We will also continue to press for policies that expand and \nstrengthen our economy. This session, we passed smart, pro-growth \nfiscal policy. We are already beginning to see the results. But there \nis still much to do.\n  Frivolous lawsuits are clogging the State courts, wasting taxpayer \ndollars, and inhibiting the innovation and entrepreneurship so critical \nto creating jobs. When it comes to medical malpractice, frivolous \nlawsuits are destroying access to quality health care and, literally, \nimperiling lives.\n  America is country that values fairness, and we will return fairness \nto the litigation process.\n  We will also work to return fairness to the tax system. We will \ncontinue to press for reforms that simplify the tax code. Tax payers \nshouldn't have to hire a consultant to file a tax return.\n  We will also begin the exciting work of constructing the long awaited \nNational Museum for African American History and Culture. America will \nfinally have a museum worthy of America's sons and daughters who \nsacrificed so much and have given so profoundly.\n  There is much more to do in the year ahead, and I will speak to that \nwhen we resume in January.\n  Each day I walk into this great institution, I am humbled and \ninspired, humbled by the great men and women who have come before, and \ninspired by their example.\n  In his 1862 address to Congress, President Lincoln told the assembled \nlegislators that America is the world's last, best hope. Those words \nhave never been more true than they are today. I am confident that we \nwill face the challenges ahead with honor and courage, for the simple \nreason that we are Americans.\n\n[[Page S16079]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S16068-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16068-S16079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I commend Admiral Loy for his \nwillingness to take on the position of Deputy Secretary of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, one of the most important and also \nmost difficult jobs in the federal government. The fledgling Department \nof Homeland Security is a critical undertaking for our government and \nour country. We know that we face real and ongoing threats to our \ndomestic security from terrorism, and the Department is our best hope \nof bringing the critical focus, resources and leadership to bear on \nthese new and insidious threats. It is a momentous undertaking fraught \nwith challenges, and we must give the Department every support we can \nto achieve its vital task. Unfortunately, in the face of numerous \nexpert reports chronicling the terrorist threat to United States \ncitizens)--and the need for a dramatic infusion of new federal funds--\nPresident Bush has consistently failed to embrace the challenge of \nhomeland security with vision or resources.\n  As Deputy Secretary, Admiral Loy will be second-in-command and have \ninfluence over the full array of DHS policies and practices. As such, I \nhope he will work forcefully to close the existing gaps in our \nsecurity--and in the administration's efforts on homeland security. I \nhave detailed some of my concerns in other floor statements and in \nnumerous letters to Secretary Ridge and other DHS officials. We are, to \nquote a distinguished report sponsored by the Council on Foreign \nRelations, ``drastically underfunded, dangerously unprepared'' with \nrespect to our state and local first responders and the federal \ngovernment's efforts here are falling far short. The administration is \nthwarting a critical congressional mandate to create a true \nintelligence fusion center within DHS. On critical infrastructure \nprotection, our government has yet to complete vital threat and risk \nassessments, much less implement forceful measures to protect these \ncritical assets. I will not repeat all those concerns here, but instead \nfocus on the dangerous gaps I perceive with respect to transportation \nsecurity--the issue that has been Admiral Loy's direct responsibility \nas head of the Transportation Security Administration, TSA, and one \nover which he will continue to exercise considerable influence.\n  TSA was created in the aftermath of 9/11 in response to the tragic \nweaknesses in the air security realm that were exposed by the attacks. \nIndeed, TSA has made important strides to improve certain aspects of \naviation security, such as passenger and baggage screening. But \ncritical deficiencies exist in these and other areas of air security, \nand the agency has barely begun to tackle its broader transportation \nsecurity mandate. Although Admiral Loy will be leaving his post as \nAdministrator of TSA, I believe it is essential that he continue to \nplace a high priority on resolving these critical issues.\n  By law, the Transportation Security Administration is responsible for \nsecurity in all modes of transportation. But TSA has thus far focused \nalmost exclusively on commercial aviation, leaving treacherous \nweaknesses in other transportation systems--a problem I outlined in a \nJuly 9 letter to Secretary Ridge. For fiscal year 2004, the \nadministration sought $4.3 billion for passenger aviation security, but \nonly $86 million for TSA's maritime and land security efforts. \nCongressional appropriators added some additional resources for \nmaritime and land security, but there is still very little money \navailable for these critical needs.\n  For instance, with respect to maritime transportation, the Coast \nGuard has identified billions of dollars worth of necessary \nimprovements--and Congress has mandated greater security--yet the \nadministration requested no money for port security grants to help make \nthe changes and only $125 million for this purpose was ultimately \nincluded in the DHS appropriations bill. Indeed, there is not even \nenough funding for Coast Guard employees to review the security plans \nmandated under the Maritime Transportation Security Act. This even as \nexpert upon expert has identified the Nation's 360 commercial ports as \na leading cause for concern on the homeland front--in large part \nbecause of the valuable goods and energy imports channeled through \nthese ports and because the millions of containers that enter this \ncountry by sea can hide untold dangers.\n  Mass transit systems are another grave source of concern. We all \nremember the 1995 attack on the Tokyo subway, when members of a \nJapanese cult released sarin, a lethal chemical nerve gas, on five \nsubway trains during rush hour. Twelve people were killed and thousands \ninjured. Only mistakes by the terrorists kept the death toll from being \nfar higher. Here in the United States, our transit systems remain \nvulnerable to such an attack. In many cases, transit officials have \nalready identified steps to make the system more secure, but simply \ncannot afford to take them. Transit systems typically struggle just to \nmeet operating costs and are simply not in a position to fund major new \nsecurity investments on their own. A December 2002 GAO report concluded \nthat ``insufficient funding is the most significant\n\n[[Page S16070]]\n\nchallenge in making . . . transit systems as safe and secure as \npossible.'' The administration did recently award some grants to help a \nnumber of urban transit systems, but nowhere near the kind of \ncommitment that is needed to confront the problem.\n  Nor do we see a commitment to improve rail security, although vast \nquantities of hazardous materials are shipped by rail.\n  Given this vast amount of work to be done by TSA in all modes of \ntransportation, it is inexplicable to me why the administration \nactually sought to decrease the agency's budget in FY 04.\n  But it is not simply a matter of money. TSA has not formulated the \nessential strategic plans needed to guide transportation security \nefforts. Admiral Loy testified last May that the agency was close to \nfinishing such a document--the National Transportation System Security \nPlan or NTSSP. GAO has testified that this national plan is a \n``prerequisite'' to investing wisely in transportation security. Yet as \npart of the hearing process for this nomination, Admiral Loy stated \nthat such a plan is still months away, at best.\n  Even in the area of passenger aviation, where TSA has focused \nvirtually all its resources, troubling gaps remain. Although TSA spent \nhundreds of millions to recruit and train screeners, thousands of these \nemployees are gone due to layoffs and attrition and we now face serious \nscreener shortages at some airports. While I recognize that this is a \ncomplex question, it simply is not clear that TSA has control of this \nissue and is implementing a staffing level needed to assure adequate \nsecurity. There have been other problems. For example, TSA failed to \ncomplete background checks of many of the screeners hired before they \nwere trained and deployed, resulting in the discovery last spring that \nover 1200 screeners had felony convictions or other disqualifying \nproblems that required their termination. Investigations by the DHS \nInspector General and TSA's Office of Internal Affairs into the baggage \nscreener training program found that trainees were given the questions \nand answers to the final certification exam and that some of the test \nquestions were ``inane'' or simply ``gave away'' the correct response. \nGAO has reported that TSA has not yet fully developed or deployed \nrecurrent or supervisory training programs to ensure that screeners are \neffectively trained and supervised.\n  Moreover, despite considerable attention to the safety of air \npassengers and their baggage, TSA has not developed a reliable system \nto screen commercial cargo loaded onto the very same planes. This cargo \nis still not being screened for explosives and TSA currently is relying \non the airlines to implement a ``known shipper'' program as the primary \nmethod of ensuring the security of this cargo, despite the numerous \nvulnerabilities GAO and the Department of Transportation Inspector \nGeneral have identified in this approach. TSA has still taken only \npreliminary steps toward assessing security technologies that are \nneeded to restrict access to secure areas of airports, despite the \nrequirements of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act that it do \nso. Airport perimeter security also requires significant improvement, \naccording to GAO, including the need to guard against possible \nterrorist attacks using shoulder-fired portable missiles from locations \nnear airports. In addition, GAO has raised substantial concerns about \nthe limited progress TSA has made in shoring up security at general \naviation airports. To date, general aviation pilots and passengers are \nnot screened before takeoff and the contents of general aviation planes \nare not screened at any point, leaving general aviation far more open \nand potentially vulnerable than commercial passenger aviation.\n  I understand that the administration's failure to seek adequate \nfunding and TSA's deadlines have greatly contributed to the challenges \nTSA faces in remedying these and other gaps in our aviation security. I \npledge to continue my efforts to increase the resources we devote to \nthese needs. However, TSA has also exercised inadequate oversight of \nthe contracts it has entered into to perform many of the essential \ntasks needed to improve aviation security. The resulting problems \ninclude the huge cost overrun of its screener hiring contract with NCS \nPearson, which ballooned from an original estimate of $104 million to \nover $700 million. I intend to watch closely to make sure that TSA \nimplements stringent management controls and procedures so that we can \nbe assured TSA's programs are effective, appropriately focused and \nachieving expected results.\n\n                      NOMINATION OF MICHAEL GARCIA\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, although I do not intend to object to \nthe confirmation of Michael Garcia to be Assistant Secretary of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, Bureau of Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement, BICE, I do want to take this opportunity to express my \nconcern about his handling of an issue that arose during the Committee \non Governmental Affairs' consideration of his nomination. Specifically, \nI would like to describe my concerns about the way Mr. Garcia responded \nto questions from the committee related to his bureau's participation \nin a search for a plane belonging to a Texas state legislator. My \nconcerns about the nominees's answers occurred in the context of \nproblems we have been having getting clear and comprehensive answers \nfrom some other nominees for department positions, and from receiving \nsatisfactory answers to inquiries related to our oversight \nresponsibilities. I hope that by calling attention to these concerns, I \ncan encourage the Department of Homeland Security, DHS to work with its \noversight committees in a more straightforward and cooperative fashion.\n  In this statement, I intend to describe in some detail the \ncircumstances that I find troubling. To summarize, I have two main \nconcerns. First, it took Mr. Garcia far too long--until well after the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee reported his nomination--to acknowledge \nwhat until then had been a rather uncontroversial fact: that the \npendency of an investigation by an agency's Inspector General does not \npreclude an official of that agency from responding to congressional \nrequests for information about matters that are the subject of the IG's \ninvestigation. A significant part of Congress' work involves overseeing \nhow agencies do their jobs, and this committee in particular often \nconducts investigations of alleged waste, fraud and abuse by agencies. \nIf the pendency of an internal investigation stood as a per se bar to \ncongressional information requests, our oversight work would often be \nstymied. Mr. Garcia's assertion of virtual immunity from being \nquestioned about matters under internal investigation is unfortunately \nemblematic of this administration's and this Department's frequent \nstinginess with sharing information with Congress about matters that \nare appropriate topics of congressional oversight. That this refusal to \nprovide information occurred in the context of a committee's \nconsideration of a nomination was all the more troubling, because it \nsuggested that even at the moment when the incentive for cooperation \nwas the greatest, the department was urging its officials to resist \nappropriate requests for information. The department and Mr. Garcia now \nconcede that a pending IG investigation is not grounds for refusing to \nprovide Congress with information; as they acknowledge, Congress \nfrequently inquires into--and receives information about--matters under \ninvestigation. Although it came frustratingly late, I appreciate their \nwillingness to revisit their position and look forward to greater \ncooperation from them on such matters in the future.\n  Second, I was concerned that Mr. Garcia's answers to written \nquestions were misleading, whether or not he intended them to be, and I \nam even more disturbed that after I challenged Mr. Garcia's responses, \nhe and his advisers passed up a number of opportunities to clarify his \nresponses. I will describe the back and forth in greater detail below, \nbut in short, Mr. Garcia stated in written answers to the committee \nthat he declined to answer questions about the search for the Texas \nlegislator because the IG's office had directed him not to, even though \nneither he nor his advisers had even contacted the IG's office about my \nquestions until he had twice declined to answer them. Mr. Garcia \ncontinued to maintain that the IG's office directed him not to answer \nmy questions, even after I reported to him that the IG's office did not \nbelieve it\n\n[[Page S16071]]\n\nhad issued such a direction and even after one of his advisers was \nexplicitly told by the Assistant Inspector General heading the Texas \ninvestigation that such an answer was inaccurate. After the committee \nreported his nomination, Mr. Garcia ultimately expressed his regret for \nthese events, explaining that he did not intend to mislead the \ncommittee, which is why I will not stand in the way of his nomination. \nBut I once again am forced to observe that this exchange was nowhere \nnear the frank and honest effort at providing requested information \nthat Congress has a right to expect from agency officials. It instead \nappears to have been an effort at finding any excuse for declining to \nanswer questions and then, when it became apparent that the excuse \ncould not stand, seeking to find any way possible to avoid correcting \nthe mistaken assertion. As mentioned, Mr. Garcia has subsequently \nexpressed his regret for how he answered these questions, and has \npledged to better cooperate with the Committee in the future. I am \nhopeful that both he and the department will live up to that pledge.\n  To provide more detail: when the Committee on Governmental Affairs \nreceived the nomination of Michael Garcia on March 26, 2003, he was \nalready serving as Acting Assistant Secretary for BICE. He was leading \nthe Bureau when, on May 12, 2003, it assisted in a search for the plane \nbelonging to a member of the Texas legislature; the search had been \ninitiated by leaders from the opposing party, as part of a highly \npolitical and partisan intrastate redistricting feud. At the time of \nthese events it struck me as inappropriate that homeland security \nresources were diverted for this purpose, especially as it set a \ndisturbing precedent of misusing the department's powers and authority \nto pursue American citizens who had broken no laws. So, as part of the \ncommittee's consideration of Mr. Garcia's nomination, I submitted a \nseries of written questions about the incident, in my capacity as \nranking member of the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n  Over the course of several weeks, Mr. Garcia provided answers that \nwere unresponsive, unsatisfactory, and inconsistent. Mr. Garcia's legal \nadvisers at the Department of Homeland Security appear to have \ncompounded the problem by looking for ways to avoid the questions \nrather than clear up misunderstandings that became increasingly \napparent.\n  In written questions sent on May 16, 2003, before Mr. Garcia's \ncommittee hearing, I asked the following questions:\n\n       On May 15, 2003, the Bureau acknowledged that its Air and \n     Marine Interdiction Coordination Center, AMICC, had earlier \n     that week participated in the search for the airplane of a \n     Texas legislator.\n       1. What action was requested of the AMICC, and by whom?\n       2. What action, if any, was actually taken by the AMICC? \n     Which federal officials were involved in directing that \n     action be taken?\n       3. What other federal agencies were involved, if any, and \n     what actions did they take?\n       4. If any action was taken by the Homeland Security \n     Department, please explain how these actions fall within the \n     Department's mission?\n       5. If actions were taken in error, or in contravention of \n     Department policy, what steps will be taken to ensure that \n     similar mistakes will not happen again?''\n\n  On May 30, 2003, Mr. Garcia responded that because BICE had referred \nthe underlying issues to the Office of the Inspector General, OIG, ``it \nwould be inappropriate to offer comment on the questions above.'' He \nattached to his answer a press release BICE had earlier issued, \noffering comment on the matter, including conclusions that BICE had \nacted appropriately in the incident. Concerned by the suggestion that \nthe existence of an IG investigation serves as an absolute bar to an \nExecutive Branch official providing any information to Congress, my \nstaff on June 2, 2003, again asked Mr. Garcia about the issue at the \nbipartisan interview Committee staff routinely conduct in the course of \nconsidering nominations. Mr. Garcia again declined to answer the \nquestions. At the staff interview Mr. Garcia was informed that Congress \nroutinely seeks information and testimony about matters under criminal \ninvestigation, and is routinely provided the information.\n  Apparently in response to the concerns raised at the staff interview, \non June 2 the Chief Legal Counselor to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, Lucy Clark, contacted the Counsel to the department's Acting \nInspector General, Richard Reback. According to Mr. Reback, Ms. Clark \ntold him that Mr. Garcia would be appearing for his confirmation \nhearing and asked how he should respond if questioned about the Texas \nmatter. At Ms. Clark's request, on June 4, Mr. Reback sent by e-mail a \nhypothetical question and proposed answer, in which Reback suggested \nthat Mr. Garcia, if asked ``what actions are you taking on the issue of \ndiversion of Department of Homeland Security resources to search for \nTexas State legislators?'', could respond, ``The OIG has asked that any \nquestions relating to this matter be directed to them.'' Mr. Reback \nlater made clear in a letter to me that he was not aware at the time \n``that specific questions were pending or had been posed.'' Ms. Clark \ndid not tell Mr. Reback that Mr. Garcia had already declined to answer \nquestions on two occasions, or that he had been informed by Committee \nstaff that his answer was unsatisfactory. Mr. Reback later explained \nthat he was not directing Mr. Garcia not to answer inquiries from \nCongress. Rather, it was his hope that a referral to his Office could \nbe the beginning of a dialogue with Congress, not the end of the \ndialogue.\n  After Mr. Garcia's nomination hearing, on June 5, 2003, I remained \nconcerned by the suggestion that an IG investigation could immunize \nExecutive Branch officials from Congressional information requests. I \ntherefore submitted post-hearing questions, which included the \nfollowing inquiries about why Mr. Garcia believed he could decline to \nanswer my questions on the Texas matter:\n\n       a. Why do you believe it would be inappropriate to comment?\n       b. Did the Office of Inspector General ask you not to \n     comment?\n       c. Will you refuse to provide Congress with information on \n     any matter being investigated by an inspector general? If \n     your willingness to provide information to Congress would \n     depend on the circumstances, please specify in what \n     circumstances you would refuse to provide information.\n       d. As Acting Assistant Secretary for BICE at the time the \n     incident occurred, do you have any knowledge of the \n     circumstances of your bureau's involvement, either direct or \n     second-hand? Did you take any steps to learn about the \n     bureau's role? Were you involved in deciding how the Bureau \n     should respond to the incident, and to the news reports that \n     described the incident?''\n\n  On Friday, June 13, 2003, Mr. Garcia sent his responses to the post-\nhearing questions. Mr. Garcia stated that he had ``received direction \nfrom the Inspector General's Office to refer all inquiries regarding \nthis matter to that office.'' He also stated that ``the IG's office \ndirected that it would not be appropriate to comment on this issue and \nthat all inquiries be directed to that office,'' and ``in this case I \nwas directed to refer all inquiries to the Inspector General's \nOffice.'' Mr. Garcia's answers did not specify who had directed him not \nto answer, nor did they describe the nature of the communications with \nthe IG's office. In response to the question about whether he would \nrefuse to provide Congress with information on any matter being \ninvestigated by an inspector general, Mr. Garcia responded \n``(g)enerally, I would defer to the IG's office for direction on \ninquiries relating to any matter actively being investigated by that \noffice.'' He declined to answer whether he had any knowledge of the \ncircumstances of his Bureau's involvement in the incident, and what \nactions he took in its aftermath.\n\n  Aware of no law, custom or precedent that would allow an IG to direct \nan Executive Branch official to decline to answer Congressional \ninformation requests, I had my staff contact the Department of DHS \nOffice of Inspector General to learn more about the IG's views of this \nissue. On the afternoon of June 13, Lisa Redman, the assistant \nInspector General responsible for the investigation into the Texas \nincident, denied to my staff that anyone from the IG's office had \ndirected Mr. Garcia not to comment on the issue. She also informed \nCommittee staff that the IG's office had no policy that would have \nprecluded him from answering questions about his role in the incident, \nor from giving answers based on information provided by personnel at \nBICE.\n  Concerned by this discrepancy, on the evening of June 13, I sent Mr. \nGarcia another set of post-hearing questions, seeking clarification \nregarding\n\n[[Page S16072]]\n\nthe apparently contradictory information received from the IG's office. \nMy questions also informed Mr. Garcia that both the Congressional \nResearch Service and the Senate Legal Counsel had confirmed that an \nongoing IG's investigation did not provide a legal basis for someone to \nrefuse to provide information to Congress.\n  As we later learned from Ms. Redman in a letter responding to my \ninquiries, on the morning of June 16, while Mr. Garcia and his staff \nwere preparing answers to my questions, Ms. Redman received a telephone \ncall from Mark Wallace, who was then Mr. Garcia's principal legal \nadviser at BICE. According to Ms. Redman, Mr. Wallace ``was very \nagitated and stated that the OIG had provided answers [to the \nCommittee] inconsistent to those he provided on Mr. Garcia's behalf.'' \nMs. Redman informed Mr. Wallace that no one from the IG's office had \n``directed'' Mr. Garcia not to answer questions from Congress, that the \nIG's office had never been told about Mr. Garcia's written responses to \nmy questions, and that Mr. Wallace should have cleared Mr. Garcia's \nanswers with the IG's office before submitting them. She also pointed \nout that the IG's office cannot direct Mr. Garcia to do anything. \nAccording to Ms. Redman, Mr. Wallace ``became quite angry and demanded \nthat we make our responses consistent with his,'' and he ``said it was \nthe OIG's fault that Mr. Garcia was now in this situation because we \nwere not consistent in our responses.'' Ms. Redman refused to change \nher story.\n  According to correspondence I received from Mr. Reback, Mr. Wallace \nalso contacted Reback on June 16, in an e-mail ``in which [Wallace] \nstated that the OIG had provided inconsistent guidance to Mr. Garcia on \nresponding to questions regarding the Texas matter.'' Mr. Reback said \nthat he responded in an e-mail to Mr. Wallace, in which he said he \nexplained that ``I had been asked for guidance on what Mr. Garcia could \nsay if asked a question [on] the Texas matter at his confirmation \nhearing, and that I had provided guidance reflected in my June 4th e-\nmail to Ms. Clark.'' Mr. Reback also told Mr. Wallace that he was \n``unaware that Mr. Garcia ever had received any written questions on \nthe matter and had not seen or cleared on [sic] any of his written \nresponses.'' Late in the evening of June 16, Mr. Reback was contacted \nby Ms. Clark and another adviser at BICE, Tim Haugh, who provided him a \ncopy of draft responses to the questions I sent Mr. Garcia on June \n13th. Mr. Reback did not review or comment on all of the draft \nresponses, but did request that ``with respect to questions that \nimplicated OIG statements, Mr. Garcia refer to my June 4th e-mail in \nhis responses.''\n  At 11:00 p.m. on June 16, less than 12 hours before the committee met \nto consider his nomination, Mr. Garcia provided additional responses in \nwhich he continued to maintain that he had in fact been directed not to \nanswer. For the first time, he referred the committee to the e-mail \nmessage Mr. Reback sent to Lucy Clark on June 4, 2003, but he made no \nmention of Ms. Redman's different interpretation of that communication, \nor of the IG's authority. Despite Ms. Redman's statements to his \nadviser, Mr. Garcia did not correct his earlier assertions that the \nInspector General has the authority to instruct someone not to \ncooperate with Congress; he cited his legal advisers at DHS and the \nIG's office as the sources of his conclusion.\n  At the committee mark-up on the morning of June 17, I expressed my \nconcerns about Mr. Garcia's refusal to answer questions about the Texas \nincident, and I questioned whether his reliance on supposed \ninstructions from the IG's office were factually accurate or legally \nsound. I entered into an agreement with Chairman Collins that I would \nnot object to the committee reporting Mr. Garcia's nomination, but that \nMr. Garcia's nomination would not go to the Senate floor until my \nquestions and concerns had been satisfactorily resolved.\n  I subsequently sent letters seeking additional information from Mr. \nReback, Ms. Redman, and Mr. Garcia. I have already described the \ninformation I received from Mr. Reback and Ms. Redman. Mr. Garcia, for \nhis part, maintained that all of his answers had been accurate, and \nthat he had reasonably interpreted Mr. Reback's e-mail as equivalent to \nbeing directed by the IG's office not to respond. He concluded that at \nall times he was ``guided by a sincere desire not to in any way \ninterfere with an ongoing criminal investigation'': ``At no time did I \nintend to evade answers or to in any way challenge the authority of \nCongress to inquire into such matters. I responded based on what I \nreasonably believed was the guidance from the OIG and counsel.''\n  Although I am troubled by how Mr. Garcia and his advisers at the \nDepartment dealt with this issue, I have nevertheless decided not to \noppose this otherwise qualified nominee. Still, I felt that the issues \nraised during his nomination process were important enough that they \ndeserved to be fully aired.\n  One of the principal functions of the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs, like all Senate committees, is to ensure that qualified, \ncapable and responsible people are ultimately appointed to the highest \npositions in our government, and to conduct oversight over the \ndepartments and agencies within its jurisdiction. Through both the \nconfirmation and oversight processes, we ensure ourselves and the \nAmerican people that our government is functioning as it should be. As \npart of these processes, we regularly engage in dialogues with \nnominees, including through written questions; the integrity of our \nprocess requires that nominees fully and forthrightly answer the \nquestions asked.\n  It appears to me that Mr. Garcia and his legal advisers at DHS \nprovided answers to the Committee that were misleading factually and \nmisstated the legal reasons a nominee could refuse to answer questions. \nFor example, Mr. Garcia did not have any communications with any \nofficial from the IG's office until June 4, 2003, after he had already, \non two occasions, declined to answer questions about the Texas matter. \nNevertheless, his answers to my post-hearing questions stated that he \nhad declined to answer the questions because ``the IG's office directed \nthat it would not be appropriate to comment on this issue and that all \ninquiries be directed to that office.'' Whatever Mr. Garcia's \nintention, that answer was not a factually accurate way of explaining \nanswers given before he or his advisers spoke with the IG's office \nabout the issue.\n  Furthermore, it is now clear that Mr. Garcia never was ``directed'' \nnot to answer the questions by the Office of Inspector General--an \nassertion he repeatedly made in his written responses to my questions. \nRegardless of whether Mr. Reback's June 4 e-mail could have been \ninterpreted as something stronger than intended, Mr. Garcia's legal \nadviser, Mr. Wallace, knew prior to Mr. Garcia's submission of his \nfinal set of answers that the IG's office was not directing him not to \nanswer questions and had never intended to do so. Nevertheless, Mr. \nGarcia submitted written answers on June 16 in which he continued to \nassert that the IG's office had directed him not to answer the \nquestions, referring to Mr. Reback's e-mail. Nothing in the answers \ngave any indication that the IG's office had explicitly rejected this \ninterpretation of Mr. Reback's e-mail.\n  Mr. Garcia's rationale for not answering the questions raised \nimportant institutional issues. As a general matter, I find it \nunacceptable for agency officials to argue that the pendency of an IG \ninvestigation categorically precludes them from responding to \ncongressional information requests. Congress often seeks information--\nand sometimes even conducts parallel investigations--on matters also \nunder review by IG offices. Were the pendency of IG investigations a \nbasis for an agency official or employee to decline to respond to \nCongressional inquiries, numerous Congressional inquiries conducted by \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee and other Committees would be \ninappropriately stymied.\n  The notion that an Inspector General could ``direct'' a Department \nofficial not to cooperate with Congress was itself troubling. Officials \nat the Inspector General's office understood that they did not have the \nauthority to ``direct'' Department officials not to answer questions, \nbut neither Mr. Garcia nor his legal advisers consulted with IG \nofficials on their choice of words until after they had already sent \nthe Committee Mr. Garcia's answers. I was especially disturbed, in this \ncontext, to\n\n[[Page S16073]]\n\nlearn that Mr. Garcia's legal adviser, Mark Wallace, apparently berated \nthe Assistant Inspector General and attempted to get her to change her \nversion of events to make it ``consistent'' with the answers he had \npreviously prepared. If true, this is highly improper behavior for a \ngovernment attorney, and might itself have been worthy of an \ninvestigation.\n  Subsequent to the Committee's reporting of Mr. Garcia's nomination, \nmy staff met with him to discuss these issues and my concerns about \nthese events as well as with other examples of DHS nominees providing \nless than adequate answers to questions posed during the nomination \nprocess. In light of Mr. Garcia's statement in that meeting that he did \nnot intend to mislead the Committee and now understood the need to \nbetter cooperate with Congress, I am prepared to move forward with his \nnomination. I could not do so, however, without leaving a complete \nrecord of my concern over these events.\n  Mr President, I thank my colleague, Chairman Collins, for working \nwith me towards a satisfactory resolution of this issue. I am glad that \nwe have had the opportunity to share with Mr. Garcia and with other DHS \nofficials our concerns about how this nomination was handled. I hope \nthat in the future the Department of Homeland Security will endeavor to \nwork constructively with all senators to avoid misunderstandings of the \ntype we experienced in this case, and to take seriously its obligations \nto provide Congress with the accurate, timely and complete information \nit needs.\n  In the interest of fairness to all parties, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of letters from Mr. Reback, Ms. Redman, and Mr. Garcia, \nbe printed in the Record following my remarks. Space limitations \nprevent me from including the full text of the pre-hearing and post-\nhearing questions asked of Mr. Garcia, and his answers, but those may \nbe found in the Committee's hearing record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Department of Homeland Security, Office of Inspector \n           General,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 26, 2003.\n     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, Dirsken Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lieberman: Thank you for your letter to me \n     dated June 23, 2003, in which you asked me to clarify a \n     matter before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, \n     specifically the Committee's consideration of the nomination \n     of Michael Garcia to serve as Assistant Secretary in the \n     Department of Homeland Security. The following responses to \n     your questions are below:\n       (1) Did you have any communications with Mr. Garcia about \n     how to respond to questions regarding the Texas matter? If \n     so, please state when each communication occurred, who \n     initiated the communication and who else was present, and \n     please describe the content of the conversation or \n     communication.\n       Response: No.\n       (2) Did you have communications with any DHS official or \n     employees seeking information on Mr. Garcia's behalf on how \n     to respond to Congressional information requests about the \n     Texas matter or otherwise involved in the drafting of Mr. \n     Garcia's responses? If so, please state the person with whom \n     you had each communication (including his or her title), who \n     initiated the communication, when the communication occurred, \n     and describe the content of the communication.\n       Response: Yes. I had telephone conversations with Lucy \n     Clark, DHS Chief Legal Counselor, on the afternoon of June 2, \n     on June 4, and possibly on June 3, 2003. These conversations \n     were initiated by Ms. Clark and each conversation was very \n     brief--I would estimate the total time for all my telephone \n     conversations with Ms. Clark on these days was approximately \n     five to ten minutes.\n       Ms. Clark told me that Mr. Garcia would be appearing for \n     his confirmation hearing and asked me how he should respond \n     if questioned about the Texas matter. I replied that Mr. \n     Garcia should state that the matter was under investigation \n     by the OIG and questions should be referred to the OIG. I \n     told Ms. Clark that since the OIG had an open criminal \n     investigation, we did not want people talking about the case. \n     Ms. Clark subsequently asked me to put my comments in writing \n     and I sent her the e-mail on June 4th that has been provided \n     to you. Ms. Redman, Assistant Inspector General for \n     Investigations, reviewed and concurred with my e-mail before \n     I sent it. Mr. Richard Skinner, Deputy Inspector General, \n     reviewed and concurred with my e-mail after I had sent it.\n       On June 16th, I received an e-mail from Mark Wallace, \n     Principal Legal Adviser to Mr. Garcia, in which he stated \n     that the OIG had provided inconsistent guidance to Mr. Garcia \n     on responding to questions regarding the Texas matter. Mr. \n     Wallace attached a copy of eight questions from Senator \n     Lieberman to Mr. Garcia. I responded to Mr. Wallace via e-\n     mail in which I stated that I had been asked for guidance on \n     what Mr. Garcia could say if asked a question about the Texas \n     matter at his confirmation hearing, and that I had provided \n     guidance reflected in my June 4th e-mail to Ms. Clark. I \n     further stated that I was unaware that Mr. Garcia ever had \n     received any written questions on the matter and had not seen \n     or cleared on any of his written responses. I also stated \n     that I heard nothing more about Mr. Garcia's response to \n     questions on the Texas matter until the afternoon of June \n     13th, when the Assistant Inspector General for \n     Investigations, Ms. Redman, had received oral questions from \n     some of the Committee's minority staff regarding Mr. Garcia's \n     responses. Finally, I stated that the OIG investigation was \n     closed, there was no criminal enforcement action and that Mr. \n     Garcia could answer any questions about the Texas matter. I \n     heard nothing further from Mr. Wallace.\n       Late that evening (June 16th), I had conversations with Ms. \n     Clark and with Mr. Tim Haugh, Director of Congressional \n     Relations, Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, \n     about questions Mr. Garcia had received from the Senate \n     Committee on Governmental Affairs and which Mr. Garcia \n     intended to respond to that day. My conversations were \n     primarily with Mr. Haugh, who provided me a copy of draft \n     responses to those questions. I did not review or comment on \n     all of the responses. I did however, request that with \n     respect to questions that implicated OIG statements, Mr. \n     Garcia refer to my June 4th e-mail in his responses.\n       (3) Please indicate specifically whether any communications \n     you had with persons outside the OIG about Mr. Garcia's \n     responses occurred before June 4, 2003.\n       Response: Please see answer above.\n       (4) Please indicate whether you are aware of any other \n     person employed by the OIG discussing this matter with DHS \n     personnel acting on Mr. Garcia's behalf. If you are aware of \n     any such discussions, please indicate who had the discussion, \n     who initiated it, when it occurred (and specifically whether \n     it was before June 4, 2003) and, to the extent you know, the \n     contents of the discussion.\n       Response: I am unaware of any other person employed by the \n     OIG having such discussions other than my conversations on \n     June 2nd and possibly June 3rd as discussed above.\n       (5) Mr. Garcia attached your e-mail to Lucy Clark to \n     substantiate his assertion that the IG's office ``directed'' \n     him not to respond to the questions sent to him.\n       (a) Please provide in as much detail as you can recall the \n     contents of any communications you had with Ms. Clark that \n     led to you drafting the e-mail provided to the Committee. Who \n     initiated the conversation? What specifically did Ms. Clark \n     tell you about the questions sent to Mr. Garcia? What did she \n     ask you to do?\n       Response: Please see my response to question 2 above. As \n     stated, I did not know that Mr. Garcia had received any \n     written questions nor that he had appeared for a Committee \n     staff interview on June 2, 2003.\n       (b) Was anyone other than Ms. Clark involved in these \n     communications? If so, state who was involved (including the \n     person's title) and the nature and content of their \n     involvement.\n       Response: Please see my response to questions above.\n       (c) Did you tell Ms. Clark that you were ``directing'' Mr. \n     Garcia to refer all inquiries regarding the matter to your \n     office?\n       Response: I did not use the terms ``direct'' or \n     ``directing.'' However, in my conversations with Ms. Clark, I \n     believe it was clear that the OIG did not ant DHS personnel \n     discussing a matter that was under criminal investigation by \n     the OIG without first coordinating with the OIG.\n       (d) Did you believe your e-mail was ''directing'' Mr. \n     Garcia to refer all inquiries regarding the matter to your \n     office?\n       Response: Please see my response above.\n       (e) The question attached to your e-mail does not use \n     language encompassing all questions related to the Texas \n     matter, but rather asks only what action Mr. Garcia is \n     currently taking on it. The bulk of my questions, in \n     contrast, asked about past events, not Mr. Garcia's current \n     actions. Did you tell Ms. Clark that Mr. Garcia should refer \n     all Congressional questions, including seeking Mr. Garcia's \n     knowledge about underlying events, to the IG's office.\n       Response: My conversations with Ms. Clark did not involve \n     that level of specificity. I was unaware of your prior \n     questions to Mr. Garcia at the time I had my conversations on \n     June 2nd-June 4th.\n       (f) Did you believe the attachment to your e-mail suggested \n     that Mr. Garcia should not answer the questions reprinted at \n     the bottom of page 1 of this letter?\n       Response: At the time I sent the e-mail, I was not aware \n     that specific questions were pending or had been posed. My \n     advice was inthe context of a potential inquiry along the \n     lines stated in my June 4th e-mail.\n       (g) Did Ms. Clark (or any other person involved in these \n     communications with you) ask you to provide a different \n     answer than the one you gave to her? If so, that was her or \n     their proposal, and why did you not agree to it? Please \n     describe in full the discussion on this matter.\n\n[[Page S16074]]\n\n       Response: At no time during our conversations on June 2nd-\n     4th did Ms. Clark or anyone else ask me to provide a \n     different answer than the one I provided.\n       (6) Did you ever direct Mr. Garcia or anyone inquiring on \n     his behalf not to answer questions from Congress on the Texas \n     matter? (If your previous answers dispose of this and/or any \n     of the following questions in their entirety, feel free to so \n     indicate).\n       Response: No. Please see my responses to questions above.\n       (7) Are you aware of any other OIG personnel directing Mr. \n     Garcia or anyone inquiring on his behalf not to a answer \n     questions from Congress on the Texas matter? If so, please \n     identify the individuals involved, when they issued the \n     direction, to whom they gave it, and the content of any \n     communications related to such direction.\n       Response: No. Please see my responses to questions above.\n       (8) Do you believe you or anyone in the IG's office had the \n     authority to ``direct'' Mr. Garcia not to answer these \n     questions? If so, please state the basis of that authority.\n       Response: No.\n       (9) Did you ever tell Mr. Garcia or anyone inquiring on his \n     behalf that it would be ``inappropriate to offer comment'' in \n     response to Congressional questions regarding BICE's \n     involvement in the Texas matter? If so, please identify the \n     person to whom you made this statement, when you made it and \n     the basis for your making that statement.\n       Response: I do not remember if I used those exact words. \n     However, it would have been reasonable for Ms. Clark to infer \n     that I believed it would be prudent for Mr. Garcia to check \n     with the OIG before offering comment about the OIG's \n     investigation of BICE's involvement in the Texas matter.\n       At the time, the OIG had an open criminal investigation. \n     Generally, we seek to avoid public discussion of open \n     criminal matters to avoid jeopardizing the success of a \n     potential future prosecution, impeding our ability to gather \n     all relevant information, affecting the impartiality and \n     perceived impartiality of our work, and other such concerns. \n     We also try to discourage speculation about the outcome of a \n     pending investigation.\n       (10) Had you seen Mr. Garcia's answers to the questions \n     sent to him by the Committee prior to receiving this letter? \n     If so, in what context did you see them? Who showed them to \n     you and when? Were you shown any of Mr. Garcia's written \n     responses before he sent them to the Committee? Regardless of \n     when you saw them, did you believe the answers to be accurate \n     in their representation of the IG office's statements and \n     views? If not, did you communicate that belief to anyone in \n     DHS? If so, to whom? When? What were the contents of that \n     conversation?\n       Response: I saw a draft of Mr. Garcia's June 16th answers \n     on the evening of June 16th; I did not see the final document \n     until after it had been sent to the Committee. I believe the \n     responses received by the Committee are accurate in their \n     representation of OIG statements, namely, I sent the June 4, \n     2003, email to Ms. Clark. I did not offer any comment on the \n     responses in any other respect. I did not see the written \n     responses to any of the other sets of questions until \n     provided them by Committee's minority staff in the course of \n     responding to these questions.\n       Examining the responses after the fact, I believe that the \n     scope of the OIG guidance may have been misunderstood. The \n     OIG had not intended, and did not direct that no \n     Congressional requests be answered. Instead, we asked that \n     questions be referred to the OIG because the OIG had an open \n     criminal investigation. We did not intend that to be the end \n     of the dialogue with the Congress.\n       (11) Please provide any additional information you believe \n     might be helpful to clarify the Committee's record on this \n     matter.\n       Response: Legal authority supports the general position \n     that an OIG can withhold certain confidential information \n     from Congress during the course of an open criminal \n     investigation. See 13 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 77 (1989). In my \n     experience, I have found Congressional staff members \n     sensitive to these issues and willing to accommodate OIG \n     concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Richard N. Reback,\n     Counsel to the Acting Inspector General.\n                                  ____\n\n         Department of Homeland Security, Office of Inspector \n           General,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 26, 2003.\n     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lieberman: Thank you for your letter to me \n     dated June 23, 2003, in which you asked me to clarify a \n     matter before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, \n     specifically the Committee's consideration of the nomination \n     of Michael Garcia to serve as Assistant Secretary in the \n     Department of Homeland Security. The following responses to \n     your questions are provided below:\n       (1) Did you have any communications with Mr. Garcia about \n     how to respond to questions regarding the Texas matter? If \n     so, please state when each communication occurred, who \n     initiated it and who else was present, and please describe \n     the content of the communication.\n       Response: No.\n       (2) Did you have communications with any DHS official or \n     employee seeking information on Mr. Garcia's behalf on how to \n     respond to Congressional information requests about the Texas \n     matter or otherwise involved in the drafting of Mr. Garcia's \n     responses? If so, please identify the person with whom you \n     had each communication (including his or her title), state \n     who initiated the communication, indicate when the \n     communication occurred, and describe the content of the \n     communication.\n       Response: No, not until June 16th and that conversation was \n     with Mark Wallace after he had sent responses to the \n     Committee on Mr. Garcia's behalf.\n       (3) Please indicate specifically whether any communications \n     you had with persons outside the OIG about Mr. Garcia's \n     responses occurred before June 4, 2003.\n       Response: I had no communications outside the OIG prior to \n     June 4, 2003, regarding Mr. Garcia's responses.\n       (4) Please indicate whether you are aware of any other \n     person employed by the OIG discussing this matter with Mr. \n     Garcia or with DHS personnel acting on Mr. Garcia's behalf. \n     If you are aware of any such discussions, please indicate who \n     had the discussion, who initiated it, when it occurred (and \n     specifically whether it was before June 4, 2003) and, to the \n     extent you know, the contents of the discussion.\n       Response: I am aware that OIG Counsel Richard Reback was \n     contacted by DHS General Counsel Lucy Clark on June 4th or \n     perhaps June 3rd; during which contact Ms. Clark sought \n     advice from Counsel Reback as to what Mr. Garcia should say \n     if asked about the OIG Texas investigation. Mr. Reback \n     advised me that Ms. Clark initiated contact with him and he \n     provided an email to her in response as to suggested language \n     Mr. Garcia might use. That is the same email previously \n     provided to your staff. Mr. Reback showed me his proposed \n     email before he sent it and I concurred with its contents.\n       (5) Did you ever direct Mr. Garcia or anyone inquiring on \n     his behalf not to answer questions from Congress on the Texas \n     matter? If so, please describe when that happened, to whom \n     you gave that direction, who initiated the communication, and \n     the details of your direction.\n       Response: No direction was provided by me to Mr. Garcia or \n     anyone acting on his behalf on any matter.\n       (6) Are you aware of any OIG personnel directing Mr. Garcia \n     or anyone inquiring on his behalf not to answer questions \n     from Congress on the Texas matter? If so, please describe \n     when that happened, who gave the direction and to whom that \n     direction was given, who initiated the communication, and the \n     details of the direction.\n       Response: I am not aware of any OIG contact with Mr. Garcia \n     or anyone on his behalf directing him as to what to say or \n     not to say.\n       (7) Do you believe you or anyone in the IG's office had the \n     authority to ``direct'' Mr. Garcia not to answer these \n     questions? If so, please state the basis of that authority.\n       Response: No, I do not believe the OIG has the authority to \n     ``direct'' Mr. Garcia or anyone else in DHS to answer or not \n     answer questions from Congress.\n       (8) Did you ever tell Mr. Garcia or anyone inquiring on his \n     behalf that it would be ``inappropriate to offer comment'' in \n     response to Congressional questions regarding BICE's \n     involvement in the Texas matter? If so, please identify the \n     person to whom you made this statement, when you made it and \n     the basis for your making that statement.\n       Response: No, I never made that statement to Mr. Garcia or \n     anyone on his behalf.\n       (9) Had you seen or discussed Mr. Garcia's answers to the \n     questions sent to him by the Committee prior to receiving \n     this letter? If so, in what context did you see them? Who \n     showed them to you and when? Were you shown any of Mr. \n     Garcia's written responses before he sent them to the \n     Committee? Regardless of when you saw them, did you believe \n     the answers to be accurate in their representation of the IG \n     office's statements and views? If not, did you communicate \n     that belief to anyone in DHS? If so, to whom? When? What were \n     the contents of that conversation?\n       Response: the first time I saw any questions for Mr. Garcia \n     was on the morning of June 16th. Those questions were e-\n     mailed to me by Mark Wallace, who identified himself as Mr. \n     Garcia's Principal Legal Advisor. He sought assistance in \n     preparing responses to those questions on Mr. Garcia's behalf \n     and asked for ``urgent'' help at 9:41 am. I did not see any \n     responses he drafted to those questions until the morning of \n     June 17th. A faxed copy of his responses was under my door \n     when I arrived at work. I e-mailed Mr. Reback at 8:32 am on \n     June 17th and advised him that the responses prepared by Mr. \n     Wallace to Questions 2 and 3 were not accurate as they \n     purported to represent a conversation Wallace and I had the \n     morning of June 16th. I was subsequently told by Mr. Reback \n     that those responses did not get sent to the committee; \n     instead a new (second) set of responses was drafted by the \n     night before and those responses were the ones sent to you by \n     Lucy Clark. The set of responses you received was accurate.\n       (10) You indicated to my staff that on Friday, June 13, you \n     had a conversation with the individual who drafted Mr. \n     Garcia's responses to the questions regarding the Texas \n     matter and that you told him that the IG's office had not \n     ``directed'' Mr. Garcia not to respond to the questions. To \n     the extent that you have not already done so in response to \n     the questions above, please answer the following questions \n     with respect to that conversation:\n       (a) With whom did you have this conversation (please \n     identify the individual's name and title)?\n\n[[Page S16075]]\n\n       Response: I did say in a meeting with your staff on June \n     19th that I had such a conversation on Friday, June 13th. \n     However, I was mistaken and realized that mistake in \n     reviewing my e-mails and telephone notes. On the afternoon \n     and early evening of Friday, June 13th I had several \n     telephone conversations with Kevin Landy of your staff from \n     whom I learned for the first time that questions and answers \n     had been provided to the Committee by Mr. Garcia. The \n     conversation to which you refer actually occurred on Monday, \n     June 16th between 9:41 and 9:54 am between myself and Mark \n     Wallace, Principal Legal Advisor to Mr. Garcia.\n       (b) Because Mr. Garcia sent answers to the questions on \n     that date (DHS staff emailed them to Committee staff at 12:29 \n     p.m.), please identify to the most precise extent you can \n     recall when in the day that conversation occurred.\n       Response: as indicated above, I misspoke and I did not have \n     any conversations with Mr. Wallace until Monday, June 16th, \n     not Friday, June 13th. My June 13th conversations were with \n     Kevin Landy, not Mark Wallace.\n       (c) Who initiated the conversation?\n       Response: the conversation on June 16th was initiated by \n     Mark Wallace. He called the main number, asked for Mr. \n     Reback, then Mr. Skinner, and finally me after learning the \n     other two were not available.\n       (d) Who else was involved in it?\n       Response: No one else was involved in this conversation.\n       (e) Please describe in the greatest detail possible, the \n     contents of the conversation.\n       Response: Mr. Wallace was very agitated and stated that the \n     OIG had provided answers inconsistent to those he provided on \n     Mr. Garcia's behalf. I asked him to which questions he was \n     referring and he said he submitted a number of responses for \n     the record on Friday (June 13th) and also prior to Mr. \n     Garcia's hearing. I told him that he should have coordinated \n     those responses with the OIG because his responses, as \n     described to me by Kevin Landy on the 13th, were not \n     accurate. He said his answers were accurate, mine were not, \n     and this inconsistency would only make me and the OIG ``look \n     bad.'' I told Wallace that no one had ``directed'' Garcia or \n     anyone else as to what to say and I was not going to state \n     otherwise. He said we had directed Garcia in the form of Mr. \n     Reback's email to Lucy Clark and I disputed that claim. He \n     became quite angry and demanded that we make our responses \n     consistent with his. I told him that he would not be in this \n     situation if he had cleared his answers with the OIG prior to \n     submission. I further said it is not a good idea to speak for \n     the OIG; that is our job. He insisted that ``direct'' is the \n     same thing as ``ask'' if it comes from the OIG and I told him \n     that was not correct and that it was not his right to \n     interpret what he thought the OIG meant. Further, I told \n     Wallace that Mr. Reback's email was clear as to the position \n     of the OIG. The conversation ended as abruptly as it had \n     begun.\n       (f) Did the individual show you or describe to you my \n     questions to Mr. Garcia or the answers he had given or \n     proposed to give? If so, what did he say about them?\n       Response: Mr. Wallace did not share any prior responses \n     with me. I saw responses for the first time on the morning of \n     June 17th, which were not correct and were not ultimately \n     submitted to the committee. Those responses were to questions \n     Wallace said he received from you sometime between the 13th \n     and the 16th. He did orally confirm during our conversation \n     of the 16th that he was being questioned by you, in writing, \n     as to responses he submitted on Mr. Garcia's behalf on the \n     13th, because I told him I understood that he had submitted \n     questions that we had not seen.\n       (g) Did you tell the individual with whom you spoke that \n     the IG's office had not ``directed'' Mr. Garcia not to \n     respond to questions about the Texas matter?\n       Response: Yes, I was very adamant on that point and that \n     was why he called me on June 16th. He said we needed to be \n     consistent with responses he had already submitted and that \n     we had ``directed'' Mr. Garcia not to answer questions. I \n     told Wallace that was flat-out incorrect and no one in the \n     OIG had had any communication with Mr. Garcia, let alone \n     ``directed'' him on any matter, nor did we know until the \n     13th (from Kevin Landy to me) that any questions had been \n     submitted in the first place.\n       (h) What did you tell the individual with whom you spoke \n     about whether the IG's office had authority to give such a \n     direction?\n       Response: I told Wallace that he well knew from his time in \n     the OIG community (he previously worked at FEMA) that an OIG \n     cannot direct anyone (other than OIG employees) to do \n     anything.\n       (i) What did that individual ask you to do or say?\n       Response: Wallace demanded that we assist him in drafting \n     responses to new questions he had received because it was our \n     fault he had gotten the questions. He said it was the OIG's \n     fault that Mr. Garcia was now in this situation because we \n     were not consistent in our responses.\n       (j) What did you say in response?\n       Response: I told Wallace that if we had seen his draft \n     responses before he sent them then we could have prevented \n     him from using such a poor choice of language. Prior \n     coordination would have resulted in consistent responses.\n       (11) Please provide any additional information you believe \n     might be helpful to clarify the Committee's record on this \n     matter.\n       Response: Mr. Wallace left DHS employ on June 18th. He \n     advised Mr. Reback that he had accepted a position as Deputy \n     Campaign Manager for the President's re-election campaign.\n           Sincerely,\n     Elizabeth M. Redman,\n       Assistant Inspector General for Investigations, Office of \n     Inspector General, Department of Homeland Security.\n                                  ____\n\n         Department of Homeland Security, Bureau of Immigration \n           and Customs Enforcement,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 30, 2003.\n     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lieberman: This letter is in response to your \n     letter of July 8, 2003, requesting further clarification \n     regarding information previously provided in response to \n     questions for the record involving the Air and Marine \n     Interdiction Coordination Center.\n       Please find enclosed responses to each of your questions. \n     Thank you for the opportunity to address your further \n     questions regarding this matter. I would be happy to discuss \n     this matter with you further if you feel such a meeting would \n     be helpful.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Michael J. Garcia,\n                                       Acting Assistant Secretary.\n       Enclosure.\n\n       (1) On May 30, 2003, when you first responded to my \n     questions that because BICE had referred the underlying \n     issues to the Office of the Inspector General, ``it would be \n     inappropriate to offer comment on the questions above,'' did \n     you believe you had been ``directed'' by the IG's office not \n     to answer the questions? If so, what was the basis for that \n     belief? Who told you about such direction and when?\n       Response: I think it would be helpful in clarifying the \n     record to set forth the responses made to your inquiries \n     regarding the Air and Marine Interdiction Coordination Center \n     (``AMICC'') and in doing this to detail the substance and \n     chronology of those answers and the basis for the position \n     taken.\n       On May 30, 2003, I responded to the first set of questions \n     regarding events at AMICC by stating that the matter had been \n     referred to the Inspector General and that ``[t]herefore it \n     would be inappropriate to offer comment on the questions \n     above.'' At this time I based my statement on the fact that \n     this was a potential criminal investigation and on my \n     experience as a Federal prosecutor. In sum, I was motivated \n     by the belief that it would be inappropriate to offer my \n     comments on this ongoing IG matter. I was also aware that \n     before the House Select Homeland Security Committee on May \n     20, 2003, Secretary Ridge had stated, ``we thought it was \n     very appropriate, based on the multiple inquiries that we \n     received from members of Congress, including yours, that we \n     deploy the means with which Congress has given us. And that's \n     an inspector general within our department.'' He went on to \n     say ``. . . it's not appropriate to be passing that \n     information out right now'' when referring to a request to \n     release the audiotapes. My responses were reviewed by the \n     Department of Homeland Security prior to being sent to the \n     Committee. On June 2, 2003, I was interviewed by staff \n     members for the Committee. At that time, Minority Counsel \n     asked me about my May 30 answers to the AMICC questions, \n     specifically my basis for declining to answer with specifics. \n     I explained that I based this response on my experience as a \n     prosecutor and my concern about commenting on an ongoing, \n     potentially criminal, investigation. Minority Counsel \n     disagreed with this analogy--my experience as a Federal \n     prosecutor--and stated that the law regarding inquiries by \n     Congress made such comment possible. I replied that I was not \n     aware of that legal authority.\n       As a result of the statements by Minority Counsel and the \n     continuing interest in this area of inquiry by the Committee \n     as manifested by his questions, I asked my Principal Legal \n     Advisor to get clarification. I understood that he worked \n     through Lucy Clark, Chief Legal Counselor to DHS. I used this \n     avenue of communication with the IG--through counsel--given \n     that the most appropriate medium for communicating with an \n     agency conducting an ongoing criminal investigation into \n     activities by a component of my agency is through legal \n     counsel.\n       A subsequent e-mail (previously provided to the Committee) \n     authorized by the Office of Inspector General stated: \n     ``Attached is the language Mr. Garcia can use if questioned \n     on the Texas State legislators issue.'' The attachment \n     read: ``My office referred this matter to the Department's \n     Office of Inspector General (OIG) on the evening of May \n     15, 2003. The OIG has asked that any questions relating to \n     this matter be directed to them.'' I received a copy of \n     this e-mail prior to my confirmation hearing on June 5, \n     2003. It is my understanding that the OIG counsel who \n     provided this e-mail knew that this guidance was being \n     sought in the context of my confirmation hearing. I also \n     received confirmation from Lucy Clark that it would be \n     inappropriate to make any comments and I should refer any \n     questions on this matter during the confirmation process \n     to the OIG. (See Letter from Lucy Clark to Senator Joseph \n     Lieberman, dated June 16, 2003). The\n\n[[Page S16076]]\n\n     AMICC matter was not raised at the June 5, 2003 hearing.\n       On June 13, I submitted responses to your post-hearing \n     questions. At that time, in response to the question \n     regarding why I believed it inappropriate to comment, I \n     responded, ``I received direction from the Inspector \n     General's (IG's) Office to refer all inquiries regarding this \n     matter to that office.'' In response to the next question, \n     ``Did the Office of the Inspector General ask you not to \n     comment?'' I responded, ``As noted above, the IG's office \n     directed that it would not be appropriate to comment on this \n     issue and that all inquiries be directed to that office.'' I \n     based these answers on the e-mail from the IG counsel \n     referenced above which stated that the OIG ``has asked that \n     any question relating to this matter be directed to them'' as \n     well as the guidance from Lucy Clark, who I knew to be in \n     contact with the IG's office, that it would be inappropriate \n     to make any comments on this matter during the confirmation \n     process other than to refer such questions to the OIG. These \n     answers were again cleared at the Department level.\n       Later that evening of June 13, 2003, I received additional \n     questions on this issue. Those questions referenced a \n     conversation between your staff and the OIG to the effect \n     that referring questions to the OIG regarding an OIG criminal \n     investigation was not consistent with the policy of the OIG \n     and that the Assistant IG conducting the investigation had \n     stated that no one at the IG's office had ever had any \n     communications with me. You then posed several questions \n     related to this ``contradiction.''\n       I responded to the first question related to any \n     communications with the IG's office by providing the e-mail \n     discussed above and outlined the method of communication I \n     used to obtain that guidance, namely through my Principal \n     Legal Advisor and the DHS Chief Legal Counselor. While I \n     never had any direct communication with the OIG on this \n     matter, the communication from the OIG's Chief Counsel \n     clearly was intended as guidance for ``Mr. Garcia'' in the \n     confirmation process. I also noted that my answers were \n     cleared through the Chief Legal Counselor for DHS based upon \n     her understanding of her direct communications with the OIG.\n       This round of questions raised for the first time an issue \n     with respect to the clear guidance offered by that OIG e-mail \n     and the Chief Legal Counselor. Let me state that I believe \n     that this guidance was the topic of much discussion, at \n     the time, in order to attempt to ensure a coordinated \n     approach to Congress. I understood that my Principal Legal \n     Advisor, as well as Tim Haugh of my Congressional Affairs \n     Office, discussed the issue of referring to the OIG \n     questions regarding the investigation with the OIG Chief \n     Counsel in order to clarify the position and to insure \n     that the responses were accurate. At this time, I also \n     answered the substantive questions about the AMICC matter. \n     My understanding is that both the OIG's Chief Counsel and \n     the Assistant IG assigned to investigate this matter agree \n     that the June 16 responses are accurate with respect to \n     communications with that office.\n       (2) According to Richard Reback, Counselor to the Acting \n     Inspector General, Lucy Clark, the DHS Chief Legal Counselor, \n     first called him on the afternoon of June 2, 2003, and spoke \n     with him a final time on June 4, 2003. On June 4, Mr. Reback \n     sent Lucy Clark the e-mail which you provided to the \n     Committee on June 16.\n       (a) Were you aware of these conversations between Lucy \n     Clark and Richard Reback? If so, when did you learn of the \n     conversations, from whom, and what were you told about the \n     conversations?\n       (b) Did you ever see the text of the e-mail that Mr. Reback \n     sent on June 4? If so, when did you first see it, who showed \n     it to you, and how did you interpret the guidance it \n     contained?\n       Response: I was aware that Lucy Clark was in contact with \n     Richard Reback prior to my June 5 confirmation hearing. Prior \n     to my June 5 confirmation, I received a copy of this e-mail, \n     I believe through my Principal Legal Advisor. On advice of \n     DHS counsel, I interpreted this e-mail and the guidance that \n     it would be inappropriate to answer any questions other than \n     to refer the questioner to the OIG as directed in the e-mail.\n       (3) On what did you base your statement that you had been \n     directed not to answer the questions?\n       Response: I based my answer on the e-mail from the OIG \n     counsel stating that I should respond to questions by stating \n     ``The OIG has asked that any questions relating to this \n     matter be directed to them,'' and on advice of the Chief \n     Legal Counselor that ``in the context of his confirmation \n     hearing, the OIG responded [in response to a request from the \n     Office of General Counsel] that Mr. Garcia should refer all \n     questions related to this matter to the OIG.'' Moreover, I \n     was advised ``it would be inappropriate for him to make any \n     comments on this matter during the confirmation process other \n     than to refer such questions to the OIG.'' (See, Letter of \n     Lucy Clark, Chief Legal Counsel to DHS, to Senator Joseph \n     Lieberman, dated June 16, 2003.)\n       (4) Lisa Redman says she told Mark Wallace on the morning \n     of June 16 that he had misrepresented the position of the \n     Office of the Inspector General in preparing your earlier \n     answers. She refused his request to change her responses to \n     make them consistent with your answers. The answers you \n     submitted later that night did not reflect this conversation, \n     but instead held to the answers the IG's office had rejected. \n     The questions I sent you on June 13 specifically noted that \n     the IG's office had denied having the communications you \n     earlier described.\n       (a) Were you ever aware of the conversation between Mark \n     Wallace and Lisa Redman? If so, when did you learn of the \n     conversation, from whom, and what were you told about the \n     conversation?\n       Response: At some point on June 16, I became aware that the \n     ICE Principal Legal Advisor was engaged in conversation with \n     the Office of Inspector General and was in contact with the \n     Department's Chief Legal Counselor. I was not aware of the \n     substance of the particular conversation referenced in your \n     July 8 questions. I was aware of the conflicting \n     interpretations of the OIG policy as outlined in your June 13 \n     letter. As I understood it, the point of the conversations \n     between the Department's Chief Legal Counselor, my Principal \n     Legal Advisor, and the Office of Inspector General were aimed \n     at clarifying the OIG position regarding questions related to \n     the Texas matter and to ensure that the answers submitted on \n     June 16 were accurate. I understand that the OIG agrees that \n     the June 16 answers are accurate.\n       (b) Why did you claim in your answers of June 16 that Mr. \n     Reback's e-mail was the basis for your understanding that you \n     had been ``directed'' not to answer questions on the Texas \n     matter, despite Lisa Redman's disavowal of that claim?\n       Response: Mr. Reback's earlier e-mail (stating that I could \n     use the following questions if asked about the State \n     legislator issue: ``The Office of Inspector General (OIG) has \n     asked that any questions relating to this matter be directed \n     to them.'') was the primary basis for my earlier answers, in \n     addition to the guidance of the Department's Chief Legal \n     Counselor. At the time I answered the June 13 questions, I \n     had no indication that Ms. Redmon or anyone else at the OIG \n     interpreted that guidance in any other way nor, given the \n     plain language of that text, did I have any reason to do so. \n     The June 16 questions were directed to the basis for my June \n     13 answers. I understand that Ms. Redmon of the OIG did not \n     express her view regarding OIG policy until June 16--not June \n     13 as she had erroneously claimed previously.\n       (c) Why did your answers of June 16 refer to the e-mail \n     Lucy Clark received from Richard Reback, but fail to mention \n     the conversation Mark Wallace had with Lisa Redman?\n       Response: The e-mail from Reback appeared to state plainly \n     the OIG position (``The Office of Inspector General (OIG) has \n     asked that any questions relating to this matter be directed \n     to them.''). At no time prior to June 16 did I have any \n     indication that Ms. Redmon interpreted that guidance to mean \n     I was free to answer questions based upon my personal \n     knowledge or what others had said to me. Nor was such leeway \n     in any way apparent from the text of the e-mail. My June 16 \n     answers were in response to questions aimed at tracking the \n     basis for my June 13 responses (and as stated the basis for \n     those was the Reback e-mail and guidance from Lucy Clark).\n       Please indicate whether you are aware of any other person \n     employed by the IG's office discussing this matter with you \n     or with DHS personnel acting on your behalf. If you are aware \n     of any such discussions, please indicate who had the \n     discussion, who initiated it, when it occurred, and, to the \n     extent you know, the contents of the discussion.\n       Response: No, only Lisa Redman and Richard Reback.\n       (6) What role did Mark Wallace play in drafting each set of \n     your written answers? Who else contributed to the drafting of \n     the answers relating to this matter? What efforts did you \n     make to independently confirm the accuracy of the answers you \n     provided on May 30, June 13, and June 16 with respect to the \n     Texas matter?\n       Response: as stated, following standard procedure, the \n     written answers like all testimony were cleared through the \n     following DHS offices: Legislative Affairs, Office of General \n     Counsel, and Office of the Secretary. Additionally, ICE \n     Legislative Affairs (Tim Haugh, Acting Director, and ICE \n     Legal (Mark Wallace, Principal Legal Advisor) reviewed the \n     draft answers. In answering the questions related to the \n     Texas matter, I relied upon the advice of legal counsel, the \n     OIG e-mail, and the fact that the answers were ``cleared'' \n     through DHS.\n       (7) With respect to each of the answers you provided on May \n     30, June 13, and June 16 relating to the Texas matter, do you \n     now believe the answers you submitted were accurate? Please \n     explain the basis for your conclusions.\n       Response: Yes--for the reasons explained above.\n       Based on what you now know, do you still believe that ``the \n     IG's office directed that it would not be appropriate to \n     comment on this issue''? If so, how do you explain the \n     statements to the contrary by officials from the Office of \n     the Inspector General? Please explain the basis for your \n     conclusion.\n       Response: The Office of Inspector General stated in an e-\n     mail in response to a request for guidance as follows: \n     ``Attached is the language Mr. Garcia can use if questioned \n     on the Texas State legislators issue.'' The attachment read: \n     ``My office referred this matter to the department's Office \n     of inspector General (OIG) on the evening of May 15, 2003. \n     The OIG has asked that any questions relating to this \n     matter be directed to them.'' I believe that I took the \n     appropriate step by having counsel seek guidance from the \n     AMICC\n\n[[Page S16077]]\n\n     regarding the appropriate answer to questions related to \n     an investigation the OIG was conducting. Given that the \n     OIG guidance at the time `'asked'' for question to be \n     ``directed to them'' and an OIG only subsequently \n     suggested different guidance, I believe that directing \n     questions to the OIG was appropriate at the time. I also \n     believe that better communication between OIG and ICE, \n     especially when presented with an inquiry from Congress, \n     is critical and I am committed to facilitating such \n     communication in the future.\n       (9) Both the IG's Counsel and the Assistant IG for \n     Investigations have stated that they don't have the authority \n     to direct a Department employee not to answer Congressional \n     inquiries. Do you still believe that an IG's office has the \n     authority to direct you not to provide information to \n     Congress? If so, what is the legal basis for that claim?\n       Response: I will be guided by the OIG's interpretation \n     regarding its authority and will ensure proper coordination \n     with that office.\n       (10) As you may know, Congress has frequently conducted \n     inquiries into agency matters in which there were also IG \n     investigations. Do you nevertheless believe that the pendency \n     of an IG investigation precludes you or other agency \n     officials from responding to Congressional information \n     requests? If so, what is the legal basis for that claim?\n       Response: I would be guided by the OIG with respect to \n     commenting on such matters. Again, I believe better internal \n     coordination on this issue would avoid any conflict in \n     providing responsive answers to Congress.\n       (11) Please provide any additional information you believe \n     might be helpful to clarify the Committee's record on this \n     matter.\n       Response: I would add that at all times in responding to \n     your questions I was guided by a sincere desire not to in any \n     way interfere with an ongoing criminal investigation, one of \n     high sensitivity and one which I had referred to the IG. At \n     no time did I intend to evade answers or to in any way \n     challenge the authority of Congress to inquire into such \n     matters. I responded based upon what I reasonably believed \n     was the guidance from the OIG and counsel. I would be happy \n     to discuss this matter with you further if you feel that such \n     a meeting would be helpful.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as the 108th Congress draws to a close, I \nwould like to take a few moments to reflect on the tremendous progress \nthis Senate has made in moving America forward. Leading the Senate is \nan honor and a pleasure, made all the more so by working with such \ntalented people. I thank my fellow Senators for their dedication. It \nhas been an exceptional legislative year.\n  Back in January, we set an ambitious agenda. We resolved to put the \neconomy back on track; lend critical support to the war on terror; and \npromote public health here at home and abroad. Our mission was to \nexpand freedom and opportunity, and strengthen America's security.\n  In 11 short months we have made major strides towards those goals. \nAnd we did so by respecting the longstanding Senate values of civility \nand trust, by building strong and reliable relationships, and by \ncommitting ourselves to action. Each of us can go home this holiday \nseason proud of our accomplishments.\n  We first set to work passing spending bills left undone by the \nprevious Congress. We passed 11 of those bills in just 3 weeks.\n  We also passed a budget to establish a blueprint for creating jobs, \ninvesting in homeland security and education, providing Medicare \nprescription drug coverage and offering health insurance for our most \nvulnerable citizens, America's children.\n  With that unfinished business of the last Congress complete, we \nturned our attention to the President's jobs and growth agenda.\n  Under the President's leadership, we passed $350 billion in tax \nrelief, the third largest tax cut in history. We cut taxes, across the \nboard, for 136 million hard-working, tax-paying Americans.\n  For America's families, we increased the child tax credit from $600 \nper child to $1000 per child, and made sure that money was sent out \nright away. As a result, this summer, 25 million families received \nchecks from the United States Treasury of up to $400 per child. In \ntotal, we returned $13.7 billion to families across the country.\n  But that was just the start.\n  Under the Jobs and Growth Act of 2003, a family of four making \n$40,000 will see their taxes reduced by $1,133 this year.\n  Of the $350 billion in tax cuts and fiscal relief, nearly $200 \nbillion, fully 60 percent, is provided this year and next.\n  Some critics of the tax cut say $1,300 is not a lot of money, that it \nwould not make much difference if the bureaucrats took it away again. \nTell that to the family working hard to raise their children, keep up \nwith household expenses, and have a something left over for a family \nvacation. I am fairly certain the United States Treasury did not get a \nflurry of child tax credit checks in the mail from families who said \nthey didn't need it.\n  Small business owners, too, got a major boost from the tax package. \nTwenty-three million small business owners who pay taxes at the \nindividual rate saw their taxes lowered. And we quadrupled the expense \ndeduction for small business investment.\n  Small business owners are the heart of the American marketplace. \nWorkers and consumers depend on the small business sector to generate \njobs, products, and services. These innovators create 60 to 80 percent \nof new jobs nationwide, and they generate more than 50 percent of the \ngross domestic product.\n  By cutting their taxes and encouraging investment, we have helped \nunleash their tremendous economic power.\n  Taken together, this year's tax cut and the tax cuts of 2001 are \nproviding an astonishing $1.7 trillion in tax relief over the next \ndecade. And we are already beginning to see the results. We are now in \nthe midst of a strong economic recovery. Consumers have more money in \ntheir pockets. And businesses are, once again, optimistic about the \ndirection of the economy.\n  Economic growth in the third quarter soared at an incredible 8.2 \npercent annual rate. This is the largest third quarter increase since \n1984.\n  Real disposable income is up 7.2 percent for the third quarter, and \nconsumer spending is up a whopping 6.6 percent, the biggest third \nquarter growth since 1988.\n  Last month, sales of previously owned homes hit their third-highest \nlevel on record. The National Association of Realtors reports that \npreviously owned home sales rose 3.6 percent to a record annual rate of \nnearly 7 million units in September. Meanwhile, housing starts are \nnearing a 17 year high.\n  The association credits this phenomenal growth to ``the powerful \nfundamentals that are driving the housing market, household growth, low \ninterest rates and an improving economy.''\n  This is great news for America's families and for America's \nbusinesses. When a family buys a home, that not only benefits the \ncommunity, it sets off a chain of purchases that fuel the economy: \nliving room furniture, kitchen appliances, washer and dryer, and on and \non. In short, many other industries benefit from the one family's \nmomentous and gratifying decision to buy a home.\n  Not only is individual consumption up, the business sector is showing \nimpressive signs of recovery, as well. Non-residential investment is up \nmore than 10 percent. Business investment went up 11.1 percent in the \nthird quarter, and productivity soared by 8.1 percent, its highest \nlevel in two decades.\n  Businesses are rebuilding their inventories and retooling their \nfactories. And all of this economic activity is ultimately leading to \nmore jobs. Indeed, the labor market appears to be stabilizing and the \neconomy is finally creating much needed jobs.\n  Over the past 3 months, 286,000 new jobs have come on line. In \nOctober alone, 126,000 jobs were added.\n  Meanwhile, since the tax cut, initial claims for unemployment \ninsurance have gone down more than 10 percent. For the seek ending \nNovember 1, unemployment claims hit a 34-month low. There is more \nprogress to be made on this front, but we are on our way towards \nputting Americans back to work.\n  And, finally, there is good news for individual State treasuries. \nTheir budget gap of nearly $20 billion at the beginning of last fiscal \nyear has now declined to a budget gap of less than $3 billion for the \nbeginning of this fiscal year. States are beginning to see ``revenue \nsurprises'' in their estimates.\n  Consumers and businesses, alike, are optimistic about the America's \neconomic direction. Inflation and interest rates are low. American \ntaxpayers have more of their hard earned money to spend and save as \nthey choose.\n  We will continue to champion policies that strengthen the economy and \ncreate jobs. We will continue to pursue fair and free trade policies \nthat increase consumer buying power and stoke the economic furnace.\n\n  This session we passed the free trade agreements with Chile and \nSingapore.\n\n[[Page S16078]]\n\nSimultaneously, export grew 9.3 percent in the third quarter, another \nmarker of our renewed economy.\n  We will continue to fulfill our mission to maximize freedom and \nexpand opportunity.\n  Which leads me to national security. Our mission to expand freedom \nand opportunity applies not just to our economy, but to our national \nsecurity, as well. Freedom cannot find its fullest expression under the \nthreat of terror. But, likewise, terror can not spread where freedom \nreigns.\n  That is why, this year, America took the extraordinary action of \ntoppling Saddam Hussein and his terrorist-sponsoring regime. In 3 short \nweeks, the men and women of the United States military, with the \nsupport of 49 nations, swept to Baghdad, ending three decades of \nruthless Ba'ath Party rule and support for terror.\n  In the months since, our soldiers have worked tirelessly, under \ndangerous conditions, to help the Iraqi people build a democracy.\n  Our soldiers have rebuilt schools, hospitals, electrical grids, \npipelines, and roads. They are training Iraqi police forces to patrol \nthe streets and hunt down terrorists. Everyday, our troops are helping \nthe people of Iraq and Afghanistan move toward becoming free and open \nsocieties.\n  To support their efforts, we passed the President's $87 billion war \nsupplemental. We did so because we recognize that investing in the \nfuture of Iraq and Afghanistan is an investment in our security. \nSeptember 11 taught us a cruel lesson. We learned that we cannot wait \nwhile storms gather. As the President has said, ``the Middle East \nregion will either become a place of progress and peace, or it will \nremain a source of violence and terror.''\n  This Senate took bold action to support the war on terror because we \nare determined that progress and peace take root.\n  The Middle East is not the only region where we are working to bring \nstability. This session, we passed the Burmese Freedom Act and the \nClean Diamond Act.\n  And we also took the historic action of dedicating $15 billion to \ndrive back the HIV/AIDS virus.\n  As a Senator, as a doctor, and as a medical missionary, I am \nespecially gratified by the Senate's demonstration of compassion on \nthis issue. Millions of lives around the world have been cut short by \nthe scourge of one tiny virus. Countries have seen entire swaths of \ntheir populations wiped out and children orphaned, because of the HIV \nvirus that causes AIDS.\n  By passing the Global HIV/AIDS bill, we help to prevent 7 million new \ninfections; provide antiretroviral drugs for 2 million HIV-infected \npeople; care for 10 million HIV-infected individuals and AIDS orphans; \nand bring hope to millions of people around the world who are living in \nthe shadow of this devastating disease.\n  Our work in passing this critical legislation demonstrates that we \nare a country that places a high value on life. History will judge how \nwe chose to respond. We can proudly say that we made the right choice \nand took the necessary actions to put an end to one of the worst \nplagues in recorded history.\n\n  We also made the right choice to end partial birth abortion. Partial \nbirth abortion is a fringe procedure. It is not taught in medical \nschools. And now, it never will be. With an overwhelming majority, we \nvoted to end an immoral procedure, and said ``yes'' to life.\n  Indeed, this Senate can be proud of our efforts to protect the most \nvulnerable among us. In January, we passed legislation to establish a \nnational AMBER Alert. Law enforcement will now have another tool to \nwork with the public to find missing children. In June, we passed \nlegislation to protect victims of child abuse. We also voted to extend \nwelfare reform to help lift families out of poverty.\n  But perhaps the most historic and far reaching legislative \naccomplishment of the 108th Senate happened this morning, when an \noverwhelming, bipartisan majority voted to enact prescription drug \ncoverage for our nation's 40 million seniors and individuals with \ndisabilities.\n  For the first time in its 40-year history, Medicare will offer true, \ncomprehensive health care coverage. This worthy program will finally be \nable to keep pace with modern medicine.\n  I am deeply thankful for the cooperation, hard work and dedication of \nmy colleagues to overcome years of partisan gridlock and finally offer \nAmerica's seniors the security they need and the choices they deserve.\n  Medicare reform, the Jobs and Growth tax cuts, the Iraqi war \nsupplemental, the global HIV bill--we set our sights high and we more \nthan exceeded expectations.\n  We are moving America forward, and we will continue to do so in the \ncoming months. There is much yet to be done.\n  Critically, we must pass the energy bill. We have been debating \nnational energy for three years. During the last Congress, we spent a \ntotal of 7 weeks debating energy on the Senate floor. In this Congress, \nwe spent more time debating energy than any other bill. And yet, \ndespite all of this, a few in the Senate continue to obstruct progress. \nAnd while they insist on more debate, natural gas prices continue to \nrise.\n  U.S. chemical companies are closing plants, laying off workers, and \nlooking to expand production abroad. The U.S. is expected to import \napproximately $9 billion more in chemicals than it exports this year. \nAmerican consumers are getting hit with higher electric bills, and \nsmall businesses are struggling to contain costs. All because of rising \nenergy prices. We must pass the energy plan.\n  Not only will it lower prices, it will save jobs and create thousands \nmore. It is estimated that this energy package will create at least \nhalf of a million jobs. The Alaskan pipeline alone will create at least \n400,000. The hundreds of millions of dollars that will be invested in \nresearch and development of new technologies will not only benefit the \nenvironment, but will create new jobs in engineering, math, chemistry, \nphysics, and science.\n  We cannot allow the obstruction of a few in the Senate continue to \nharm the interests of millions of Americans. And I use the word \n``obstruction,'' because we have seen it used to an alarming degree in \nthis Congress, nowhere more so than in the consideration of the \nPresident's judicial nominees.\n  Only 2 weeks ago, we had an historic, around the clock, 40 hour \ndebate. And after 40 full hours of debate, the minority continued to \nblock an up or down vote. This is partisan obstruction pure and simple. \nA minority of Senators is denying all 100 our Constitutional duty to \nadvise and consent.\n\n  When we return in January, we will continue to press this issue. \nNothing less than the United States Constitution is at stake.\n  We will also continue to press for policies that expand and \nstrengthen our economy. This session, we passed smart, pro-growth \nfiscal policy. We are already beginning to see the results. But there \nis still much to do.\n  Frivolous lawsuits are clogging the State courts, wasting taxpayer \ndollars, and inhibiting the innovation and entrepreneurship so critical \nto creating jobs. When it comes to medical malpractice, frivolous \nlawsuits are destroying access to quality health care and, literally, \nimperiling lives.\n  America is country that values fairness, and we will return fairness \nto the litigation process.\n  We will also work to return fairness to the tax system. We will \ncontinue to press for reforms that simplify the tax code. Tax payers \nshouldn't have to hire a consultant to file a tax return.\n  We will also begin the exciting work of constructing the long awaited \nNational Museum for African American History and Culture. America will \nfinally have a museum worthy of America's sons and daughters who \nsacrificed so much and have given so profoundly.\n  There is much more to do in the year ahead, and I will speak to that \nwhen we resume in January.\n  Each day I walk into this great institution, I am humbled and \ninspired, humbled by the great men and women who have come before, and \ninspired by their example.\n  In his 1862 address to Congress, President Lincoln told the assembled \nlegislators that America is the world's last, best hope. Those words \nhave never been more true than they are today. I am confident that we \nwill face the challenges ahead with honor and courage, for the simple \nreason that we are Americans.\n\n[[Page S16079]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/11/25/senate-section/article/S16079-1", "month": "11", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
