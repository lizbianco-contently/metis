I think the work \ndone yesterday on the FAA bill was exemplary. The managers of the bill, \nthe chairman and ranking member, Senator McCain and Senator Hollings, \nshowed their maturity. They worked through these amendments. When there \nwas a debate that was necessary, they had one. When votes were \nnecessary, they had votes. There were no unnecessary votes yesterday. \nThey were aided by the two subcommittee chairs, Senator Rockefeller and \nSenator Lott.\n\n  I thought yesterday was really a good day for the Senate. The FAA \nreauthorization was one of the most important bills we could do. There \nare things in that bill that will help every part of our country. The \nconferees have already been appointed. They can go to conference as \nearly as next week and come back with a bill very soon.\n  Again, I say that it is more press worthy to focus on things that go\n\n[[Page S7866]]\n\nwrong and not very press worthy to focus on things that go right, but \nit is a testament to what the Senate can do with the work we did \nyesterday on this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/13/senate-section/article/S7866-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I will take a few minutes to comment on \nsome events that occurred over the last couple of days that were not \nnecessarily apparent to a lot of people, either in Washington, DC, or \naround the country. It has to do with a visit from somebody everybody \nrecognizes, and that is Bruce Willis.\n  Mr. Willis came to our Nation's Capitol a couple of days ago to \nspotlight the issue of foster care reform. This is the first time I had \nthe opportunity to speak with him on this particular issue. He is \nclearly a long-time advocate for children in foster care and has \ndedicated a huge amount of time to bring attention to the problem of \nchildren who are aging out of the system.\n  I take this opportunity to thank Mr. Willis for his efforts and to \ntake a moment to underscore the importance of the issue he came to \nshare with us, and that is foster care reform.\n  Thousands of children are cared for by loving families in our foster \ncare system, and we owe these families a debt of gratitude for opening \ntheir lives, their homes, and indeed their hearts to these children. \nBecause of their generosity, many foster children do become adopted and \nexperience that gift of a warm and a loving family.\n  But too many children--and Mr. Willis made crystal clear based on his \nexperiences and the information he has gathered--end up being bounced \nfrom place to place, never having that opportunity to have four walls \nand what can be called a home, or even really one person they can turn \nto and call family.\n  Imagine spending your entire childhood as a virtual orphan: No one to \ncome to your high school graduation, no one to keep your picture in \ntheir wallet. Most of us do take for granted having a family, but for \nmany children in America childhood is the time they spend waiting in \nvain for someone to call mom or dad.\n  Even worse, some foster children end up in situations where they \nexperience severe mental and physical abuse. Many develop health \nproblems and suffer emotional and even physical neglect.\n  It is my hope that through our efforts in this legislative body, \nthrough the efforts of the National Adoption Center and other groups \nsuch as Children in Foster Care, by public awareness campaigns such as \nNational Adoption Day, through PSAs featuring well-known figures and \nthe participation of people whom everybody recognizes, such as Mr. \nWillis, America's foster children will get what they need most, and \nthat is a family. I applaud my colleagues for their efforts on behalf \nof America's foster children.\n  A few minutes ago, I was listening to Larry Craig. He has been one of \nthe Senate's leading voices on this whole issue of adoption and foster \ncare. In 2001, he cosponsored the Hope For Children Act as part of the \nEconomic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act which we just passed \nand which has become the law of the land.\n  Others, such as Senator Jim Bunning, the distinguished Senator from \nKentucky, worked to pass a bill to exclude foster care payments from \ntaxation. Other Senators, including Senators Hutchison, Landrieu, \nRockefeller, and Clinton, have all worked to improve foster care and \nadoption issues. America's foster children are helped immeasurably by \ntheir efforts.\n  As we debate the big issues, the bold issues, the issues that make \nthe headlines--the Medicare modernization, the addition of prescription \ndrugs to give seniors health care security, to give them greater \nchoice, to have plans that better meet their needs--as we debate the \nimportant issues, such as energy this week and FAA reauthorization and \ntax credits, we should not forget to protect our most vulnerable \ncitizens. Truly, America's foster children are depending on us to look \nout for them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/13/senate-section/article/S7866-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          HAPPY BIRTHDAY PRESIDENT GEORGE HERBERT WALKER BUSH\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

HEWITT PATE, OF VIRGINIA, TO BE AN ASSISTANT ATTORNEY \n                                GENERAL\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the hour of 10 \na.m. having arrived, the Senate will proceed to executive session to \nconsider the nomination of R. Hewitt Pate, of Virginia, to be an \nAssistant Attorney General.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of R. Hewitt Pate, of \nVirginia, to be an Assistant Attorney General.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask my fellow Senators to vote for R. \nHewitt Pate to be Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division \nof the United States Department of Justice. I rise today to share with \nmy colleagues my views, familiarity and admiration for R. Hewitt Pate.\n  We all know, and the Presiding Officer recognizes, how important our \nantitrust laws are and their beneficial influence in making sure we \nhave competition in our free market society. Competition is absolutely \nessential because it forces us to always be innovative to ensure a good \nmarket share for whatever the product or service. Our antitrust laws \nare vital for free competition in our society and in our economy.\n  Mr. Pate, as Assistant Attorney General in the Antitrust Division of \nthe Justice Department, will be one of the key leaders, if not the key \nleader, in making sure that monopolistic or anti-competitive practices \ndo not occur in this country. I can confidently say Mr. Pate is very \nwell qualified to decide antitrust matters effectively. He will lead \nwith impartiality, dignity and fairness in this important position.\n  When I was Governor of Virginia, I appointed Mr. Pate to the Virginia \nCommission of Higher Education and the Governor's Commission on Self-\nDetermination and Federalism.\n  I have known Hew Pate since he was at the University of Virginia. I \nwas a relatively young delegate at the time, representing Mr. \nJefferson's seat in Albemarle and Nelson Counties, which surround the \nUniversity of Virginia. Ever since those years, Hew Pate has constantly \namazed me. Even then, as a very young man at the University of Virginia \nSchool of Law, he was always very conscientious and knowledgeable, and \nhe has been a very good friend and ally ever since.\n  Hew Pate graduated first in his class from the University of Virginia \nLaw School in 1987 and went on to clerk for Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson \non the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. In addition, Mr. Pate clerked \nfor both Justice Louis Powell and Justice Anthony\n\n[[Page S7867]]\n\nKennedy on the United States Supreme Court.\n  After these impressive clerkships, Mr. Pate went on to practice \nantitrust law for 10 years at Hunton & Williams, which is one of \nVirginia's largest and most highly respected law firms. Hew Pate also \ntaught competition law at the University of Virginia.\n  Since 2001, Mr. Pate has performed with distinction, handling several \nsignificant matters in a scholarly, reasoned, and admirable manner for \nthe Department of Justice's Antitrust Division. Since November 2002, \nHew Pate has been the Acting Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust. \nIn fact, on a case affecting a major company in the Commonwealth of \nVirginia, my good colleague Senator Warner and I were on one side \nadvocating a certain result, and Mr. Pate was on the other side. Mr. \nPate briefed us on how our views were not necessarily in accordance \nwith the views of the Department of Justice, but he did it in a very \ncareful, considerate, and well-reasoned way. Afterward, we did not have \nany reason to appeal because the conclusion was so well briefed and \nresearched.\n  It is my sincere pleasure to highly recommend this exceptional \nnominee and outstanding Virginian this morning.\n  I respectfully urge all my colleagues to support the confirmation of \nR. Hewitt Pate to this important position in the Department of Justice. \nI think he will be an outstanding Assistant Attorney General, leading \nthe Antitrust Division.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, we confirm R. Hewitt Pate to be \nAssistant Attorney General of the Antitrust Division at the Department \nof Justice. The Antitrust Division is charged with a critically \nimportant role in protecting our nation's consumers and their markets, \nand I look forward to Mr. Pate fulfilling that role with diligence and \ndistinction.\n  As the boundaries of our marketplaces are expanding ever outward, \nmany of the competitive issues that were once only local have become \nregional, national, or even global in their impact. That global economy \nis also increasingly dominated by high tech and information industries. \nIn those arenas, technological change and innovation are taking place \nat dizzying speed, and we are seeing new and creative products and \nservices developed every day. Fair and efficient policing of corporate \nbehavior in those swiftly evolving markets is particularly important to \nensure that the early entrants do not preclude competition from later \nrivals, and that a rapid accumulation of market power cannot be used to \nharm consumers.\n  Another hallmark of antitrust problems arising in recent years has \nbeen the increasing number of situations in which suppliers and \ndistributors join forces, possibly to the detriment of consumers. Many \nof us are accustomed to thinking of antitrust enforcement as focused on \nmergers of competitors, but as more and more vertical arrangements are \nentered into, we must be aware--and be wary--of such deals. While in \nsome cases they may permit consumers a greater range of choice than \nthey would otherwise enjoy, they can also facilitate grievously \nanticompetitive behavior. As we all move more and more of our \nacquisition of information, of goods, and of services, to the Internet, \nthe online businesses and markets will need the scrutiny of the \nAntitrust Division to help guarantee that those marketplaces provide \ndigital-age consumers with the quality and quantity of offerings that \nhave long been the promise of the Internet.\n  As Mr. Pate confronts these issues, with the help of the many \nseasoned career lawyers and economists in the Antitrust Division, I am \nconfident that he will be able to protect and promote the competitive \nhealth of the American economy. We all stand to benefit if he does his \njob well. I stand by ready to help him ensure that consumers and \nproducers alike enjoy the benefits of a properly functioning \nmarketplace.\n  Mr. KOHL. I rise today in support of the confirmation of Hew Pate to \nthe important post of Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust. I am \nconfident that Mr. Pate's talents and dedication will serve the Justice \nDepartment and the American people very well in this vital position.\n  The responsibilities of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division \nhave never been more important. In our challenging economic times, we \nall depend on the dynamism of competition to provide economic growth \nand jobs necessary to propel our economy forward. And I am convinced \nthat only the aggressive enforcement of our Nation's antitrust laws--\nour fundamental charter of economic liberty proven for over 110 years--\nwill ensure that competition will flourish and ensure that consumers \nwill obtain the highest quality products and services at the lowest \npossible prices. The Antitrust Division must be a vigilant watchdog to \nensure that the antitrust laws are properly enforced to prevent \ncompanies from stifling competition and harming consumers.\n  Moreover, Mr. Pate will assume his post at a time when the Antitrust \nDivision will have to serve as our last line of defense against \nexcessive media consolidation. Now that the FCC has substantially \nrelaxed media ownership restrictions, many expect a new wave of media \nmergers and acquisitions. These acquisitions will come before the \nJustice Department for review. We will expect that Mr. Pate will be \ncareful to review these transactions to ensure that they do not unduly \ndiminish competition in the marketplace of ideas nor unduly harm the \ndiversity of news and information so essential to our democracy.\n  It is essential, then, that the next head of the Antitrust Division \nbe committed to the Justice Department's tradition of vigorous \nantitrust enforcement. The performance of the Antitrust Division over \nthe last 2 years under Mr. Pate's predecessor's leadership gave me \nconsiderable cause for concern. From the defects in the Microsoft \nsettlement--which many believe was unnecessarily weak and riddled with \nloopholes--to the general decline in the division's enforcement \nactivities, we were left to wonder if the division was truly committed \nto its crucial mission of protecting competition. We will expect the \nnext Antitrust Division Chief to return to the tradition of strong and \nenergetic antitrust enforcement.\n  I believe that Mr. Pate is well qualified to restore our confidence \nand lead the Antitrust Division in the years ahead. He has compiled an \nimpressive record of achievement at a relatively young age as an \nattorney in private practice, and we have heard a great deal of praise \nfor his talents and legal acumen. Since joining the Justice Department \nas a Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Antitrust Division more \nthan 2 years ago, Mr. Pate has proven to be an effective enforcer of \nour Nation's antitrust laws. As a Deputy, he was responsible for many \nof the division's most important matters, including its successful \nchallenge last year to the Echostar/DirectTV merger in the satellite \ntelevision industry. And I have been particularly impressed with his \ndedication and hard work since he assumed the leadership of the \nAntitrust Division on an acting basis last fall.\n  My favorable impression of Mr. Pate has been enhanced by my own \ndealings with the nominee. He demonstrated his knowledge and expertise \nin antitrust law at our confirmation hearing several weeks ago. And I \nwas particularly pleased with his forthrightness and candor in our \nprivate meeting in advance of the hearing, where he impressed me with \nthe sincerity and seriousness with which he would take his new \nresponsibilities.\n  I will therefore vote in favor of confirming Mr. Pate. I will look \nforward to working with Mr. Pate in the months and years ahead.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of R. Hewitt Pate's \nnomination for Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division.\n  I would note that Mr. Pate's nomination was unanimously approved by \nthe Judiciary Committee. I fully expect that the Senate will follow \nsuit and quickly approve his nomination to this important position.\n  Over the last decade, the position of the Assistant Attorney General \nfor Antitrust has grown in importance. The rapid transformation of our \ncountry's economy, particularly in new technologies and international \nmarkets, has raised public attention and policy focus on a variety of \nimportant antitrust issues. The Assistant Attorney General plays a \ncrucial role in formulating competition policy and enforcing existing \nantitrust laws to make\n\n[[Page S7868]]\n\nsure that our free-market economy operates efficiently and serves the \npublic.\n  Mr. Pate comes before the United States Senate with an impressive \ntrack record of public service in the Antitrust Division. In June 2001, \nhe was appointed as the Deputy Assistant Attorney General responsible \nfor Regulatory Matters, and served ably under then Assistant Attorney \nGeneral Charles James. In November 2002, after Mr. James' departure, \nMr. Pate was appointed as Acting Assistant Attorney general for the \nAntitrust Division. During that time, he has demonstrated his talent \nand ability to lead the Antitrust Division.\n  Prior to joining the Justice Department in 2001, Mr. Pate practiced \nat the distinguished law firm of Hunton & Williams in Richmond, \nVirginia, where he had a distinguished record in representing both \nplaintiffs and defendants in a variety of antitrust and business law \ncases. After graduating first in his class at the University of \nVirginia Law School in 1987, Mr. Pate went on to clerk for the \nhonorable J. Harvie Wilkinson, at the United States Court of Appeals \nfor the Fourth Circuit, Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell, and Supreme \nCourt Justice Anthony Kennedy. During his tenure at the firm of Hunton \n& Williams, Mr. Pate found time to teach at the University of Richmond \nand University of Virginia Law Schools.\n  With such an impressive background, both in private practice and in \nantitrust enforcement, particularly given his proven track record, I am \nconfident that Mr. Pate will be an excellent Assistant Attorney General \nfor the Antitrust Division. I am hopeful that this Senate will act \nquickly to confirm Mr. Pate's nomination.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof R.

Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the attention \nof the Senate the oppression of democracy and freedom underway in \nZimbabwe. A number of my colleagues, including the Senators from \nArizona and Kentucky, have led this body in discussions about \noppression in Burma. I share their concerns.\n  But as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on African \nAffairs, I would be remiss not to note a struggle in Zimbabwe that \nbears at least some similarity to events in Burma. As in Burma, the \nleader of the democratic opposition in Zimbabwe has been imprisoned by \nan illegitimate government in a cruel attempt to maintain power.\n  The so-called ``President'' of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, has engaged \nin a systematic campaign of intimidation, torture, and terror to \noppress opposition to his rule over Zimbabwe. Since the elections of \n2000, when Mugabe's ruling party rigged the elections in its favor and \nterrorized voters for the opposition, Zimbabwe has been thrown into a \ndownward spiral. Youth brigades not unlike the Hitler Youth or Chinese \nRed Guard roam the streets and invoke terror on those who resist \nMugabe's rule. The country's infrastructure, which was fairly good \nprior to this time, has deteriorated rapidly.\n  In the last week the situation has grown worse. A little over 1 week \nago, for the second time this year, the people of Zimbabwe stood up and \nsaid enough is enough. Strikes and work stoppages occurred throughout \nthe country as many citizens engaged in a massive protest of Mugabe's \nillegitimate regime. Many rightly blame Mugabe not only for political \nturmoil, but also economic decay, led by fuel and food shortages.\n\n[[Page S7869]]\n\n  The government's response was swift and brutal. Armed troops \ndescended upon neighborhoods where opposition members lived and \nviolently beat those suspected of opposing Mugabe. More than 800 \nindividuals were arrested, many of them tortured. According to the most \nrecent reports I have seen, about 150 individuals have now been \nreleased, but only after paying an ``admission of guilt'' penalty of \n$3,000 to $5,000. In order to get out of jail, you have to admit your \nguilt and pay a huge fine.\n  Here is Mugabe's justification. He is quoted as saying, ``The actions \nare blatantly illegal in that they are aimed at an unconstitutional \nremoval of the country's head of state.'' He is essentially saying that \nby protesting his rule, protestors are committing a crime. And he is \narresting and torturing them as a result. The only crime being \ncommitted is the continued rule of Robert Mugabe.\n  Just prior to the first crackdown in March, which followed a similar \nprotest and work stoppage, Mugabe said, and I am quoting, ``I am still \nthe Hitler of the time.'' Let me say that again. He said, ``I am still \nthe Hitler of the time.'' He purposely chose to compare himself to \nAdolph Hitler, perhaps the most evil leader in the entire 20th century. \nAfter that announcement in March, military forces loyal to Mugabe burst \ninto people's homes in pre-dawn raids, raping and beating those \nsuspected of supporting the Movement for Democratic Change, Zimbabwe's \nopposition party. Torture tactics included rape, electrocution, forced \nconsumption of chemicals and urine, cigarette burning, whipping with \nsteel cable, barbed wire and sustained beatings.\n  What makes these events truly tragic is that prior to Mugabe's \nactions, Zimbabwe was not a dilapidated country ready to collapse. On \nthe contrary, it was a leading African nation with a strong economy and \ninfrastructure. Zimbabwe's roads were among the best in Africa, and its \nagricultural sector was a major exporter. As an example of the rapid \ndecline Zimbabwe faces, their GDP has shrunk from $9.3 billion in 2001 \nto only $5.4 billion today. It has been cut nearly in half in only 2 \nyears.\n  The latest news reports from Zimbabwe show that Mugabe is now \nactively imprisoning and torturing leaders of the opposition party, the \nMovement for Democratic Change or MDC. Morgan Tsvangirai, the leader of \nthe MDC, is in prison and charged with treason as are hundreds of party \nactivists. Tsvangirai lost last year's rigged Presidential elections, \nand has begun legal proceedings against Mugabe because the elections \nwere not conducted properly. I can only hope that Tsvangirai and the \nMDC survive Mugabe's violent rampage against them.\n  The White House and the State Department have responded to this \ncrisis, and I hope will continue to work to achieve a change of \nleadership in Zimbabwe. President Bush recently imposed sanctions on \nthe Mugabe government. The sanctions, which began on March 7, prohibit \nany U.S. corporation from making business deals with Zimbabwe and also \nfreeze any assets top Zimbabwean officials in the Mugabe government may \nhave in U.S. banking institutions. The State Department has condemned \nMugabe's actions, and taken other appropriate diplomatic action.\n  The people of Zimbabwe deserve better. They deserve better than a \nregime that commits violence on its own people. They deserve better \nthan to see their economic infrastructure destroyed by a dictator-on-\nthe-rampage. And they are standing up for themselves by actively \ndemonstrating against this terrible regime. I hope other countries in \nthe region will join with the United States and others in opposing this \nbrutal regime in the hope of bringing new, democratic leadership to \npower in Zimbabwe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/13/senate-section/article/S7869-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7869-S7870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO SENATOR KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to say some \nwords in tribute to the senior Senator from Texas, one who this week \nmarks her tenth anniversary as a Member of this august body, Senator \nKay Bailey Hutchison.\n  Senator Hutchison is a wonderful spouse to her husband, Ray; a \nwonderful mother to her children, Bailey and Houston; an excellent \nSenator; and a great Texan. I am enormously grateful to be able to work \nalongside of a woman of her vision, a woman of her energy, and someone \nwho represents the very best of the State of Texas.\n  After 10 years in the Senate, Senator Hutchison has shown herself to \nbe a great leader in so many different ways. She has devoted herself to \nour national security. She has dedicated herself to preserving our \nhomeland security. She has energetically sought legislation that will \ncreate jobs and greater opportunities for all Americans. She has worked \nhard to improve health care, not just for people in our State, the \nState of Texas, but for all Americans.\n  All of us came here from our various States to serve those States, \nbut we also came here to serve this great Nation. Senator Hutchison \ncame here, in addition, to make a difference, to work to find solutions \nto the complex problems of modern society, to attain real and lasting \nchange for the good. She has succeeded in brilliant fashion.\n  President Ronald Reagan once said:\n\n       We have been blessed with the opportunity to stand for \n     something, for liberty and freedom and fairness, and these \n     are things worth fighting for, worth devoting our lives to.\n\n  Senator Hutchison has devoted her life to these very values. Her life \nserves as an example to us all, a life of patriotism, responsibility, \ndedication, and abundant friendship. She has been a leader in Texas and \nhere in the Senate. It is lives like Senator Hutchison's that make me \nproud to say I am from the great State of Texas, and prouder still to \ncall her my friend.\n  Senator Hutchison, over these last 10 years in the Senate, has made \nTexas proud as she works hard for all Americans as a woman of great \nvalor. I thank Senator Hutchison for her leadership, for her counsel, \nand for her steadfast service to the great State of Texas and to the \nUnited States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I commend my colleague, Senator Cornyn, \nfor his remarks. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison has distinguished herself \nover these 10 years. It is very appropriate that her junior colleague \nbring that to the attention of the Senate. She is a Senator from our \nsecond largest State. She has been a pioneer in women's rights and \nadvancement by women. When she began her career, as was true for our \ncolleague from North Carolina, Senator Dole, not many legal jobs were \navailable to women, much less positions in the Senate.\n  She has achieved a lot. She is part of our leadership, and I am glad \nI was here to hear Senator Cornyn's remarks.\n  I hope both Senators will permit me to comment on the fact that some \nof the best things in Texas come from Tennessee. A lot of Tennesseans \nwent to Texas in the 1830s. One of Senator Hutchison's ancestors was \nGovernor Hall, of Tennessee, just as Sam Houston was Governor of \nTennessee before he was Governor and Senator from Texas. So Tennesseans \ntake special pride in 10 years of service by someone we consider, if \nnot our daughter, at least our cousin.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I thank my desk mate and member of the \nfreshman class of 2002 in the Senate, Lamar Alexander, for his comments \nand his friendship and his great service, not only on behalf of \nTennessee but on behalf of the Nation. He did make a very appropriate \nobservation about the connection between the people of the State of \nTennessee and Texas. Some have said many of the people who populated \nTexas were evading their creditors in Tennessee, which is one reason \nfor their going to Texas in the first place, where they believed there \nwould be great opportunity. With a land the size of Texas, with the \nopportunity to till the soil and take risks and perhaps reap the \nrewards of that risk, many people came from all over the United \nStates--indeed, the world--to Texas.\n  One great Tennessean--and I want to just make this comment while \nSenator Alexander is here--with whom I am proud to connect myself is \nSam Houston, who was a distinguished figure in Tennessee before he came \nto Texas, then served as Governor, President of the Republic, and whose \nseat in the\n\n[[Page S7870]]\n\nU.S. Senate I now hold. When Texas was annexed to the United States of \nAmerica in 1845, Thomas Jefferson Rusk, a former member of the Texas \nSupreme Court at that time, and Sam Houston, came to Washington to \nrepresent the State of Texas.\n  So I am proud to have that connection, another connection with the \ngood people of Tennessee and with my friend Lamar Alexander, and to be \nconnected through that lineage to that seat originally held by a great \nTennessean, and we claim him as a great Texan, a great American still, \nSam Houston.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, is the Senate in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is in morning business.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak out of \norder for such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/13/senate-section/article/S7870-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SALLY GOFFINET\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Sally Goffinet is an unsung hero. Like many \nthousands of Senate staffers, her name is not widely known. There are \nno news accounts of her 31 years of service to her country. Her quiet \nprofessionalism will never be the subject of wide acclaim. But she is a \nstar of the Senate family. Sally is one of the thousands of people \nstretching back over the history of our Republic to whom the Senate \nowes a very great debt.\n  Sally Goffinet was hired in 1972 by one of the greatest \nParliamentarians ever to serve the Senate, the late Dr. Floyd Riddick. \nSally was the first woman ever to be assigned to that office. She \ncontinued to serve the Parliamentarian's office until the spring of \nthis year, at which time she retired. Sally has worked for every \nParliamentarian since the office was established, except for the very \nfirst Senate Parliamentarian, Mr. Charles Watkins. Charles Watkins was \nthe Parliamentarian when I came to the Senate 45 years ago.\n  Sally graduated from college with a BA in history. So her interest in \nthe Senate came naturally.\n  Can you imagine the institutional knowledge and the institutional \nmemory she possesses? She possesses something there.\n  When I say that, I mean an institutional memory. And not every \nSenator has that, an institutional memory. It is acquired after one is \nhere a great while, normally. But it is not normally that every Senator \nacquires an institutional memory.\n  Why is that? One has to be interested. A Senator must be interested \nin the Senate as an institution, its history, its customs, its \nfolklore, its rules, and its precedents. Then one will have an \ninstitutional memory.\n  The institution means something. The institution is always at the \ncenter of a Senator's public life, if he or she has an institutional \nmemory.\n  Can you imagine the institutional memory that Sally possesses? When \none works alongside so many Parliamentarians, one acquires a deep, deep \nexposure to Senate rules and precedents. Senate rules and precedents--\nhow important are they?\n  Thomas Jefferson in his manual, ``Jefferson's Manual,'' spoke of \nSpeaker Onslow.\n  I watched television when it was good. There is a good show on most \nSaturday nights. I get it on Channel 22 in McLean, or I get it on 26 \nover in McLean. On some evenings, this particular picture, or show, \nwill be on both--possibly on 22 at a given time and a half hour later \non Channel 26. This picture is British. Ah, what actors they are. We \nhave few Americans, in my judgment, who are real, honest-to-goodness \nactors. They are conscious of the fact that they are acting in that \nshow. It comes out at you when you watch it, but not with the British. \nThey just act in a very natural way, and speak--what great English, \nwhat grammar. The British have it all over us, for the most part.\n  On Saturday nights, my wife Erma and I watch ``Keeping Up \nAppearances.'' It is good, clean comedy. So tune in on ``Keeping Up \nAppearances.''\n  As I talk about Sally, she has seen Members come and go. She has \nacquired an institutional memory. And such long service in such a \nposition imparts almost a sixth sense about the Senate and about its \nunique role in our constitutional system.\n\n  And as I was about to say, Thomas Jefferson spoke of the Speaker of \nthe British Parliament when he spoke of Mr. Onslow. The reason I got \noff on this other part about the Saturday evening TV is because there \nis a person in this comedy show whose name is Onslow. When Jefferson \nspoke of Onslow, he was speaking of a different Onslow. He was talking \nof the Speaker of the House of Commons, who said--and Jefferson said it \nalso--that it is more important that there be a rule than what the \nactual rule says. And he makes a very good point in saying that it is \nmore important that there be a rule than what the rule actually says. \nBecause if there is a rule, there will be order, and a minority will be \nheard. If there is a rule, there will be order.\n  And so we are talking now about the Parliamentarians. The Senate has \nnot always had a Parliamentarians. But Charlie Watkins was the \nParliamentarian when I came. That is a long time ago as we measure \nservice in the Senate.\n  So Sally acquired that deep exposure, that I referred to, to the \nSenate rules and precedents. And one who is in such a position \nnaturally witnesses the Senate's dynamic change as events occur. \nHistory progresses and Members come and go. Such long service in such a \nposition imparts, as I say, almost a sixth sense about the Senate and \nabout its unique role in our constitutional system. Such an individual \nreally can never be replaced.\n  Today, when so many Members and staffers in our Senate family do not \nstay very long, I often wonder how we will fare in keeping that sense \nof the institution alive in future years, that institutional pride, \npride in being a Member, an individual who has been selected by the \nconstituents of that particular State, who have gone to the voting \nbooths and cast their votes for a particular individual to serve in \nthis great institution. We must find a way because, year by year, an \nunderstanding of the Senate's ultimate role and purpose is slipping \naway.\n  We have these pages on the Republican side and the Democratic side, \nand they are wholesome, fine young people. I talk with every new class \nthat comes in. I get acquainted with them. I talk with them. I tell \nthem stories. I tell them, for example, the story written by that great \nauthor, Tolstoy, ``How Much Land Does a Man Need?''\n  I have not talked to this new group yet, but probably the first story \nI will tell them will be ``How Much Land Does a Man Need'' by Tolstoy. \nThen I may tell them that story that great Chataquan speaker told 5,000 \ntimes. Russel Conwell, that great Chataquan speaker, told the story \n``Acres of Diamonds.'' He said he had told that story 5,000 times. \nWell, I am going to tell that story to the pages also.\n  These are great stories, and I look forward to talking with them. In \nthis way, I help to preserve an understanding of what the Senate is all \nabout. We talk about that. We talk about politics and about the Senate \nso that these young people, when they leave here, will go out and they \nwill spread the word also.\n  Individuals like Sally Goffinet have helped to keep us true to our \ncourse. And, today, I thank Sally for her long years of service, her \npleasant and professional demeanor, which I will miss, and her wisdom, \nborn of long experience and deep appreciation for the special place \nwhich is the United States Senate.\n  I send my best to her husband of 31 years, Joe Goffinet, and to her \ndaughter, Sarah. Joe is a special education teacher. Sarah is a \ngraduate of Bowdoin College in Maine, and she is presently working at \nthe Corcoran Gallery of Art. So the Senate's loss is their gain.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/13/senate-section/article/S7871-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S7871]]\n                                FLAG DAY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, the next subject I want to talk about today--and may \nI say to any other Senator who wishes to have the floor, I will be glad \nto give it up at any time. So I do not want to hog the floor, if I may \nuse that word, ``hog.''\n  Tomorrow is Flag Day.\n  Now, from time to time, I speak on events such as Flag Day, these \nnational holidays--Independence Day, Father's Day, Mother's Day, \nColumbus Day, and so on. When I first came to the Congress, now over a \nhalf century ago, there were Senators and there were Members of the \nHouse who spoke on these subjects. I do not see much of that anymore. \nSo I try to preserve that way of Senate tradition, talking about these \ndays every year as they come along. It enables us to be still and know \nand to remember the things that are our heritage, the things that made \nAmerica great. We hear a lot about family values, and so I speak on \nMother's Day about our mothers, I speak in advance of Father's Day--as \nI will a little later this morning--about Father's Day, to preserve \nthis heritage.\n  Mr. President, since 1885, Americans have observed Flag Day on June \n14. In 1949, President Truman signed an Act of Congress designating \nJune 14 of each year as National Flag Day. That day, June 14, which \nthis year falls on Saturday, was chosen because it was on June 14, \n1777, that the Continental Congress adopted the Flag Act establishing \nan official flag for the new Nation.\n  The first Flag Act was a model of brevity. Here is what it said in \nits entirety:\n\n       Resolved, That the Flag of the United States be made of \n     thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the Union be \n     thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new \n     Constellation.\n\n  As many Senators may remember from their schooldays, in the early \nyears of the Nation there were a number of different variations of the \nflag including, of course, the one consisting of a circle of 13 stars \nthat was attributed in our schoolbooks to Betsy Ross.\n  As the Nation grew, however, changes were made to the flag. Each \nchange was authorized by an Act of Congress or, in later years, by an \nExecutive order of the President.\n  In 1818, Congress provided for a flag of 13 stripes, 1 for each of \nthe original 13 Colonies, and 1 star for each State to be added to the \nflag on the Fourth of July following the admission of each new State to \nthe Union.\n  The most recent change was made by Executive order of President \nEisenhower on August 21, 1959. His order provided for the arrangement \nof the stars in 9 rows of stars staggered horizontally and 11 rows of \nstars staggered vertically. That is the flag that flies over this \nCapitol Building today, and that is the flag that stands majestically \nas it does beside the desk of the President of the Senate, to the right \nof the Presiding Officer.\n  Today that Presiding Officer is from the State of Tennessee, and he \npresides over the Senate with great dignity and aplomb.\n  While we are on that subject, people all over the country watch the \nUnited States Senate, which is the premier upper legislative body in \nthe world today. Aren't you proud that you serve in this body? Always \nkeep in mind that the world is watching. It is watching that Presiding \nOfficer, how he or she presides, and that is why I try to suggest to \nnew Members that they preside in a way that lets the world know that \nhere is truly the greatest body of all.\n  I suggest they not read mail, they not read newspapers while they are \npresiding; that they give their full attention to the Senate, to the \nChamber, to the individual Senator who is speaking. Members of State \nlegislatures watch this Presiding Officer, believing that here is the \nbest, and we have to be conscious of that when we preside. We should \nbe. Professors, students, coal miners, housewives--people in every walk \nof life--watch that desk.\n  There used to be a telephone at that desk. When I became majority \nleader, I took it out. I believe I was majority leader at that time, or \nperhaps majority whip. But I took that telephone out so the Senators \nwould not sit at that desk and be talking on the telephone while they \nwere presiding. A few of them did that, so I just moved out the \ntelephone.\n  So there is the flag right there by the Presiding Officer. We see it \nevery day when we address the Chair. That is the flag, as I say, that \nflies over the Capitol Building today.\n  This very abridged, short history now of the flag does not, of \ncourse, do justice to the emotions that we all feel as we look at that \nflag. Imagine the excitement in each new State as a new flag is \nunfurled for the first time with its new constellation of stars. \nImagine the excitement in the State of Alaska when that new flag was \nunfurled. Imagine the excitement in the State of Hawaii in 1959, when I \nfirst came to the Senate--there was a new star in that constellation. \nImagine the excitement in Hawaii as the people saw that flag with the \nnew star. West Virginia was the 35th star on the flag.\n  We have but to think of the explorers who have carried the American \nflag to the ends of the Earth and into space. We have but to look at \nthe classic photograph of the American flag being erected at Iwo Jima \nto share in the determination and triumph of that moment. And in the \nwake of September 11, 2001, who was not touched to the core by the \nsight of all the American flags that sprang up defiantly, as it were, \nacross the Nation immediately after that attack, showing our sympathy, \nour resolve.\n  There is no doubting the love and the sorrow when you catch a tear \ncreeping down the face of a man in uniform as taps is played and \nanother flag is carefully and ceremoniously folded from atop the coffin \nand preserved for a grieving widow.\n  Mr. President, our flag is our Nation's greatest symbol, the icon by \nwhich we are recognized around the world. Old Glory--there is nothing, \nnothing, that can match it is our flag. That is the way we feel about \nit. It has withstood war. It has withstood assaults upon its fabric. \nBut no assault has yet bested the fabric of this Nation or the ideals \nupon which the Nation was founded.\n  I firmly believe that if we hold true to our Constitution--here it \nis; I hold it in my hand, the Constitution of the United States--our \nflag will never fail, and this great constellation of stars and States \nwill shine on through ages to come.\n  So I close with one of my favorite poems by Henry Holcomb Bennett, \nentitled ``The Flag Goes By.''\n\n       Hats off.\n       Along the street there comes\n       A blare of bugles, a ruffle of drums,\n       A flash of color beneath the sky;\n       Hats off.\n       The flag is passing by.\n       Blue and crimson and white it shines,\n       Over the steel-tipped, ordered lines.\n       Hats off.\n       The colors before us fly;\n       But more than the flag is passing by.\n       Sea-fights and land-fights, grim and great,\n       Fought to make and to save the State:\n       Weary marchers and sinking ships;\n       Cheers of victory on dying lips;\n       Days of plenty and years of peace;\n       March of a strong land's swift increase;\n       Equal justice, right in law,\n       Stately honor and reverend awe.\n       Sign of a nation, great and strong\n       To ward her people from foreign wrong;\n       Pride and glory and honor--all\n       Live in the colors to stand or fall.\n       Hats off.\n       Along the street there comes\n       A blare of bugles, a ruffle of drums;\n       And loyal hearts are beating high;\n       Hats off.\n       The flag is passing by.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/13/senate-section/article/S7871-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7871-S7873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              FATHER'S DAY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this Sunday, June 15, is Father's Day. It is \na day of lovely chosen, if sometimes unstylish, ties; a day of lumpy \nclay bowls and golf tee puzzles; of handmade cards and big brunches. It \nis a day for family members to struggle over what to get dad, in a \nreflection of both the many hours that fathers spend away from home \nworking and of his proclivity for just buying himself what he wants.\n  What does dad need? Nothing, really. What he wants is more time with \nhis family and more time for fun, but that cannot be purchased. That is \nsomething that cannot be purchased at the mall.\n  This Father's Day will be even more special for the men returning \nfrom service in Iraq in time to meet newborn sons and daughters for the \nfirst time. They will be coming home to a precious new life that they \nsee for the first time in many instances. It is difficult to imagine \nthe poignant first\n\n[[Page S7872]]\n\nmeeting as the same large hands that wrestled weapons on aircraft or \ninto tanks now cradle small bundles squirming with life and happy, \ntoothless smiles. What moments of simple, unalloyed joy.\n  If we are fortunate this Father's Day, it will be a day of beautiful \nJune skies, warm weather and lush lawns trimmed close and smelling of \nfresh cut grass. If we are lucky in this very rainy spring, it will be \na day to enjoy family activities outside, to preside over savory \npicnics or barbecues, to play ball games, to take long walks with the \ndog.\n  I look forward to that. I take a walk with my dog every day before I \ncome to work. When she sees me getting ready she knows I am going to \nleave and go to work. When she sees me put on a tie, she stays at my \nfeet and does not leave me until I take her for that walk.\n  I used to have a little dog named Billy. I spoke of Billy many times \non this floor during his 15 years with us, but Billy is gone. Now we \nhave a little shitzu, and she was named ``Trouble'' by my wife. These \ndogs were to be the palace dogs in Tibet, exceedingly friendly. She \njust loves everybody so I have to be very careful that she does not get \nout the door and go. She will leave with anybody. I call her ``baby.''\n  But that walk with the dog, or to have fun at the pool or lake, it is \nin these venues that we see the best sides of fathers, relaxed and \nhappy, even a bit goofy as they play with their kids and banter with \ntheir wives.\n  In a suit or a uniform at work, we do not commonly see fathers but \nrather bosses, or officials, men with titles, men with \nresponsibilities, mindful of production goals or other targets and \ndeadlines. In this work-a-day mode, men set fine role models for their \nchildren of strong work ethics and integrity and responsibility for \ntheir families. But it is the kid tossing dad in the pool or the dad as \nsoftball coach who children are thinking of as they scrawl their ``I \nlove yous'' on Father's Day cards.\n  One may well appreciate the hours and effort that fathers put into \ntheir jobs in order to provide the best for their children, but that \nsacrifice does not fill the heart with memories in the same way that \nquiet moments do. Late nights at work or at home paying bills and \npreparing taxes are important but not remembered or as appreciated by \nchildren as when dad reads bedtime stories and passes out good night \nkisses.\n  It has been a long time since I had young children, but I remember \nhow it was then. My children, who have grown into adulthood, have \nchildren of their own, who have grandchildren of their own, meaning \nthat Erma and I have great-grandchildren. Erma and I remember the time \nwhen we put our children to bed and when they said their prayers and we \ngave them our good-night kisses.\n  Fathers play an important role in families far beyond their title as \nbreadwinner. Their comforting presence adds to family life and their \nloss is felt profoundly.\n  It was in recognition of both roles that one of the first Father's \nDay services was held, in my own State of West Virginia. It makes me \nproud that my State figures in the history of both Mother's Day and \nFather's Day.\n  That first Father's Day service was conducted by Dr. Robert Webb at \nthe Central United Methodist Church in Fairmont, WV, in 1908. The \nservice was to honor the 210 fathers killed in the terrible mine \nexplosion at Monongah, WV, on December 6, 1907, that took the lives of \nmore than 360 men in all. Think about it. There was no joy at Christmas \nin Monongah in 1907. The idea for the service was the inspiration of \nMrs. Charles Clayton, who sympathized with the grieving families of \nthese men, as she still mourned the loss of her own father. Reverend \nWebb, was Mrs. Clayton's pastor, and he agreed with her thoughts and \nprepared a special mass held in honor and remembrance of fathers on \nJuly 5, the very next year, 1908. This service was but a one-time \nevent.\n  It was the selfless efforts of one father that inspired his daughter \nto advocate a national Father's Day. After listening to a Mother's Day \nsermon in 1909, Mrs. Sonora Smart Dodd proposed the idea of a \n``father's day'' to honor her father, Willam Smart. Mr. Smart was a \nCivil War veteran who was widowed when his wife died in childbirth \ndelivering their sixth child. Mr. Smart raised the newborn and his \nother five children on a rural farm in eastern Washington State. That \nwould be quite a feat even today, but imagine doing so in the late 19th \ncentury! There were no disposable diapers then, no prepared formula or \nbaby food, no day care, no automatic washing machines and dryers, no \nfrozen orange juice. Frozen orange juice came along in 1947. No sliced \nbread here. That did not come along until 1930. You hear people say: \nThis is the greatest thing since sliced bread. That doesn't go very far \nback. Mechanically sliced bread sold commercially by 1930.\n\n  So there were none of the conveniences that we take for granted \ntoday. Mrs. Dodd gives her father great credit, and credit he deserves, \nbut without the help of his five older children, it is difficult to \nimagine how Mr. Smart could have met the challenge.\n  In my own life, as my mother approached death during the influenza \npandemic of 1918, when I was just under a year old, she chose to ask \nrelatives to raise me. She asked my father to give me, the baby, she \nsaid, to the Byrds, Titus Dalton Byrd and his wife Vlurma. His wife \nVlurma was my natural father's sister. My father, my natural father, \nhad several sisters.\n  So when my mother died of influenza in that great epidemic that swept \nthe world, 20 million people died--nobody really knows how many--\nthroughout the world, 12 million in India, perhaps 750,000, give or \ntake, in the United States. They would become ill one morning and die \nthat afternoon or the next day--the great influenza epidemic.\n  So my mother felt that if she did not recover, she wanted this \nfamily, Tyson Dalton Byrd and his wife, to raise me. That was her wish. \nOf my three older brothers and a sister, the three older brothers were \ngiven to the other sister. My father had several sisters. My father \nkept the daughter, my sister. So that is the way it was.\n  The people who reared me were kind. They were not well educated. I \nwas the first person ever, I suppose, in my family to go to the second \nor third grade, if that far. Nobody else in my family ever went beyond \nthat. They could barely read and write, but they were good people. They \nwere honest, they were hard working, and they loved me.\n  So that is what I remember. My dad was my uncle, you see. I never \nknew any other father because my uncle and his wife, my aunt, brought \nme to West Virginia from North Carolina when I was 2 or 3 years old. So \nI remember this man, Titus Dalton Byrd as my father. He loved me.\n  I can remember his coming from work. He was a coal miner. I can \nremember seeing him come down the railroad track from a half mile, \nthree-quarters of a mile away. I could see him coming, this tall man \nwith black hair and red mustache and watch chain. I could see the watch \nchain; I could see him coming down the railroad tracks. I would run to \nmeet him.\n  When I came near to him, he would put down his dinner bucket. He \nwould lift up the lid. He would reach down into that dinner bucket and \npull out a cake. My mom--my aunt; I called her my mom--always put a \ncake, a 5-cent cake, in the dinner bucket. He took the cake--he never \nate it--but always brought it back. He saved the cake for me. So he put \nthat dinner bucket down on the wooden cross tie, the railroad cross \ntie, reached in to get that cake, and I ran up to meet him, and he \nwould give me the cake.\n  This fine old couple had had a son, but that child had died of \nscarlet fever before I was born. So they took me into their home and \nthey raised me. That must have been a difficult choice for my father \nand my mother. She was concerned that she might not recover, and they \ndecided to give me, the baby, to the Byrds.\n  So without the conveniences that we take for granted today, you might \nimagine how it was to raise an infant or a toddler in 1918, bringing a \nchild in 1918 to manhood. Under the circumstances, with three older \nbrothers and a sister, I know it must have been a very difficult thing \nfor my father to try to raise this family with the mother gone. So I \nwas raised by my uncle, Titus Dalton Byrd, and my aunt, Vlurma Byrd. As \nI already said, I called my uncle my dad, and he was my dad. He was the \nonly dad I ever knew until I was ready to graduate from high\n\n[[Page S7873]]\n\nschool, when he told me the story about how my mother died and how my \nmother's wish was what it came to be, that I be made a part of the Byrd \nfamily.\n\n  So my uncle--he was a patient, quiet man--toiled in the dark pits of \nthe West Virginia coal mines without any complaint. I never saw him sit \nat the table and complain about the food--never. He always thought to \nsave me that cake. And, like good fathers everywhere, he encouraged me \nalways to do my best. He encouraged me in my school work. He and she \nalways wanted to see my report card and there was a line on that report \ncard designated ``deportment.'' He always looked at that as well. He \nwanted to see how I behaved in school. And he always told me that if I \ngot a whipping in school, I could be sure of getting another one at \nhome.\n  So he encouraged me in my school work. He did not want me to follow \nhim into the mines which were, in those days, just as dangerous as they \nhad been in 1907, in Monongah.\n  In all my years, I say to these wonderful young people and to those \nwho are watching out there watching this Senate Chamber today, in all \nthose years I never heard him use God's name in vain. I never heard him \ncomplain about his lot in life. He simply toiled on, doing the best he \ncould, a man of few words and few affectionate gestures, but loving \nnonetheless.\n  In any event, the first Father's Day was observed on June 19, 1910, \nin Spokane, WA. In 1924, President Calvin Coolidge supported the idea \nof a national observance of Father's Day, but it was not until 1966 \nthat President Lyndon Johnson signed a Presidential proclamation \ndeclaring the third Sunday in June as the national Father's Day. In \n1972, President Nixon established the permanent national observance of \nFather's Day.\n  The Bible admonishes us: ``Honor thy father and thy mother.'' And on \nthis day in June we honor our fathers with gifts, cards, and time spent \ntogether as a family. The rest of the year we can only hope to honor \nour fathers by our own hard work, as we try to live up to the dreams--\nyes, the dreams--that they have for us.\n  I think of Kipling's lines at this moment. I think they are quite \nappropriate:\n\n       Our Fathers in a wondrous age,\n       Ere yet the Earth was small,\n       Ensured to us an heritage,\n       And doubted not at all\n       That we, the children of their heart,\n       Which then did beat so high,\n       In later time should play like part\n       For our posterity.\n\n       Then, fretful, murmur not they gave\n       So great a charge to keep,\n       Nor dream that awestruck Time shall save\n       Their labour while we sleep.\n       Dear-bought and clear, a thousand year,\n       Our fathers' title runs.\n       Make we likewise their sacrifice,\n       Defrauding not our sons.\n\n  Mr. President, I close with a short poem by Grace V. Watkins entitled \n``I Heard My Father Pray.'' I offer it in honor of Titus Dalton Byrd, \nmy Dad, who is looking down from Heaven.\n\n       Once in the night I heard my father pray.\n       The house was sleeping, and the dark above\n       The hill was wide. I listened to him say\n       Such phrases of devotion and of love,\n       So far beyond his customary fashion,\n       I held my breath in wonder. Then he spoke\n       My name with such tenderness and such compassion,\n       Forgotten fountains in my heart awoke.\n       That night I learned that love is not a thing\n       Measured by eloquence of hand or tongue,\n       That sometimes those who voice no whispering\n       Of their affection harbor love as strong,\n       As powerful and deathless as the sod,\n       But mentioned only when they talk with God.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/13/senate-section/article/S7873-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE FAA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator \nSpecter to engage the distinguished chairman of the Commerce Committee \nin a colloquy regarding a proposal to allow airports increased \nflexibility with the use of the Passenger Facility Charge, PFC, \nrevenues.\n  Mr. President, as you know, many airports are impacted by the \ndownturn in the aviation industry. In my State, the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania is working with US Airways to maintain its presence at \nboth Pittsburgh and Philadelphia International Airports. Our activities \nin Pennsylvania include efforts to reduce costs in order to make our \nairports even more competitive.\n  The amendment that I filed today would change current law to allow \nairports increased flexibility in the use of the Passenger Facility \nCharge revenues so that an airport may choose to use such funds to help \nretire outstanding debt. I believe that this change would be an \nimportant tool for airports, which could benefit from the option of \nusing the funds they receive more effectively.\n  According to information provided to me, this change, if implemented \nat Pittsburgh International Airport, would result in millions of \ndollars in immediate cost savings for both the airport and tenant \nairplanes operating there.\n  It is my understanding that Chairman McCain is aware of this issue \nbut has concerns about the approach taken by this amendment. I am also \ninformed, however, that the Chairman indicated that he plans to examine \nissues related to airport financing and competitiveness in the current \naviation industry environment.\n  I would like to inquire of Chairman McCain if he would agree to \nexamine this issue and continue discussions to identify solutions that \ncan allow airports to be more competitive in this challenging aviation \nindustry environment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of the amendment \noffered by my colleague Senator Santorum that would provide airports \nwith increased flexibility in the use of their Passenger Facility \nCharge funds. As Senator Santorum mentioned, we are working hard to \nassist US Airways and to keep the company's large presence in \nPennsylvania with its hubs in both Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. Earlier \nthis week I hosted a meeting with US Airways CEO David Siegel in my \noffice that included Governor Rendell, Senator Santorum, most of our \ndelegation from the House of Representatives, as well as local elected \nofficials. The purpose of this meeting was to work with US Airways to \nmake our Pennsylvania hubs in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia more cost \ncompetitive so that those airports can remain critical assets to US \nAirways. If enacted, proposals such as our amendment will be of great \nhelp to Pennsylvania and will be available for use by other airports \nthroughout the Nation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the distinguished Senators from Pennsylvania for \nfiling this amendment. I am aware of interest in proposals to allow \nincreased flexibility in the use of Passenger Facility Charges as well \nas other Federal revenues. The Commerce Committee does plan to continue \nits examination of appropriate Federal policy measures that might \naddress the concerns raised by my colleagues. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues on this issue.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank Chairman McCain for agreeing to work with us on \nthis important issue.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I also thank the chairman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/13/senate-section/article/S7873-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7873-S7874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE HOMELAND SECURITY GRANT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am very proud today to join my \ncolleague, the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, in introducing the \nHomeland Security Grant Enhancement Act of 2003. This legislation will \nbring much-needed coordination to the fund application process for our \nfirst responders and State and local officials.\n  The coordination of grant programs called for by this bill will go a \nlong way to make certain that those who will be first called upon to \ndeal with a threat to the security of the United States will be better \nprepared to face it. By enacting the Homeland Security Grant \nEnhancement Act, we can free\n\n[[Page S7874]]\n\nmunicipal governments and first responders of bureaucratic guesswork, \nallowing them to focus instead on training and execution of response \nplans.\n  Currently, Federal programs within the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human \nServices, and other Federal agencies provide our first responders with \na basic level of support with respect to training and equipment \nprocurement. However, in order to receive this support, State and local \nofficials often must complete separate emergency plans and redundant \ngrant application forms. The information demanded by the various \nhomeland security plans is frequently similar; nonetheless, different \nFederal agencies require grant applicants to start from square one in \neach case.\n  The Homeland Security Grant Enhancement Act of 2003 will put an end \nto this inefficient practice. Our bill creases an interagency \ncommittee, composed of representatives from the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department \nof Transportation, the Department of Justice, and the Environmental \nProtection Agency, as well as any other department or agency deemed \nnecessary by the President, to eliminate duplication in planning \nrequirements and to simplify the application process. The committee \nwill engage in a three-step process to accomplish this goal. First, \nwithin 2 months, it will compile a list of the homeland security \nassistance programs, identifying planning and administrative \nrequirements for each program. Second, it will conduct a 4-month review \nof these requirements. Finally, within 8 months, it will report to \nCongress and to the President with recommendations as to how to \nstreamline and standardize requirements.\n  In order to provide first responders with the support they need, our \nbill also creates a Homeland Security Information Clearinghouse. The \nclearinghouse will work with the interagency committee to make grant \ninformation available to first responders and local officials, easing \nthe application process. Many State and local agencies, as well as \nfirefighters, police, and emergency service officials, have found the \nHomeland Security Act provides insufficient guidance from Federal \nagencies as to the use of government funding and technical expertise in \norder to meet security needs. Through the clearinghouse, our bill will \nprovide the coordination needed to locate grant information and other \nresources within the Federal Government. Easy access to this kind of \ninformation will improve immeasurably our State and local agencies' \nability to deal with potential threats.\n\n  First responders have also cited the Homeland Security Act's lack of \nguidance regarding how Federal dollars can be spent and to whom these \nfunds can be allocated. Neither the Homeland Security Act nor the \nDepartment of Homeland Security's efforts to implement the law has done \nmuch to relieve this problem. Our bill seeks to remedy this by \nstreamlining the Office for Domestic Preparedness homeland security \ngrant process from as many as 12 deliberate steps to just 2 commonsense \nrequirements.\n  When enacted, the Homeland Security Grant Enhancement Act will put in \nplace grant application processes that are much more efficient and \nuser-friendly. State and local authorities will be called upon to \ndevelop a single, 3-year homeland security plan that outlines \nvulnerabilities and capabilities. Federal grant programs will be \nreconciled to establish a process for a more logical allocation of \nresources to meet State and local needs. Local agencies or government \nofficials will then apply for funds based on this plan, which can be \nrevised each year pending approval by the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity. These steps will lead to greater ease in securing funding for \nlocal police, fire, and emergency service departments. This means \ngreater security for West Virginians and all Americans.\n  Perhaps more importantly, this will make certain that State and local \nofficials and first responders are all included in the homeland \nsecurity planning process, allowing them to access funds and equipment \nin a timely and efficient manner. Our legislation requires that 80 \npercent of homeland security funding and resources will reach the local \nlevel within 60 days of allocation. The bill encourages flexibility in \nthe use of these funds by authorizing local officials to determine \ntheir allocation to planning, equipment, exercises, training, or other \nhomeland security functions.\n  In order to ensure that rural States are included in Federal grant \nprograms whose eligibility criteria sometime favor urban areas, the \nHomeland Security Grant Enhancement Act follows a procedure that \nbenefited my State of West Virginia earlier this year when we partially \nfunded first responder programs in the Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations bill. As with that legislation, our bill provides that \nany State whose application for funding through this grant program is \napproved will receive a minimum of .75 percent of the total amount \nappropriated for homeland security in a given fiscal year, thereby \nproviding an adequate preparedness funding baseline for all States. The \nSecretary, acting in cooperation with congressional appropriators, \nwould naturally exercise the authority to make upward adjustments with \nthe remaining funds. However, the .75 percent baseline will make \ncertain that rural first responders are not left out. At the same time, \nthis mechanism will see to it that areas facing higher risk and greater \nvulnerabilities might receive more funds. Rural areas will not be left \nout, but areas that are home to elements of the Nation's critical \ninfrastructure, as well as areas with higher population density--both \nof which are the most likely targets for international terrorists--will \nbe safeguarded.\n  Finally, this bill also provides a logical flexibility for Federal \nofficials who oversee unspent funds previously appropriated to the \nOffice for Domestic Preparedness. Rather than allowing this money to \nsit idle while our first responders clamor for adequate funding, this \nlegislation will enable DHS to dispense funds to those States that \nobtain a waiver from the Secretary. Funds earmarked for one purpose, \nsuch as training, may then be used to pay costs associated with another \nfirst responder need, such as equipment.\n  I commend the Senator from Maine for her close personal attention to \nthe matter at hand, and for her hard work in putting this legislation \ntogether. She has worked closely with many of the groups who will \nbenefit directly from this legislation. While many of these \norganizations do not endorse legislation, the approach we offer today \nhas been supported by the National Governors Association, the National \nConference State Legislatures, the Council of State Governments, the \nNational Association of Counties, the National League of Cities, the \nInternational City/County Management Association, and the International \nAssociation of Fire Fighters.\n  I believe the Homeland Security Grant Enhancement Act will greatly \nimprove coordination between the various agencies that distribute \nhomeland security funds to our States, communities, and first \nresponders. Relevant information will flow more freely and the grant \napplication and funding process will become more clear and more \nflexible. While we have made great strides in our efforts against \ninternational terrorists, stifling their ability to conduct operations, \nthe danger of an attack remains. This legislation improves efficiency \nwithin a multiagency bureaucracy, easing the burdens on those who are \ncharged with defending the homeland. These changes will also better \nprepare our first responders to meet the threats they face.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/13/senate-section/article/S7874-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7874-S7875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PROSECUTING GUN-RELATED CRIMES\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last month I spoke about a report released \nby Americans for Gun Safety Foundation entitled, ``The Enforcement Gap: \nFederal Gun Laws Ignored,'' analyzing the Justice Department's \ncommitment to enforcing and prosecuting gun laws. The report examines \nprosecution data acquired from the Justice Department under the Freedom \nof Information Act for fiscal years 2000 through 2002. The AGS study \nreveals a significant gap between the number of federal gun crimes \ncommitted and the number of Federal prosecutions initiated.\n  In response to this report, Representative John Dingell, the Dean of \nthe Michigan delegation in the House, sent\n\n[[Page S7875]]\n\na letter to Attorney General Ashcroft asking ``how the Justice \nDepartment plans to improve its abysmal record of enforcement of all of \nthe major federal firearms statutes.'' He goes on to say, ``by not \nenforcing existing federal firearm laws, we are not only allowing \ncriminals to arm themselves, we are eliminating any deterrent effect \nthese laws may have.''\n  Justice Department officials regularly point to a 38 percent increase \nin prosecutions of gun crimes since 2001 as evidence of their success. \nHowever, according to the AGS report, at the end of fiscal year 2002, \nfederal prosecutors filed 197 cases for gun trafficking, despite \n100,000 guns showing signs of trafficking. Only 27 cases were filed \nagainst corrupt gun dealers, even though AGS reports that gun dealers \nare the leading source of firearms recovered in gun trafficking \noperations. Across the country, only seven cases for illegally selling \na gun to a minor were filed, even though more than 30,000 gun crimes \nwere committed by youths age 17 or under. Only 202 cases were filed for \npossessing or selling a stolen firearm, despite nearly 140,000 reported \ngun thefts that year in which the make, model and serial number of a \nstolen gun was reported to police. And, a mere 98 cases for possessing \nor selling a firearm with an obliterated serial number were prosecuted, \ndespite thousands of these guns being recovered in cities across the \ncountry each year.\n  I believe vigorous and fair enforcement of our gun safety laws is a \ncritical step toward reducing gun violence. I commend Congressman \nDingell questioning the Justice Department about the enforcement gap, \nand I hope the Justice Department will step up its efforts to prosecute \nnot only people who commit gun crimes but those corrupt or negligent \ndealers who put guns in criminal hands.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/13/senate-section/article/S7875-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need \nfor hate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in Palos \nHeights, IL. On September 11, 2001, a man attacked a Moroccan-American \ngas station attendant with the blunt end of a 2-foot machete. The \nattacker was arrested and charged with a hate crime.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n  (At the request of Mr. DASCHLE, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/13/senate-section/article/S7875-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RETIREMENT OF MR.

(Bill) Coffey on his \nretirement as president and chief executive officer of Volunteers of \nAmerica Greater Baton Rouge.\n  It is my privilege to recognize Bill's dedicated service to the \npeople of our State. During his nearly 40 years as a public servant and \na nonprofit leader, Bill has helped countless individuals and families \nin need.\n  Born in 1940 on a small farm in north Louisiana, Bill began working \nfor the State Department of Health and Human Services in 1964 after \nearning a master's in social work from Louisiana State University. His \ndistinguished career as a State employee spanned 25 years and a day, \nbefore his retirement in 1987 as deputy director of the Department of \nMental Retardation.\n  He then joined Volunteers of America--one of our Nation's leading \nhuman services charities B and in 1989 was appointed president /CEO of \nthe organization's Baton Rouge affiliate. Under his leadership, \nVolunteers of America expanded its vital mission of service, opening \nnew programs in Lafayette, Lake Charles and many smaller communities \nacross south Louisiana.\n  Today, Volunteers of America serves more than 14,000 south Louisiana \nresidents every year--abused and neglected children, at-risk youth, the \nelderly, homeless families, people with mental illness or mental \nretardation, people living with HIV/AIDS, victims of hurricanes and \nother disasters, and many more.\n  Above all, Bill has been a community-builder, bringing together those \nin need with those who have a need to serve.\n  My wife Lois and I have experienced the joy of service through \nVolunteers of America many times, especially on our visits with the \nchildren at Parker House in Baton Rouge, a therapeutic setting for \nyoung victims of the most severe abuse and neglect. We were honored to \nbe part of a recent $1.2-million fundraising campaign to acquire a new \nresidence for these children, and a center to prevent child abuse. The \noutpouring of support for this new facility helped fulfill one of \nBill's long-term dreams. It will surely be the crowning touch of his \nlife of service, and his legacy for generations to come.\n  For all Louisianans, I wish to express our thanks and best wishes to \nBill and his family--his wife, Cooky, and their children, Pam and \nBlake--for many happy years ahead.\n  (At the request of Mr. REID, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/13/senate-section/article/S7875-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         EXPLANATION OF ABSENCE\n\n Mr. REED.

Mr. President, I commend Mr. Bryan Jones of Yazoo \nCity, MS, for his distinguished service as President of Delta Council.\n  Delta Council is an area development organization representing the 18 \nDelta and part-Delta counties of Northwest Mississippi. Delta Council \nwas organized in 1935 to bring together the agricultural, business, and \nprofessional leadership of the region to confront the major problems \nfacing the region at that time. Since then, and over the past 68 years, \nthe organization has expanded its role under leaders like Bryan Jones, \nfor the purpose of working in the fields of educational policy, water \nresource conservation, highway developments, agricultural research, and \nflood control.\n  As President of Delta Council, Bryan has served unselfishly and in an \neffective role to lead the people of the Delta during very stressful \neconomic times. He has performed admirably and gained the respect of \nhis peers through the use of sound judgment and meaningful action.\n  Bryan has distinguished himself in many areas on behalf of the \nMississippi Delta region that he loves so much. Bryan has led the \norganization of Delta Council into new fields of endeavor such as \nhealth care and adult literacy. He has supported innovative approaches \ntoward expanding the conservation provisions of our farm laws. He has \nbeen a strong advocate for water resource developments that include \nsignificant features for improved environmental restoration. And, he \nhas become well known throughout the region and among members of the \nMississippi Congressional Delegation as an effective spokesperson on \nbehalf of the Delta's largest industry, which is agriculture.\n  After graduating from the University of Mississippi, Bryan Jones \ncould have been placed in a senior executive position in almost any \ncompany located anywhere in the United States. However, because of his \nlove for the Mississippi Delta, Bryan returned to the Delta region and \njoined his local peers in building a $1 billion banking system which \nhas rapidly grown throughout our State. In addition to serving as the \nChief Executive Officer of the Delta Division of BankPlus, Bryan \noperates a\n\n[[Page S7876]]\n\ncotton, soybean, corn, and wheat farm which is located in Holmes and \nHumphreys Counties.\n  Bryan is a member of the Second Presbyterian Church in Yazoo City and \nhe and his wife, Sara, have three children. He is an enthusiastic \noutdoorsman and a director of Delta Wildlife, which and a leading \nadvocate for the enhancement of the Mississippi Delta's rich wildlife \nresources.\n  It is a great privilege for me to congratulate Bryan Jones for his \nmany contributions to the Delta region of Mississippi and the Nation, \nand I look forward to working with Bryan and other Delta Council \nleaders in the future who share our common goal of improving the \nquality of life for the people of this great part of this \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/13/senate-section/article/S7876-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       COMMEMORATING THE 228TH BIRTHDAY OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY\n\n Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I rise today to wish the United \nStates Army ``happy birthday.'' It was 228 years ago tomorrow, June 14, \n1775, that the Continental Army of the United States was formed. The \nUnited States Army has had a monumental impact on our country.\n  Millions of men and women over the past 228 years have served in the \nsenior most branch of our military forces. The Army is woven in the \nculture of America.\n  For 228 years, the Army has protected the American values of liberty, \nfreedom and democracy. Many people around the globe enjoy these \nfreedoms because of the U.S. Army.\n  The principles of ``Duty, Honor, Country'' are the foundation of the \nU.S. Army. It is America. Every generation of Americans who have served \nin the U.S. Army--from the Continental army to today's fighting men and \nwomen--have been shaped by these principles. It has molded lives in \nways that are hard to explain, just as the Army has touched our \nnational life and history and made the world more secure, prosperous, \nand a better place for all mankind.\n  On this 228th birthday of the U.S. Army, as a proud U.S. Army \nveteran, I say happy birthday to the Army veterans of our country. We \nrecognize and thank those who have sacrificed and served and those \nwhose examples inspired those of us who have had the opportunity to \nserve in the U.S. Army.\n  On this, the 228th birthday of the Army, I say ``Happy Birthday'' \nand, in the great rich tradition of the U.S. Army, I proclaim my annual \nSenate floor . . . ``HOOAH''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/13/senate-section/article/S7876-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. GREGG, from the Committee on Health, Education, \n     Labor, and Pensions, without amendment:\n       S. 231.

A bill to reauthorize the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am joined by the Chairman of the \nSenate Commerce Committee's Consumer Affairs and Product Safety \nSubcommittee, Senator Fitzgerald, in introducing the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission Reauthorization Act of 2003. This legislation is \ndesigned to reauthorize the Consumer Product Safety Commission, CPSC or \nCommission, in furtherance of its mission to protect consumers by \nreducing the risk of injuries and deaths associated with consumer \nproducts. This vital consumer protection agency has not been \nreauthorized since 1990.\n  This bill would authorize funding for the Commission for fiscal years \n2004 through 2007. The bill also would clarify CPSC employee position \ntitles that have evolved informally over time.\n  The CPSC is essential to ensuring the safety of the approximately \n15,000 consumer and household products marketed and sold to American \nconsumers. However, because the agency has not been reauthorized for \nmore than a decade, the Commission has fallen behind in its ability to \nupgrade its technology, meet its overhead expenses, and retain needed \nstaff. Funding for the Commission has not kept pace with the cost of \nregulating the ever-increasing number of products covered by its \njurisdiction.\n  I look forward to working on this important consumer protection \nlegislation and I hope that my colleagues will join us in expeditiously \nmoving this reauthorization through the legislative process. \nReauthorizing the CPSC is crucial to the Commission's successful \nefforts to protect American consumers.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1261\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Consumer Product Safety \n     Commission Reauthorization Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       Section 32(a) of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. \n     2081(a)) is amended by striking paragraphs (1) and (2) and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(1) $60,000,000 for fiscal Year 2004;\n       ``(2) $66,800,000 for fiscal year 2005;\n       ``(3) $70,100,000 for fiscal year 2006; and\n       ``(4) $73,600,000 for fiscal year 2007.''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 2004, \n2005, and 2006 for certain maritime programs of the Department of \nTransportation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nreauthorize the Maritime Administration, MARAD, for fiscal years 2004, \n2005, and 2006. The bill was developed in consultation with \nAdministration officials and would provide for needed reforms in a \nnumber of maritime programs.\n  The bill would authorize appropriations for MARAD operations and \ntraining, administrative costs associated with the shipbuilding loan \nguarantee program authorized by Title XI of the Merchant Marine Act of \n1936, and the disposal of vessels in the National Defense Reserve Fleet \nthat have been identified by the Secretary of Transportation as \nobsolete.\n  The bill is designed to reform how MARAD manages the Title XI \nmaritime loan guarantee program. Both the Department of Transportation \nInspector General and the General Accounting Office have found that \nMARAD has failed to provide effective oversight in receiving and \napproving loan guarantees; has failed to closely monitor the financial \ncondition of borrowers during the term of the loan; and has failed to \nadequately monitor the condition of projects subject to guarantees. \nThey also found that MARAD was flagrant in its use of authority in \ngranting waivers to its own regulations governing the program without \ntaking steps to better secure the taxpayer against defaults. The bill \nincludes reform provisions to address these findings.\n  Furthermore, the bill would amend the Merchant Marine Act to give the \nSecretary of Transportation the authority to convey obsolete National \nDefense Reserve Fleet vessels to nonprofit organizations, a State, \nCommonwealth, or possession of the United States or any municipal \ncorporation or political subdivision thereof or the District of \nColumbia for their use and to U.S. territories and foreign governments \nfor use as artificial reefs. The bill also would amend the Merchant \nMarine Act to allow, under certain circumstances, otherwise unqualified \nU.S.-flag vessels to carry reference cargo reserved for qualified U.S. \nvessels.\n  Finally, the bill would amend requirements for enforcement of the \ncommitment agreements for students at the United States Merchant Marine \nAcademy, USMMA, and students at the state maritime academies who \nreceive student incentive payments, SIP; allow MARAD to use funds \nreceived from a settlement for legally authorized purposes, including \ncompletion of repairs to the Merchant Marine Academy, Fitch Building; \nprovide the Secretary with the authority to also exclude vessels from \nthe carriage of Government\n\n[[Page S7878]]\n\nimpelled cargoes that have been detained for violations of security \nstandards contained within international agreements to which the United \nStates is a party; allow MARAD to retain funds received as a result of \nfinal judgments and settlements in the Vessel Operations Revolving \nFund; and clarify the decades-old authority of the Saint Lawrence \nSeaway Development Corporation, SLSDC, to carry out the provisions of \nthe Ports and Waterways Safety Act, PWSA, in the case of the Saint \nLawrence Seaway.\n  I look forward to working on this important legislation and hope my \ncolleagues will join me in expeditiously moving this authorization \nthrough the legislative process.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1262\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Maritime Administration \n     Authorization Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEARS \n                   2004, 2005, AND 2006.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of \n     Transportation for the Maritime Administration--\n       (1) for expenses necessary for operations and training \n     activities, not to exceed $104,400,000 for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2004, $106,000,000 for the fiscal year \n     ending September 2005, and $109,000,000 for the fiscal year \n     ending 2006;\n       (2) for administrative expenses related to loan guarantee \n     commitments under title XI of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 \n     (46 U.S.C.

A bill to reauthorize the Federal Communications Commission, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Federal \nCommunications Commission Reauthorization Act of 2003. This legislation \nis designed to reauthorize the Federal Communications Commission, FCC \nor Commission, so that it may continue to carry forth its charge to \nensure interference-free communication on interstate and international \nradio, television, wire, satellite, and cable communications. This \nindependent agency has not been reauthorized since 1991.\n  The FCC is responsible for a wide range of duties, including \nestablishing regulatory policies that promote competition, innovation, \nand investment in broadband services; ensuring that a comprehensive and \nsound national competitive framework for communications services \nexists; encouraging the best use of spectrum domestically and \ninternationally; and providing leadership for the rapid restoration of \nthe Nation's communications infrastructure in the event of disruption.\n  This bill would reauthorize the Commission through fiscal year 2007. \nIt would require that all application and regulatory fees paid to the \nCommission be deposited with the Commission subject to Appropriations.\n  The legislation also would authorize the Commission to allocate \nsufficient funds to be used for an audit of the e-rate program to \ndetermine the specific fraud or abuse that has occurred during the \noperation of the program. Serious allegations of fraud in the operation \nof the e-rate fund have been raised in recent months, and we should \nprovide the Commission adequate resources to ensure that e-rate funds \nare being used for the purposes intended. The Commission would be \nrequired to transmit a report of its findings and conclusions to the \nSenate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the House \nof Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce on the anniversary \nof the Act's enactment for each year between 2004 and 2007.\n  Further, this bill would clarify the Commission's review of its media \nownership rules. Specifically, the bill sets forth the timing and the \nstandard the FCC will use for reviewing its broadcast ownership rules. \nCurrently, the FCC is required to review its broadcast ownership rules \nevery 2 years. The bill lengthens the duration between reviews from 2 \nyears to 5 years. At a recent hearing, all five FCC Commissioners \nrecommended this change.\n  The legislation also would clarify the actions the FCC may take \nduring its media ownership reviews. Courts have found the current \nreview standard to carry ``with it a presumption in favor of repealing \nor modifying ownership rules'' as part of ``a process of \nderegulation.'' This bill modifies the review standard to specifically \nallow the FCC to repeal, strengthen, limit, or retain media ownership \nrules if it determines such changes are in the public interest. At a \nrecent hearing, several of the FCC Commissioners endorsed this change.\n  The bill would increase the Commission's ability to enforce the \nCommunications Act of 1934, the 1934 Act, by raising the statutory cap \non Commission fines and forfeitures by a factor of ten. The Commission \nhas sought this increased enforcement ability to ensure communications \nproviders do not accept Commission fines as a ``cost of doing \nbusiness.'' The bill also increases the statute of limitations for \nviolations of FCC rules or regulations from one year to two years. The \nlegislation also allows the Commission to assess fines against direct \nbroadcast satellite (DBS) operators for violations of the \nCommunications Act in the same manner that the Commission may assess \nfines against broadcasters and cable operators.\n  The bill would further clarify that a party injured by a common \ncarrier's violation of FCC rules or orders may recover damages for such \ninjury in an action before the FCC or before a United States District \nCourt. The need for this clarification is underscored by the recent \ndecision by the United States Court of Appeals or the Second Circuit in \nConboy v. AT Corp. Moreover, the new section would allow for the \nrecovery of attorneys' fees in complaints filed either in district \ncourt or at the FCC.\n  The bill also would allow the Commission to seize broadcasting \nequipment where one engages in malicious interference to radio \ncommunications. This type of behavior is particularly egregious when \nparties attempt to maliciously interfere with public safety \nfrequencies.\n  Furthermore, the bill would ensure that valuable spectrum does not \nlie fallow unnecessarily. It precludes a successful bidder in a \nspectrum auction from using bankruptcy to avoid its obligation to pay \nfor its spectrum license. The bill also establishes an office within \nthe Commission for the recording and perfecting of security interests \nrelated to licenses.\n  It also would ban any payment or reimbursement to the FCC of travel \ncosts for FCC officials or staff from a nongovernmental sponsor of a \nconvention, conference, or meeting. Recent reports indicate that during \nthe last eight years, FCC officials and staff have taken more than \n2,500 trips paid for by the industries they regulate. Although this is \nperfectly legal and it is often appropriate for FCC officials and staff \nto attend such conventions, conferences, or meetings, it should be \nwithout the appearance of impropriety. Therefore, the bill authorizes \nthe Commission sufficient funds to pay for their own travel costs in \nthe future.\n  The bill would impose a one year lobbying ban on high-level FCC \nstaffers who leave the FCC's employment.\n  Finally, the bill contains language in response to a recent court \ncase before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which held that the \nCommission lacked jurisdiction to promulgate regulations necessary to \nrequire video descriptions of television programming to assist those \nwho are visually impaired. This section would provide the FCC such \nauthority.\n  Reauthorizing the FCC is important so the agency may continue to \nsuccessfully carry out its many responsibilities. I look forward to \nworking on this important legislation and I hope that my colleagues \nwill agree to join me in expeditiously moving this reauthorization \nthrough the legislative process.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1264\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Since 1990, the United States has lost more than \n     600,000 aerospace jobs.\n       (2) Over the last year, approximately 100,000 airline \n     workers and aerospace workers have lost their jobs as a \n     result of the terrorist attacks in the United States on \n     September 11, 2001, and the slowdown in the world economy.\n       (3) The United States has revolutionized the way people \n     travel, developing new technologies and aircraft to move \n     people more efficiently and more safely.\n       (4) Past Federal investment in aeronautics research and \n     development have benefited the economy and national security \n     of the United States and the quality of life of its citizens.\n       (5) The total impact of civil aviation on the United States \n     economy exceeds $900,000,000,000 annually--9 percent of the \n     gross national product--and 11 million jobs in the national \n     workforce. Civil aviation products and services generate a \n     significant surplus for United States trade accounts, and \n     amount to significant numbers of America's highly skilled, \n     technologically qualified work force.\n       (6) Aerospace technologies, products and services underpin \n     the advanced capabilities of our men and women in uniform and \n     those charged with homeland security.\n       (7) Future growth in civil aviation increasingly will be \n     constrained by concerns related to aviation system safety and \n     security, aviation system capabilities, aircraft noise, \n     emissions, and fuel consumption.\n       (8) The United States is in danger of losing its aerospace \n     leadership to international competitors aided by persistent \n     government intervention. Many governments take their funding \n     beyond basic technology development, choosing to fund product \n     development and often bring the product to market, even if \n     the products are not fully commercially viable. Moreover, \n     international competitors have recognized the importance of \n     noise, emission, fuel consumption, and constraints of the \n     aviation system and have established aggressive agendas for \n     addressing each of these concerns.\n       (9) Efforts by the European Union, through a variety of \n     means, will challenge the United States' leadership position \n     in aerospace. A recent report outlined the European Union's \n     goal of becoming the world's leader in aviation and \n     aeronautics by the end of 2020, utilizing better coordination \n     among research programs, planning, and funding to accomplish \n     this goal.\n       (10) Revitalization and coordination of the United States' \n     efforts to maintain its leadership in aviation and \n     aeronautics are critical and must begin now.\n       (11) A recent report by the Commission on the Future of the \n     United States Aerospace Industry outlined the scope of the \n     problems confronting the aerospace and aviation industries in \n     the United States and found that--\n       (A) Aerospace will be at the core of America's leadership \n     and strength throughout the 21st century;\n       (B) Aerospace will play an integral role in our economy, \n     our security, and our mobility; and\n       (C) global leadership in aerospace is a national \n     imperative.\n       (12) Despite the downturn in the global economy, Federal \n     Aviation Administration projections indicate that upwards of \n     1 billion people will fly annually by 2013. Efforts must \n     begin now to prepare for future growth in the number of \n     airline passengers.\n       (13) The United States must increase its investment in \n     research and development to revitalize the aviation and \n     aerospace industries, to create jobs, and to provide \n     educational assistance and training to prepare workers in \n     those industries for the future.\n       (14) Current and projected levels of Federal investment in \n     aeronautics research and development are not sufficient to \n     address concerns related to the growth of aviation.\n\n        Subtitle A--The Office of Aerospace and Aviation Liaison\n\n     SEC. 621.

Mr. President, in a few moments we will be adjourning \nuntil Monday afternoon. But in looking back over the last 5 days, I do \nwant to share with my colleagues my satisfaction with the progress we \nhave made.\n  I have had the pleasure of opening the Senate most every day, and \nthen closing it most every day or evening and at the end of the week, \nso it gives me an opportunity to look back. For just a few minutes I \nwould like to comment on some of the things we accomplished this week.\n  We had very good debate--strong debate, effective debate--on the \nEnergy bill over the past week and, in fact, over the past 2 weeks.\n  I do want to take this opportunity to thank, praise and commend the \nchairman of the Energy Committee, the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico, Chairman Domenici, for his tremendous work in moving us forward \non this critically important bill. We have made solid progress. We have \nhad a number of votes this week.\n  As all of my colleagues know--because I have said it on this floor \nand in many other places almost daily--we will be turning to the \nMedicare prescription drug bill next week. We will stay on the bill \nuntil we complete that legislation. I think we can finish it actually \nin less than 2 weeks, although I have targeted a 2-week period, which \ngives more than adequate time for debate and amendment. I am even more \nconfident that we will be able to pass that bill after spending about \n12 hours yesterday in the Finance Committee meeting, where we looked at \nthe bill, debated it, amended it, and passed it with a strong \nbipartisan majority in preparation for coming to the floor.\n  But I do want to make it very, very clear that we will be coming back \nto the Energy bill, and we will finish it.\n  Also, this week, we accomplished a lot, locking in an agreement which \nlimits the number of amendments that can be considered on the Energy \nbill. That is real progress because now we have a finite number of \namendments, and we can talk to the various Members and see what they \nhave proposed and get those amendments organized in such a way that we \ncan spend time on each of the amendments in a way that makes sense, \nthat is systematic, and whereby we will be able to, I believe, lay out \na glidepath to bring that bill to conclusion.\n  It is imperative for the United States of America that we have a \ncomprehensive energy policy. It is America's future that is at stake, \nour economic future, so much so that, in fact, the Federal Reserve \nChairman, Alan Greenspan, came to the Hill this past week to speak \nspecifically on the need for action on energy policy.\n  The price of natural gas for July delivery is 150 percent higher than \nit was\n\n[[Page S7903]]\n\n3 years ago. Meanwhile, natural gas storage levels are at their lowest \nin almost 3 decades. Chairman Greenspan warns that the volatility in \nthe price of natural gas could eventually contribute to ``erosion'' in \nthe economy. We simply cannot afford that.\n  American industry, at the same time, is caught between regulations \nlimiting the supply of natural gas and regulations encouraging its use. \nThe result of that is we have rising gas prices, with some industries \ncutting jobs or being priced out altogether, and consumers getting hit \nwith rising electric bills.\n\n  As we talked about a lot this week, and looked at the various \namendments, we absolutely must diversify our sources of energy. We must \ndo so in a way that lessens our overall dependence on foreign sources.\n  America's energy policy should be consistent with our foreign policy \nin the sense that both should be independent and secure--independent \nand secure.\n  By increasing America's domestic production of sources of energy--\nwhether it is clean coal, oil and gas, nuclear, solar, or other \nrenewable energy sources--we increase not only our energy supply but \nour national security.\n  In closing, I want to say one other thing about the comprehensive \nnature of a national energy policy. We will, by doing so, create needed \njobs. The Energy bill, it is estimated, will create at least 500,000 \njobs, and we know it will save even more. The Alaskan pipeline, for \nexample, will create at least 400,000 jobs alone. The hundreds of \nmillions of dollars that will be invested in research and development \nof new technologies will not only benefit the environment but will also \ncreate new jobs. These are the types of jobs that are increasingly \nimportant, I would argue, in this century--jobs of engineering, \nmathematics, chemistry, physics, and science.\n  Thus, I am committed, as majority leader, to get a comprehensive \nnational energy bill passed as soon as we possibly can. We hear the \nDemocrats warning, darkly, of a weak economy and increasing \nunemployment, while we, as Republicans, are talking about taking action \nand making our economy strong with such action.\n  So again, Mr. President, we will return to this bill. We will dispose \nof the remaining amendments, and we will deliver to the American people \nenergy that is cleaner, more abundant, and more secure.\n  In addition to the Energy legislation which we spent most of the week \non, we actually touched on a number of other very important legislative \nmatters. The Senate last night passed the Federal Aviation \nAdministration reauthorization bill. We were able to consider a number \nof amendments, and as the Democratic assistant leader said earlier \ntoday at the opening of the Senate this morning, it was remarkable to \nsee how that bill was handled on the floor. It came together in a \nbipartisan way, in a way that really is a good model for us in handling \nthis type of legislation when it comes to the floor.\n  I thank the chairman and ranking member and Members on both sides of \nthe aisle for their cooperation in moving us forward and passing that \nvery important bill.\n  We also passed this week the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act. I am \npleased the Senate was able to consider that bill to address the \ntragedy that is occurring, as we speak, in Burma and the issues of \nfreedom and democracy for which we have fought so hard in other parts \nof the world. It shows we understand, that we are caring, we are \ncompassionate, and we will take action when freedom and democracy are \nchallenged.\n  I thank the majority whip, the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, \nMr. McConnell, for bringing that bill to our attention and bringing it \nto the floor.\n  We also passed the Women Business Centers Preservation Act which was \nsponsored by our colleague, Senator Olympia Snowe. In addition, we were \nable to clear a number of executive nominations. Just a few minutes ago \nI was looking at the nominations that are pending, and I will continue \nto work toward clearing these nominations on the Executive Calendar and \nscheduling rollcall votes as necessary.\n  (Mr. BENNETT assumed the Chair.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/13/senate-section/article/S7903-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       A WEEKEND OF CELEBRATIONS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, there are two other issues I wish to \nquickly mention. It has to do with important holidays that occur this \nweekend. Sandwiched between Memorial weekend and the Fourth of July, \nFlag Day often gets overlooked. Believed to have been started in 1885 \nby a Wisconsin schoolteacher, the purpose of Flag Day, June 14, is to \ncelebrate the birthday of the American flag. It gives us all the \nopportunity to reflect on the great Nation that the American flag \nsymbolizes.\n  The American flag is recognized worldwide as a symbol of democracy \nand freedom. It is the flag which leads us in every American battle and \nmany struggles of freedom in foreign lands. It flies over our Capitol \nBuilding. It is unfurled at public events, large and small. It even \nflies on the face of the Moon.\n  I encourage my fellow citizens to pause tomorrow evening at 7 p.m. \nand join in the annual recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. The \nfirst pledge we make, after all, is to that Flag of the United States \nof America.\n  Also this weekend we celebrate Father's Day. All across the country \nfamilies will be honoring their dads with special dinners, handmade \ngifts, and probably goofy ties for one or two dads across the country, \nand rightly so. Every day we learn more and more about how vital \nfathers are to the well-being of their families, and especially their \nchildren.\n  Children with involved loving fathers, as compared to children \nwithout fathers, are more likely to do well in school, to have a \nhealthy self-esteem, to show empathy, to avoid drug use, to avoid \ntruancy, and to avoid criminal activity.\n  The National Fatherhood Initiative, a nonprofit organization devoted \nto promoting responsible fatherhood, reports that today's fathers are \npresent in their children's lives more than ever.\n  The phenomenon of father absence has stopped growing. Dads in two-\nparent families are spending more time with their children than fathers \ndid a generation ago. What is more, these fathers seem to be more \nactive and more nurturing. Indeed, that is progress.\n  Perhaps even more heartening is the large number of national surveys \nwhich find that young men identify fatherhood and family time as a \nmajor priority. Indeed, that is great news.\n  On Saturday, let us salute our flag and, on Sunday, America's dads. \nFrom a grateful Nation, happy Flag Day and happy Father's Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/13/senate-section/article/S7903-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SEQUENTIAL REFERRAL OF NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
