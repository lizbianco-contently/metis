I ask my Senate colleagues to pay attention to what I am \nabout to say because the purpose is to bring as many people to the \nfloor to listen and discuss and debate what the Constitution says and \nour interpretation of the Constitution at an elevated level. That is \nthe purpose in setting aside that time from 11 to 12:30.\n  Time should be equally divided, and look for some outstanding \ndiscussion on what is a very important principle in our Constitution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/10/senate-section/article/S3375-6", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S3376]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, with respect to the Estrada nomination, \nthis Senator has no reason to vote to confirm and everyone should \nunderstand up front that I have treated my responsibility with serious \npurpose, always giving the benefit of the doubt to the President. I was \none of the two Democrats who voted for Robert Bork, and I am \nparticularly proud that I did vote for him. Robert Bork was an \noutstanding jurist. He answered the questions.\n  So when these folks come up and apply for a job, they ought to treat \nthe advise and consent responsibility that we have as Senators with \nrespect. They should not go to the committee and give the rope-a-dope \nrunaround and then come back later and have the White House calling \nSenators saying: Would you like to see the gentleman?\n  I have heard the whining cry again and again that this is all \nunconstitutional. I wish they would have been present when Justice \nFortas, the Associate Justice for the Supreme Court, was nominated by \nPresident Lyndon Johnson to become the Chief Justice. My senior \ncolleague at the time, the distinguished Senator Thurmond, led the \nfilibuster. There was extended debate, and please note it in the Record \nthat they had a cloture vote. They could not get cloture and--read it \nin the Record--they then withdrew the nomination.\n  The leadership in the Senate should get on with the important \nbusiness of this Government at a time of war, at a time of dreadful \ndeficit spending, at a time when they will not even pay for the war. I \ncan say now that every President, every Congress, has paid for wars, \nand I am embarrassed to be a Senator at this particular time to go home \nto my state and report that we are not going to pay for this war. It \nwas Abraham Lincoln, in order to pay for the Civil War, who put a tax \non dividends. And now this President says the need of the hour is to \ntake the tax off dividends.\n\n  During World War I we had a marginal income tax rate that went up to \n77 percent. In World War II, it was 79 percent to 94 percent. In the \nKorean War, it was 91 percent, and the country sustained. The country \ndid not break up. The country did not go poor. The country was \nstimulated by a sense of responsibility. This Mickey Mouse idea that \ndividends are going to stimulate the economy--come on. In the Vietnam \nWar, we had a marginal tax rate up to 77 percent. But we have the \nunmitigated gall to now say we need to stimulate the economy with a \ndividend tax cut, with doing away with the marriage penalty, and with \neliminating the estate tax.\n  It is quite obvious what is on course is tax reform. There is no \nsense of responsibility for this position. It helped when, with Senator \nMuskie, we passed in 1973 and it was finally signed in 1974 the Budget \nCommittee process. I have served on that Budget Committee for the past \n25, 26 years, including as Chairman. I am the author, along with \nSenator Gramm and Senator Rudman, of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings when \nPresident Reagan said we were not going to have to run deficits \nanymore. We had truth in budgeting.\n  On Saturday, we got the truth from the Congressional Budget Office. \nIt projected the pending deficit for the fiscal year which we are in \nnow, 2003, on page 21, at the back of the document would be $469 \nbillion. The distinguished Presiding Officer knows this by heart \nbecause he has served on the Budget Committee on the House side. This \nis important because that is the actual debt increase, that is the \nactual deficit.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the lead \neditorial from today's Washington Post, ``Digging the Budget Hole.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 10, 2003]\n\n                        Digging the Deficit Hole\n\n       The deficit numbers grow ever grimmer. The Congressional \n     Budget Office on Friday put out a new estimate for this \n     fiscal year in which the projected deficit is 24 percent \n     higher than the CBO had anticipated two months ago, mostly \n     owing to the faltering economy. Meanwhile, Congress this week \n     will begin outlining a course for federal spending and tax \n     cuts that would push the country further into a deficit hole. \n     So it seems like an opportune moment to pause for a reminder \n     of how we got into this mess, how bad it is and how bad it \n     could be if President Bush's tax wishes come to pass.\n       First, what happened to the surplus? It was only two years \n     ago that the CBO foresaw a surplus of $5.6 trillion through \n     2011. Back then, administration officials, insisting that Mr. \n     Bush's $1.3 trillion tax cut was easily affordable, dismissed \n     warnings that the surplus could be illusory. The forecasts \n     could ``just as easily be wrong on the low side as the high \n     side,'' said White House budget director Mitchell E. Daniels \n     Jr. Now, even without new tax cuts, the surplus has \n     evaporated and the administration is airbrushing its previous \n     statements. ``We didn't squander a surplus. We never had \n     it,'' Treasury Secretary John W. Snow told the House Budget \n     Committee. ``It wasn't real dollars in hand.''\n       The biggest reason those dollars failed to materialize, \n     particularly in the short term, is the faltering economy. But \n     over 10 years, according to CBO projections, the major drag \n     on the nation's fiscal health will be the cost of the 2001 \n     tax cut and increased spending. A sobering report last week \n     by the Committee for Economic Development (CED), a \n     nonpartisan group of business leaders, spelled this out: ``In \n     short, while a substantial portion of the current fiscal \n     deterioration can be blamed on the economy, responsibility \n     for the fiscal set-back in later years lies squarely on the \n     shoulders of policymakers.''\n       Now build in the effect of Mr. Bush's $1.5 trillion in new \n     tax proposals. The part that Congress will take up \n     immediately, projected to cost $726 billion through 2013, \n     includes the immediate implementation of the 2001 tax cuts, \n     much of which was to have been phased in over time, and the \n     elimination of the individual income tax on corporate \n     dividends. But Mr. Bush also wants Congress to make his 2001 \n     tax cuts permanent; currently they're scheduled to expire in \n     2010. In interest costs alone, the Bush proposals would \n     impose an additional $530 billion. Overall, according to the \n     new CBO figures, the administration's tax and spending \n     proposals would cost $2.7 trillion. The bottom line, \n     according to the CBO: cumulative deficits of $1.8 trillion \n     through 2013 if Mr. Bush gets his way.\n       But the real fiscal picture is even worse. Remember the \n     Social Security lockbox? It has been broken open. The deficit \n     numbers above are cushioned by including $2.6 trillion from \n     the Social Security trust fund. In other words, if that money \n     were placed out of reach, the deficit would be $4.4 trillion \n     through 2013. Moreover, those numbers don't reflect the cost \n     of fixing the alternative minimum tax, which was designed to \n     prevent the wealthy from wriggling out of taxes but is \n     projected to apply to a third of all taxpayers by 2010. The \n     administration has proposed a short-term fix; extending that \n     fix through 2013 would cost $750 billion. Likewise, these \n     figures don't take into account the likely increases in \n     spending to cover an Iraq war and its aftermath, homeland \n     security or a prescription drug benefit for seniors. Nor do \n     they include the growing demands on Social Security and \n     Medicare that will materialize when baby boomers start to \n     reach retirement age just five years from now.\n       ``The first step in climbing out of a hole is to stop \n     digging,'' the CED report said. ``We cannot afford economic \n     policy decisions today that further raise deficits \n     tomorrow.'' Congress ought to put down that shovel.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Everyone can read the entire article, but let me read \nthe sentence: ``The deficit numbers above are cushioned by including \n$2.6 trillion from the Social Security trust fund.'' I have to read \nthat again: ``The deficit numbers above are cushioned by including $2.6 \ntrillion from the Social Security trust fund.''\n  The following sentence: ``In other words, if that money were placed \nout of reach, the deficit would be $4.4 trillion through 2013.'' Now, \nthat is just the Social Security trust fund. The Social Security trust \nfund is not the only one being expended. There is the Medicare trust \nfund. They take the surpluses, and they are going to say we have to do \nsomething on Medicare, but they have been spending the moneys on \nanything and everything other than Medicare. The same can be said with \nthe highway trust funds, the airport trust funds, and the military and \npublic service retirees. We have all kinds of trust funds, and if they \nwere all included, rather than the $4.4 trillion, it would be $5.7 \ntrillion.\n  This Enron-like accounting operation is right in the President's \nbudget book. If you look at page 1--and I hold within my hand the \nbudget for the fiscal year 2004 that was just released last month--it \nsays: ``My administration firmly believes in controlling the deficit \nand reducing it as the economy strengthens and our national security \ninterests are met. Compared to the overall Federal budget and the $10.5 \ntrillion national economy, our budget cap is small by historical \nstandards.''\n  That is on page 1. Now, Kenny Boy Lay, when he put out his Enron \ncorporate report to the stockholders, that\n\n[[Page S3377]]\n\nis exactly the way he would start off. Make the stockholders feel good. \nMake the taxpayers feel good. Make the public servants feel \nresponsible. But where is the truth? You will have to go all the way \nthrough to page 332.\n  I ask unanimous consent that page 332, by itself, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          TABLE S-14.--FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING AND DEBT--Continued\n                                            [In billions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                            Estimates\n              Function                  2002   -----------------------------------------------------------------\n                                       actual      2003       2004       2005       2006       2007       2008\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDebt outstanding, end of year:\n    Gross Federal debt \\7\\:\n        Debt issued by Treasury....      6,171      6,725      7,294      7,811      8,327      8,832      9,363\n        Debt issued by other                27         27         27         26         26         26         25\n         agencies..................\n                                    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            Total, gross Federal         6,198      6,752      7,321      7,837      8,353      8,858      9,388\n             debt..................\n    Held by:\n        Debt held by Government          2,658      2,874      3,155      3,451      3,751      4,061      4,385\n         accounts..................\n        Debt issued by the public        3,540      3,878      4,166      4,387      4,603      4,797      5,003\n         \\8\\.......................\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\7\\ Treasury securities held by the public and zero-coupon bonds held by Government accounts are almost all\n  measured at sales price plus amortized discount or less amortized premium.

Debt held by the Federal Reserve Banks is not estimated for future years.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, you will see the total gross Federal \ndebt whereby it goes from $6.198 trillion at the end of last fiscal \nyear to, as projected at the end of this fiscal year, $6.752 trillion, \nfor a deficit of $554 billion. And they are running around here, in \nthis newspaper, continuing to say $300 billion deficits. We already are \nprojecting, without the cost of Iraq--this does not include the cost of \ngoing to war in Iraq--a $554 billion deficit. And if you look at next \nyear, the 2004 debt is increased from $6.752 trillion to $7.321 \ntrillion, for a deficit of $569 billion for next year.\n  On Wednesday, at the Budget Committee, the fix will be in. We used to \nhave some moderates on the Budget Committee, but the leadership took \nthe moderates off, so it will be bam-bam.\n  On Wednesday the Committee will have a conference and then on \nThursday we will have amendments. It will be the Democrats who will \nhave amendments because the Republicans are a fixed jury. They are a \nfixed jury, and they are not going to go along with any amendments, and \nthey are going along with the President's budget and the President's \ntax cut because that is the makeup of the Republicans when they got rid \nof the moderates.\n  Before that we at least had a chance to talk and discuss with each \nother, but now the budget process that we instituted back in 1974 is \npure sham. Their goal is to get those reconciliation instructions that \nby majority vote they will have. Then by majority vote they can pass \nall these tax cuts and everything else that they have, under limited \ntime. You can't have extended debate. So the fix is on--unfortunately \nfor the country.\n  According to the Committee for Economic Development, ``The first step \nin climbing out of a hole is to stop digging. We cannot afford economic \npolicy decisions today that further raise deficits tomorrow.''\n  Congress ought to put down that shovel. That is the most important \nthing we have going, even more important than war. I think we can win \nthe war. I don't think we are going to win this. This is terrible.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the ``Hollings' \nBudget Realities'' chart.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe

Budget of the US Government: Beginning in 1962, CBO's The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2004-2013, January 2003.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. What will happen when we have the budget debate is they \nwill have leadership amendments. They will have something on \nprescription drugs and they will have something on some other thing, \nwhatever it is. Then the real important ones you submit for 2 minutes. \nYou describe your amendment and everybody votes. Senators will not get \nthe opportunity to see this, so I hope they will all get this out of \nthe Congressional Record.\n  When you talk about digging that hole, let me show you the hole we \nare really in. If, we have a deficit of $554 billion for this year, and \nlast year we had a $428 billion deficit, and next year they project a \n$569 billion deficit--that, added together, is $1.5 trillion. That is \n$1.5 trillion of stimulus. We don't need a little dividend cut, or a \nlittle marriage penalty elimination to stimulate the economy. What we \nneed is money and certainly not tax cuts, certainly not digging the \nhole. You are in a dickens of a hole if you are already in $1.5 \ntrillion in deficit without the cost of Iraq.\n  For my colleagues, let me try to put this in perspective. If you add \nup all the deficits from Harry Truman in 1945 to Gerald Ford in 1975--\nif you take the 30 years cumulative of all deficits, which include the \ncost of World War II, the cost of Korea, the cost of Vietnam--it adds \nup to $358 billion. We are already talking, not $300 some billion over \n30 years, but we are talking about $554 billion this year without the \ncost of Iraq.\n  You are in real trouble when you have to estimate that and you see \nthe interest cost now. Lyndon Johnson was the last President to balance \nthe budget. In 1968-1969 he had a surplus. That is the last time. I was \nhere.\n  In fact, we met over on the House side, the distinguished chair--\nGeorge Mahon was chairman of the Appropriations Committee. We didn't \nhave a Budget Committee. I am almost convinced that we ought to go back \nto that because there was a conscience. This whole budget process has \nnow become a charade.\n  But George Mahon said, you know the President is very, very sensitive \nabout this guns and butter. We have to do something else, a little bit \nmore if we are really going to balance it. He said, Call over to Marvin \nWatson and ask the President if we can cut another $5 billion, and we \ncut another $5 billion. If I am not mistaken, the budget at that time \nfor guns, butter, the war in Vietnam was $178 billion.\n  Now we have a budget of almost $2.1 trillion. We pay $324 billion in \ninterest per year--it is estimated that when the interest rates go back \nup, it will be back up to a billion a day in interest.\n  The first thing the Government does every morning at 8 when the banks \nopen is borrow another $1 billion, every morning except Sunday this \nyear. They are going to go down every day, including Saturday, \nincluding holidays. They will go down and borrow and add it to the \ndebt. That is why we are running this $554 billion deficit.\n  But these interest costs are just saddling us, when we are paying \nover $300-some billion in interest, as much as the defense budget, and \nall just waste just because we didn't pay our way. We used to pay our \nway. We used to pay for the war. Yes, tell my friend Robert Novak when \nhe constantly says we are going to pay for the war by borrowing just \nlike we did for guns and butter in Vietnam--no, no. President Lyndon \nJohnson paid and balanced the budget then.\n  You have seen exactly what the score is with respect to digging a \nhole. I want to get right into the point of this so-called tax cut \nbecause nobody was better at stopping digging the hole and recognizing \nit, of course, than Mr. David Stockman. I had just come off the \nchairmanship of the Budget Committee, and I went over with Mr. Alan \nGreenspan to the Blair House and briefed President Reagan in December \nof 1980. I will never forget, the President said:\n\n       Whoops, I had promised to balance the budget in 1 year. \n     From what you gentlemen are telling me it is going to take 3 \n     years.\n\n  That is when we went from a 1-year budget to 3 years. In 1981, I \nopposed those tax cuts, Reaganomics, what George Bush senior called \nvoodoo. I opposed voodoo I. I opposed the increase in spending at that \ntime because we all had a sense of responsibility. In order to stick it \nout and be able to serve around here, you have to go with the flow like \nthe traffic in downtown Hanoi.\n  Listen to this, from page 342 of ``The Triumph of Politics'':\n\n       The President had no choice but to repeal or substantially \n     dilute the tax cut that would have gone far toward restoring \n     the stability of the strongest capitalist economy in the \n     world. Ronald Reagan chose not to be a leader but a \n     politician. His obstinacy was destined to keep America's \n     economy hostage to the errors of his advisers for a long, \n     long time.\n\n  So under President Reagan, we had an $85.7 billion deficit in 1981, \nand it went up to $142.5 billion in 1982. That is when he was cutting \ntaxes.\n  The next thing you know it was up to $234 billion and he ended up \nwith a $252 billion deficit by his eighth year in office.\n  Then President George Herbert Walker Bush came in and he ended up \nwith a $403 billion deficit. We never had over $100 billion in deficit \nuntil voodoo I came along.\n  Let me talk about voodoo II. I watched that because I have been in \nthe budget lead now for quite some time. I come from a State where in \norder to be elected governor you have to promise to pay the bill. But \nin that same State, in order to be elected to the Senate you have to \npromise not to pay the bill. I am against the government of let us cut \ntaxes. So I know whereof I speak. I have experience in the budget.\n  What happened when Governor Bush in September of 2000 said on the \ncampaign trail said he was going to cut taxes. I sort of shook my head \nand smiled. I said, Well, that is campaign talk. That is not going to \nhappen for the simple reason that we can't afford to be cutting taxes. \nBut I sort of sobered up on the Friday after the election--on Tuesday \nin November 2000.\n\n[[Page S3379]]\n\nThat is when Vice President-elect Cheney said, Yes, that is what we are \ngoing to do. When Vice President-elect Cheney said we were going to cut \ntaxes, there was no recession yet.\n  Please listen. Harken all. Lend me your ears, for I can tell you what \nreally started that recession in 2001. It was when Alan Greenspan, the \nchairman of the Federal Reserve, came on January 25, 2001 before the \nBudget Committee and he attested to the fact that we were paying down \ntoo much debt. He gave title and interest to the young President George \nW. Bush. He gave him the go-ahead with this $5.6 trillion debt.\n  Secretary of Treasury John Snow, former head of CSX and who used to \nhead up the Business Roundtable, was always coming into my office \nbecause we were big admirers of CSX. He was always coming in worried \nabout the budget and the deficits. When I talked to him on the phone \nbefore he became Secretary, I said, ``John, I see you are giving up two \nthings.'' He said, ``What's that?'' I said, ``You are giving up your \nmembership at Augusta National Golf Club, and you have given up any \nchance of balancing the budget and getting this Government out of the \nred. You are giving up on the deficit now, and you are going to head \nfor deficits.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this 2001 debt time line schedule \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           2001 Debt Timeline\n\n       On January 25, 2001, we were $65 billion in the red.\n       On February 27, 2001, we were $53 billion in the red.\n       On April 15, 2001, we were $94 billion in the red.\n       On April 30, 2001, we were $13 billion in the black.\n       On May 1, 2001, we were $23 billion in the black.\n       On June 1, 2001, we were $4 billion in the black.\n       On June 7, 2001, the President signed the $1.7 trillion tax \n     cut.\n       On June 15, 2001, we were $41 billion in the black.\n       On June 28, 2001, we were $52 billion in the red.\n       On September 10, 2001, we were $99 billion in the red.\n       On September 30, 2001, the end of the fiscal year, we were \n     $141 billion in the red.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, we have on January 25 the chairman of \nthe Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, saying we are paying down too much \ndebt.\n  On February 27, 2001, the President submitted his budget for the \nfirst time, and he said, in essence, I protect Social Security. I have \n$2.6 trillion to protect Social Security. I have $2 trillion for \ndefense and domestic programs, and I have $1 trillion for unforeseen \ncircumstances.\n  At the time Chairman Greenspan spoke, we were still in the red in \ndeficits--$65 billion. When the distinguished President spoke on \nFebruary 27 for the first time to Congress, we were $53 billion in the \nred. On April 15, the income tax time to make the returns, we were $94 \nbillion in the red. But with all the tax payments coming in on April \n15, by April 30 we were in the black by $13 billion. On May 1, we were \n$23 billion in the black. On June 1, we were $4 billion in the black. \nFrom the end of April to the first of June, we were in the black. But \non June 7, the President signed the $1.7 billion tax cut, and by June \n28, 20 days after he put his signature to the tax cut, we were $52 \nbillion in the red. On September 10, we were $99 billion in the red.\n  They all said 9/11 caused this deficit. No. The day before 9/11, we \nwere already, as a result of the tax cut, $99 billion in the red when \nthe President was talking about $1 trillion for unforeseen \ncircumstances. We have only authorized since 9/11 for the 2002 war on \nterrorism $20 billion. At the Congressional Budget Office they say 9/11 \nwill only cost us $34 billion. Give them the double amount--some $60 \nbillion that 9/11 may have cost. But it didn't cost any trillion \ndollars, and it didn't cause us to go back into the red. The tax cut is \nwhat we are suffering from. And thereby, as the Washington Post said, \nthe first rule is to stop digging. But we will be meeting on Wednesday \nand Thursday with the Budget Committee, and there they will be \ndetermined to come in with shovels and dig as deep as they possibly \ncan.\n  I happened to have fought with the French in World War II, and they \nare outstanding fighters. We are talking about NATO, how brave we are, \nhow we are going into Iraq. I wish we had the courage to pay the bill. \nThey say it is small by historical standards; that is, the deficit is \n2.7 percent of the gross domestic product. But when you look at the \nactual debt, when they don't use Social Security, then the deficit as a \npercent of the gross domestic product is 5.7 percent.\n  The Greenspan Commission recommended that you are not to use Social \nSecurity trust funds, as the editorial points out, and that is exactly \nhow they have lowered the deficit.\n  You see, when the editorial says, ``The deficit numbers above are \ncushioned by including $2.6 trillion from the Social Security trust \nfund,'' that is against the law, Senator. That is against, section 13-\n301, which passed the Senate 98 to 2.\n  I wanted it to pass unanimously, but I could not get Senator \nArmstrong's vote. That is the one I missed, along with Senator \nBoschwitz's. I had the greatest--and still have the greatest--respect \nfor both Senator Boschwitz and Senator Armstrong. I could not get their \nvote, but I got everyone else's. It went to President Bush senior on \nNovember 5, 1990, and he signed that into law.\n  So under law, you are not supposed to be spending Social Security \nmoneys on anything other than Social Security.\n  For the Social Security trust funds, you can see that here we have \nspent $1.489 trillion. Everybody is running around saying: Save Social \nSecurity. We are going to have to reform Social Security. We are going \nto have to do this and do that. All they need to do is quit spending \nSocial Security moneys on any and everything but Social Security. That \nis the whole problem.\n  Of course, you can see what they are spending for Medicare, military \nretirement to civilian retirement, the unemployment compensation fund, \nthe highways, the airports, the railroad retirement, and others.\n  We are spending some $2.7 trillion already of all of these other \ntrust funds. Yet we are going to do something on account of the baby \nboomers? I want to do something on account of the adults and get some \nconscience to this group up here and some awareness to the media and \neverybody to understand, let's have truth in budgeting.\n  The Secretary of the Treasury puts it out every day--the public debt, \nto the penny--and you can see how much the debt goes up. The debt clock \nis running every second in New York for the people to see. But we give \nthem Enron accounting. It is small here, and we have another figure \nhere, and everything else. So you can see we are spending a little over \n$40-some billion per month.\n  I think with that chart, and the distinguished Senator from Utah \nbeing here, I am sure I am using the Hatch rule on Estrada. Under the \nHatch rule, you said, on another Hispanic nominee we had at one time, \nthat you were worried she would be an activist and would legislate from \nthe bench. That is exactly what I am worried about with Estrada.\n  I appreciate the time of the body. I would be glad if somebody wants \nto debate Mr. Estrada. Tell them I know very little about him except \nfor the fact that when he was given the opportunity to come up to get \nmy vote for confirmation, he elected to rudely not answer. I know the \ngimmick, and I know what they are doing. I voted for Robert Bork. David \nBoren of Oklahoma and myself were the two Democrats who voted for \nRobert Bork. I am delighted to vote for conservatives. My State is \nconservative. But don't send a fellow up and think he can engage in \nthat kind of monkey business of not even answering the questions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I understand that we are on the Executive \nCalendar under the executive order; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CRAIG. And that we are considering the nomination of Miguel \nEstrada to the Tenth Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n\n[[Page S3380]]\n\n  Mr. President, I listened to my colleague from South Carolina for a \ngood number of minutes and have always been fascinated by his review of \nthe budget and budget processes.\n  I am also always frustrated by the reality of a general fund budget, \nin a comprehensive budget policy under which we operate, and the \nfungibility of moneys, and the broad general system in which we take \nSocial Security moneys, once appropriately registered in the trust \nfunds of Social Security, and then it being moved into the general fund \nof our country; that, in fact, Social Security money is spent and bonds \nare taken out or loans are made against the trust funds and interest is \nbearing and money is replaced. So to suggest that trust fund moneys \ncannot be spent once they have been appropriately accounted for is a \nfrustration.\n  But let me stop there because I came to the floor this afternoon to \nonce again speak about Miguel Estrada and his nomination and, of \ncourse, where the Senate is at this moment in time, which is not only \nimportant for all of us but important for the judiciary of our country, \nthat we are able to bring to the floor of the Senate highly qualified \nmen and women who have been appropriately vetted by the \nadministration--no matter what administration it is--and that the \nnominations of these people are reviewed by the Judiciary Committee and \nthen brought to the floor for a vote.\n  What has gone on here for well over 4 weeks is the denial of that \nopportunity to vote. We did have a vote last week. It was a cloture \nvote. It is part of the inside ball game of the Senate that oftentimes \nthose who are observers of what we do do not understand.\n  We got 55 votes, if you will, for Miguel Estrada. My goodness, that \nis 50 percent plus 5 of a 100-member body. Surely, that would confirm \nthis fine judicial nominee.\n  Quite to the contrary, it was a cloture vote. Under a cloture vote, \nwith a supermajority rule in the rules of the Senate, it simply says \nyou have to get 60 before you have the right to get 50 plus 1 of those \npresent and voting.\n  That has to be awfully confusing for anyone listening or observing. \nClearly, the rules of the Senate are to make sure that our Constitution \nis upheld, or at least a prescription of our Constitution, that \nrequires that all States enter in and are members of the United States \nunder our Constitution and are equal in the Senate. Therefore, we have \nhistorically, and appropriately so, erred on the side of protecting the \nminority. And that, of course, is the cloture process: to make sure \nthat a supermajority finally decides it is time to vote on an issue.\n  I hope that over the course of the next several weeks we can gain \ncloture and that we can get to the real vote, the honest vote, the fair \nvote, the appropriate vote of 50 plus 1 of those present and voting for \nthe confirmation of Miguel Estrada under the advice and consent clause \nof our Constitution.\n  Let me recap, for a few moments, some of the arguments we have heard \non the floor of the Senate over the last several weeks about this fine \nnominee: We are asked, if you will, to rubberstamp everyone the \nPresident sends up, and we should not inquire, we should not be \nprobative, we should not look into the individual's background.\n  Well, that is an interesting argument, but it echoes in such a hollow \nway on the floor of the Senate when you look at the reality and the \nfact that Mr. Estrada has been before the Judiciary Committee for over \n2 years and that we have had now a very extensive filibuster--or shall \nI say extended debate--that has talked about almost every aspect of \nMiguel Estrada's professional life--his career and his life in general; \nthat he was thoroughly investigated by the FBI, and those records were \nbrought to the Judiciary Committee for all of us to examine, and \nsomehow we are no ``rubberstamping,'' after literally hundreds and \nhundreds of pages of material, and the process of this investigation is \nnow compiled in the Judiciary Committee on Mr. Estrada.\n  Rubberstamping? I think not. Rubberstamping is not when any Senator \ncan vote how he or she wishes. We are not suggesting that everybody \nvote yes. We are suggesting that everybody vote--yes or no, up or \ndown--and that Mr. Miguel Estrada be given his day, as should the \nPresident be given the right to have his or her nominees brought to the \nfloor for an up-or-down vote.\n  I say to my colleagues on the other side, that ain't a rubberstamp; \nthat is doing what you are asked to do when you are sworn in as a \nMember of the Senate--to vote up or down on the issue, face the tough \nvotes, face the easy votes. I have one job here, as do 99 other \nSenators, and that is to come to the floor of the Senate and vote. That \nis what my State asks. That is the role I play for my State. That is \nall our President asks. I am quite sure that is what Miguel Estrada \nwould like.\n  Our colleagues have complained that Mr. Estrada is a ``blank slate;'' \nthat there is not enough information for Senators to be able to make a \nresponsible judgment about his ability to serve.\n  You have heard my colleague from South Carolina say not all the \nquestions have been answered. Well, Miguel Estrada has literally called \nevery Senator's office and said, ``I will come and visit with you and I \nwill respond to your questions.'' But, no, that is not good enough. We \ndon't want him in our office; we want him before the committee again \nresponding to the questions that the committee would choose to ask and, \nof course, we would like more of the record that he compiled while \nserving in the Justice Department under both Democrat and Republican \nPresidents.\n  It is a very frustrating time we have here when, in fact, that which \nthey argue has been answered not only once but twice or a hundred times \nover. When you, therefore, compile all of this and analyze the record, \nthere has to be something more than just the background, just the \ninformation. I think it is, in fact, the politics of the issue today, \nand the effort on the part of the far left to cause the Democrat Party \nto try to deny Miguel Estrada his day on the floor of the Senate in an \nup-or-down vote with Members present and voting.\n  Let me talk a little bit about some of the questions asked. I am \nquoting from a phenomenally comprehensive letter which was sent to the \nSenate by the legal counsel at the White House. I have it here. It is \n15 pages. Counsel to the President, Judge Gonzales, sent this up on \nFebruary 12. It goes into great detail. I thought for a few moments I \nwould, once again, for the record, talk of some of that detail and some \nof the answers that both Miguel Estrada has responded to and that Judge \nGonzales, legal counsel to the White House, has responded to--only for \nthose who are concerned about the Congressional Record that we compile \nhere to clearly understand that the arguments placed by the other side \nare so hollow, they have hardly no echo today, because questions have \nbeen asked and answers have been given.\n\n  Miguel Estrada answered the committee's questions--and this is \naccording to Judge Gonzales. I was not there at the time. I now serve \non the Judiciary Committee, but these questions were leveled at Miguel \nEstrada in the 107th Congress. I was not a member of the committee at \nthat time.\n\n       Miguel Estrada answered the Committee's questions \n     forthrightly and appropriately. Indeed, Miguel Estrada was \n     more expansive than many judicial nominees traditionally have \n     been in Senate hearings, and he was asked a far broader range \n     of questions than many previous appeals court nominees were \n     asked.\n\n  He goes on to catalog the questions and the answers in the area of \nrights, privacy and abortion, unenumerated rights.\n\n       When asked by Senator Edwards about the Constitution's \n     protection for rights not enumerated in the Constitution, Mr. \n     Estrada replied: ``I recognize that the Supreme Court has \n     said [on] numerous occasions in the area of privacy and \n     elsewhere that there are unenumerated rights in the \n     Constitution, and I have no view of any sort, whether legal \n     or personal, that would hinder me from applying those rulings \n     by the court. But I think the court has been quite clear that \n     there are a number of unenumerated rights in the \n     Constitution. In the main, the court has recognized them as \n     being inherent in the right of substantive due process and \n     the liberty clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n       When asked by Senator Feinstein whether the Constitution \n     encompasses a right to privacy and abortion, Mr. Estrada \n     responded, ``The Supreme Court has so held, and I have no \n     view of any nature whatsoever, whether it be legal, \n     philosophical, moral, or any other type of view that would \n     keep me from applying that case law faithfully.'' When asked \n     whether Roe v. Wade was ``settled law,'' Mr. Estrada replied, \n     ``I believe so.''\n\n\n[[Page S3381]]\n\n\n  That is a pretty straightforward answer. That is as clear as you can \nget on issues of privacy and abortion. I cannot understand why the \nother side cannot accept that as a responsible and clear answer.\n\n       General approach to judging.\n\n  In other words, what is your philosophy? How do you react?\n\n       When asked by Senator Edwards about judicial review, Mr. \n     Estrada explained: ``Courts take the laws that have been \n     passed by you [meaning the Senate] and give you the benefit \n     of understanding that you take the same oath that they do to \n     uphold the Constitution, and therefore they take the laws \n     with the presumption that they are constitutional. It is the \n     affirmative burden of the plaintiff to show that you have \n     gone beyond your oath. If they come into court, then it is \n     appropriate for courts to undertake to listen to the legal \n     arguments--why it is that the legislature went beyond [its] \n     role as a legislature and invaded the Constitution.''\n       Mr. Estrada stated to Senator Edwards that there are 200 \n     years of Supreme Court precedent and that it is not the case \n     that ``the appropriate conduct of the courts is to be guided \n     solely by the bare text of the Constitution because that is \n     not the legal system that we have.\n\n  In other words, he was talking to that precedent in relation to the \nstrictness of the Constitution.\n\n       When asked by Senator Edwards whether he was a strict \n     constructionist, Mr. Estrada replied that he was ``a fair \n     constructionist,'' meaning that, ``I don't think that it \n     should be the goal of the courts to be strict or lax. The \n     goal of the court is to be right. . . . It is not necessarily \n     the case in my mind that, for example, all parts of the \n     Constitution are suitable for the same type of interpretive \n     analysis. . . . [T]he Constitution says, for example, that \n     you must be 35 years old to be our chief executive. . . . \n     There are areas of the Constitution that are more open-ended. \n     And you adverted to one, like the substantive component of \n     due process clauses, where there are other methods of \n     interpretation that are not quite so obvious that the court \n     has brought to bear to try to bring forth what the \n     appropriate answer should be.\n\n  That is an understandable answer when the law is as specifically as \n35 years; that is interpretive. When the Constitution gives you the \nopportunity for some interpretation, of due process, then of course \nthat goes to the fairmindedness of the individual judge involved within \nthe framework of precedent so ruled.\n  When Senator Kohl asked him about the environmental statutes, for \nexample, Mr. Estrada explained that those statutes come to court with a \n``strong presumption of constitutionality.'' In other words, there is a \npresumption that those laws that the Congress of the United States \npasses are constitutional by their passage, only later to be tested in \nthe courts to find out how constitutional or if they can withstand that \ntest.\n  In response to Senator Leahy, Mr. Estrada described the most \nimportant attributes of a judge:\n\n       The most important quality for a judge, in my view, Senator \n     Leahy, is to have an appropriate process for decisionmaking. \n     That entails having an open mind. It entails listening to the \n     parties, reading the briefs, going back beyond those briefs \n     and doing all of the legwork needed to ascertain who is right \n     in his or her claims as to what the law says and what the \n     facts [are]. In a court of appeals court, where judges sit in \n     panels of three, it is important to engage in deliberation \n     and give ear to the views of colleagues who may have come to \n     different conclusions. And in sum, to be committed to judging \n     as a process that is intended to give us the right answer, \n     not to a result.\n\n  In other words, not to what had been planned or anticipated but the \nright answer in relation to the law and the Constitution.\n\n       And I can give you my level best solemn assurance that I \n     firmly think I do have those qualities or else I would not \n     have accepted the nomination.\n\n  Here, of course, he is talking about his own character, his own \nmakeup, the thinking processes that have allowed Miguel Estrada over \nthe years to rise as far as he has and to be recognized by most as a \nvery brilliant legal mind.\n  In response to Senator Durbin, Miguel Estrada stated that:\n\n       The Constitution, like other legal texts, should be \n     construed reasonably and fairly, to give effect to all that \n     its text contains.\n\n  Mr. Estrada indicated to Senator Durbin that he admires the judges \nfor whom he clerked: Justice Kennedy, Judge Kearse, as well as Justice \nLewis Powell.\n  Miguel Estrada stated to Senator Durbin:\n\n       I can absolutely assure the committee that I will follow \n     binding Supreme Court precedent until and unless such \n     precedent has been displaced with subsequent decisions by the \n     Supreme Court itself.\n\n  That is an interesting and a very important response to a question \nthat many will argue he has not been asked or he has denied or refused \nto answer. Let me repeat that. When asked about how he will respond to \ncertain cases brought before the court as it relates to decisions made \nby the Supreme Court, he said:\n\n       I can absolutely assure the committee that I will follow \n     binding Supreme Court precedent until and unless such \n     precedent has been displaced by subsequent decisions of the \n     Supreme Court itself.\n\n  In response to Senator Grassley, Mr. Estrada stated:\n\n       When facing a problem for which there is not a decisive \n     precedent from a higher court, my cardinal rule would be to \n     seize aid from any place where I can get it. Depending on the \n     nature of the problem, that would include related case law in \n     other areas that higher courts had dealt with that had some \n     insight to teach with respect to the problem at hand. It \n     could include the history of the enactment, including \n     a statute's legislative history. It should include the \n     custom and practice under any statute or document. It \n     should include the views of the academicians to the extent \n     they purport to analyze what the law is, instead of \n     prescribing what it should be. And in sum, as Chief \n     Justice Marshall once said, to attempt not to overlook \n     anything from which aid might be derived.\n\n  There is a very open, probative, bright mind responding to that kind \nof question. You go to the resources at hand to ultimately compile the \ninformation from which to make a decision, to make judgment.\n  In response to Senator Sessions, Mr. Estrada said:\n\n       I am firmly of the view that although we all have views on \n     a number of subjects from A to Z, the first duty of a judge \n     is to self-consciously put that aside and look at each case \n     by starting withholding judgment with an open mind and an \n     answer to the parties. So I think the job of a judge is to \n     put all of that aside and, to the best of his human capacity, \n     to give a judgment based solely on the arguments and the law.\n\n  Again, straightforward, very clear answers with which I think all \nshould be satisfied.\n  In response to Senator Sessions, Mr. Estrada stated:\n\n       I will follow binding case law in every case. I may have a \n     personal, moral, philosophical view on the subject matter, \n     but I undertake to you that I would put all that aside and \n     decide in accordance with binding case law and even in \n     accordance with the case law that is not binding but seems \n     constructive on that area, without any influence whatsoever \n     from my personal view I may have about the subject matter.\n\n  The letter goes on to deal with Miranda, with congressional \nauthority, ethnicity, racial discrimination, right to counsel, \ncongressional authority to regulate firearms--phenomenally complete \nresponses to very critical questions that speak to the mind and the \nlegal training of a tremendous talent whose nomination we now have \nbefore us.\n  Somehow that is not good enough. Somehow our colleagues on the other \nside, time and again, have said: No, no, we need to go back to the \ncommittee to ask the questions. We need now all of the legal drafts and \nthe memos that are a part of Mr. Estrada's record at the Justice \nDepartment when he worked there for both Presidents Bush, Sr. and \nPresident Clinton and, of course, Democrats and Republicans alike have \nsaid those are simply off the record and we cannot go there, nor should \nwe go there.\n  The question is: Why go there at this time when we now have such a \nvery complete record that speaks to the mind, the temperament, the \njudgment, the talent of Miguel Estrada? I think the answer is quite \nsimple: We should not.\n  There is a simpler answer, and it is one we seek and one we have \nasked our colleagues for, and that is the right for an up-or-down vote \non the floor of the Senate. Under the advise and consent clause of our \nConstitution, I am one who firmly believes that is the responsibility \nof the Senate, to review, to analyze, to be probative, as we have, but \nultimately to bring a President's nominee to the floor for the purpose \nof a vote, a 50-percent plus 1 vote of those present and voting. I \nfirmly believe that.\n  We are going to continue to pursue the confirmation of Miguel \nEstrada, as we must. We can simply not allow a nominee to come to the \nfloor and for those who are in opposition to simply\n\n[[Page S3382]]\n\nfilibuster until all are exhausted and we all retreat into the shadows \nbecause no one wants to vote up or down. That is quite the opposite in \nthis case. We clearly do need a vote. We want a vote. Let us not hide \nbehind the supermajority in this instance. That is not an excuse for \nthe ultimate oath of office that we have taken and the responsibility \nthat we have at hand as Senators.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Mikulski are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Jeffords are found in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I inquire of the Presiding Officer, are we \nnow automatically returned to the period of time allocated to the \npending nomination for the circuit court of appeals?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is now in executive session on the \nEstrada nomination. That is the pending order of business.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, article II, section 2 of the Constitution provides \nthat the President:\n\n       Shall nominate by, and by and with the Advice and Consent \n     of the Senate, shall appoint . . . Judges of the supreme \n     Court, and all other Officers of the United States. . . .\n\n  As I read that historic phrase, and reflect and study on the history \nbehind it, I reach the conclusion that these are coequal powers as it \nrelates to the Federal judiciary responsibilities. They are balanced \npowers and, as such, they give strength to that time-honored doctrine \nof checks and balances between the three separate but coequal branches \nof our Federal Government.\n  The debate before us today goes to the very heart of our Constitution \nand the doctrine of checks and balances. As such, we should examine the \nvery roots of our Republic to determine these respective \nresponsibilities of the three branches of our Government.\n  The magnificence of the ``great experiment,'' a term used by the \nskeptics of the work of our Founding Fathers, is what has enabled our \nRepublic to stand today, after over 200 years, as the longest surviving \ndemocratic form of government still in existence.\n  I remember one time I used that phrase in an audience of some very \nerudite individuals. One person jumped to their feet and said: Oh, no, \nSwitzerland. And I reminded them that Napoleon crossed the Alps and \nsevered the continuity of that wonderful government.\n  So there we are, these proud States, forming our Republic known as \nthe United States. The survival of that great experiment is dependent \nupon the continuous fulfillment of the balanced, individual \nresponsibilities of the three branches of our Government.\n  I reflect now on the history of that clause ``advice and consent.''\n  During the Constitutional Convention, the Framers labored extensively \nover this clause, deferring for several months a final decision on how \nto select Federal judges. Some of the Framers argued that the President \nshould have absolute and total authority to choose members of the \njudiciary. Others thought both the House of Representatives and the \nSenate should be involved in providing advice and consent. Ultimately, \na compromise plan put forth by that distinguished Virginian, James \nMadison, won the day where the President would nominate the judges, and \nonly the Senate, only one branch of the Congress, would render advice \nand consent. Such a process is entirely consistent with the system of \nchecks and balances, that inherent doctrine in the Constitution that \nthe Framers carefully placed throughout many provisions of the \nConstitution.\n  Presidents select those who should serve on the judiciary, thereby \nproviding a philosophical composition of that President and the times \nin which he is privileged to serve in that office. However, the Senate \nhas a check on the President because it is the final arbiter with \nrespect to a nominee. But I look at those responsibilities as coequal, \na check and a balance, but neither branch of Government, executive nor \nthe legislative, has a power greater. I think they are coequal in the \nexercise of joint responsibility to, in fact, create the third branch, \nthe Federal judiciary, through this process.\n\n  Historically, judicial nominations have needed only a majority of \nvotes in the Senate for confirmation. I think that long history is for \ngood reason. It is to preserve the inherent checks and balances and the \ncoequal responsibility between the two branches in creating the \njudiciary. Only once, in these 200-plus years, has a judicial nominee \nbeen rejected by the Senate due to a filibuster. That was Abe Fortas, a \nnominee for the Supreme Court.\n  Indeed, a simple majority of votes in support of the confirmation of \na nominee is also consistent with the Constitution which specifically \nspells out instances where, for example, a supermajority of votes is \nneeded. For example, under the Constitution, two-thirds of the Senate \nmust vote to ratify a treaty. Two-thirds of the Senate must vote to \nconvict on an article of impeachment. Two-thirds of a House of Congress \nmust vote to expel a Member of that body. Two-thirds of each House of \nCongress must vote to override a President's veto, and two-thirds of \neach House must vote to propose an amendment to the Constitution.\n  So when the Framers wanted to change the power structure as it \nrelates to the respective duties of the branches, it did so expressly \nby creating the two-thirds supermajority vote.\n  In this instance, we are talking about a Senate rule which requires \n60 votes to stop a filibuster. It is not constitutional. It is a Senate \nrule. The Framers did not think a supermajority was needed. The Framers \nprobably did not have in mind the possibility someday of a 60-vote \nfilibuster.\n  So I come back that it is clear that the Constitution wanted to have \na coequal responsibility and balance of power between the two branches \nas it related to their respective functions in forming and creating the \nFederal judiciary.\n  If the Framers intended judicial nominees to be subjected to a \nsupermajority vote, they would have included such language in the \nConstitution. In my view, the reason they did not include a \nsupermajority requirement in regard to judicial confirmations is that \notherwise it might prove too difficult for certain judicial nominees to \nbe confirmed. If the bar was set too high, then the Senate would have \nfar more power in the judicial process than the President. The checks \nand balances concept of our Founding Fathers would cease.\n  Is this what the Framers intended, that that inherent balance of \npower should in any way be violated? Absolutely not. We do not want the \nchecks and balances concept to cease in the case of judicial \nnominations.\n  I recognize the filibuster, a rule created by the Senate itself and \nnot by the Constitution, obviously does require the Senate to have 60 \nvotes in certain circumstances in order for it to proceed. But in the \ncontext of judicial nominations, use of the filibuster to defeat a \nnominee would thwart the carefully crafted system of checks and \nbalances put into place in our Constitution by the infinite wisdom of \nthe Framers of that Constitution.\n\n[[Page S3383]]\n\n  Throughout the quarter of a century I have been privileged and had \nthe honor of representing the Commonwealth of Virginia in the Senate, I \nhave conscientiously in each of those years under all of the Presidents \nI have served with made the effort to work on judicial nominations in a \nfair and objective way, recognizing the doctrine of checks and balances \nand the coequal authority of the two branches.\n  Whether our President was President Carter, President Ronald Reagan, \nPresident George Bush, President Clinton, or President George W. Bush, \nI have been privileged to accord equal weight to the nominations of all \nPresidents, irrespective of party. I have done so because of my belief \nthat if the concept of equal power sharing and the concept of checks \nand balances was lost in the judicial confirmation process, then we may \nultimately discourage many highly qualified men and women nominees from \noffering to serve in our judiciary.\n  Certainly each Senator is entitled to vote for or against a \nparticular nominee for any reason he or she deems important. And it is \nclear our Framers did not intend the Senate's role in the advice and \nconsent process to be a rubberstamp. No one is suggesting that. \nExercise your authority. Exercise your judgment. Do it fairly. Do it \nconsistently with the doctrine of checks and balances inherent in the \nConstitution.\n  This much is evident from history. Soon after the Constitution was \nratified, the Senate rejected a nomination put forward by our first \nPresident, our founding father, George Washington.\n  President Washington nominated John Rutledge to serve on the U.S. \nSupreme Court. Even though Mr. Rutledge had previously served as a \ndelegate to the Constitutional Convention, the Senate rejected his \nnomination. It is interesting to note many of those Senators who voted \nagainst the Rutledge nomination were also delegates to the \nConstitutional Convention.\n  The key differences between the Rutledge nomination of over 200 years \nago and the Estrada nomination of today is that Mr. Rutledge received \nan up-or-down vote. A simple majority controlled. The early Members of \nour Senate, some of whom participated in the Constitutional Convention, \nallowed an up-or-down vote on Mr. Rutledge even though they opposed \nhim.\n  On the other hand, Mr. Estrada has not received a vote and he is \nbeing subjected to a filibuster-proof majority for confirmation.\n  Our Founding Fathers, I say to my colleagues, were not so prudent of \nthe requirement for the 60 votes.\n  Mr. Estrada is being opposed simply because of his political \nideology. In the view of this Senator we ought to accord equal weight \nto a President's nominees, irrespective of party. I have tried to abide \nby this principle throughout my 25 years in the U.S. Senate.\n  For example, in the 106th Congress and the 107th Congress, I was \nhonored to support the nomination of Roger Gregory. Judge Gregory was \noriginally nominated by President Clinton and he was supported by \nVirginia's former Democratic Governor Doug Wilder.\n  Regardless of political ideologies, and regardless of which President \nnominated him, Judge Gregory was highly qualified to sit on the bench. \nWe are fortunate to have him on the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe Fourth Circuit. Judge Gregory is now the first African American \nJudge to ever serve on the United States Court of Appeals for the \nFourth Circuit, and he is serving with distinction.\n  Judge Gregory's qualifications were clear cut. Regardless of which \nPresident nominated him, he deserved the support of the United States \nSenate.\n  Like Judge Gregory, Miguel Estrada's nomination is also a clear-cut \ncase.\n  Mr. Estrada has received a unanimous ranking of ``well qualified'' by \nthe American Bar Association. In my view, his record indicates that he \nwill serve as an excellent jurist.\n  Mr. Estrada's resume is an impressive one. Born in Honduras, Miguel \nEstrada came to the United States at the age of 17. At the time, he was \nable to speak only a little English. But, just 5 years after he came to \nthe United States, he graduated from Columbia College with Phi Beta \nKappa honors.\n  Three years after he graduated from Columbia, Mr. Estrada graduated \nfrom Harvard Law School where he was an editor of the Harvard Law \nReview.\n  Mr. Estrada then went onto serve as a law clerk to a Judge on the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit and as a law clerk \nto Judge Kennedy on the United States Supreme Court.\n  After his clerkships, Mr. Estrada worked as an Assistant United \nStates Attorney, as an assistant to the Solicitor General in the \nDepartment of Justice, and in private practice for two prestigious law \nfirms.\n  Throughout his career, Mr. Estrada has prosecuted numerous cases \nbefore federal district courts and federal appeals courts. He has \nargued 15 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Without a doubt, Mr. Estrada's legal credentials make him well \nqualified for the position to which he was nominated. I am thankful for \nhis willingness to resume his public service, and I am confident that \nhe would serve as an excellent jurist.\n  In closing, Mr. President, it is clear to me that the Senate's role \nin the confirmation process is more than just a mere rubber-stamp of a \nPresident's nomination; but it is the Senate's constitutional \nresponsibility to render ``advice and consent'' after a fair process of \nevaluating a President's nominee. After that process is complete, \nnominees who emerge from the Judiciary Committee ought to be accorded \nup or down vote.\n  Should a Senate rule overrule the Constitutional responsibilities of \nchecks and balances? I think it should not.\n  Thomas Jefferson once remarked on the independence of our three \nbranches of government by stating, ``The leading principle of our \nConstitution is the independence of the Legislature, Executive, and \nJudiciary of Each other.''\n  I would add that each branch of government must perform its \nrespective responsibilities in a fair and timely manner to ensure that \nthe three branches remain independent.\n  In my view, we must ask ourselves:\n  Is the current filibuster of Miguel Estrada's consistent with our \ncountry's last 200 plus years since our Constitution was ratified?\n  Are we fulfilling our constitutional responsibilities to preserve the \ndoctrine of checks and balances?\n  In my view, we don't want to set a precedent that alters the inherent \nresponsibilities of checks and balances in the judicial confirmation \nprocess.\n  But, these questions are for each Senator to decide upon.\n  I for one, though, fear the precedent that would be set if the Senate \ndoes not support cloture for Miguel Estrada and I fear what it might \nmean for the future of our Judiciary, and the future of our Republic.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nscheduled vote this evening on the Frost nomination now occur at 5:45, \nprovided that debate time from 5 p.m. to 5:45 p.m. be equally divided \nas under the earlier order.\n  Mr. REID.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to consideration of S. 3, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3) to prohibit the procedure commonly known as \n     partial-birth abortion.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, we are now on a piece of legislation \nknown\n\n[[Page S3384]]\n\nas the partial-birth abortion bill. It is a bill we have debated in the \nSenate in two previous Congresses on four different occasions. We \ndebated it the first time and passed it. It was vetoed by the \nPresident, President Clinton at the time, back in 1996. Then we \nattempted to override the President's veto and fell just a few votes \nshort.\n  We came back the next session, went through the same process, sent \nthe bill to the President, he vetoed it again, and we came closer but \nwe still failed in overriding the President's veto.\n  Subsequently, there were a whole series--actually, concurrent with \nthat debate--of States, over half the States in the Union, that passed \nbans on this horrific partial-birth abortion procedure. That is the \nprocedure where the baby is delivered--this is a baby at over 20 weeks \ngestation; in other words, halfway through the pregnancy. The \ngestational period is 40 weeks. This procedure is only performed on \nbabies in utero after 20 weeks. So these are late-term abortions.\n  The process is as follows: A woman shows up and decides she wants to \nhave an abortion after 20 weeks. A doctor decides to use this \nmethodology. The woman is given a drug to dilate her cervix. She is \nsent home. Two days later she returns, and the baby is then delivered \nin a breech position. Under the definition of this act as currently \nconstituted, the baby has to be alive when it is brought in through the \nbirth canal, the baby has to be in a breech position, has to be outside \nthe mother at least past the navel, and be alive. Then the baby is \nkilled in a fashion that I will describe in more detail later.\n  That procedure, as I said, was banned by over 25 States. It was \nbrought, obviously, to the courts by many in those States. There were a \ncouple of circuit courts that found this to be constitutional, one that \ndid not. The Supreme Court took one of those cases, the Nebraska case \nthat was appealed to the circuit, and made a decision which I think was \nin error. It was a horrible decision, but a decision I think we need to \ncontemplate here. It is a decision that said that an abortion past 20 \nweeks of a child that would otherwise be born alive is now encompassed \nby Roe v. Wade.\n  You hear a lot of comments about Roe v. Wade, that Roe v. Wade only \nallows legal abortions within the first trimester and under limited \ncircumstances in the second trimester. These are babies in the second \nand third trimester, where the courts have basically said, as many of \nus who have been studying this issue for a long time have said, that \nthere is no limitation on the right to abortion. Abortion is a right \nthat is absolute in America. There are no limitations, as a result of \ncourt decisions, on the right to an abortion.\n  So they held, in this case, that the language of the statute was too \nvague and that--the description of the procedure was too vague, and \nthat there needed to be a health exception to this procedure; in other \nwords, to preserve the health of the mother.\n\n  We have responded to that with a bill we introduced last year, in the \nlast session of Congress. In the last session of Congress, we \nintroduced a piece of legislation in the House that was passed. Steve \nChabot, at the time chairman of the Constitution Subcommittee on the \nJudiciary Committee, passed a piece of legislation in the House that \nbanned this procedure. It is identical to the bill that is on the floor \ntoday. We asked for its consideration last year.\n  I came to the floor on a couple of occasions and asked for unanimous \nconsent to bring this bill forward. I agreed to debate it on Fridays \nand Mondays, so as not to interrupt the rest of the Senate's schedule, \nI agreed to stay on the weekend if that was necessary so we could deal \nwith amendments. Unfortunately, even though the bill passed in July of \nlast year, it was not scheduled here on the Senate floor for debate and \nfor passage--for action.\n  That is why I believe this is unfinished business from last year and \none of the reasons I advocated for its early consideration this year. I \nthank our leader, Senator Frist, for his willingness to bring this bill \nto the floor promptly, for us to be able to have this debate, to look \nat the issues involved with respect to this issue.\n  We believe the issues the Supreme Court brought up with respect to \nthe infirmities in the Nebraska statute have been addressed by this \nlegislation. First, we have gone into much greater detail in describing \nthis procedure, and either later tonight or tomorrow I will read the \ntext of the bill and I will provide graphic illustration as to how this \nprocedure is conducted.\n  Second, we dealt with the issue of health. Roe v. Wade requires a \nhealth exception when the health of the mother is potentially in \ndanger. We have included in this legislation a voluminous amount of \nmaterial that shows clearly, without dispute, in my mind--without \ndispute, period, not just in my mind--without any medical dispute, that \nthere are no reasons this procedure has to be available for the health \nof the mother because there are no instances in which this procedure is \nrequired for the health of the mother. There is no medical organization \nout there that believes that to be the case.\n  While some do not support the legislation or have a neutral position, \nnobody has come forward and said this is medically necessary to protect \nthe health of the mother, much less, by the way, the life of the \nmother.\n  So, since there is no reason for a health exception because there are \nno instances where a health exception is needed, then Roe does not \napply. So we have laid that out very clearly in this legislation. We \nbelieve as a result of that, Congress has the right--because we do a \nheck of a lot more exhaustive study, in our deliberations with hearings \nand other testimony, than the Supreme Court can. They have to rely on \nthe record of the lower court and the arguments made to that lower \ncourt.\n  In the case of Nebraska, frankly, the arguments were not particularly \nwell put and the evidence was not particularly robust for either side. \nIt was a very weak record, and the court made a decision based on that \nrecord. They will have a different record before them in this case when \nit is brought up to the court, and I believe the record will be clear \nand dispositive that no health exception is necessary. We have dealt \nwith the constitutional issues. Now we are back to the focus of this \nlegislation. Do you want to allow a horrific procedure that is not \nmedically necessary, never medically indicated, not taught in any \nmedical school in this country, not recommended, and which, in fact, \nmajor health organizations of this country have said is bad medicine, \ncontra-indicated, that is so brutal in the way it is administered to a \nbaby that otherwise would be born alive?\n\n  Let me emphasize that it is a baby fetus--some will refer to it as \nthe child in utero--that would otherwise be born alive. You don't want \nto allow this child to be brutally killed by thrusting a pair of \nscissors into the back of its skull and suctioning its brains out.\n  This goes on in America thousands of times a year. The number of \npartial-birth abortions has tripled, according to the abortion industry \nthat doesn't keep very good records. They admit that. It has tripled, \nthey say, to 2,200. Oddly enough, back in 1997 when we were debating \nthis, the Bergen County Record took the bother of asking the local \nabortion clinic how many they did just in Bergen County. The partial-\nbirth abortion national number at that time was 600. In Bergen County, \nthey did 1,500. I guess they dismissed that.\n  The bottom line is that this goes on an enormous amount of times and \nthey call it a rare procedure. If we had a procedure that killed 2,200 \nchildren in America every single year, we would not be saying it is a \nrare procedure in America. If we had a disease that affected 2,200 \nlittle babies every year, we wouldn't say this is a rare thing when we \nknow, by the way, that the number is multiples of that. The people we \nhave to rely on for that information are the people who want this to be \nlegal and who don't tell us about the abortions they perform.\n  This is something that needs to be done. I am hopeful that we can \ndeal with this issue in an expeditious fashion, get this over in the \nHouse of Representatives and have them pass it, and have the President \nsign it, because he will sign it.\n  I think there is broad bipartisan support for this legislation as \nthere has been in the past. It is overwhelmingly supported by the \nAmerican people. A very large majority support this legislation. Even \nthose who do not consider themselves pro-life believe that at\n\n[[Page S3385]]\n\nsome point we have to draw the line on the brutal killing of a child \nliterally inches from constitutional protection--inches from being born \nand being completely separated from the mother, being held in the birth \ncanal and executed, having scissors thrust into the base of its skull \nand then to have a suction catheter inserted and the ``cranial \ncontent'' removed.\n  Just to describe it here sends chills down your back. Yet people will \ndefend this procedure and say that a civilized nation such as America \nbelieves this is proper medicine. Medicine, healing? I, frankly, don't \nknow who is healed in that situation. I do not know who is protected in \nthat situation when every credible medical core organization says it is \nnot medically necessary; in fact, it is ``bad medicine,'' and it is \nharmful to the woman. I have just described how harmful it is to the \nlittle child.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in passing this piece of legislation \nand ending this outrageous procedure.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, could you advise me when I have used 9 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so advise.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, there have been so many misstatements made on this \nfloor right now in just a few minutes that I don't know where to start.\n  Why don't I start with the whole point that we have made over and \nover again. We are Senators. We are not doctors. With all due respect \nto my friend from Pennsylvania, if my daughter were in trouble with \npregnancy, I wouldn't go to him. I would go to her OB-GYN. And I would \nsay, Tell us what do we have to do to make sure this birth goes well, \nand tell us what we have to do to make sure our daughter's life will \nnot end and that her health will not be impaired forever. I would not \ngo to the Senator from Pennsylvania in that circumstance.\n  There are many arguments that we will lay out. Today, we only have a \nfew very short minutes. Senator Murray and I are going to share the \ntime. We have a number of amendments that we are going to offer during \nthis week to talk about what we think is very important for women's \nhealth, and, frankly, the health of their families and their children.\n  This bill, S. 3, is called the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. It \nshould be called the following: The ``Criminalizing Medically Necessary \nProcedures Act,'' because the procedures that are banned are necessary \nto save the life and the health of a woman facing a medical emergency \nduring a pregnancy.\n  My friend from Pennsylvania makes light of it. Oh, this doesn't hurt \nwomen. This is fine for women. Let me tell you who agrees with us and \nwho disagrees with the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  To start, I have a letter that I ask unanimous consent be printed in \nthe Record from Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                   March 10, 2003.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: We are writing to urge you to stand in \n     defense of women's reproductive health and vote against S. 3, \n     legislation regarding so-called ``partial birth'' abortion.\n       We are practicing obstetrician-gynecologists, and academics \n     in obstetrics, gynecology and women's health. We believe it \n     is imperative that those who perform terminations and manage \n     the pre- and post-operative care of women receiving abortions \n     are given a voice in a debate that has largely ignored the \n     two groups whose lives would be most affected by this \n     legislation: physicians and patients.\n       It is misguided and unprincipled for lawmakers to legislate \n     medicine. We all want safe and effective medical procedures \n     for women; on that there is no dispute. However, the business \n     of medicine is not always palatable to those who do not \n     practice it on a regular basis. The description of a number \n     of procedures--from liposuction to cardiac surgery--may seem \n     distasteful to some, and even repugnant to others. When \n     physicians analyze and debate surgical techniques among \n     themselves, it is always for the best interest of the \n     patient. Abortion is proven to be one of the safest \n     procedures in medicine, significantly safer than childbirth, \n     and in fact has saved numerous women's lives.\n       While we can argue as to why this legislation is dangerous, \n     deceptive and unconstitutional--and it is--the fact of the \n     matter is that the text of the bill is so vague and \n     misleading that there is a great need to correct the \n     misconceptions around abortion safety and technique. It is \n     wrong to assume that a specific procedure is never needed; \n     what is required is the safest option for the patient, and \n     that varies from case to case.\n\n                               The Facts\n\n       (1) So-called ``partial birth'' abortion does not exist.\n       There is no mention of the term ``partial birth'' abortion \n     in any medical literature. Physicians are never taught a \n     technique called ``partial birth'' abortion and therefore are \n     unable to medically define the procedure.\n       What is described in the legislation, however, could ban \n     all abortions. ``What this bill describes, albeit in non-\n     medical terms, can be interpreted as any abortion,'' stated \n     one of our physician members. ``Medicine is an art as much as \n     it is a science; although there is a standard of care, each \n     procedure--and indeed each woman--is different. The \n     wording here could apply to any patient.'' The bill's \n     language is too vague to be useful; in fact, it is so \n     vague as to be harmful. It is intentionally unclear and \n     deceptive.\n       2) Physicians need to have all medical options available in \n     order to provide the best medical care possible.\n       Tying the hands of physicians endangers the health of \n     patients. It is unethical and dangerous for legislators to \n     dictate specific surgical procedures. Until a surgeon \n     examines the patient, she does not necessarily know which \n     technique or procedure would be in the patient's best \n     interest. Banning procedures puts women's health at risk.\n       3) Politicians should not legislate medicine.\n       To do so would violate the sanctity and legality of the \n     physician-patient relationship. The right to have an abortion \n     is constitutionally-protected. To falsify scientific evidence \n     in an attempt to deny women that right is unconscionable and \n     dangerous.\n       The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecology, \n     representing 45,000 ob-gyns, agrees: ``The intervention of \n     legislative bodies into medical decisionmaking is \n     inappropriate, ill advised, and dangerous.''\n       The American Medical Women's Association, representing \n     10,000 female physicians, is opposed to an abortion ban \n     because it ``represents a serious impingement on the rights \n     of physicians to determine appropriate medical management for \n     individual patients.''\n\n                              The Science\n\n       We know that there is no such technique as ``partial \n     birth'' abortion, and we believe this legislation is a \n     thinly-veiled attempt to outlaw all abortions. Those \n     supporting this legislation seem to want to confuse both \n     legislators and the public about which abortion procedures \n     are actually used. Since the greatest confusion seems to \n     center around techniques that are used in the second and \n     third trimesters, we will address those: dilation and \n     evacuation (D), dilation and extraction (D), \n     instillation, hysterectomy and hysterotomy (commonly known as \n     a c-section).\n       Dilation and evacuation (D) is the standard approach for \n     second-trimester abortions. The only difference between a D \n     and a more common, first-trimester vacuum aspiration is that \n     the cervix must be further dilated. Morbidity and mortality \n     studies indicate that this surgical method is preferable to \n     labor induction methods (instillation), hysterotomy and \n     hysterectomy.\n       From the years 1972-76, labor induction procedures carried \n     a maternal mortality rate of 16.5 (note: all numbers listed \n     are out of 100,000); corresponding rate for D was 10.4. \n     From 1977-82, labor induction fell to 6.8, but D dropped to \n     3.3. From 1983-87, induction methods had a 3.5 mortality \n     rate, while D fell to 2.9. Although the difference between \n     the methods shrank by the mid-1980s, the use of D had \n     already quickly outpaced induction, thus altering the size of \n     the sample.\n       Morbidity trends indicate that dilation and evacuation is \n     much safer than labor induction procedures, and for women \n     with certain medical conditions, e.g., coronary artery \n     disease or asthma, labor induction can pose serious risks. \n     Rates of major complications from labor induction were more \n     than twice as high as those from D There are instances of \n     women who, after having failed induction, acquired infections \n     necessitating emergency D, which ultimately saved her \n     fertility and, in some instances, her life. Hysterotomy and \n     hysterectomy, moreover, carry a mortality rate seven times \n     that of induction techniques and ten times that of D\n       There is a psychological component which makes D \n     preferable to labor induction; undergoing difficult, \n     expensive and painful labor for up to two days is extremely \n     emotionally and psychologically draining, much more so than a \n     surgical procedure that can be done in a few hours under \n     general or local anesthesia. Furthermore, labor induction \n     does not always work: Between 15 and 30 percent of cases \n     require surgery to complete the procedure. There is no \n     question that D is the safest method of second-trimester \n     abortion.\n       There is also a technique known as dilation and extraction \n     (D). D is merely a variant of D There is a dearth of \n     data on D as it is an uncommon procedure. However, it is \n     sometimes a physician's preferred\n\n[[Page S3386]]\n\n     method of termination for a number of reasons: it offers a \n     woman a chance to see the intact outcome of a desired \n     pregnancy, thus speeding up the grieving process; it provides \n     a greater chance of acquiring valuable information regarding \n     hereditary illness or fetal anomaly; and there is a \n     decreased risk of injury to the woman, as the procedure is \n     quicker than induction and involves less use of sharp \n     instruments in the uterus, providing a lesser chance of \n     uterine perforations or tears and cervical lacerations.\n       It is important to note that these procedures are used at \n     varying gestational ages. Neither a D nor a D is \n     equivalent to a late-term abortion. D and D are used \n     solely based on the size of the fetus, the health of the \n     woman, and the physician's judgment, and the decision \n     regarding which procedure to use is done on a case-by-case \n     basis.\n\n                            The Legislation\n\n       Because this legislation is so vague, it would outlaw D \n     and D (and arguably techniques used in the first-\n     trimester). Indeed, the Congressional findingsl--which go \n     into detail, albeit in non-medical terms--do not remotely \n     correlate with the language of the bill. This legislation is \n     reckless. The outcome of its passage would undoubtedly be \n     countless deaths and irreversible damage to thousands of \n     women and families. We can safely assert that without D and \n     D, that is, an enactment of S.3, we will be returning to \n     the days when an unwanted pregnancy led women to death \n     through illegal and unsafe procedures, self-inflicted \n     abortions, uncontrollable infections and suicide.\n       The cadre of physicians who provide abortions should be \n     honored, not vilified. They are heroes to millions of women, \n     offering the opportunity of choice and freedom. We urge you \n     to consider scientific data rather than partisan rhetoric \n     when voting on such far-reaching public health legislation. \n     We strongly oppose legislation intended to ban so-called \n     ``partial birth'' abortion.\n           Sincerely,\n     Natalie E. Roche, MD,\n       Assistant Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology,\n       New Jersey Medical College.\n     Gerson Weiss, MD,\n       Professor and Chair, Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology \n     and Women's Health,\n       New Jersey Medical College.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in fact, they say the so-called partial-\nbirth abortion does not exist. There is no mention of the term \n``partial-birth abortion'' in any medical literature.\n  Let me say once again for my colleagues that there is no mention of \nthe term ``partial-birth abortion'' in any medical literature. \nPhysicians are never taught a technique called partial-birth abortion \nand, therefore, are unable to medically define the procedure.\n  These physicians who are charged with protecting the life and health \nof women and babies--I might add that what is described in the \nlegislation could ban all abortions. What this bill describes can be \ninterpreted as any abortion.\n  We have a bill called the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, and there \nis no such thing as partial-birth abortions. What this does is \ncriminalize a medically necessary procedure. So let us get that on the \ntable.\n  Why then would this be before us? I think the answer lies in this \nletter from OB-GYNs. It is an attempt to outlaw all abortions, to take \naway the rights of women to choose--not only to chip away at that \nright, but to take it away, and, by the way, criminalize abortions.\n  What follows from that? Women and doctors will be in jail. That is \nwhat follows from that. And if you read behind and between the lines \nhere, when you hear my colleagues stand up, they have been fighting all \ntheir lives to outlaw abortion and to overturn Roe v. Wade. So let us \nget it on the table. That is what this is about.\n  There is a further quote in this letter that I think is worth \nmentioning.\n\n       The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecology, \n     representing 45,000 OB-GYNs, agrees: ``The intervention of \n     legislative bodies into medical decision-making is \n     inappropriate, ill-advised and dangerous.''\n\n  Let me repeat that. These are the doctors who birth our children.\n  I find it very interesting because a lot of men come out here and \ntalk about this, and women who have had pregnancies, who understand the \nrelationship that you develop with your doctor--your doctor is your \nfriend. Your doctor advises you. Your doctor tells you what your risks \nare. Your doctor, more than anything, wants a healthy child to be the \nend result of a pregnancy. That is why they go into medicine. People \nhere would put them in jail if they tried to save your life by using a \nprocedure that they know is the safest one in an emergency.\n  So repeating:\n\n       The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecology, \n     representing 45,000 ob-gyn's, [says]: ``The intervention of \n     legislative bodies into medical decision making is \n     inappropriate, ill advised, and dangerous.''\n\n  The American Medical Women's Association, women who go into healing--\nwomen who go into healing--what do they say, 10,000 female physicians? \nThey are opposed to this ban because it ``represents a serious \nimpingement on the rights of physicians to determine appropriate \nmedical management for individual patients.''\n  So here we are, with everything else happening in the world, playing \ndoctor--playing doctor--and putting women's lives at risk. It is very \nupsetting.\n  I go home every weekend. That is why I could not begin this debate on \nSaturday because I go home and I listen to my constituents. They come \nup to me--as I know my friend from Washington goes home every weekend--\nand they tug at my sleeve. Do you know what they are saying to me? Not \nban medical procedures that doctors think might be necessary to save \nthe life and health of a woman, no.\n  They are saying: Senator Boxer, we are worried. We have 250,000 \ntroops ready to go to war. We are worried. Can we avoid war? We are \nworried. We are losing our retirement nest eggs. We are worried. We \nhave lost our jobs.\n  I have a chart in the Chamber to just put this into context; that we \nare standing here debating a procedure that, if you take the definition \nof D, impacts one-tenth of 1 percent of all abortions. I do not \nhappen to agree that is what the bill does, but let's take the \nadvocates' point of view. They say it is this D, and that is one-\ntenth of 1 percent of all abortions, when these are the things people \nwant us to work on:\n  In the last 2 years, 2.5 million private-sector jobs have \ndisappeared. And I know some of those families. And 8.5 million people \nare unemployed in the United States of America; 1.1 million in \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator suspend. The Chair advises \nthe Senator she has used 9 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President. I will continue. Will the Chair \nlet me know when I have used 11 minutes, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator let us know, do you want us \nto let you know when you have used 11 more minutes or 2 more minutes?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Two additional minutes, and then I intend to yield back \nto my friend. And then Senator Murray will seek recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will advise the Senator when she has \nused 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, people are unemployed. Mortgage \nforeclosures have reached a record high. Forty-one million Americans \nhave no health insurance--no health insurance--whatsoever. Nine million \nchildren do not have health insurance coverage; 1.6 million children in \nCalifornia have no coverage.\n\n  Over 15 million Medicare beneficiaries have no prescription drug \ncoverage. And 1.5 million violent crimes were reported in the U.S. in \n2001. The crime rate is going up again, along with the unemployment \nrate.\n  We are talking about banning a medical procedure--or more than one, \nbecause the Supreme Court, by the way, in its ruling, claims the \nwording actually bans more than one procedure--we are doing that \ninstead of this.\n  Mr. President, 13.5 million eligible children do not have child care \nassistance. And 280,000 children in California are on waiting lists to \nreceive assistance.\n  There is a lot of passion about kids here. I share the passion. I \nshare the love. I share the anxiety for those children. Let's do \nsomething to help them.\n  Mr. President, 15 million children have no access to afterschool \nprograms, and the President cut the afterschool program by 40 percent.\n  One million children live within 1 mile of a toxic Superfund site, \nand the Superfund is in danger, and Superfund\n\n[[Page S3387]]\n\ncleanups are now cut in half. Talk about how it affects children. Why \ndon't we do our job instead of trying to be doctors? If we do our job, \nwe will have healthy children, get the parents health insurance, and \nthe rest.\n  Mr. President, 17 million Americans have asthma; 6 million are \nchildren. I will tell you, if you go to any school and ask the kids to \nraise their hand, a third of them will say they have had asthma.\n  And 11.6 million children are living in poverty.\n  Mr. President, I ask for 30 more seconds, and then I will stop.\n  Bottom line: We are here in a situation where we are making a \ndecision that is going to harm women. And through this debate I will \nshow you the real faces of the women who have had this procedure. Some \nare very religious Catholics. Some are very conservative Republicans. \nAnd they are fighting against this with all their heart.\n  So I do look forward to this debate because, frankly, if we can take \nthis love we all share for children and put it to good use for all of \nthese things I have talked about, maybe something good will come out of \nit.\n  I thank the Chair very much and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the Senator from California suggested \nthis procedure may be the safest one in the case of an emergency. I do \nnot have a medical degree, but I do have common sense. I cannot imagine \nthat any doctor, faced with an emergency such as preeclampsia, or any \nother kind of emergency to the health of the mother, would give a woman \na pill and send her home for 2 days and say: Come back to me in 2 days \nso I can abort your child. And that is exactly what the Senator from \nCalifornia would suggest is necessary in the case of an emergency.\n  Now, again, I do not have a medical degree. I agree with that. There \nwill be a physician who does have a medical degree who will be here \nduring this debate who will give you his opinion. That is our leader. \nBut there is no way this procedure would ever be used in the case of an \nemergency. It is a 3-day procedure.\n  You ask the doctors. I do not know whether the Senator from \nCalifornia did. Ask the doctor who designed this procedure. And it was \nasked, in hearing after hearing after hearing, and letters. The doctor \nsaid he did this for his convenience because it took him 45 minutes to \ndo your average late-term abortion, but the partial-birth abortion only \ntook 15 minutes--15 minutes after 2 days of the mother being home \nhaving her cervix dilated over time. So, please.\n  And, by the way, I have had this conversation many times on this \nfloor, where I have laid out very clearly this will never be used in \nthe case of an emergency. You will find nothing anybody with a medical \ndegree has ever written that says this will ever be used in the case of \nan emergency. But it does not fail that someone will come up and say: \nWell, you have to have this just in case of an emergency. You will \nnever use this in the case of an emergency to protect a woman's health, \nlife, or anything else. So let's just, if we can, try to stipulate to \nsome facts, No. 1.\n  No. 2, the Senator from California said this may be a medically \nnecessary procedure to save the health of the mother. That is a \nstatement I have heard numerous times. She was reading from some \nletter, which I am going to be anxious to read because I have not seen \nit. But for the past 7 years, for anybody who has questioned this \nprocedure, I have asked one question: Give me a for instance. Give me \none example where this procedure, which is not taught in medical \nschools, which is not done in hospitals--let me repeat this--not done \nin hospitals; it is done in abortion clinics, designed by \nabortionists--tell me, under what circumstances would this be a \npreferable medical procedure?\n  Never--I underscore never--have I gotten a response. Why? Because \nthere isn't an answer, other than never.\n  Yet it doesn't dissuade anybody from coming here for years and \nrepeating the same line. Oh, we may need this. This may be medically \nnecessary. Give me a for instance--just one. Give me one. Never--not \nonce, ever--has someone come here and given a for instance of when this \nwas medically necessary to preserve health, life, or anything. So I ask \nthe Senator from California, who has exited the floor, to give me an \nexample. I have been asking for years. I am a patient man.\n  Finally, she talks about how we are not doctors and we should not be \nhere regulating medical procedures. I ask the Senator from California \nif she was a sponsor of a bill in which Congress banned, in 1996, a \nprocedure known as female genital mutilation. I believe the Senator \nsupported that legislation, as did I. It banned a medical procedure. I \ndon't think the Senator from California came here and said we should \nnot ban this procedure because we are not doctors. But we did ban that \nprocedure.\n  By the way, is the procedure in the medical literature known as \nfemale genital mutilation? Answer: No. That is what Congress called it. \nDoes Congress have a right to label things what we want? Answer: Yes. \nIt may be more descriptive and real in describing what goes on than the \nmedical term, which is mumbo jumbo in some cases to us lay people. So \nthe medical term for female genital mutilation is infibulation.\n  If we came here and said we were going to ban that, everybody would \nlook at me like I am looking at that word--having no familiarity with \nit. So we put it into plain language. Why? Because our job is to \ndescribe what we are doing. We don't want to keep secrets. We do enough \nof that. We want to accurately describe what is going on.\n  The Senator from California voted to ban a medical procedure that was \nnamed in the legislation differently than the ``technical name'' used \nin medicine--the very argument she is making against this legislation. \nNot that we have to be consistent in the Senate, but I suggest if you \nare going to make arguments about what we are doing here, don't do it \nfrom a glasshouse. That is what the Senator from California is doing. I \nsee a lot of broken glass on the floor.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield myself 9 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I am dismayed and outraged that as we stand on the \nbrink of war, as a quarter million of our finest soldiers gather in the \nPersian Gulf, the Senate is here this week discussing how to \ncriminalize women's health choices. That is outrageous. I cannot \nbelieve the Senate leadership can find no more pressing national issue \nfor the Senate to consider right now than abortion.\n  I cannot believe my colleagues are so out of touch with what is going \non in America and the world that we should be debating this bill, S. 3. \nFor anyone who hasn't had time to read a newspaper or talk to a \nconstituent in the last week, I will read you some of the headlines. It \nwill help demonstrate what else we are not doing right now.\n  This is from Friday's New York Times. Headline: ``U.S. Payrolls Fall \nSharply as Jobless Rate Rises to 5.8 Percent.''\n\n       Employers shed more jobs last month at any time since the \n     immediate aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks, \n     the Labor Department reported today.\n\n  Saturday's Washington Post is even more alarming.\n\n     . . . [T]he report showed significant declines in a wide \n     range of industries, including manufacturing, construction, \n     retail trade, transportation, and some service.\n\n  How about this revelation: ``Chronic Budget Deficits Forecast,'' says \nthe Washington Post.\n\n       The Federal Government . . . faces chronic deficits that \n     only dramatic policy shifts can reverse. . . . Altogether, \n     the CBO concluded, the President's policies would leave the \n     Government with $2.7 trillion in debt through 2013, which the \n     Government would not realize if Bush's proposals were \n     rejected.\n\n  The Associated Press reported on Thursday that the Dow Jones fell to \na 5-month low. If it drops 400 more points, it will hit a 5-year low.\n  On Wednesday, we learned that ``75 million Americans had no health \ninsurance in 2001-02.''\n  Today, the New York Times reported, ``More Students Line Up at \nFinancial Aid Offices.''\n\n\n[[Page S3388]]\n\n\n       As the economic slump wears on, universities are awash in \n     financial aid requests that dwarf those of earlier years, \n     often from students who never thought of asking for help \n     before and now find themselves scrambling for ways to stay in \n     school.\n\n  On Saturday, the AP reported:\n\n       The Air Force Chief of Staff vowed to make the Air Force \n     Academy safer for female cadets. The Air Force says it has \n     investigated 54 reports of sexual assault since the academy \n     began admitting women in 1976. Many of the alleged victims \n     have said they were afraid to report the attacks because they \n     feared they would be reprimanded.\n\n  Mr. President, this is a terrible situation. I commend Senators \nAllard and Warner for their leadership in working to address that \nproblem.\n  Unfortunately, the news overseas is no better than the news at home. \nThe New York Times reported: ``North Korean Fliers Said To Have Sought \nHostages.''\n\n       The North Korean fighter jets that intercepted an unarmed \n     American sky plane over the Sea of Japan last weekend were \n     trying to force the aircraft to land in North Korea and seize \n     its crew, a senior defense official said today.\n  Today's Washington Post reports that ``Iran's Nuclear Program Speeds \nAhead; Making ``Startling' Progress.''\n\n       U.S. officials . . . described Iran's progress last week as \n     ``startling'' and ``eye-opening,'' so much so that \n     intelligence agencies are being forced to dramatically \n     shorten estimates for when Iran may acquire nuclear weapons. \n     But equally striking is the extent to which Iran's \n     breakthrough caught the United States and others by surprise.\n\n  Mr. President, these are the issues that I hear about when I am home \nin my State at the grocery store on Saturday morning. My constituents \nare terribly concerned about the economy, their jobs, their health \ncare--or their lack of a job or health care. They ask about the war in \nIraq and the threat posed by North Korea. My constituents have a vested \ninterest in resolving the North Korean crisis, as do the Senators from \nCalifornia, since they have read news reports that the Western United \nStates is potentially within range of a North Korean missile.\n  We are living in very trying times. It is challenges like these that \ntest the strength of a nation and its leaders. But for the good of the \ncountry, shouldn't we now, more than ever, put aside the wedge politics \nand get on with the real business of the American people? That is what \nthey elected us to do. That is why each one of us is here today.\n  Instead, we find ourselves on the eve of war facing a stagnant \neconomy and the Senate is here debating a woman's right to choose.\n  Someone just tuning into C-SPAN right now might think this debate is \ntaking place on another planet because it is dangerously out of sync \nwith the real threats that are facing our Nation. It shows that \nnothing--not war, not the stagnant economy--will stop hardliners in \nCongress from trying to appease their political base by pushing an \nunconstitutional, deceptive, extreme agenda on American women.\n  But do you know what? If the Senate leadership wants to debate \nabortion on the eve of war, fine, bring it on, because it is time the \nAmerican people see that they are using deceptive examples and \nmisleading information to impose extreme, unconstitutional restrictions \non a woman's health decision.\n  Throughout this debate, I want to show that the Republican proposal \nis based on misinformation and is skewed to undermine a woman's legal, \nconstitutionally protected rights.\n  I am going to go a step further and offer an amendment that would \nactually reduce the number of abortions in America and ensure that low-\nincome, pregnant women have access to health care that will reduce \ncomplications in their pregnancies and ensure healthy outcomes.\n  Like any debate on a sensitive issue, the debate on this measure is \ncomplicated. But it really comes down to one simple question: Who \ndecides what is right for a woman's health? The woman and her doctor, \nor Senators she has never met? Who decides whether or not a woman will \never be able to have children? The woman herself, or a Senator who \nknows nothing about her?\n  When you ask Americans who they believe should be making health care \ndecisions, the answer is overwhelmingly clear: The patient should \ndecide.\n  We all bristle at the idea that an insurance company or an HMO would \nstand in the way of a doctor or patient making a decision about a \nmedical test. Yet on this, the most sensitive and private and difficult \ndecision a woman may ever face, the Senate is about to insert itself \nbetween a patient, her doctor, her family, and her faith.\n  This measure would gag a doctor who is about to offer a woman a \nchoice in a potentially life-threatening or health-impairing decision. \nIt would substitute a woman's own judgment about her life and her \nfamily for the judgment of the Senate leadership.\n  With all due respect, the Senate leadership does not know what is \nbest for that woman, and neither do I, nor any other elected official. \nThe Government should not be making a woman's health decisions for her. \nShe should make them for herself, in consultation with her family, her \ndoctor, and her faith.\n  Mr. President, I will have much more to say about this and the \namendment I intend to offer, but again, I have to say that I find it so \namazing this Senate would be so out of sync with the fear and the \nanxiety in this country not because of some late-term abortion bill \nthat is brought out for political reasons, but because our country is \non the edge of a war that could change things for a long time to come. \nWe are on the edge of a war where we have thousands of young people \nstanding ready to do what this President asks. We are on the edge of a \nwar where no one knows what the consequences will be, and at the same \ntime, at home, we are facing an economy that is truly becoming one in \nwhich many people fear for their job, their health care, their ability \nto send their kids to school, and the future of this country.\n  Those are the issues we should be debating tonight, Mr. President, \nnot this issue. But we are here. We will debate it, and we will make \nthe case that it is deceptive, it is extreme, and it is \nunconstitutional.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor. I retain the remainder of \nour time.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, how much time does each side have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 3 minutes 14 \nseconds. The Senator from California has 16 seconds.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Washington if she \nwould characterize something that has, in the most recent poll, 70 \npercent support among the American people as an extreme agenda item?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I will make the case that this is \ndeceptive, it is extreme, it is unconstitutional, and I will make that \ncase over the following days.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. So the Senator believes something that has 70 percent \nsupport among the American people is extreme. OK, I am interested in \nhearing that.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. If the Senator asks me a question, I will be happy to \nrespond.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I think you did. You reiterated your position you \nbelieve this is an extreme piece of legislation even though 70 percent \nof the American people support it.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I answer that I think most Americans do \nnot know the reality of the language of the bill that is being \npresented to them, and I will make that case.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. This legislation has been around 7 years. This has been \nwritten about, described in detail in the national press, and I do not \nthink we do the American public a great service by suggesting they \ncannot read and understand very clearly what this procedure is all \nabout. I would argue probably the 30 percent who have not heard of it \nhave not read in detail exactly what goes on. I make the other \nargument. But 70 percent is a pretty good start on our side.\n\n  Second, the Senator says the Government should not get involved in \nregulating the doctor-patient relationship when it comes to women's \nhealth. Did the Senator support the female genital mutilation bill \nwhich bans a medical procedure that interferes with the doctor-patient \nrelationship between a woman and her doctor?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. That does not interfere with the doctor-patient \nrelationship, I would argue with my colleague, and I am happy to have \nthat debate. Senator Reid from Nevada has been adamant about that \nissue, and I think it\n\n[[Page S3389]]\n\nis totally separate from what we are discussing this evening.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. This is a banned medical procedure that affects the \nreproductive system of a woman. I argue that you can make the case and \nyou will ban things you agree with, but you do not want to ban things \nyou do not agree with. That does not mean the Congress does not have a \nright, when we find something to be abhorrent, that we believe is not \nin the best interest of the medical profession and women in this \ncountry and particularly, obviously, the child in the process of being \nborn, to step forward and ban what we believe are harmful and \ndestructive procedures. That is what we have done in this case.\n  The Senator from Washington spent 90 percent of the time talking \nabout anything but this bill, which leads me to the old saw when I was \na lawyer: If you cannot argue the facts, argue the law; if you cannot \nargue the law, pound the table.

Frost, of \nOhio, to be United States District Judge for the Southern District of \nOhio.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, in a moment we will be voting on the \nnomination of Judge Gregory Frost to be a United States District Court \nJudge for the Southern District of Ohio. I have had the opportunity of \nknowing Judge Frost for many years. He is a man of great honor and \nintegrity, and I ask my colleagues to vote for this very fine man. \nJudge Frost has been on the Licking County bench for 19 years, 7 as \nmunicipal court judge and 12 as common pleas court judge. Judge Frost \nwill make an excellent district court judge.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, tonight the Senate will vote to confirm \nJudge Gregory Lynn Frost to the United States District Court for the \nSouthern District of Ohio. This will be the 105th confirmation of a \nlifetime Federal judicial appointment by President George W. Bush, the \nfifth so far this year. He is also the second District Court nominee \nconfirmed for Ohio this year, following the confirmation of Judge Adams \nto the District Court for the Northern District last month, and the \nthird within the last year. Last May, the Senate also confirmed Judge \nThomas Rose to the vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of Ohio. With the confirmations of Judge Frost, we will have \nfilled all of the vacancies on the Federal trial courts in Ohio.\n  Federal judicial vacancies remain under the level--67--that Senator \nHatch termed ``full employment'' in the Federal courts during the years \nbefore 2000 when President Clinton's nominees were being considered by \nthe Republican majority in the Senate at a rate of 38 per year. Of \ncourse, last year the Democratic Senate majority proceeded to bring \nvacancies down by confirming 72 of President Bush's nominations, a rate \nalmost double that maintained when the roles were reversed.\n  Judge Frost currently serves the people of Ohio as a Licking County \nCourt Judge in Newark, Ohio. Judge Frost is a graduate of Wittenberg \nUniversity (B.A. 1971) and Ohio Northern University Law School (J.D. \n1974). He is strongly supported by Senator DeWine, who shepherded this \nnomination through the Judiciary Committee and now to the Senate floor \nfor prompt consideration.\n  After graduating from law school, Frost was appointed to be an \nAssistant Prosecuting Attorney for the Licking County Prosecuting \nAttorney's Office. In 1978, Frost joined the law firm of Schaller, \nFrost, Hostetter & Campbell in Newark, Ohio as a partner. He was \nappointed in 1979 by Mayor Chet Geller to be an Ohio Civil Service \nCommission clerk. In the early 1980's, he was elected a Licking \nCounting Municipal Court Judge. In 1990, Judge Frost was elected to a \n6-year term on the Licking County Common Pleas Court and has been \nreelected twice, most recently in November 2002. According to this \nSenate Questionnaire, he has no experience in Federal court.\n  Judge Frost is a current or former member of numerous charitable, \ncivic and social organizations. Judge Frost is also a current member of \nthe Newark Elks Club, which currently bases membership on being ``a \ncitizen of the United States over the age of 21 who believes in God.'' \nJudge Frost states in his Senate Questionnaire that, for four years, he \nhad been a member of the Newark Elks Club, along with the Newark Moose \nLodge and Newark Maennerchor, however, he states that, ``when it became \napparent that those organizations discriminated against women in their \nmembership practices, I resigned. In 2000, I was asked to re-apply for \nmembership in the Newark Elks Lodge. I advised that organization that I \ncould not subscribe to their membership tenets as a result of their \ncontinued discrimination against women. In part, because of my position \non this issue, I am proud to say that the Newark Elks Lodge has changed \nits practices and now permits women as full members.'' Judge Frost \nbelongs to the Moundbuilders Country Club, a private golf club that \ndoes not discriminate in its membership.\n  The Committee received a letter of support for Judge Frost from the \nOhio Employment Lawyers Association, a nonprofit organization that \nrepresents individual employees concerning employment and labor \nmatters. The Ohio Employment Lawyers Association writes that Judge \nFrost ``is an example of how a jurist should set aside personal and \npartisan political beliefs to provide justice.'' Supporters of Judge \nFrost's nomination to the District Court also include the Ohio Academy \nof Trial Lawyers and Peter W. Hahn, a Democrat who has practiced before \nJudge Frost, writes that ``Judge Frost has the unique ability and \ntemperament to adjudicate complex cases while maintaining civil and \nprofessional decorum both inside the courtroom and in chambers.''\n  I congratulate Judge Frost and his wife on his confirmation.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Gregory L. Frost, of Ohio, to be United States District Judge for \nthe Southern District of Ohio? The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST.

The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me return now to the debate in regard \nto the partial-birth abortion ban.\n  Let me thank my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, for \nhis unending and unwavering and tireless efforts to put a permanent end \nto this horrific partial-birth abortion procedure. In the time we have \nserved together in this body, he has never given up hope that Congress \nand this country would put an end to this barbaric procedure.\n  This Senate, this Congress, and this country must ban a procedure \nthat is inhumane, that has absolutely no medical purpose, and that is, \nquite simply, morally reprehensible.\n  During the course of the debate on S. 3, the bill to ban partial-\nbirth abortion, we will hear repeated descriptions of the barbaric \nnature of this procedure. I ask my colleagues, as difficult as it is, \nto listen to the description. There may be many arguments during this \ndebate, but the description of what this procedure is will not be \nargued. There is no debate what it is. There is no debate about what \ntakes place during a partial-birth abortion. I submit to my colleagues \nthat the more you know about this procedure, the worse it is. The more \nyou know about it, the easier it will be to vote to ban it.\n  We will hear repeated descriptions of this barbaric procedure. It is \na procedure in which the abortionist pulls a living baby feet first out \nof the womb and into the birth canal except for the head which the \nabortionist purposely keeps lodged just inside the cervix. As Senator \nSantorum explained, the abortionist then punctures the base of the \nbaby's skull with a long scissors-like surgical instrument and then \ninserts a tube into the wound removing the baby's brain with a powerful \nsuction machine. This causes the skull to collapse, after which the \nabortionist completes the delivery of the now dead baby.\n  Mr. President and Members of the Senate, those are the essential \nfacts. I can think of nothing more inhumane and indifferent to the \nhuman condition. Yet every year the tragic effect of this extreme \nindifference to human life becomes more and more apparent. It troubles \nme deeply that this is happening across this country and that it is \nhappening in my home State of Ohio. In fact, it happens within 20 miles \nof my home.\n  I would like to take a few minutes now to talk about two particular \npartial-birth abortions that occurred in Ohio. They were two typical \nabortions--typical except for the way they turned out. These two \ntragedies that I am going to describe illustrate the gruesome facts and \nthe evils of this procedure and show what can happen when it does not \ngo according to the way the abortionist plans. Let me explain.\n  On April 6, 1999, in Dayton, OH, a woman entered the Dayton Medical \nCenter to undergo a partial-birth abortion. This facility was and is \noperated by one Dr. Martin Haskell, one of the main providers of \npartial-birth abortion in the Nation. Usually the partial-birth \nabortion procedure takes place behind closed doors where it can be \nignored--its morality left outside. In this particular case, the \nprocedure was different. There was light shed upon it. This is what \nhappened. This is why light was shown upon it.\n  This Dayton abortionist inserted a surgical instrument into the woman \nto dilate her cervix so the child could eventually be removed and then \nkilled. This whole procedure usually takes 3 days.\n\n  The woman went home to Cincinnati expecting to return to Dayton for \nthe completion of the procedure in 2 or 3 days. In this case, her \ncervix dilated too quickly, and as a result shortly after midnight she \nwas admitted to Bethesda North Hospital in Cincinnati.\n  The child was born. A medical technician pointed out that the child \nwas alive. But apparently the chances of survival were slim, and after \n3 hours and 8 minutes the child died. The baby was named Hope.\n  Mr. President and Members of the Senate, on the death certificate, of \ncourse, is a space for cause of death--``Method of Death.'' There it \nwas written in the case of Baby Hope, ``Method\n\n[[Page S3391]]\n\nof Death: Natural.'' That, of course, is simply not true. There is \nnothing natural about the events that led to the death of this tiny \nlittle child because Baby Hope did not die of natural causes.\n  Baby Hope was the victim of a barbaric procedure that is opposed by \nthe vast majority of the American people. In fact, the Gallup poll \nconducted in January of this year shows that 70 percent of the American \npeople want to see this procedure permanently banned because the \nAmerican people know it is wrong. They feel strongly about it. And we, \nas a Senate, and as Members of Congress, I believe, should be listening \nto the American people.\n\n  The death of Baby Hope did not take place behind the closed doors of \nan abortion clinic. That death took place in public--in a hospital \ndedicated to saving lives, not taking them.\n  This episode reminds us of the brutal reality and tragedy of what \npartial-birth abortion really is. Because what it really is is the \nkilling--the killing--of a baby, plain and simple. And almost to \nunderscore the inhumanity of this procedure, 4 months later it happened \nagain, again in Ohio, with the same abortionist. This time, though, \nsomething quite different occurred.\n  Once again, in Dayton, OH, this time on August 18, 1999, a woman who \nwas 25 weeks pregnant went in to the same Dr. Haskell's office for a \npartial-birth abortion. As usual, the abortionist performed the \npreparatory steps for the barbaric procedure by dilating the mother's \ncervix. The next day, she went into labor, and was rushed to Good \nSamaritan Hospital--again, not what was expected. Again, the procedure \nnormally takes 3 whole days. But she was rushed into labor.\n  But this time, however, despite the massive trauma to this baby's \nenvironment, a miracle occurred. And by the grace of God, this little \nbaby survived. So she now is called ``Baby Grace.''\n  I am appalled by the fact that both of these heinous partial-birth \nabortion attempts occurred in this great country of ours, and occurred \nin my home State of Ohio.\n  When I think about the brutal death of Baby Hope and then ponder the \nmiracle of Baby Grace, I am confronted with the question, Why can't we \njust allow these babies to live?\n  Opponents of the ban on this procedure argue that this procedure is \nnecessary to protect the health of women. And yet, the American Medical \nAssociation has said this procedure is never medically necessary. In \nfact, many physicians have found the procedure itself can pose \nimmediate and significant risk to a woman's health and future \nfertility. Clearly, the babies did not have to be killed in the Ohio \ncases I cited, no. The two babies I cited were both born alive. One was \nable to live and one tragically died.\n  Why, Mr. President, why, Members of the Senate, does the baby have to \nbe killed? Why?\n  Opponents of this legislation say this procedure is only used in \nemergency situations--you will hear those words used time and time \nagain: emergency situations--when women's lives are in danger. And yet \nit seems very strange that in an emergency, a 3-day procedure would be \nused and the mother would be sent home. If it was truly an emergency, \nwhy would the doctor pick a procedure that would take 3 days? Why would \nthe woman consent to a 3-day procedure if it was truly an emergency? It \nis not an emergency. And the testimony we have heard, the testimony \nthat has been taken in our committee in the past, has clearly indicated \nthis procedure is never medically indicated--never medically indicated.\n  Nevertheless, even abortionists say the vast majority of partial-\nbirth abortions are elective. Dr. Haskell, the Ohio abortionist, said \nthis:\n\n       And I'll be quite frank; most of my abortions are elective \n     in that 20-24 week range.\n\n  This is Dr. Haskell. Let me quote him again:\n\n       And I'll be quite frank; most of my abortions are elective \n     in that 20-24 week range.\n\n  ``Elective.''\n  Opponents of this bill say this procedure is necessary when a fetus \nis abnormal. I do not believe the condition of a fetus ever warrants \nkilling it. I do not believe that. But even abortionists and some \nopponents of this ban agree that most partial-birth abortions involve \nhealthy fetuses. And that is what the statistics clearly show.\n\n  The inventor of this procedure himself, the late Dr. James McMahon, \nsaid:\n\n       Gee, it's too bad that this child couldn't be adopted.\n\n  Opponents of this bill contend that the partial birth procedure is \nrare, yet a report released just this past January suggests the number \nof partial-birth abortions has, in fact, tripled, accounting for an \nestimated 2,200 abortions in the year 2000.\n  I have heard it stated on the floor that is just a small fraction of \nthe number of abortions that are performed in this country every year. \nThat may very well be true. Still, statistics would indicate, if we \nbelieve the previous statistics, that is a significant increase in the \nnumber of partial-birth abortions. And still, whatever the total number \nof abortions is in this country, that is still 2,200 abortions that \noccurred in this very barbaric manner in 1 year.\n  I would again call my colleagues' attention to the description of \nthis procedure. And again, I remind my colleagues that no one--no one--\nwill come to this floor and deny what a partial-birth abortion is. No \none will come here and say what Senator Santorum has said, what I have \nsaid, what Senator Brownback will say, what any of us are saying about \nwhat this procedure is really like, is a lie or is not true. It is what \nit is, and no one can deny it.\n  And so 2,200 of these children had to suffer that agony of a partial-\nbirth abortion. That is what the facts are. And there are many people \nwho believe it is underreported. But we know of at least that many.\n  Opponents say a ban on partial-birth abortion violates Roe v. Wade, \nand they conclude it must be unconstitutional. But, as anyone who has \nread that case knows, Roe declined to consider the constitutionality of \nthe part of the Texas statute banning the killing of a child in the \nprocess of delivery. Moreover, the Supreme Court again declined to \ndecide this issue in Planned Parenthood v. Casey.\n  Again, I ask, why does the baby have to be killed? Why?\n  Opponents say this bill is unconstitutional because it does not have \na health exception. But the American Medical Association itself has \nstated:\n\n       There is no health reason for this procedure.\n\n  ``There is no health reason for this procedure.''\n\n       In fact, there is ample testimony to show that all of the \n     health consequences are more severe for this procedure than \n     any other procedure used.\n\n  The AMA has also said:\n\n       The partial delivery of a living fetus for the purpose of \n     killing it outside the womb is ethically offensive to most \n     Americans and physicians.\n\n  I ask my colleagues who wish to continue to allow this heinous act, \nagain, why does the baby have to be killed? Why?\n  Mr. President and Members of the Senate, why do babies, 3 inches away \nfrom their first breath, have to die?\n  Something is terribly wrong. With the advent of modern technology, we \ncan sustain young life in ways we could not just a few short years ago. \nWe sustain children much younger than the children who are being killed \nin partial-birth abortions, and they are in hospitals throughout this \ncountry. Most of us on the Senate floor have seen these children. And \nwe have seen people, very gallantly, in hospitals fighting to save \ntheir lives every day.\n  Unfortunately, we have created more and more savage methods of \nkilling our young at the same time we are creating wonderful ways to \ntry to continue to keep children alive and save lives.\n  I think we are really destroying ourselves by not admitting as a \nsociety that partial-birth abortion is an evil against humanity. I \nbelieve there will be more and more horrible consequences for our \nNation if we do not ban this cruel procedure.\n  As Frederick Douglass stated more than 100 years ago:\n\n       Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and \n     you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong \n     which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till \n     they are resisted. . . .\n\n  Mr. President, we must stop and ask: To what depths has the American \nconscience sunk? When it comes to abortion, is there nothing to which \nwe will say: Enough, enough, no, stop; we will\n\n[[Page S3392]]\n\nnot tolerate this. At this point, we will draw the line. At this point, \nwe will go no further.\n  Partial-birth abortion is a very clear matter of right and wrong, \ngood versus evil. It is my prayer that there will come a day when my \ncolleagues, such as Senator Santorum and the rest of us who have fought \nthis battle, won't have to come to the floor and talk about partial-\nbirth abortion. Nobody wants to talk about this. But until that day \ncomes, when this procedure has been outlawed in our country once and \nfor all, we will have to continue to come to the floor and talk about \nit. Now is the time to ban this very evil procedure. It is the right \nthing to do.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the question asked very eloquently by my \nfriend is: How low have we sunk? I say pretty low, when we have a bill \nbefore us that doesn't even have an exception for the health of a \nwoman. I get caught up in my throat when I think about it. Women like \nViki Wilson, women who are religious, women who desperately want \nchildren, women who were told, as she was--and I will read her story--\nthat if she didn't have a procedure outlawed in this bill, she could \nnever have a child again, and worse. So I think we sink pretty low when \nwe write a bill that doesn't even have an exception that has been the \nlaw of this land since 1973 in a Supreme Court case that is still \nupheld, which says, yes, we can act to limit abortion, but we always \nhave to make an exception for the life and the health of a woman. That \nis my position.\n  I have said on this floor, along with many of my pro-choice \ncolleagues who are Democrats and Republicans, we would ban all late-\nterm abortions, except for the life and health of the woman. My view is \nanyone who comes to this floor to ban a medical procedure that could \nsave the life and health of a woman and doesn't have that exception, is \nsinking very low. It shows a lack of respect for women, a lack of \nrespect for their lives, their future ability to have children, to love \nchildren, and for their future as healthy women.\n  I will show you a list of problems that could develop in women if \nthey don't have the procedures that are banned in this bill. Show me \nthat list of what could happen. This comes from various physician \nletters, which I will ask to print in the Record later in the debate. \nThis is what can happen to women if there is no health exception in the \nbill, which there is not. There are 15 pages of findings, but no health \nexceptions.\n  The Supreme Court already ruled on this very same bill--the Nebraska \nlaw--and sent it back and said you cannot come to us with a bill that \ndoesn't make an exception for the health of a woman. Why? Because they \nsee that a woman could hemorrhage and die; a woman's uterus could \nrupture and she could die; a woman could get a blood clot and she could \ndie; she could have an embolism and she could die; she could have a \nstroke and she could die; she could have damage to nearby organs and, \nin some cases, she would have to live paralyzed.\n\n  How low have we sunk that we cannot make a exception for the health \nof a woman? Pretty low. Pretty low. When I started this debate, I made \nthe point that there is no such thing as partial-birth abortion. It is \na phrase that is used by the proponents of this bill in order to \nessentially make abortion illegal one procedure at a time. Every one of \nmy friends who is on the floor time and time again, if you ask them, \nthey will be honest and they will say they don't like Roe v. Wade; they \ndon't think abortion should be legal; it ought to be criminalized. This \nis the way they are going--one procedure at a time.\n  By the way, if you read the Supreme Court case--put up the chart that \nshows what the Court said. We are talking about more than one procedure \nbanned, although our friends will tell you it is one procedure. Look at \nwhat the case says.\n  First of all, there is no health exception. I will go to this chart. \nThe Supreme Court said in the Nebraska case, a legally identical bill:\n\n       Even if the statute's basic aim is to ban D and X, its \n     language makes clear it also covers a much broader category \n     of procedures.\n\n  So let there be no mistake, those voting for this bill are not just \noutlawing one procedure, but many procedures, which fits right into the \nagenda of my friends who are here tonight and who will be here in the \nnext several days debating with us, because they want no abortion--even \nthough, if you ask the American people, should a woman have a right to \nchoose, should Government stay out of that private decision, a vast \nmajority will say yes, because it is out of respect for women to make a \ndecision with their physician and with their God. It is a decision that \nhas a lot of components to it, one they discuss with their families. It \nis a tough decision. But I don't personally think any Senator ought to \nbe put in the bedroom of any of our people making these decisions, or \nin a doctor's office.\n  If my daughter had a problem pregnancy and her health was threatened, \njust as Viki Wilson's was, I don't think that I would go to a U.S. \nSenator--not even the one who is a doctor, because he is a heart \nsurgeon. If she had a heart problem, absolutely. I think it is \nimportant to see what the American Medical Association says about this. \nI say to my friends on the other side of the aisle that they are very \nholier than thou about this and they have every right to their \nopinions. They do not know more than doctors. It is not their job to \nprotect the life and health of women. They don't even know what they \nare talking about. Listen to the AMA. The AMA, American Medical \nAssociation, has previously stated their opposition to this bill:\n\n       We oppose legislation that would criminalize a medical \n     practice or procedure. Since S. 3 includes a provision that \n     would impose a criminal penalty on physicians performing \n     intact dilation extraction, the AMA does not support this \n     bill.\n\n  Even though they don't like the procedure, they would not support \nthis bill. The letters I have had printed in the Record from practicing \nOB/GYNs--those are the doctors women go to. They don't go to ``Dr. \nSantorum,'' they don't go to ``Dr. DeWine,'' they don't go to ``Dr. \nBoxer,'' they don't go to ``Dr. Murray;'' they go to their OB/GYN.\n  What do they say?\n\n       We urge you to stand in defense of women's reproductive \n     health and vote against S. 3, legislation regarding so-called \n     partial-birth abortion.\n\n  There is no mention of the term ``partial-birth abortion'' in any \nmedical literature. There is no such term, I say to my friends. \nPhysicians are never taught a technique called ``partial-birth \nabortion'' so, therefore, they are unable to medically define it. What \nis described in the legislation, they say, could ban all abortions.\n  Why don't my colleagues just come out and say, ``Let's ban all \nabortions''? Let's have that debate. You lose it, at least with the \nAmerican people. I do not know how the votes line up here. We are going \nto have a chance to vote on whether to overturn Roe v. Wade. We are \ngoing to offer that up. We will have a debate about that. Let's see \nwhere people stand on that one. But to do it in this way, making up a \nterm and doing it in a way that is so vague that the Supreme Court \nbasically says it covers a much broader category of procedures, is \nabsolutely a fraud on the people. I do not know what else to call it. \nThe Supreme Court said in an identical bill it is far broader than just \none procedure.\n  What did it say about the health of a woman? It also said:\n\n       Our cases have repeatedly invalidated statutes that in the \n     process of regulating the methods of abortion, imposed \n     significant health risks.\n\n  In other words, there is no health exception in this bill. Senator \nSantorum added 15 pages of language, but the operative part of the bill \nmakes no exception for health.\n  Let's be clear on what we are talking about. First of all, a partial-\nbirth abortion, which there is none, is a vague term which could ban \nall abortions and many abortions. There is no health exception \nwhatsoever in the bill. Without a health exception, if a doctor fears a \nhemorrhage or a uterine rupture, or a blood clot or an embolism or a \nstroke or damage to nearby organs or even paralysis, it is not enough \nfor my friends on the other side. How low have we sunk--I want to talk \nabout that. If your daughter is told if she does not get this \nparticular procedure, she may be paralyzed for life and you will not \nmake an exception, how far have we sunk? I think that is a fair \nquestion.\n\n[[Page S3393]]\n\n  The debate we are having is not the real debate. The real debate is \noutlawing abortion completely and doing it one procedure at a time and \nmaking people think this particular procedure, A, is real, which there \nis no such thing as a partial-birth abortion--it is not in any \ndictionary; it is made up--and B, making them think you really are \nbanning one procedure when the Supreme Court said, no, there are many \nprocedures and maybe all abortions are banned.\n  So why not come here like a man--and I say ``a man'' because it is \nthe men on the other side who brought this to us. Maybe we will have \nsome women debating it tomorrow, but so far we have seen the same men \ncome down here, and they are saying they are after this partial-birth \nabortion when we know every one of them wants to ban all abortions, \ndoes not believe in a woman's right to choose, wants to criminalize \nwomen who would have an abortion, criminalize doctors, and have a \nconstitutional amendment to make it illegal.\n  I remember those days. Women died during those days. How low have we \nsunk? Women were made infertile in those days. All the points we see \nhere--serious health consequences of banning safe procedures--all of \nthat I remember in those days. Finally, the Supreme Court got \nenlightened in 1973 and said: Government, keep your nose out of this; \nit is a health issue; and if you legislate to clamp down on abortions \nin the late term--which, by the way, I agree with, but always have a \nlife and health exception so we do not force women into a situation \nwhere they can lose their ability to function for their families.\n\n  Let's put Viki's picture up again. I will tell you her story. She \nsays:\n\n       I urge you to oppose S. 3. I understand this bill is very \n     broad and would ban a wide range of abortion procedures. Mine \n     is one example of the many families that could be harmed by \n     legislation like this.\n       In the spring of 1994, I was pregnant and expecting \n     Abigail, my third child, on Mother's Day. The nursery was \n     ready and our family was ecstatic. My husband, Bill, an \n     emergency room physician, had delivered our other children \n     and he would do it again this time. John, our older, would \n     cut the cord. Katie, our younger, would be the first to hold \n     the baby. Abigail had already become an important part of our \n     family.\n       At 36 weeks of pregnancy, however, all of our dreams and \n     happy expectations came crashing down around us.\n\n  This is Viki. She says:\n\n       My doctor ordered an ultrasound and detected what all of my \n     previous prenatal testing had failed to detect. Two-thirds of \n     my daughter's brain had formed outside her skull. What I \n     thought were big healthy, strong movements were, in fact, \n     seizures. My doctor sent me to several specialists. We were \n     in a desperate attempt to find a way to save her.\n\n  ``A desperate attempt to find a way to save her,'' and yet my \ncolleagues come down here and make everyone believe that these women \nwho have had this procedure were callous about it. ``A desperate \nattempt to save her.''\n\n       Everyone agreed she would not survive outside my body. They \n     also feared that as the pregnancy progressed before I went \n     into labor, she would die from the increased compression in \n     her brain. The doctors feared that my uterus might rupture in \n     the birthing process, rendering me sterile. The doctor \n     recommended against C section because they could not justify \n     the risks to my health.\n\n  What were the risks to her health? Let's look at it again and again \nand again. What could have happened to Viki if she had to live under \nthis cruel law that has no health exception? She could have \nhemorrhaged. Her uterus could have ruptured. She could have had blood \nclots, an embolism, or a stroke. She could have become paralyzed. Her \norgans nearby could have been damaged.\n  When people come down here and say ``how low have we sunk,'' I agree: \nHow low have we sunk to have a bill come before this body with a name \nthat is not even a real procedure, that could outlaw a broad range of \nprocedures, and that makes no exception for a woman's health and could \nconsign her to live the rest of her life, if she survives it, in a \nhorrific situation which could be so detrimental to her other children.\n  I see my colleague has come to the floor. I am not going to go on \nmuch longer because I have a lot more to say on this and a lot more \ncases to share with my colleagues tomorrow. We have pictures and \npictures and pictures of women and their children, women who are deeply \nreligious, women who tried every way to save their pregnancy, women who \nwanted to live to try to have another child.\n  Is that a crime? Is that being made a crime? Yes, it is being made a \ncrime. I feel heavy in my heart that with all of the issues that face \nus, 250,000 troops--talk about killing. I have 5,000 National Guard on \nthe border of Iraq, with another couple of thousand having been \nnotified. I have young people over there, people who have left their \nfamilies, who are going to face God knows what, and we are debating a \nprocedure that would be banned, which does not even make an exception \nfor the health of a woman such as Viki, and the many others I will \nbring to light.\n  It is so callous. We have children who are uninsured who cannot even \nget medicine. We are not talking about that. We have the most \nunemployed people we have seen in decades, the worst economy we have \nseen in 50 years. The stock market plunged again today, and people have \nto work another 5 or 10 years because their dreams are gone. And we are \ntalking about banning a procedure without making a health exception. I \nam amazed.\n  Debate it we will, and we will offer amendments to try to bring \nhealth to women, to children, and to women who are pregnant. We hope \nour friends will be as eloquent in supporting those as they are \neloquent tonight.\n  We will have the chance to speak out on Roe v. Wade and see how many \nof our colleagues really support a woman's right to choose, as the \nSupreme Court laid it out, in the early stages of a pregnancy. And, \nyes, in the later stages one may not have an abortion unless it is to \nsave the life and health of a woman. That is the law.\n  This will set a dangerous precedent. It will send a message that the \nhealth of the mother does not matter. Every time I put up a picture, my \nfriends will say, because they did it last time, oh, these women, they \ncould have had it, there is no problem with them. Wrong. These women \nhave come to us and told us they had the procedure that my colleagues \nwant to ban, and had they not had it, they might not have lived to tell \nthe tale or they would have had serious adverse health consequences.\n  So how low have we come? That is for the people of America to decide. \nAs far as I am concerned, anyone who comes to this floor and puts \nforward a bill that is so callous as to say that if a woman's health is \nthreatened and she could suffer one of these terrible consequences, she \ncannot even have a procedure that her OB/GYN says she needs to have--it \nis callous, and I am going to speak out against it. I hope we will \nfinish this in due course, have a good debate and move on, but we will \nbe heard on our side. We did not bring this up, but we will be heard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I see my colleague from Ohio is in the \nChamber so I will not speak very long. I do want to very briefly \nrespond to my friend and colleague from California, if I may. I know we \nwill have ample time the remainder of the week to debate this issue. \nShe is an excellent debater, and I look forward to the chance of \ncontinuing this dialogue and this debate as we go forward. I do want to \nrespond very briefly to a couple of her comments.\n  Quite candidly, listening to my colleague from California, I almost \nget the impression that partial-birth abortion does not exist in this \ncountry or that no one could really define it or even know it when it \nexists. That is not true. The fact is that people know what it is. They \nknow it takes place. It is counted, at least in one State. There are \nproviders who say: I provide partial-birth abortion. So it is defined, \nand it is defined very specifically in this bill.\n  Senator Santorum has worked very hard to have a definition that is a \nprecise definition, and I might say that it is a more precise \ndefinition, a better definition, a definition that conforms to what the \nSupreme Court has said, a better definition than the previous bill \ntaken up on the Senate floor. It is taking into consideration what the \nSupreme Court has said. I will read a portion of that definition to my \ncolleagues.\n\n       As used in this section, 1, the term ``partial-birth \n     abortion'' means an abortion in\n\n[[Page S3394]]\n\n     which, A, the person performing the abortion deliberately and \n     intentionally vaginally delivers a living fetus until, in the \n     case of a head-first presentation, the entire fetal head is \n     outside the body of the mother, or, in the case of breech \n     presentation, any part of fetal trunk past the navel is \n     outside the body of the mother for the purpose of performing \n     an overt act that the person knows will kill the partially \n     delivered living fetus; and, B, performs the overt act, other \n     than completion of delivery, that kills the partially \n     delivered living fetus.\n\n  Then it continues on and defines physician, et cetera. But that is \nthe key part. That is a very precise definition. So I would reject the \nargument that this is vague. It is not vague. It is very well \nunderstood.\n  Turning to another point my colleague from California made, that has \nto do with the health of the mother, we had the opportunity to listen \nto a great deal of testimony in the past, and we have also had a lot of \npeople who have talked about this issue. We will have the opportunity \nto debate this tomorrow and the days after. I am not going to quote a \nlot of people tonight because of the time, but the testimony has been \nvery clear that this is not ever medically indicated. It is not \nsomething that is done in an emergency. One does not perform a \nprocedure that takes 3 days in an emergency; something else is done. An \nemergency is not a 3-day procedure. Make no mistake about it, all the \ntestimony has been that the partial-birth abortion takes 3 days. That \nis not an emergency procedure. It simply is not.\n  Let me quote former Surgeon General Dr. C. Everett Koop:\n\n       Partial-birth abortion is never medically necessary to \n     protect a mother's health or her fertility. On the contrary, \n     this procedure can pose a significant threat to both.\n\n  Dr. Warren Hern, OB/GYN:\n\n       I have very serious reservations about this procedure. You \n     really cannot defend it. I would dispute any statement that \n     this is the safest procedure to use.\n\n  The physicians Ad Hoc Coalition For Truth said the following:\n\n       Given the many potential risks the procedure entails the \n     mother, far from being medically indicated, partial-birth \n     abortion is actually contra-indicated.\n\n  Dr. Pamela Smith, OB/GYN, said the following:\n\n       Partial birth is, in fact, a public health hazard in \n     regards to women. Medically, I would contend, of all the \n     abortion techniques available to a woman, this is the worst \n     one which could be recommended in the situation of a mother's \n     health.\n\n  Dr. Dominic Casanova, OB/GYN:\n\n       This procedure is totally unnecessary and dangerous. If it \n     becomes necessary to evacuate a uterus beyond 20 weeks \n     gestation, there is a recognized standard method taught in \n     all OB/GYN training programs which involves another \n     procedure.\n\n  It goes on and on. I will not take the Senate's time tonight. We will \nhave an opportunity tomorrow to debate this. This is not medically \nindicated. The testimony has been abundantly clear. This is not a \nprocedure that is ever used for the health of the mother.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I take a minute to rebut my friend before I listen to my \ncolleague from Ohio. I find it very interesting that because a \nprocedure could take 3 days, it is not an emergency. If my daughter is \nundergoing a procedure and on the third day she dies, because perhaps \nsomething went wrong, she was in an emergency, even though it took 3 \ndays. If someone has cancer and rushes into the hospital and it may \ntake some intensive work over a period of days to save their life, the \nprocedures used there are used because this is an emergency. To say it \nis not an emergency because it took 3 days to try to save a woman's \nlife is, on its face, counterintuitive.\n  I say again, my friend, with all due respect, absolutely knows this \nprocedure he wants to ban without exception for health, he knows it is \nnot the safest procedure.\n  Well, I don't know what medical school he went to. Listen to the \nphysicians. They are writing to us. They are stating over and over \nagain, don't tie our hands; we may be forced to use this procedure. \nDon't tie our hands; a woman can suffer irreparable harm.\n  I would love to believe in everything my friend----\n  Mr. DeWINE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I'm sorry?\n  Mr. DeWINE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Does the Senator from California dispute Dr. Haskell's \nstatement that the vast majority of these abortions are elective?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have not read what my friend is reading from. I wonder \nwhether he has read what the obstetricians and gynecologists----\n  Mr. DeWINE. Can my colleague answer that question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Send it over to me. I will be glad to. You are asking, do \nI agree with this doctor. I don't know who he is. I am telling you what \nI am agreeing with. I agree with the OB/GYN, the women physicians, the \nphysicians who were dealing with these difficult pregnancies all the \ntime.\n  But I am happy--the time is mine, if I might, I say to my friend.\n  Mr. DeWINE. You will not yield for another question. I understand.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I didn't say I would not yield for another question.\n  I asked you to send over the letter to which you are referring so I \ncan answer the question with intelligence. I have not seen the letter. \nI am not asking my friend to comment on the OB/GYN because I don't know \nthat he has seen it. I don't think that is right to do in an \nintelligent debate. I am happy to look at it and at that time I will be \nhappy to answer the question.\n  We have a situation where we are being told by doctors over and over \nagain, thousands of doctors, 45,000 doctors, that they may well have to \nuse this procedure. All they want is a health exception. My friends are \nnot interested in giving us a health exception. They will have a chance \nto vote it down because we will offer up an exception that talks about \nthe terrible things that can happen to a woman. If they want to vote it \ndown and say no, that is fine. They have to live with that. That is \nfine.\n  I don't want to have to face a Viki Wilson. I don't want to have to \nface the women who have told me this procedure that they want to ban \nsaved them. I don't want to face them when they are sitting in a \nwheelchair and paralyzed or suffering from a stroke because my friends \ndecided we were sinking so low that we would fight for an exception for \nhealth. Imagine. Just imagine.\n\n  I rise tonight, and I will do so at every turn, because the facts \nsimply are not on the side of those who want to get this through the \nSenate and outlaw a set of procedures the court said--by the way, my \nfriend argues that the bill took care of the problem; it is very \nspecific.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a legal \nanalysis by the Center for Reproductive Rights which says very clearly \nthat this bill is legally identical to the one that the court found \nunconstitutional.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                               Center for Reproductive Rights,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 2003.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: On June 29, 2000, in Stenberg v. \n     Carhart, 530 U.S. 914 (2000), the U.S. Supreme Court held \n     that Nebraska's sweeping ban on abortion--misleadingly \n     labeled a ban on so-called ``partial-birth abortion''--was \n     unconstitutional. I was one of the attorneys who represented \n     LeRoy Carhart, M.D., the Nebraska physician who challenged \n     the ban in that case.\n       In Carhart, the Court held that Nebraska's abortion ban was \n     unconstitutional for two reasons. First, the Court held that \n     the ban did not prohibit only one type of abortion procedure, \n     but instead outlawed several methods, including the safest \n     and ``most commonly used method for performing pre-viability \n     second trimester abortions,'' Carhart, 530 U.S. at 945, and \n     therefore constituted an undue burden on women's right to \n     choose. Second, the Court held that the Nebraska ban was \n     unconstitutional because it failed to include an exception \n     for women's health. The Court noted that ``a State may \n     promote but not endanger a woman's health when it regulates \n     the methods of abortion'' and that ``the absence of a health \n     exception will place women at an unnecessary risk of tragic \n     health consequences.'' Carhart, 530 U.S. at 931, 937.\n       The new federal bill (H.R. 760, S. 3) contains the same two \n     flaws. Like the Nebraska law, the federal bill fails to limit \n     the stage of pregnancy to which the bill's provisions apply, \n     so the ban could criminalize abortions throughout pregnancy \n     (nor just post-viability or ``late term'' abortions, as the \n     bill's sponsors often claim), and the definition of ``partial \n     birth abortion'' in the bill is broad enough to criminalize \n     numerous safe abortion procedures, including the safest and \n     most commonly used method for performing\n\n[[Page S3395]]\n\n     abortions early in the second trimester, the D method (not \n     just one abortion procedure, as the bill's sponsors \n     misleadingly imply). Moreover, the federal bill fails to \n     limit its prohibitions to abortions involving an ``intact'' \n     fetus, fails to explicitly exclude the D & E technique or the \n     suction curettage abortion method from the law's \n     prohibitions, and fails to include definitions of key terms \n     such as ``living'' or ``completion of delivery.'' Like the \n     Nebraska law, the federal bill also fails to include the \n     constitutionally mandated health exception. Therefore, the \n     federal bill is unconstitutional for the same reasons as the \n     Nebraska law struck down in Carhart.\n       Because the U.S. Supreme Court has already struck down \n     legislation containing the same constitutional flaws \n     contained in the new federal bills, these bills can only be \n     seen as a direct attack on the Supreme Court's decision, on \n     the safest and most common abortion procedures in the second \n     trimester, and on the protection for women's health that have \n     been consistently reaffirmed throughout three decades of \n     abortion jurisprudence.\n       Please feel free to contact me with any further inquiries.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Priscilla Smith,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. My friend did say, and I appreciate that, that he heard a \nlot of witnesses come forward to talk about this. That was a couple of \nyears ago. For some reason, they have the time to do this but they did \nnot have the time to send this bill to the Judiciary Committee where \nthey could have looked at this issue.\n  This is an amazing situation. We had a Supreme Court that argues that \nthe Stenberg case, the legally identical bill to this, is \nunconstitutional on its face on two grounds--no health exception and a \nvery vague definition. Here it is. Unconstitutional. This is what the \nSupreme Court said in a legally identical bill, and I have just placed \nin the Record a letter from the attorney who argued that case. She read \nthe Santorum bill and says it is legally identical to the case that was \ndeclared unconstitutional. This is what the Court said. \nUnconstitutional because it put an undue burden on women because the \ndefinition is vague. Undue burden--very important words. You cannot put \nan undue burden on a woman because abortion under Roe is legal and in \nthe late stages it is not legal if the State says it isn't, except for \nlife and health. But it puts an undue burden because we don't know at \nwhat stage the woman is going to get this abortion and whether this \nprocedure applies to it or not.\n  No exception to protect a woman's health, that is the one that breaks \nmy heart. After all of this, the Court sending it back, please make an \nexception for women's health, my friends do not even have it in their \nheart to make an exception for a woman's health. I find it difficult. \nSo S. 3, the bill before us, and Stenberg are legally identical \naccording to the lawyers who won the case.\n  I argue the life exception is very narrow. It does not just say you \ncan use it if a woman's life is threatened. It says the woman has to \nhave this preexisting condition. I argue that.\n  But clearly my purpose tonight is to say to my friends on the other \nside, as we offer these amendments on women's health, be with us; as we \noffer these amendments on children's health, be with us; as we offer \nthese amendments on prenatal care, be with us. Because you care about \nchildren, that is why you are here. So be with us. Be with us on these.\n  I say be with us on Roe v. Wade. Roe v. Wade is a modest decision \nthat said to government, take your nose outside of privacy. You cannot \nmake a decision in an early stage of a pregnancy. Be with us on that. \nBe with us if we suggest that the Judiciary Committee ought to take a \nlook at this in light of the Stenberg case. We offer our hand to you. \nBe with us when Senator Durbin offers a health exception. If you care \nabout women and their families, be with us when we say make an \nexception if a woman is told she could be paralyzed if she does not \nhave this or be prepared to face the consequences if this does become \nthe law of the land and the Supreme Court does change. It is bringing \npain and suffering to a lot of our families in America.\n\n  We will give you the chance to offer up these amendments. We look \nforward to joining with you. We hope we will win a couple here. We have \na few people already on your side of the aisle who are pro-choice who \nare going to be with us on some of these amendments. We hope we can \nexpand that. We hope we can have a good vote on the health exception. I \nthink we are getting close to winning that one. That would be a good \nday for women.\n  Just remember the most important thing of all: This is about real \npeople, real women like Viki. She is just one. These are religious \nwomen, caring women, loving women, who wanted these babies more than \nanyone could say but who knew if they didn't have the procedure that \nyou want to ban, they could well die, be made infertile, have a blood \nclot, be paralyzed. We can't do this to women. We should not do this. \nWe should respect women.\n  We should act as Senators, not OB/GYNs. I think it is important.\n  In closing, I want to say my friend, Senator Santorum, when I was out \nof the Chamber, said: Well, Senator Boxer said we should not ban \nprocedures, but she voted to ban a medical procedure that would have \nallowed women's genitals to be mutilated.\n  I just want to set the record straight. You are darned right I did. \nThat is not a medical procedure; that is torture. That is torture. We \nare talking here about a medical procedure which doctors say is \nnecessary to save the life and health of a woman in certain abortions. \nThat's quite different. So I wanted to set the record straight.\n  This debate is emotional. This debate is difficult. There is no doubt \nabout it. But I am so proud to stand tonight, to call on my friends to \nbe honest about what their true goal is. If it is to ban one procedure, \nthen name it in the bill. They do not do that. It is vague. Therefore, \naccording to the Court, it could ban all abortion. That is what the \nSupreme Court said.\n  If that is what they are about, then be man enough to come over here \nand say they believe abortion should be banned, and then let's have at \nit and talk about the right of families, of women, to make a decision \nlike this--with their doctor, with their God, with their conscience, \nwith their family. But I say: Not with their Senator. I don't think I \nhave that right. I have more humility than that.\n  I try hard to be a good Senator. I try hard. I come here, I try to \nfight for the American dream for people. I fight for children, fight \nfor families, fight for jobs. God knows we have trouble in this land. \nWe have troubles in this land. Retirements are up in smoke. People are \nbeing forced to work longer and harder. I mean, there are a lot of \nissues that adversely impact on children and their families. But we \nwill stand here and we will have a point/counterpoint as long as they \nwant to do that.\n  I thank you and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me just briefly respond on my own time \nnow and maybe lay a little foundation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time. The Senator from Ohio has \nthe floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Let me lay a little foundation for my previous question \nthat I asked my colleague from California. I will send over to her the \nquote from Dr. Haskell. But to explain to her who Dr. Haskell is, Dr. \nHaskell is probably the foremost--I would say notorious--partial-birth \nabortion provider in this country. He operates in my home State, near \nmy hometown. He operates in Dayton, OH. He performs many partial-birth \nabortions.\n  The quote I have is as follows. I will read the quote that I have. \nDr. Martin Haskell indicates he:\n\n     . . . routinely does this procedure on all patients, 20 to 24 \n     weeks pregnant, except on women--\n\n  He gives some exceptions.\n  He further states:\n\n       And I'll be quite frank. Most of my abortions are elective \n     in that 20 to 24-week range.\n\n  My only point to my colleague was that most partial-birth abortions \nare elective. I think that has been, frankly, the testimony of most of \nthe witnesses we had. I don't think it is really a disputed issue. That \nwas the only point of my question.\n  I want to return briefly to the issue of medical necessity. I would \nlike to maybe quote a couple more experts who have testified in front \nof Congress in the past.\n  Dr. Pamela Smith, Medical Education Director of Mount Sinai Medical \nCenter in Chicago, has testified in front of Congress. Here is what she \nhas said.\n\n\n[[Page S3396]]\n\n\n       So, for someone to choose a procedure that takes 3 days, if \n     they are really interested in the life of the mother, that \n     puts the mother's life in further jeopardy.\n\n  Members of the Senate, those are not my words. Those are the words of \nDr. Pamela Smith.\n  Dr. Nancy Romer, Chairman of OB/GYN and professor at Wright State \nUniversity Medical School in Ohio, had this to say:\n\n       There is simply no data anywhere in medical literature in \n     regard to the safety of this procedure.\n\n  Again she was talking about the partial-birth abortion. I continue to \nquote Dr. Romer.\n\n       There is no peer review or accountability of this \n     procedure. There is no medical evidence that a partial-birth \n     abortion procedure is safer, or necessary to provide \n     comprehensive health care to women.\n\n  Finally, Dr. Donna Harrison, a Fellow of the American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists, put it most simply:\n\n       This is medical nonsense. It is a hideous travesty of \n     medical care and should be rightly banned in this country.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Partial-Birth \nAbortion Ban Act. I am grateful to the Senator from Pennsylvania, and \nmy colleague from Ohio, the senior Senator from Ohio, for their \ncourageous fight to stop this barbaric procedure. Any of us who have \nlistened to them cannot help but be moved by their eloquence in regard \nto the importance of banning this procedure.\n  This tie that I have on is one that was given to me last week. It \nsays, ``Stop Violence Against Women.''\n  I wish those of us who are opposed to this procedure would have had \nties made saying, ``Stop Violence Against Babies.''\n  It is even difficult to talk about because it is a gruesome \nprocedure, but we need to remind Members of the Senate that this is a \nprocedure that is not done on an emergency basis. It is a little bit \ndifficult for me to talk about it because last week my daughter \ndelivered our fifth grandchild, a little baby girl, Emily Elizabeth.\n  The way the procedure goes is that a woman goes through 2 days of \ndoctor visits to get dilated; 2 days to get dilated. On the third day, \nthe baby is positioned for delivery in the birth canal. The doctor then \npulls the living baby feet first out of the womb and into the birth \ncanal, except for the head which the abortionist purposely keeps lodged \njust inside of the womb. The doctor punctures the base of the baby's \nskull with a surgical instrument such as long surgical scissors or a \npointed hollow metal tube called a trochar.\n  He then inserts a catheter into the wound and removals the baby's \nbrain with a powerful suction machine. This causes the skull to \ncollapse, after which the doctor completes the delivery of the now dead \nbaby.\n  I can't understand how anyone can support this ghastly procedure or \ncannot support it being illegal.\n  There are some who say it is hard to believe we are even talking \nabout the question on the floor of the Senate. In an editorial today, \nthe Washington Post called our debate in the Senate on this subject \n``pointless.'' I have also heard my colleagues take the floor and \nstate, Have we no other priorities that take precedence over this? What \npriority is more important than human life? It is hard for me to \nbelieve anyone would say we should not even discuss this procedure that \nkills a human being. It should have been banned years ago. I am glad we \nare moving early in the 108th Congress to go forward with something \nthat should have been done many years ago.\n  The subject of partial-birth abortion is not a new one for me. Eight \nyears ago in 1995, Ohio was the first State to pass a partial-birth \nabortion ban. The bill prohibited doctors from performing abortions \nafter the 24th week of pregnancy and banned completely the dilation and \nextraction procedure we call the partial-birth procedure in this bill, \nthe one I just described.\n  The bill allows late-term abortions to save the life of the mother. \nThe women seeking abortions after the 21st week of pregnancy were \nrequired to undergo tests to determine the viability of the fetus, and \nif the fetus was deemed to be viable, the abortion would be illegal.\n  I am glad the Senator from Ohio pointed out the language in this bill \nhas been carefully drafted. It is not ambiguous. I have heard the \nSenator from California say this should have gone to the Judiciary \nCommittee. The fact is this has been discussed on the floor of the \nSenate since 1994.\n  While I was Governor, I watched the partial-birth abortion ban make \nits way through the 104th and 105th Congresses, only to be vetoed by \nPresident Clinton. It has been around a long time.\n  After I arrived in the Senate in the 106th Congress, I gave a speech \nin support of banning partial-birth abortion and, quite frankly, \nlobbied some of my colleagues to support it. The bill passed both \nChambers of the Senate and the House. It made it to conference but \nnever came out of conference.\n  I have listened to my colleagues quote statistics and spout off facts \nabout medical necessity and the health of the mother. We can all quote \ndifferent statistics, but the bottom line is there is no need for this \nprocedure. My colleague from Ohio has spoken to that very clearly. Most \nof these partial-birth abortions are elective. They take 3 days to \ncomplete. If a mother really needs an abortion, she has alternatives \navailable to her that are not as tortuous as partial-birth abortion.\n  It is interesting to note that in January 2003 the Alan Guttmacher \nInstitute, which is affiliated with Planned Parenthood, published a \nsurvey of abortion providers, showing that the number of partial-birth \nabortions more than tripled between 1996 and 2000. Why is the \noccurrence of such a procedure that is never medically necessary \nincreasing? One of the main reasons we do not need these late-term \nabortions is thanks to the technology available today. It is better \nthan it has ever been before. We can identify problems very early in \nthe pregnancy so abortions can take place earlier. Women today are \nbeing encouraged to come in early in the first trimester for the \nvarious tests they need so that if an abortion is acceptable to them, \nthey can have an early abortion while the baby is still not viable \noutside the womb. In fact, to date, the technology is so sophisticated \nthat if they find there is something wrong with a baby, they can go in \nthrough surgery and correct it in the womb.\n  I want to make it clear to those who believe in abortion and who face \nthat tremendous decision in terms of whether they are going to deliver \nthe baby, that there are other procedures available. The victims of the \npartial-birth abortions are human beings. I find it interesting that \nthey are sometimes called ``living fetuses.'' They are living human \nbeings. Whether they are called ``babies'' or ``fetuses,'' no one seems \nto dispute the fact that they are living. In fact, they are human \nbabies and they can feel pain. When partial-birth abortions are \nperformed, these babies are just 3 inches away from life and, for that \nmatter, seconds away from life.\n\n  I urge all of my colleagues in the Senate to stand up against what I \nrefer to as ``human infanticide.'' This is not Roe v. Wade. I suspect \nthat when the vote is taken on the floor of the Senate, there are going \nto be many people who will support partial-birth abortion who label \nthemselves as pro-choice and pro-abortion. When this legislation passed \nin Ohio back in 1995, it passed overwhelmingly in both houses, and \nthere were pro-life and pro-choice and pro-abortion people who \nsupported this legislation. This is not an issue of Roe v. Wade. This \nis an issue of banning a procedure that is gruesome and is not \nmedically necessary.\n  In the State of the Union address this year, President Bush again \npledged to support the legislation and said, ``We must not overlook the \nweakest among us. I ask you to protect infants at the very hour of \ntheir birth and end the practice of partial-birth abortion.''\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to ban partial-birth abortions in the \nUnited States of America and end this national tragedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Ohio yield the floor?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Yes. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, my friend talked about the joy of \nchildbirth. He is so right. I have a magnificent grandchild. I have two \nbeautiful children, a boy and girl. They were\n\n[[Page S3397]]\n\nboth premature. It was very scary, and they made it. It was wonderful. \nI absolutely can say there is no greater joy in my life. As I stand \nhere today, it is because I am pro-children. I am pro-family. I am for \nhealthy families. I am for women not having to face a situation where \nthey could be paralyzed for life if a certain procedure is banned.\n  My friend says it is not about Roe v. Wade. Nothing could be further \nfrom the truth. None other than the Supreme Court said on an identical \nbill in Nebraska that, in fact, it was against Roe v. Wade--that \nbecause there was no exception for the health of the mother in which \nyou have the same situation here. You have salutary language in \nfindings. But the operative language makes no exception for health. \nThat is against Roe v. Wade. Roe v. Wade was a very carefully crafted \nbill that has withstood time since 1973. Even this Supreme Court, which \nis new, as we well know, and to the right, has supported Roe very \nrecently.\n  It says to me, if you look at the case that just came down, you have \ntwo problems with this bill that goes against Roe: No health exception. \nEveryone agrees there is no health exception. The fact is that the \nterminology used is very vague. Therefore, it puts an undue burden on a \nwoman because it could ban all abortion procedures.\n  Having said that, it seems to me puzzling why this bill didn't go \nback to the Judiciary Committee. I will tell you why. It is not as if \nnothing has changed since we looked at this the last time. Everything \nchanged. The Supreme Court said the partial-birth abortion ban, as the \nSenator calls it, was unconstitutional in Nebraska because they had no \nhealth exception and it put an undue burden on women because the \ndefinition is vague. That has not been cured here.\n  This is going to go right back to the Supreme Court. I am sure the \nPresident will sign this bill because he definitely said he is looking \nforward to doing that. And it will go to the Court, and I believe it \nwill be struck down because it hasn't met the problems the Court found.\n  It is puzzling to me why we wouldn't send it back to the Judiciary \nCommittee to discuss the problems the Court found with a legally \nidentical bill. I have had printed in the Record a letter from \nattorneys who say, in fact, this is a legally identical bill.\n\n  I want to close tonight for my part and talk about another case \nbecause my friend was very eloquent, and I appreciate his eloquence \nabout children and families.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Will the Senator from California yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I certainly will.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Do you agree this issue has been debated on the floor \nof the Senate for a long period of time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely, it has been, but not since the Supreme Court \ncase which struck down a legally identical bill. That is why I believe \nit should go back to Judiciary.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Is my colleague from California aware of the fact that \nthose of us who want to ban this procedure believe the language in this \nbill is not vague and that it will sustain a test in the Supreme Court \nof the United States?\n  Mrs. BOXER. With all due respect to my friend, we have a Judiciary \nCommittee that is supposed to make those judgments. So I am sure you \nthink it is fine. You thought the other one was fine, the Stenberg \ncase. You thought the Nebraska case met the Roe v. Wade requirements as \nwell. You were wrong and you were faulty.\n  So I believe if there is sincerity here--this isn't about politics or \nwhatever--it is really about meeting the constitutional requirements of \nRoe, it should have gone back.\n  But I agree with my friend, sure, it has been debated quite a bit, \nbut not since this latest case.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from California yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Will the Senator yield the floor back so I can make \na----\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am not going to yield the floor back to you, but I am \nhappy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. The question I would ask, again, is that those of us \nwho have had a concern about this for many, many years have studied the \nlanguage quite carefully. I particularly have because of the fact that \nwe had two partial-birth abortion statutes that passed in Ohio, and we \nwere looking at what the Supreme Court was going to do with the \nNebraska case.\n  I must say to you we have looked at it as carefully as we can. We \nbelieve the language that is in the bill is not vague. We believe it \nwill stand up to a test in the Supreme Court, and that to go back to \nthe Judiciary Committee, quite frankly, would just delay the real \nissue; that is, whether we have enough votes on the floor of the Senate \nto ban partial-birth abortions.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Was that a question?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I think that was a statement.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me say to my friend, I appreciate his sincerity. I do \nnot question it for one minute. But I also have studied this. I also \nhave cared about this, because I care about women who I am going to be \ntalking about here tonight, and many of whom have come to see me in \nCalifornia and here. They are begging me to fight this because it does \nnot have a health exception. Even though my friend thinks you have \nwritten it in a way to have a health exception, it isn't in the bill.\n  Here is another story about Claudia Crown Ades, who, in 1992, was in \nthe 26th week of a desperately wanted pregnancy. Claudia and her \nhusband, Richard, were told, after an ultrasound, that their son had a \ngenetic condition called trisomy 13. His anomalies included extensive \nbrain damage due to a fluid-filled nonfunctional brain and a malformed \nheart with a large hole between the chambers. He also had developed \nliver, kidney, and intestinal malformations. He did not have normal \nblood flow.\n\n  They were told his condition was incompatible with life. She was told \nif she did not have this procedure she could suffer a number of \nproblems, which I have talked about before, that we have been told by \ndoctors can occur if the procedure is not available.\n  Her loving family got together, and they decided to have this \nprocedure. It saved her. She did not have to suffer the potential of \nhaving a hemorrhage, a blood clot, an embolism, stroke, or paralysis.\n  So I know my friend worked hard on this bill. I am just saying, it \nwould not take that much effort to get the Judiciary Committee to take \na look at it since the stakes are so high for the women of this country \nto outlaw a procedure, to not have a health exception, and to have such \na vaguely drawn phrase about a procedure that is a nonexistent medical \nprocedure. It was given to a procedure that I have already put in the \nRecord.\n  Maybe my friend did not hear me, but several physicians, representing \n45,000 OB/GYNs, say there is no such thing as this, and that these \nprocedures could be far more than one.\n  So I am going to close my statement here tonight.\n  Does my friend have a question?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I do have a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am glad to yield for a question.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. What is puzzling to me--the question is, you have \npointed out some unusual cases that----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senators are reminded that they will address \nquestions through the Chair and not address each other in the first \nperson.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Would the Senator from California agree that the \ntechnology today, in terms of the delivery of babies, in the \nascertaining of a problem that a baby or a delivering mother would \nhave, has improved substantially over what it was in 1994 when we first \nstarted the debate on this legislation?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank God, we have had so many advances. In my own family \nwe had a circumstance where we were very fearful we were going to lose \na pregnancy of one of my children. And because of these incredible \nadvances, she held on, and long enough to have a healthy baby.\n  What a miracle that is. That is the reason why I support banning all \nlate-term abortions across the board. I think that is consistent with \nRoe. But for the life and health of a woman, which always must be, it \nseems to me, considered in a civilized country, we need to make sure \nwomen are not facing these kinds of serious problems.\n  So yes, I say to my friend, I could not be more excited about the \nincredible progress we have made.\n  Does my friend have another question?\n\n[[Page S3398]]\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I do.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. If you agree that the medical technology today is \nbetter than it was in 1994, can you explain to me why the Alan \nGuttmacher Institute, which is an affiliate of Planned Parenthood, \npublished a survey of abortion providers, showing that the number of \npartial-birth abortions more than tripled between 1996 and 2000? \nWouldn't you think there would be less partial-birth abortions because \nof the technology that we have, less cases like the ones you have \npresented here before my colleagues in the Senate?\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me say to my friend, he keeps referring to partial-\nbirth abortions: ``There would be less partial-birth abortions.'' I \nwould defy my friend to show me where there is a list of so-called \npartial-birth abortions. Because there are none. This is a made-up \nterm. I will read to you again--because having a debate about partial-\nbirth abortion, I do not know that you take care of these women on a \ndaily basis, as do physicians, but I want to answer my friend.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would like to answer my friend's question. He is asking \nme a question, whether I disagree with the premise. The premise is, \nthere is a procedure called partial-birth abortion. Physicians are \ntelling me--and I believe them, I hate to tell you, over you, because \nthis is their life's work. These are OB/GYNs. They are saying, there is \nno such technique as partial-birth abortion.\n  Reclaiming my time, I am going to conclude in this way: I have shown \nyou a couple of cases. My friends say: Oh, they are a couple of \nanomalies. There are many more I am going to share--many, many more--\nmany more photographs, many more stories, compelling stories of loving, \nreligious, caring families that made a decision based on the facts as \nthey were laid out, so that a woman could live and be a mother to her \nother children, so she could go on with her life, where she could have \nbeen in a circumstance where she could have absolutely been in peril \nfor her whole family for the rest of her life.\n  I think we have a lot of power here in the Senate. That is why I am \nso proud the people of California sent me here. And my friend feels so \nproud the people of Ohio sent him here, as my friend, who is sitting in \nthe Chair, feels so proud the people of Nevada sent him here.\n  We work hard to get here. And I do not shrink from responsibility. I \nam very happy to take on whatever responsibility that I have.\n  I do not see it in the Constitution that I should outlaw a medical \nprocedure that doctors are saying to me is necessary to save the life \nand health of a woman.\n  I think that harms families. If my friends would like to offer a \nhealth exception, we would have a lot of support. Dick Durbin will do \nthat. I hope a lot of you will join us.\n  I will conclude my remarks because this is what I really think about \nthis. I don't think this about my friends who are on the floor, but I \nthink if you look around for the past 2 years, you see what has \nhappened to women who want to exercise their right to choose, their \nright to family planning, and you see what has happened to women in \nthis country. So I am going to conclude with the chart that will go \nthrough what has happened to women's rights in this country in terms of \na right to choose, which is so important, it seems to me.\n  First, we have a situation where the administration says pregnant \nwomen won't be eligible for health benefits; their fetus will--not \nthem. Keep in mind what we have here. This is a circumstance where we \nhave a bill that will outlaw a procedure that doctors tell us they need \nto save the life and health of a woman. Put that into perspective with \nwhat has been happening lately to women's rights. So a woman is ignored \nby this administration. They are going to give the prenatal care to the \nfetus, not to the woman. What does that say about women, by the way? We \nare not entities; we are just here to exist. People can look right by \nus. That is not right. That in and of itself is an insult, a lack of \nrespect, it seems to me, for women.\n  Pushing legislation recognizing an embryo as a person with rights \nseparate and apart from the woman's: Again, what does that say about \nwomen?\n  Moving legislation forcing some young women to make reproductive \nhealth choices alone, and criminalizing caring adults who help them: \nThat will hit us soon in this debate.\n  Attempts to block women's access to RU486, a drug proven safe and \neffective by the FDA, which will avoid abortion procedures: We have \ntrouble with that. By the way, women all over the world have this, and \nwe have fought hard to get our women to have nonsurgical abortion, \nwhich is safer. It has been a fight. So far we have won it. It is under \nattack.\n  Attempts to block access to emergency contraception: We are going to \nhave a chance to vote on that during the course of this debate.\n  Denial of Roe v. Wade's protections to Federal employees; low-income \nwomen who rely on the Federal Government for their health care; poor \nwomen who live in the District of Columbia--in other words, women, \nincluding U.S. servicewomen, who pay out of their own pocket for a \nprocedure cannot even use a Federal facility, with our women abroad, in \ndifficult places all over the world--again, a lack of respect.\n  Why am I bringing this up now? Because I see what we are doing here \nas a continuation of what I would call a basic assault on a woman's \nright to choose, which I consider to be a fundamental right that has \nbeen articulated in Roe v. Wade and stands for respect of a woman.\n  We have seen starving funding for family planning programs, and \ninternational family planning is basically impounded by this \nadministration, $34 million. That money can save, by the way, tens of \nthousands in abortions. If a woman has family planning, she will \nhopefully plan her family and not be in a circumstance where she might \nseek an abortion. Tell me how that makes any sense. I don't really see \nit.\n  Attempts to channel taxpayer funds to deceptive crisis pregnancy \ncenters that intimidate and withhold information from women; pushing \nlegislation to gag doctors from providing abortion referrals; placing a \ngag rule on international family planning providers; push for youth \nprograms that censor discussion of contraception benefits; censorship, \nthen revision of medical information on Government Web sites about \ncondoms, and the unproven ``link'' between abortion and breast cancer; \nattempt to fund Federal research on the unproven link between abortion \nand breast cancer; key Cabinet appointments who oppose the \nconstitutionally protected right to choose; campaign to pack courts \nwith judges hostile to women's rights; refusal to hold perpetrators of \nviolence, intimidation, and harassment at reproductive health clinics \nresponsible for their illegal acts; refusal to act on international \nwomen's rights treaty. I am involved in that, the convention to \neliminate all forms of discrimination against women. We are standing \nwith countries such as Angola because somebody says that may mean we \nsupport a woman's right to choose. Heaven forbid. So we cannot even \nsign onto a treaty. It is stunning to me; enactment of 335 antichoice \nState measures into law since 1995.\n\n  So what I am suggesting to you is there is an agenda here--and this \nis part of it--to ill-define a procedure so it could, in fact, relate \nto more than one. The court says it could effectively ban all abortion, \nwithout really saying they are doing that and not having a health \nexception, so that women could face all kinds of horrible problems. It \nis just part of this campaign, if you will, this assault that I see \nhappening, that I feel is very sad for the women in this country.\n  This is the 21st century. We should allow women to make very private, \nvery difficult choices, as long as these decisions are in accord with \nthe guidelines sent down in 1973.\n  I will close by saying that Roe v. Wade is a very logical, moderate \nposition. It says in the very beginning of a pregnancy that a woman has \na right to choose to have an abortion, without the interference in that \ndecision by government. Then it says after that time, government cannot \ncome in and put in restrictions--but always an exception for the life \nand health of the mother. I think that is a balance.\n\n[[Page S3399]]\n\n  The problem with this bill, it bans procedures--and maybe all \nprocedures--many procedures, except some that are very dangerous to a \nwoman, and procedures that could be used at any stage of abortion. That \nis what the court said, and it makes no exception for her health. I \nargue the life exception is very narrowly drawn, but we don't have time \nto go into that tonight.\n  Thank you very much. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I reiterate the fact that this is not \nan issue that gets to the basis of the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. \nWade. I predict that just as in the past on the floor of the Senate, \nthere are going to be people supporting the outlaw of this gruesome \nprocedure, which is not necessary, who are very much pro-choice, pro-\nabortion, and who will probably have amendments on the floor of the \nSenate, a sense of the Senate, in terms of Roe v. Wade and many of the \npeople who will vote to sustain Roe v. Wade will be some of the same \npeople who will vote against this procedure because they understand how \ngruesome it is.\n  I point out one other fact. You just cannot give the back of the hand \nstatistics from the Alan Guttmacher Institute, which is a very \nrespected institute, which is an affiliate of Planned Parenthood, that \npublished a survey of abortion providers showing--these are abortion \nproviders, OK--showing that the number of partial-birth abortions more \nthan tripled between 1996 and 2000.\n  So this procedure is not one that is being practiced in some of the \nexamples that my colleague from California has presented on the floor \nof the Senate but, rather, has become a regular procedure in the \noffices of many OB/GYN doctors in this country--a procedure that is not \nnecessary.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of this much-\nneeded and long-overdue measure. There is no place in a decent Nation \nfor the barbaric practice known as partial-birth abortion. Senator \nSantorum's measure is the only one the Senate is considering that will \nput an end to it once and for all.\n  Every abortion ends the life of a tiny boy or girl, but only partial-\nbirth abortion involves the destruction of life at the moment when a \nchild is being brought out of the womb--and he or she is just inches \nfrom under the full protection of our laws. Partial-birth abortion \nblurs the line and does so in such a way as to further erode the \nsanctity of life.\n  The legislation Senator Santorum has proposed should avoid the \nconstitutional problems that five Supreme Court Justices found in \nNebraska's statute in the Stenberg v. Carhart case. Specifically, it \naddresses the concern that the partial-birth abortion procedure might \nbe necessary to protect the health of the mother by incorporating as \nfindings the view of the American Medical Association and the \noverwhelming majority of physicians that there is no circumstance where \nthe health of the mother demands this procedure. It also contains a \nmore specific definition of the partial-birth abortion procedure, in \nresponse to the Stenberg decision.\n  This revised definition ensures that, once we pass this bill, it will \nno longer be permissible in America to--and here I quote the language \nof the bill itself--``deliberately and intentionally vaginally deliver \na living fetus until, the entire fetal head is outside the body of the \nmother and then kill the baby as happens in a typical partial-birth \nabortion.''\n  There is no doubt, in contrast, that the substitute measures that the \nSenate is considering will permit the continued use of this \nunconscionable procedure. To secure the approval of the radical, pro-\nabortion lobby, the authors of such measures inevitably draft their so-\ncalled ``bans'' in such a way as to permit ``health of the mother'' \nexceptions that effectively negate the restrictions. Again, the \ntestimony of the mainstream medical community makes it clear that \n``health of the mother'' is a red herring in the partial-birth abortion \ncontext, and I trust that any measure containing such an ``exception'' \nwill be soundly defeated.\n  It is simply not possible to seek cover politically while \nsubstantively protecting the most unscrupulous abortionists. The \nAmerican people overwhelmingly favor enactment of a real partial-birth \nabortion ban. Despite the predictable efforts to obscure what is really \na very clear issue--how we wish to treat the most vulnerable members of \nour human family--they will soon have it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/10/senate-section/article/S3399-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH.

Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today to \nspeak about some of the most crucial issues facing our Nation: No. 1, \nthe prospect of war against Iraq, and, No. 2--though it will never be \nin second place--support for our U.S. military.\n  It has been my longstanding position to support a multinational \nresponse to the Iraqi threat. That means building international support \nto defang Saddam Hussein. We all know he is a duplicitous character, \nbut I believe if the goals of America and the world are to be \nsuccessful, we need to work in a multilateral way, working through the \nUnited Nations, to build international legitimacy, and also to get the \nworld to support us, to share the burden of war, if war is necessary, \nduring the war in terms of the danger, and to share the burden of what \nwould come after the war in terms of the economic cost of rebuilding \nIraq.\n  The risks and consequences of acting alone are much greater than they \nwould be for multinational action. The risks to our troops are greater. \nIf allied forces do not join the mission, our troops will be bearing \nthat burden all by themselves. The challenge in post-conflict Iraq will \nbe greater if other nations do not share this responsibility or this \nburden. Also, I believe the consequences for the war on terrorism will \nbe greater if we lose the essential cooperation of other nations.\n  There is a lot of disagreement about going to war: whether we should \ngo to war now; whether we should go to war at all; whether we should go \nto war alone or whether we should continue to work through the United \nNations. I have stated my own positions. But I believe there is \nsomething all Americans agree on; that is, we must support our troops. \nWe must stand up for those who are standing up for us. We must protect \nour defenders, the brave men and women of our military, and we must \nsupport them not only with words but with deeds. That means ensuring \nthat our troops have the best and smartest weapons, that they have the \ntraining and the equipment they need.\n  But while we are standing up for our military, we must also stand up \nfor their families. Our troops will face grave danger. They should not \nhave to face fear for their families, and particularly they should not \nhave to worry about their families' finances.\n  Although America is on the brink of war, American military families \nmust never be on the brink of bankruptcy. That is why we, in the \nSenate, must take immediate steps to support military families.\n  There is legislation pending. Let's provide tax relief to military \nfamilies. Let's pass legislation to help the families of the National \nGuard and the Reserves who have been called up for longer periods than \nat any time in the past 40 years.\n  Each and every member of our military is part of the American family. \nTheir service is a tremendous sacrifice and great risk. These are \nordinary men and women called upon to act in an extraordinary way. \nWhatever their Nation asks them to do, I know they will do it with \nbravery, fortitude, and gallantry. All Americans owe them a debt of \ngratitude.\n  Members of the military, though, do not just need our gratitude \nthrough words; they need our gratitude through deeds. That is why I \nsupport two immediate steps and call upon the Senate to join with me \nand other like-minded colleagues to advance these steps.\n  I believe the Senate must quickly pass legislation to ease the tax \nburden\n\n[[Page S3400]]\n\non our American military. Our troops should not have to worry about tax \ndeadlines and paperwork when they are preparing to defend our Nation.\n  I urge the Senate to pass, this week, the Armed Forces Tax Fairness \nAct, without loading it down with any special interest giveaways. While \nsome are preoccupied with tax cuts for ``Joe Millionaire,'' we should \nbe preoccupied with GI Joe and GI Jane.\n  At the same time, we need to look at the financial burden many of the \nfamilies are facing. Let's talk about the National Guard and the \nReserves. The Senate also has to help the Guard and Reserves. They have \nbeen called up in record numbers. Right this minute, 168,000 Guard and \nReservists are serving alongside our active-duty military.\n  Since September 11, over 230,000 of our National Guardsmen and \nReservists have been mobilized. In my own home State of Maryland, that \nnumber is at least 4,000. And not only have they been called up, but \nmany have been called up more than once over the past year and a half.\n  The Guard and Reserves are ready to serve. They are our citizen \nsoldiers. They are called up in times of national emergency. Yet they \nare being asked to serve for longer periods of time. Many have been \ncalled up three or four times since September 11. This places a \ntremendous burden on their families. There are financial burdens of \nlosing pay and losing businesses. Let me give you some examples from my \nown home State of Maryland.\n\n  The 115th Military Police Battalion of the Maryland Army National \nGuard has been deployed repeatedly since September 12, after the attack \non the United States of America. That is when they were called up to \nstand guard at the Pentagon. When I went over to the Pentagon after the \nattack, I saw Maryland responding: I saw on the perimeters our own \nNational Guard protecting the Pentagon, and Maryland first responders \ndoing the rescue and recovery. When they were called up, they wanted to \nbe there. Then they had a two-week breather. But then they were called \nup to guard the prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, and now they are deployed \nin Afghanistan.\n  The long periods of mobilization are hard not only on them but on \ntheir families. Let me give you some examples of what the families are \nfacing.\n  I will talk about a reservist in Columbia, MD. He is a wonderful guy, \nand he owns a small home improvement business. After the terrible \nsnows, this business would be booming, but he is not there to fix \ngutters or sidings, or help seniors repair those leaky basements. He \nhas been called up most of the year. He has already been called up \nthree times, and now he has been called up once again. He has been \ncalled up so often that he has had to shut down his home improvement \nbusiness, where he was the sole employee. His family is now forced to \nborrow against their home to make ends meet. They have already gone \nthrough their savings, and they have already gone through their \nchildren's tuition money for college. We have to think about this man \nand his family.\n  In a family in Centreville, the husband has been activated four times \nover the past year and a half. He is the main breadwinner. The family \nhas already lost half of their income this year. They are having a \ndifficult time making payments on their home and, in fact, the wife and \nchildren are now considering moving in with her parents.\n  Then there is the National Guardsman in St. Mary's County, who has \nbeen deployed 9 months out of the last 18 months. In February, he was \ndeployed again. His wife is now working two jobs to make ends meet.\n  We have to face this challenge. For years we have faced the challenge \nof how we had been shortchanging our military. We have increased pay \nfor full-time duty and we have improved benefits. We needed to do that \nand that was the right thing to do.\n  Now we are facing a unique challenge, looking at the Guard and the \nReserves who are ready to do their duty, but they are now being \ndeployed as frequently as if they were on active duty and their \nfamilies are facing hardship.\n  As part of this response, I will be joining Senator Dick Durbin to \nintroduce legislation called the Reservists Pay Security Act of 2003. \nIt would ensure that Federal employees who take leave to serve in our \nmilitary reserves receive the same pay as if no interruption in their \nemployment occurred. Why start with Federal employees? Well, many large \ncompanies and local governments continue to pay the full salary of \ntheir employees when they are activated. I applaud those excellent \ncorporate citizens and those local governments. Some of the largest \nemployers in my own State are also meeting that responsibility. The \nFederal Government should be a model employer and set the example for \nlarge businesses. This should be a first step.\n  I believe we should move quickly to pass this bill because many \nmembers of the Guard and Reserves do work for the Federal Government in \nhighly specialized areas. But the Federal Government needs to do more \nthan that. We need to take a look at those who work for small business \nand those who are self-employed. A call for duty will be responded to, \nbut a call for duty time and time again in a single-year period places \nthe responsibility on the family. American families should never \nsubsidize our war effort. We should be looking out for those families.\n  Supporting our troops should be more than speeches, it should be more \nthan parades. Sure, when the war begins--if it does begin--I believe \nthere will be an outpouring of great American sympathy. But we need to \nput it into action to help the men and women defending our Nation; and \nfor the full-time active duty, continue raising pay and improving \nbenefits; and for our Reserves and our Guardsmen, to close the gap \nbetween the income they are leaving behind and the country they are \nworking to defend.\n  Please, let's pass that Tax Fairness Act. Our military should not \neven be paying taxes when they are at war in Iraq. There should be \nshared sacrifice in the United States of America, and that means not \nonly shared sacrifice in terms of those who are willing to go and \nfight, but we need to fight for those who are fighting for us.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in putting the men and women of our \nmilitary at the top of our agenda, whether as we look at the issues \nfacing the economy or facing taxes, because, remember, as our budget is \nstrained, theirs is near the breaking point.\n  I conclude by saying God bless our troops and God bless America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/10/senate-section/article/S3400-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3400-S3401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           A DIPLOMATIC LOSS\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I wish to call attention to a piece that \nappeared on the editorial pages of the Washington Post on Sunday. It \nwas a letter of resignation from John Brady Kiesling, a career State \nDepartment diplomat who offered some very compelling thoughts about the \nstate of our international relations.\n  After two decades with the State Department, Mr. Kiesling left his \njob on March 7 because he no longer believed the President's policies \nreflected the interests of the American people.\n  Mr. Kiesling wrote that in our pursuit of war with Iraq, the U.S. had \nsquandered the legitimacy:\n\n     that has been America's most potent weapon of both offense \n     and defense since the days of Woodrow Wilson.\n       We have begun to dismantle the largest and most effective \n     web of international relationships the world has ever known.\n\n  Mr. Kiesling wrote:\n\n       Our current course will bring instability and danger, not \n     security.\n\n  But it was this thought that I found most compelling:\n\n       When our friends are afraid of us rather than for us, it is \n     time to worry. And now they are afraid. Who will tell them \n     convincingly that the United States is as it was, a beacon of \n     liberty, security and justice for the planet?\n\n  This central question raised by Mr. Kiesling resonates with many \nAmericans who feel frustrated and confused by the way the Bush \nAdministration is performing on the international stage:\n\n       Why have we failed to persuade more of the world that a war \n     with Iraq is necessary?\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Kiesling's full letter of \nresignation, as it appears in yesterday's Washington Post, be printed \nin the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         The Diplomat's Goodbye\n\n                                                 February 27, 2003\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: I am writing you to submit my \n     resignation from the Foreign\n\n[[Page S3401]]\n\n     Service of the United States and from my position as \n     Political Counselor in U.S. Embassy Athens, effective March \n     7. I do so with a heavy heart.\n       The baggage of my upbringing included a felt obligation to \n     give something back to my country. Service as a U.S. diplomat \n     was a dream job. I was paid to understand foreign languages \n     and cultures, to seek out diplomats, politicians, scholars \n     and journalists, and to persuade them that U.S. interests and \n     theirs fundamentally coincided. My faith in my country and \n     its values was the most powerful weapon in my diplomatic \n     arsenal.\n       It is inevitable that during twenty years with the State \n     Department I would become more sophisticated and cynical \n     about the narrow and selfish bureaucratic motives that \n     sometimes shaped our policies. Human nature is what it is, \n     and I was rewarded and promoted for understanding human \n     nature. But until this Administration it had been possible to \n     believe that by upholding the policies of my president I was \n     also upholding the interests of the American people and the \n     world. I believe it no longer.\n       The policies we are now asked to advance are incompatible \n     not only with American values but also with American \n     interests. Our fervent pursuit of war with Iraq is driving us \n     to squander the international legitimacy that has been \n     America's most potent weapon of both offense and defense \n     since the days of Woodrow Wilson. We have begun to dismantle \n     the largest and most effective web of international \n     relationships the world has ever known. Our current course \n     will bring instability and danger, not security.\n       The sacrifice of global interests to domestic politics and \n     to bureaucratic self-interest is nothing new, and it is \n     certainly not a uniquely American problem. Still, we have not \n     seen such systematic distortion of intelligence, such \n     systematic manipulation of American opinion, since the war in \n     Vietnam. The September 11 tragedy left us stronger than \n     before, rallying around us a vast international coalition \n     to cooperate for the first time in a systematic way \n     against the threat of terrorism. But rather than take \n     credit for those successes and build on them, this \n     Administration has chosen to make terrorism a domestic \n     political tool, enlisting a scattered and largely defeated \n     Al Qaeda as its bureaucratic ally. We spread \n     disproportionate terror and confusion in the public mind, \n     arbitrarily linking the unrelated problems of terrorism \n     and Iraq. The result, and perhaps the motive, is to \n     justify a vast misallocation of shrinking public wealth to \n     the military and to weaken the safeguards that protect \n     American citizens from the heavy hand of government. \n     September 11 did not do as much damage to the fabric of \n     American society as we seem determined to do to ourselves. \n     Is the Russia of the late Romanovs really our model, a \n     selfish, superstitious empire thrashing toward self-\n     destruction in the name of a doomed status quo?\n       We should ask ourselves why we have failed to persuade more \n     of the world that a war with Iraq is necessary. We have over \n     the past two years done too much to assert to our world \n     partners that narrow and mercenary U.S. interests override \n     the cherished values of our partners. Even where our aims \n     were not in question, our consistency is at issue. The model \n     of Afghanistan is little comfort to allies wondering on what \n     basis we plan to rebuild the Middle East, and in whose image \n     and interests. Have we indeed become blind, as Russia is \n     blind in Chechnya, as Israel is blind in the Occupied \n     Territories, to our own advice, that overwhelming military \n     power is not the answer to terrorism? After the shambles of \n     post-war Iraq joins the shambles in Grozny and Ramallah, it \n     will be a brave foreigner who forms ranks with Micronesia to \n     follow where we lead.\n       We have a coalition still, a good one. The loyalty of many \n     of our friends is impressive, a tribute to American moral \n     capital built up over a century. But our closest allies are \n     persuaded less that war is justified than that it would be \n     perilous to allow the U.S. to drift into complete \n     solipsism. Loyalty should be reciprocal. Why does our \n     President condone the swaggering and contemptuous approach \n     to our friends and allies this Administration is \n     fostering, including among its most senior officials. Has \n     oderint dum metuant [Ed. note: Latin for ``Let them hate \n     so long as they fear,'' thought to be a favorite saying of \n     Caligula] really become our motto?\n       I urge you to listen to America's friends around the world. \n     Even here in Greece, purported hotbed of European anti-\n     Americanism, we have more and closer friends than the \n     American newspaper reader can possibly imagine. Even when \n     they complain about American arrogance, Greeks know that the \n     world is a difficult and dangerous place, and they want a \n     strong international system, with the U.S. and EU in close \n     partnership. When our friends are afraid of us rather than \n     for us, it is time to worry. And now they are afraid. Who \n     will tell them convincingly that the United States is as it \n     was, a beacon of liberty, security and justice for the \n     planet?\n       Mr. Secretary, I have enormous respect for your character \n     and ability. You have preserved more international \n     credibility for us than our policy deserves, and salvaged \n     something positive from the excesses of an ideological and \n     self-serving Administration. But your loyalty to the \n     President goes too far. We are straining beyond its limits an \n     international system we built with such toil and treasure, a \n     web of laws, treaties, organizations and shared values that \n     sets limits on our foes far more effectively than it ever \n     constrained America's ability to defend its interests.\n       I am resigning because I have tried and failed to reconcile \n     my conscience with my ability to represent the current U.S. \n     Administration. I have confidence that our democratic process \n     is ultimately self-correcting, and hope that in a small way I \n     can contribute from outside to shaping policies that better \n     serve the security and prosperity of the American people and \n     the world we share.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/10/senate-section/article/S3401-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3401-S3402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Sunday, \nMarch 9, 2003 Washington Post editorial entitled ``Moment of Decision'' \nbe printed in the Record at the appropriate place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. I believe this editorial accurately describes the \ncurrent impasse at the U.N. Security Council over whether to enforce \nSecurity Council Resolution 1441.\n  That resolution gave Saddam Hussein a final opportunity to disarm and \nprovided for ``serious consequences'' should he fail to comply. It is \nnow clear that Saddam Hussein is in violation of Resolution 1441, yet \nsome member states on the Security Council are using this forum to \npress an unrelated agenda that is hostile to the interests of the \nUnited States.\n  By pursuing this course of action, these member states are \ncontributing to the global threat that Saddam Hussein poses and \nundermining the very purpose of the United Nations--to ensure the peace \nand security of the international community.\n  We know that Saddam Hussein possesses weapons of mass destruction. We \nknow that Saddam Hussein will use those weapons against those who \noppose his tyranny. We know that Saddam Hussein has failed to disarm in \nviolation of Security Council Resolution 1441.\n  Yet, rather than holding Saddam Hussein accountable for his defiance, \nthese member states have reduced the Security Council to a debating \nsociety, hardly relevant to the tough decisions the United States and \nits allies face in the war against terrorism.\n  Only by standing together will the United Nations finally fulfill its \ncommitment of ensuring global peace and security.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 9, 2003]\n\n                           Moment of Decision\n\n       The Debate on Iraq at the United Nations Security Council \n     no longer concerns whether Iraq has agreed to disarm; in \n     fact, it hardly concerns Iraq at all. At Friday's meeting, \n     once again, neither chief U.N. inspector Hans Blix nor any \n     member of the council contended that Saddam Hussein has \n     complied with the terms of Resolution 1441, which offered him \n     a ``final opportunity'' to give up weapons of mass \n     destruction. But most members chose not to discuss the \n     ``serious consequences'' the council unanimously agreed to in \n     the event of such non-compliance. Some, such as Mexico and \n     Chile, essentially argued that Iraqi disarmament was less \n     important than avoiding a split of the Security Council. \n     Others, such as Russia and France, sought to change the \n     subject from Iraq to the United States' global role. They \n     argued for using Iraq to establish that international crises \n     should be managed solely by the Security Council--and not \n     through military action that necessarily must be led by the \n     United States.\n       It's painful to imagine Saddam Hussein's satisfaction in \n     observing the council once again descend into internal \n     quarrels rather than hold him accountable for his defiance of \n     its resolutions. But it's not hard to understand much of the \n     diversionary argument. Few countries outside of the Middle \n     East feel directly threatened by Iraq, other than the United \n     States. Many have an understandable aversion to war when \n     their own citizens' lives don't appear to be at risk. Some, \n     notably Russia and France, have been unsuccessfully seeking \n     for a decade to check American influence and create a \n     ``multipolar world''; the Iraq crisis offers a fresh platform \n     for an agenda more important to them than the menace of a \n     Middle Eastern dictator. The Security Council's action on \n     Iraq ``implies the international community's ability to \n     resolve current or future crises . . . a vision of the world, \n     a concept of the role of the United Nations,'' said French \n     Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin. ``There may be some \n     who believe that these problems can be resolved by force, \n     thereby creating a new order. But this is not what France \n     believes.'' To oppose the use of force in Iraq, in other \n     words, is to oppose the exercise of the United States' \n     unrivaled power in the world.\n       We share the concern of those on the council who spoke of \n     the damage of an enduring rift over Iraq--damage for which \n     the Bush administration's clumsy and often high-handed \n     diplomacy will be partly responsible.\n\n[[Page S3402]]\n\n     Yet we would argue that the only way to preserve \n     international cohesion is for the council to face up to the \n     tough question that it has been avoiding for weeks--not world \n     order or U.S. power but Saddam Hussein's defiance of an \n     unambiguous Security Council disarmament order. In their bid \n     for global opinion, the French and Russians now invoke \n     principles they would never agree to if they were applied to \n     Chechnya or Francophone Africa. As President Bush pointed out \n     in his news conference Thursday, Iraq's continued stockpiling \n     of banned weapons is a direct threat to the United States, \n     and the country has a right under the U.N. Charter to defend \n     itself against that threat.\n       By taking its case to the United Nations, the Bush \n     administration tested whether the Security Council--which \n     only rarely in the past 50 years has been able to respond to \n     the world's crises--could serve as a place where such threats \n     could be addressed. Yet after six months of intensive effort, \n     France, Russia, Germany and others refuse to accept the \n     consequences of the process they claim to favor. They would \n     rather the Security Council abandon its own resolutions, or \n     split apart, than endorse a U.S. use of force against an \n     outlaw tyrant. If their goal is really to preserve the U.N. \n     security system, they should join in supporting the \n     enforcement of U.N. resolutions; if it is merely to contain \n     the United States, they should not be allowed to succeed. The \n     United States, for its part, must remain open to reasonable \n     compromise. If a few more weeks of diplomacy will serve to \n     assuage the legitimate concerns of undecided council members, \n     the effort--even at this late date--would be worth making.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/10/senate-section/article/S3402-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3402-S3403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, in the upcoming days of the 108th \nCongress, this legislative body may be called upon to tackle the very \nimportant and very difficult issue of Social Security reform. As it \ncurrently stands, the Social Security System needs strengthening for \nthe sake of our children and grandchildren. I recently read an article, \nwritten by Mises Institute Scholar John Attarian, which takes us back \nto December 1981, when President Ronald Reagan, alone with House \nSpeaker Tip O'Neill and Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker, created a \nbipartisan commission to study Social Security and recommend reforms. \nAlan Greenspan was picked by President Reagan to head-up this \ncommission. This article will provide my fellow colleagues with \ninsightful information regarding past experience with Social Security \nreform. If we refuse to learn from our previous mistakes and mishaps, \nwe are doomed to travel down the same erroneous and errant path. We \ncan't just kick the can down the road. Raising taxes on benefits and \nreducing benefits are not an option for Social Security reform.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Another Greenspan Social Security Reform?\n\n                           (By John Attarian)\n\n       On Thursday, February 27, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan \n     Greenspan told the Senate's Special Committee on Aging that \n     we should tackle Social Security sooner rather than later, so \n     as to avoid ``abrupt and painful'' revisions of the program \n     when the baby boomers start retiring. Congress should, he \n     said, consider things like raising the retirement age and \n     changing the annual benefit Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA), \n     before raising the payroll tax, because a payroll tax hike \n     discourages hiring.\n       ``Early initiatives to address the economic effects of \n     baby-boom retirements could smooth the transition to a new \n     balance between workers and retirees. If we delay, the \n     adjustments could be abrupt and painful,'' Greenspan said. He \n     added that Congress should consider switching to a lower \n     inflation rate for the annual COLA, which could save billions \n     in benefit outlays.\n       Greenspan's words should set off alarm bells in well-\n     informed minds. Almost exactly ten years ago, a National \n     Commission on Social Security Reform headed by Greenspan \n     proposed a package of benefit cuts and tax increases, which \n     Congress enacted with little change, and which turned out to \n     be one of the most oppressive--and underhanded--things \n     Congress ever did to younger Americans over Social Security. \n     It also failed to solve Social Security's long-term problems.\n\n\n                 background to the greenspan commission\n\n       The 1972 amendments to the Social Security Act not only \n     greatly increased benefits, and created the annual COLA to \n     increase benefits to compensate for inflation, but included \n     an overly generous formula for the COLA which in effect \n     adjusted benefits twice. This plus the inflationary \n     stagnation of the 1970s created Social Security's first \n     funding crisis. To cure it, Congress passed in December 1977, \n     and President Jimmy Carter signed into law, amendments which \n     both undid the overadjustment of benefits and mandated the \n     largest tax increase in American history up till them. \n     Supposedly this would solve the problem permanently.\n       It didn't. The long-term actuarial deficit fell from a \n     frightening -8.20 percent of taxable payroll to a still-\n     troubling -1.46 percent. Moreover, thanks to inflationary \n     recession, the short-term outlook was calamitous; in 1980, \n     Social Security's Board of Trustees reported a deficit of \n     almost $2 billion in 1979, that by 1982 at the latest, Old-\n     Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) would be unable to pay \n     benefits on time, and that by calendar 1985 Social Security's \n     trust fund would be exhausted.\n       So in May 1981, Ronald Reagan's Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services, Richard Schweiker, sent Congress Reagan's \n     proposals for restoring Social Security's solvency.\n       Instead of another tax hike, Reagan proposed benefit cuts--\n     most importantly, cutting early retirement benefits from 80 \n     percent of the full benefit to 55 percent, and increasing the \n     dollar ``bend points'' in the Average Indexed Monthly Wage \n     formula, which break up income into intervals upon which \n     benefit calculations are based), by 50 percent of the average \n     annual wage increase, not 100 percent.\n       Reagan walked into a buzz saw. Congressional Democrats, \n     seniors' groups, Social Security architects such as Wilbur \n     Cohen, unions, and others blasted him for ``breaking the \n     social contract,'' and he suffered his first defeat in \n     Congress. In December 1981, he recommended creation of a \n     bipartisan commission to study Social Security and recommend \n     reforms. Reagan picked five members, including economist \n     Greenspan as chairman; House Speaker Thomas ``Tip'' O'Neill \n     picked five; and Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker picked \n     five more. The Greenspan Commission quarrelled bitterly over \n     what to do, missing its December 1982 deadline, and did not \n     issue its report until January 15, 1983.\n\n\n                    the 1983 social security rescue\n\n       It was just in time. Exhaustion of the Old-Age and \n     Survivors Insurance trust fund was now projected for July \n     1983, meaning benefit checks wouldn't go out on time. Reagan \n     and Congress moved fast. The Commission's proposals were \n     introduced on January 26; both houses of Congress passed the \n     final version of the rescue legislation on March 25; and \n     Reagan signed it into law on April 20, 1983.\n       Supposedly, the Greenspan Commission gave politicians a \n     political cover enabling them to bite the bullet on Social \n     Security and even do the unthinkable: cut benefits. \n     Supposedly, the Greenspan Commission's reforms were a \n     compromise between the Republicans, who wanted to cut \n     benefits, and the Democrats, who wanted to raise taxes \n     instead. Supposedly, they therefore spread the pain widely, \n     cutting current benefits, raising current and future taxes, \n     cutting future benefits, and dragging previously exempted \n     persons into Social Security's revenue pool.\n       Superficially considered, they did. Current beneficiaries \n     had their July 1983 COLA delayed six months, until January \n     1984, and all beneficiaries would have COLAs paid in January \n     thereafter. For the first time, Social Security benefits were \n     subject to taxation. Beginning in 1984, up to 50 percent of \n     Social Security benefits would be included in taxable income \n     for persons whose sum of adjusted gross income plus taxable \n     interest income plus one-half of Social Security benefits \n     exceeded $25,000 for single beneficiaries and $32,000 for \n     married beneficiaries.\n       The future tax increases mandated in 1977 were accelerated; \n     the payroll tax rate increase scheduled for 1985 kicked in in \n     1984 instead, and part of the 1990 increase went into effect \n     in 1988. In addition, the self-employment tax rate, which the \n     1977 law would have increased to 75 percent of the sum of the \n     employer and employee shares of the Federal Insurance \n     Contributions Act (FICA) tax, was raised to 100 percent of \n     this sum.\n       Many additional categories of employees were brought under \n     Social Security, including the President, members of \n     Congress, federal judges, federal employees newly hired on or \n     after January 1, 1984, and present and future employees of \n     tax-exempt nonprofit organizations. State and local \n     government employees, who previously were able to opt out of \n     Social Security, no longer could as of April 20, 1983.\n       The retirement age (the age at which one could qualify for \n     full Social Security benefits) was gradually raised, to reach \n     sixty-six in 2009 and sixty-seven in 2027. One could still \n     retire early and start collecting early retirement benefits \n     at age sixty-two, but the early retirement benefit would be \n     trimmed from 80 percent of the full benefit in 1983, to 75 \n     percent in 2009 and 70 percent in 2027.\n\n\n                        the 1983 rescue unmasked\n\n       But although the pain was indeed spread widely, it was \n     certainly not spread evenly. The distribution of sacrifice \n     was incredibly lopsided, falling least heavily on current \n     beneficiaries and most heavily on current taxpayers, future \n     taxpayers, and future beneficiaries. In other words, the \n     elderly of 1983 were spared any real hardship, and the bulk \n     of the burden was put on those who were young in 1983 and of \n     Americans yet unborn.\n       In the short-run period of 1983-1989, the majority of the \n     pain was borne by taxpayers, not current beneficiaries. Using \n     its intermediate actuarial assumptions, the Office of the \n     Actuary estimated that the amendments would raise an \n     additional $39.4 billion in this period from the higher FICA \n     tax rates, $18.5 billion from the higher self-employment tax \n     rate, and $21.8 billion form extending Social\n\n[[Page S3403]]\n\n     Security coverage to those not then in the system. Total \n     estimated additional revenues from current and newly-created \n     taxpayers: $79.7 billion.\n       The new benefit taxation, which would affect only a \n     minority of the current beneficiaries--only the richest ten \n     percent, according to Phillip Longman's 1987 book Born to \n     Pay: The New Politics of Aging in America--would bring in \n     another $26.6 billion. The only major hit taken by all the \n     current beneficiaries, the delay in COLAs, would cut benefits \n     by $39.4 billion over this six-year period, for total current \n     beneficiary losses of $66.0 billion.\n       The inequity was even worse in the long run. In 1983, \n     Social Security's actuaries put the long-range actuarial \n     deficit at -2.09 percent of taxable payroll under \n     intermediate assumptions. Raising the retirement age made the \n     largest single contribution to eliminating this deficit, \n     wiping out about a third of it, 0.71 percent of taxable \n     payroll; and this fell entirely upon future beneficiaries.\n       Benefit taxation increased the long-term income rate by \n     0.61 percent of taxable payroll--the second-largest \n     contribution to erasing the deficit; it fell somewhat on the \n     (richest) current beneficiaries, but mostly on future ones. \n     These two measures accounted for 1.32 percent of taxable \n     payroll, or almost two-thirds of the long-term actuarial \n     deficit. Most of the rest was eliminated by brining new \n     people (who would initially participate as taxpayers) under \n     Social Security (0.38 percent of taxable payroll), and \n     accelerating the phasing-in of the 1977 tax increase and \n     increasing the self-employment tax rate (0.22 percent).\n       It turns out, then, that the allegedly broad sharing of \n     sacrifice was in fact engineered to injure, and provoke, the \n     politically powerful current beneficiaries, who with their \n     allies had routed the Reagan Administration in 1981, the \n     least, and put the lion's share of the hurt on the young, \n     including those not even born yet.\n       Moreover, when we examine how the sacrifice broke down \n     between benefit cuts and tax increases, we see that the \n     broad-based rescue was, in reality, disproportionately based \n     on tax increases. The measures to increase revenues--benefit \n     taxation, accelerated tax increases, the higher self-\n     employment tax rate, and augmenting the revenue base with new \n     participants--reduced the long-term acturial deficit by 1.21 \n     percent of taxable payroll, or almost 58 percent of the \n     total.\n       Not only that, the Greesnpan Commission's reforms were shot \n     through with serpentine underhandedness. For one thing, the \n     graudal ramping up of the retirement age and cutting of the \n     early retirement benefit were scheduled so as to bite worst \n     in 2027, 44 years after enactment--in other words long after \n     the politicians who had enacted them had left Congress and \n     were safe from retaliation by angry baby boomers on Election \n     Day.\n       For another, the benefit taxation will hit future \n     generations far harder than it hit the current beneficiaries \n     of the 1980s, because the income thresholds which trigger the \n     taxation, $25,000 and $32,000, were not adjusted for \n     inflation (and still aren't). This means that over time, \n     thanks to inflation, more and more beneficiaries will hit \n     these tax tripwires, just as inflation shoved Americans into \n     higher tax brackets before income tax indexing was enacted in \n     1981.\n       Phillip Longman maintained that of all the features of the \n     1981 rescue, benefit taxation ``most reduces the benefits \n     promised to baby boomers and their children.'' While benefit \n     taxation hit only the richest beneficiaries when enacted, \n     Longman noted, even with the modest rates of inflation which \n     the Social Security actuaries' intermediate analysis assumed, \n     a $25,000 income in 2030 would have less purchasing power \n     than an income of $4,000 in the mid-1980s! ``So by the time \n     the baby boomers qualify for Social Security pensions, the \n     program will be effectively means tested, if it survives at \n     all. Under current law, i.e., including the 1983 amendments, \n     only the poorest baby boomers are even promised a fair return \n     on their contributions to the system.''\n       How's that for a piece of Byzantine cunning?\n       Yet for all its heavy burdens, which it imposed with such \n     inequity and insidiousness, the 1983 rescue of Social \n     Security turned out to be only temporarily effective. The \n     1983 Annual Report of Social Security's Board of Trustees \n     projected long-term actuarial balance for Social Security.\n       Just five years later, the long-term balance was in deficit \n     again, -0.58 percent of taxable payroll. In 1993, ten years \n     after the great rescue legislation, the long-term actuarial \n     deficit was -1.46 percent. In 1994, thanks to various changes \n     in actuarial assumptions, the Board of Trustees reported a \n     deficit of -2,13 percent--worse than the deficit which the \n     1983 rescue had erased. The long-term actuarial deficit \n     continued to grow, hitting -2.23 percent of taxable payroll \n     in the 1997 Annual Report.\n       An improved economic outlook due to the late-1990s \n     prosperity and productivity growth led to optimistic revision \n     of various economic assumptions, and the long-term actuarial \n     deficit began dropping as a result, to -1.87 percent of \n     taxable payroll in the 2002 Annual Report. Nevertheless, the \n     trustees continue to point out that Social Security is not in \n     long-term close actuarial balance and that corrective action \n     is necessary.\n       To sum up, the 1983 rescue legislation embodying the \n     recommendations of Greenspan's Commission substantially \n     injured the baby boomers and their younger siblings on the \n     sly--and it didn't help.\n\n\n                      another stealth ``rescue''?\n\n       The lurking menace in Greenspan's recent remarks is that he \n     may be floating a trial balloon for another stealth \n     ``rescue'' of Social Security which pushes the bulk of the \n     pain into the future and doesn't really accomplish much. It \n     is almost certain that any trimming of benefits by the \n     measures Greenspan advocates--raising the retirement age or \n     shifting to a lower inflation rate for the COLA--would \n     scrupulously avoid arousing the politically formidable \n     current elderly, who are not only organized into pressure \n     groups such as the American Association of Retired Persons \n     and the Seniors Coalition, but, as is well known, participate \n     in voting much more heavily than do the young.\n       Notice that Greenspan wants ``[e]lderly initiatives to \n     address the economic effects of baby-boom retirements.'' \n     What's significant here is that he says nothing about cutting \n     current costs, which have exploded to extremely high levels. \n     Benefit outlays were $141 billion ($386 million a day) in \n     calendar 1981 and $268.2 billion ($735 million a day) in \n     calendar 1991, almost double the 1981 figure. In calendar \n     2001, Social Security paid $431.9 billion in benefits ($1.18 \n     billion a day), over three times the 1981 cost.\n       Moreover, this mushroom growth will continue even before \n     the baby boomers swamp Social Security. Under intermediate \n     actuarial assumptions, benefit outlays are projected at \n     $546.7 billion ($1.5 billion a day) for calendar 2006, before \n     any baby boomers retire, and $746.7 billion ($2.05 billion a \n     day), an increase of 72.9 percent over 2001's figure, for \n     calendar 2011, when boomer retirements have just begun.\n       Then, too, just as the Greenspan Commission's 1983 benefit \n     taxation with trigger income levels unadjusted for inflation \n     is a stealth means test, tinkering with the price index for \n     the COLA is itself an intrinsically insidious way to cut \n     benefits. Rather than cut them directly, it finagles the \n     arithmetic on which their adjustment for inflation is based.\n       Finally, fiddling with the inflation rate for the COLA may \n     in fact not make all that much difference. Buried toward the \n     end of the February 28 Washington Post piece on Greenspan's \n     remarks was the interesting news that whereas a 1996 \n     commission found that the Consumer Price Index overstated \n     inflation by 1.1 percentage points a year, another study done \n     in 2000 found that improvements in the index made by the \n     Bureau of Labor Statistics had whittled the overstatement \n     down to 0.6 percentage points a year, an improvement of \n     almost 50 percent.\n       Now, the Social Security actuaries have already factored in \n     the improvements in the Consumer Price Index. Both the \n     improvement in the long term actuarial deficit in recent \n     years and the projected explosion in outlays by 2011 already \n     take the more-accurate index into account. Which leads one to \n     wonder just how much we'd really gain by tinkering with the \n     CPI some more.\n       So while Greenspan's recent testimony seems like a \n     courageous and tough-minded warning about Social Security, \n     under close scrutiny it looks like the makings of another \n     serpentine but ineffectual attempt to fend off disaster.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/10/senate-section/article/S3403-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3403-S3404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH, PREVENTION AND CARE ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my colleagues \nSenators Mikulski, Bond, Breaux, Dodd, Lincoln, Landrieu and Cochran in \nintroducing this important bipartisan legislation. The Alzheimer's \nResearch, Prevention and Care Act will expand federal efforts to find \nnew ways of treating and preventing Alzheimer's Disease and to provide \nbetter care for the 4 million Americans suffering from this devastating \nillness.\n  Alzheimer's disease is the most serious threat to the health and \nwell-being of America's seniors. It has a devastating impact on \nindividuals, families, the health care system, and society as a whole. \nToday, four million Americans have Alzheimer's disease, and that number \nis expected to grow to 14 million as baby boomers age. Currently, one \nin 10 people over the age of 65 have Alzheimer's disease, and nearly \nhalf of those over 85 suffer from it. This figure is particularly \nalarming, since the over-85 age group is the fastest growing segment of \nour population.\n  The annual cost of formal care for Alzheimer's disease is immense--\n$100 billion, and the value of the care provided by family caregivers \nis an additional $196 billion. As the baby boomer generation continues \nto age, the costs will rise to at least $375 billion a year, which \npresents a serious challenge to Medicare, Medicaid and our entire \nhealth care system.\n  We can avoid this crisis. Researchers have been working hard to find \na cure. Scientists have come close to discovering the scientific causes \nof Alzheimer's disease. Newly released studies have begun to reveal \ninformation\n\n[[Page S3404]]\n\non what aging Americans can do to reduce the risk of developing this \ndevastating disease. One study found that those who consumed the most \nsaturated fat had double the risk of those who consumed the lowest \namount. Another study has found that blood pressure played an important \nrole in the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease in those 75 or \nolder. These and other research studies are helping to create a better \nunderstanding of why brain cells shrink and die.\n  Hopefully, we are on the verge of a breakthrough, and scientists \ndeserve greater support in order to make the goal of cure a reality. \nThat is why we must do more to accelerate the research critical to \nfinding a cure. The Act we propose will advance our country toward the \ngoal of doubling the future investment in Alzheimer's disease research \nat NIH. It authorizes $1.5 billion for the National Institute on Aging \nby the year 2008, which is the lead NIH institute for this research.\n  The research funding authorized by the Act will add new speed in the \nrace to prevent this illness that touches the lives of so many \nAmericans. These funds will support the Alzheimer's Disease Prevention \nInitiative authorized by the act. Prevention is our best opportunity to \nhalt the growth of Alzheimer's disease. Observational studies in large \npopulations suggest that drugs already in wide use in middle-aged and \nolder people may have a protective effect against the disease. Those \nresults must now be validated in large-scale, controlled clinical \ntrials. Among prevention initiatives, the Act authorizes trials to \ndetermine whether compounds such as estrogen, vitamin E, ginko biloba \nand aspirin can prevent the onset of the disease.\n  The act also authorizes cooperative clinical research at the National \nInstitute on Aging. Clinical trials can cost millions of dollars and \ninvolve thousands of participants and years of work. This legislation \nwill enhance these needed trials, develop new ways to design these \ntrials, and make it easier for patients to enroll in key studies. \nCooperative research is essential to launching these clinical trials \nand supporting productive research.\n  The act also supports research and programs to help millions of \nfamily caregivers who provide loved ones with care at home. Seventy \npercent of those with the disease live at home in which families \nprovide at least 77 percent of their care. It is vitally important to \nfind better ways to help families who are the backbone of our long-term \ncare system. The support they provide is extraordinary, and often \njeopardizes their own health. It is unacceptable that one in eight \nAlzheimer's caregivers becomes ill or injured as a direct result of \ncaregiving. Family caregivers provide the support which prevents these \npatients from having to enter institutions. This issue is especially \nimportant, given the nationwide health workforce shortage in nursing \nhomes.\n  The act also reauthorizes the Alzheimer's Demonstration Program in \nthe Administration on Aging and increases funding to expand it. This \nprogram has been highly successful in pioneering new ways to fill gaps \nin existing state delivery systems, so that local and community-based \nprograms can do more for underserved populations with Alzheimer's \ndisease.

Mr. President, it is a privilege to join colleagues \nSenator Clinton, Warner, Snowe, Mikulski, Jeffords, Murray, Breaux, \nCollins and Smith in introducing the Lifespan respite Care Act. The act \nwill authorize grants to promote a coordinated system of accessible \nrespite care services for 26 million Americans who care for a family \nmember or friend who is chronically ill or disabled.\n  Caregivers today work tirelessly to support their loved ones and help \nthem to maintain their quality of life as effectively as possible. \nWithout this important care, many seniors and people with disabilities \nwould be forced to live in institutions, reducing their quality-of-life \nand resulting in more costly care.\n  Services provided by family caregivers are estimated to be worth \nnearly $200 billion annually. Even if we tried to replace these family \ncaregivers with paid workers, we would face workforce shortages, a \nserious problem that will only worsen as the baby boom generation \nreaches retirement age.\n  By 2010, more than 780,000 additional caregivers must be found to \nfill long-term staff positions, an increase of 39 percent over the year \n2000. We now rely, and we will have to continue to rely, on unpaid \ncaregivers in order to meet the growing need and enable those who \nreceive the care to continue to live in the least restrictive \nenvironment possible.\n  Many family caregivers are themselves suffering from the stress and \nphysical strain of their work. Often, they live the caregiver life, \nwhich is frequently called the 36-hour day. They deserve more support \nin order to do their essential work. Sometimes, the relief they need \nmay be a ``timeout'' for just an hour or two a week to do the grocery \nshopping or have time to go to the doctor. Other family caregivers may \nneed far more relief. Our bill will provide essential respite care \nservices and ensure that respite care providers are trained \nappropriately, so caregivers will feel at ease when they leave their \nloved one with respite providers.\n  I urge the Senate to support this important legislation that will \nprovide long needed support for the elderly and disabled and that will \nmean so much to the family caregivers of our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/10/senate-section/article/S3404-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3404-S3405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PROBLEMS WITH THE DEATH PENALTY\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I believe that the death penalty is \nineffective, cruel, and unjust. Killing people convicted of criminal \noffenses under the color of State law is wrong; and the \ndisproportionate execution of a certain class or race of people is \nutterly unconscionable.\n  In the United States, although African Americans make up only 12 \npercent of the overall population, 42 percent of the people currently \non death row are Black. African Americans are also overrepresented in \nthe number of people on death row who are later found to be innocent: \n38 percent of death row inmates freed since 1973 because of new \nevidence were African Americans, and 35 percent of those executed and \nlater found to be innocent were Black.\n  Despite these startling statistics, the State of Texas, President \nBush's home State, is determined to execute Americans as fast as \npossible, even in light of potentially exculpatory evidence.\n  In today's New York Times, columnist Bob Herbert writes about an \nAmerican-African man who, in about 48 hours, may become the 300th \nperson executed by the State of Texas since the resumption of capital \npunishment in 1982.\n  As Mr. Herbert notes, this case is particularly disturbing because \nthere is strong evidence that the accused, Mr. Delma Banks, Jr., did \nnot commit the capital offense. But, in a blatant disregard for truth \nand the equitable administration of justice, Texas intends to proceed \nregardless.\n  This senseless State-sanctioned killing must stop!\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Herbert's column in the New York \nTimes dated March 10, 2003, be printed into the Record following my \nremarks.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From The New York Times, Mar. 10, 2003]\n\n                     Countdown to Execution No. 300\n\n                            (By Bob Herbert)\n\n       The war trumps all other issues, so insufficient attention \n     will be paid to the planned demise of Delma Banks, Jr., a 43-\n     year-old man who is scheduled in about 48 hours to become the \n     300th person executed in Texas since the resumption of \n     capital punishment in 1982.\n\n[[Page S3405]]\n\n       Mr. Banks, a man with no prior criminal record, is most \n     likely innocent of the charge that put him on death row. \n     Fearing a tragic miscarriage of justice, three former federal \n     judges (including William Sessions, a former director of the \n     F.B.I.) have urged the U.S. Supreme Court to block \n     Wednesday's execution.\n       So far, no one seems to be listening.\n       ``The prosecutors in this case concealed important \n     impeachment material from the defense,'' said Mr. Sessions \n     and the other former judges, John J. Gibbons and Timothy K. \n     Lewis, in an extraordinary friend-of-the court brief.\n       They said the questions raised by the Banks case ``directly \n     implicate the integrity of the administration of the death \n     penalty in this country.''\n       Most reasonable people would be highly disturbed to have \n     the execution of a possibly innocent man on their conscience \n     or their record. But this is Texas we're talking about, a \n     state that prefers to shoot first and ask no questions at \n     all. Fairness and justice have never found a comfortable \n     niche in the Texas criminal justice system, and the fact that \n     the accused might be innocent is not considered sufficient \n     reason to call off his execution.\n       (One of the most demoralizing developments of the past \n     couple of years is the fact that George W. Bush has been \n     striving so hard to make all of the United States more like \n     Texas.)\n       Delma Banks was convicted and sentenced to death for the \n     murder of 16-year-old Richard Whitehead, who was shot to \n     death in 1980 in a town called Nash, not far from Texarkana. \n     There was little chance that this would have been a capital \n     case if both the accused and the victim had been of the same \n     race. Or if the accused had been white and the victim black.\n       But Mr. Banks is black and Mr. Whitehead was white, and \n     that's the jackpot combination when it comes to the death \n     penalty. Blacks convicted of killing whites are the ones most \n     likely to end up in the execution chamber. In Texas this \n     principle has been reinforced for years by the ruthless \n     exclusion of jurors who are black.\n       Just two weeks ago the Supreme Court handed down a ruling \n     that criticized courts in Texas for ignoring evidence of \n     racial bias in a death penalty case. Lawyers in the case \n     noted that up until the mid-1970's prosecutors in Dallas \n     actually had a manual that said, ``Do not take Jews, Negroes, \n     Dagos, Mexicans or a member of any minority race on a jury, \n     no matter how rich or well-educated.''\n       The significant evidence against Mr. Banks was the \n     testimony of two hard-core drug addicts. One was a paid \n     informant. The other was a career felon facing a long prison \n     term who was told that a pending arson charge would be \n     dismissed if he performed ``well'' while testifying against \n     Mr. Banks.\n       The prosecution deliberately suppressed information about \n     its arrangements with these witnesses--information that it \n     was obliged by law to turn over to the defense.\n       And prosecutors made sure that all the jurors at Mr. \n     Banks's trial were white. That was routine. Lawyers handling \n     Mr. Banks's appeal have shown that from 1975 through 1980 \n     prosecutors in Bowie County, where Mr. Banks was tried, \n     accepted more than 80 percent of qualified white jurors in \n     felony cases, while peremptorily removing more than 90 \n     percent of qualified black jurors.\n       The strongest evidence pointing to Mr. Banks's innocence \n     was physical. He was in Dallas, more than three hours away \n     from Texarkana, when Mr. Whitehead was killed, according to \n     the best estimates of the time of death, based on the autopsy \n     results.\n       Prosecutorial misconduct. Racial bias. Drug-addicted \n     informants. ``This is one-stop shopping for what's wrong with \n     the administration of the death penalty,'' said George \n     Kendall, a lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense and \n     Educational Fund who is handling Mr. Banks's appeal.\n       If, despite all that is known about this case, the \n     authorities walk Mr. Banks into the execution chamber on \n     Wednesday, and strap him to a gurney, and inject the lethal \n     poison into his veins, we will be taking another Texas-sized \n     step away from a reasonably fair and just society, and back \n     toward the state-sanctioned barbarism we should be trying to \n     flee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/10/senate-section/article/S3405-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RELEASE OF VIETNAM NUCLEAR WEAPONS REPORT\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, in the mid-1960s, during the height of \nthe Vietnam War, the Department of Defense commissioned a study to \ndetermine the feasibility and advisability of the use of tactical \nnuclear weapons in that conflict. A copy of that 1967 study, ``Tactical \nNuclear Weapons in Southeast Asia'', has just been declassified, and \nlays out in terrifying detail what might have happened if the United \nStates had used tactical nuclear weapons during the Vietnam war.\n  The bottom line of the study is that the use of nuclear weapons in \nVietnam--to block the Ho Chi Minh trail, kill large numbers of enemy \nsoldiers, or destroy North Vietnamese air bases and seaports--would \nhave offered no decisive military advantages to the United States but \nwould have had grave repercussions for US soldiers in the field and US \ninterests around the world.\n  The study was prepared by four physicists associated with the Jason \nDivision of the Institute of Defense Analyses, a group of scientists \nwho met frequently to provide classified advice to defense officials. \nThe study's conclusions were presented to then-Secretary of Defense \nRobert McNamara.\n  ``The political effects of US first use of TNW (tactical nuclear \nweapons) in Vietnam would be uniformly bad and could be catastrophic,'' \nthe scientists wrote.\n  They warned that US first-use of tactical nuclear weapons could lead \nChina or the Soviet Union to provide similar weapons to the Viet Cong \nand North Vietnam, raising the possibility that US forces in Vietnam \n``would be essentially annihilated'' in retaliatory raids by nuclear-\narmed guerrilla forces.\n  If that happened, they wrote, ``insurgent groups everywhere in the \nworld would take note and would try by all available means to acquire \nTNW for themselves.'' First-use of nuclear weapons in Southeast Asia, \nthe scientists warned, was ``likely to result in greatly increased \nlong-term risk of nuclear guerrilla operations in other parts of the \nworld,'' including attacks on the Panama Canal, oil pipelines and \nstorage facilities in Venezuela and the Israeli capital of Tel Aviv.\n  ``US security would be gravely endangered if the use of TNW by \nguerrilla forces should become widespread,'' they concluded.\n  Thirty-six years later some American officials are, according to \npress reports, once again contemplating the use of nuclear weapons, and \nseeking to repeal US prohibitions on the developments of smaller \nnuclear weapons, including so-called ``low-yield'' bombs and deep-\npenetration ``bunker-busters.''\n  Writing recently in the Los Angeles Times, military analyst William \nArkin disclosed the US Strategic Command in Omaha and the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff are secretly drawing up nuclear target lists for Iraq. \n``Target lists are being scrutinized, options are being pondered and \nprocedures are being tested to give nuclear armaments a role in the new \nU.S. doctrine of `preemption,' '' Arkin reported.\n  There have also been reports that tactical nuclear weapons, \nparticularly ``bunker busters,'' have been considered by Pentagon \nplanners in the context of the escalating nuclear crisis with North \nKorea. Moreover, many US analysts believe there is a great danger that \nNorth Korea, if its survival was at stake, would be willing to sell its \nnuclear arsenal to the highest bidder.\n  North Korea itself apparently believes the United States may be \nplanning nuclear strikes of its own, and on March 1 warned that a war \non the Korean peninsula would quickly ``escalate into a nuclear war.''\n  I sincerely believe that any first use of nuclear weapons by the \nUnited States cannot and should not be sanctioned. As the Jason \nscientists argued in the 1960s, U.S. nuclear planning could serve as a \npretext for other countries and, worse, terrorist groups such as al-\nQaida, to build or acquire their own bombs. If we are not careful, our \nown nuclear posture could provoke the very nuclear-proliferation \nactivities we are seeking to prevent.\n  This study, ``Tactical Nuclear Weapons in Southeast Asia'', was \nreleased this past weekend by the Nautilus Institute of Berkeley, CA, \nand I would urge those with an interest in reading it in full to \ncontact them directly.\n  The conclusions of the Jason report are as valid, realistic and \nfrightening today as they were in 1967. As we contemplate the future \ncourse of our nation's national security policy, I believe that it is \nimportant to look at past events, to learn from them, and to benefit \nfrom the counsel of history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/10/senate-section/article/S3405-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3405-S3406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TIBETAN DAY OF COMMEMORATION\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today commemorates the forty-fourth \nanniversary of the 1959 ``Lhasa Uprising.''\n  I offer my comments today in the sincere hope that it will promote a \nconstructive dialogue between Chinese and Tibetan leaders, and with the \ngoal of ending the bitter divisiveness now plaguing relations between \nChina and Tibet.\n\n[[Page S3406]]\n\n  When, following the Chinese invasion in 1949-1950, Tibet was \nestablished as an autonomous region in the People's Republic of China, \nthe Tibetan people were granted the right of autonomy in determining \nthe shape of their religious, cultural and social institutions. China's \nleadership is on record as agreeing to this principle.\n  Unfortunately, between 1951 and 1959 the government of the People's \nRepublic of China did not uphold these guarantees of autonomy, leading \nto the 1959 Lhasa Uprising and the flight of the Dalai Lama from Tibet. \nDuring the past 44 years, tens of thousands of Tibetans have been \nforced to flee their homeland in the face of continued Chinese \nrepression and violation of their right to religious and cultural \nautonomy. I find this a tragedy.\n  Nonetheless, the Dalai Lama, in seeking to engage with China's \nleadership to discuss the future of the Tibetan people, has \nspecifically cited that he is not seeking independence for Tibet, that \nhe is willing to confine his discussions to achieving cultural and \nreligious autonomy for his people, and that he is willing to negotiate \nwithin the framework enunciated by Deng Xiaoping in 1979.\n  Indeed, in his statement today on the ``44th Anniversary of the \nTibetan National Uprising,'' the Dalai Lama stated that ``As far back \nas the early seventies in consultation with senior Tibetan officials I \nmade a decision to seek a solution to the Tibetan problem through a \n``Middle Way Approach.'' This framework does not call for independence \nand separation of Tibet. At the same time it provides genuine autonomy \nfor the six million men and women who consider themselves Tibetans to \npreserve their distinctive identity, to promote their religious and \ncultural heritage that is based on a centuries-old philosophy which is \non benefit even in the 21st century, and to protect the delicate \nenvironment of the Tibetan plateau. This approach will contribute to \nthe overall stability and unity of the People's Republic of China.''\n  Over the past 12 years I have made every effort to encourage \nrapprochement between China and Tibet, including helping to pass \nmessages from His Holiness, the Dalai Lama to China. I believe the \nDalai Lama is absolutely sincere in his desire to negotiate a peaceful \nsolution to what has been a great tragedy for the Tibetan people.\n  This past September the Chinese government made it possible for two \nenvoys of the Dalai Lama to visit Beijing to re-establish direct \ncontact with the Chinese leadership, and to visit Tibet to meet with \nlocal Tibetan officials. This trip was, in my view, very significant, \nvery encouraging, and very meaningful.\n  Nonetheless, much remains to be done if the people of Tibet are to \nachieve freedom and autonomy in determining the shape of their society. \nIt is my sincere hope that China's new leadership will extend the hand \nof cooperation in resolving differences with Tibet.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/10/senate-section/article/S3406-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3406-S3407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, no one can deny the contributions \nwomen and children have made to this country and the world. In \ngovernment, business, education, medicine, the arts, and athletics, \nwomen have met and exceeded the great challenges placed before them. It \nis altogether fitting, then, that we set aside one day every year to \npay tribute and acknowledge these accomplishments: March 8, 2003 is \nInternational Women's Day.\n  On this day, we celebrate the progress women and girls have made over \nthe years, but we also renew our commitment to create a better world \nand bestow a better future to women and girls in every country. We must \nnot rest on our laurels until all women and girls enjoy basic human \nrights and have the opportunity to fulfill their life dreams.\n  Rarely does a day go by when we do not hear the news of a woman \nfighting for those rights and those dreams, whether it be a girl \nstruggling to get an education in Afghanistan, a mother desperately \nseeking to provide for her children in sub-Saharan Africa, or a woman \nexpressing her views in the streets of Venezuela. We who enjoy the \nblessings of liberty and democracy have an obligation to raise our \nvoice on behalf of these women and girls to let them know that they are \nnot alone and we are fighting for them.\n  All over the world, women and girls are looking to the United States \nfor leadership and I would like to take this time to address several \ncritical issues that I believe are vital to their lives: international \nfamily planning assistance, the Convention on the Elimination of All \nForms of Discrimination Against Women, CEDAW, rape as an instrument of \nwar, and the plight of women in Afghanistan.\n  Honest differences of opinion exist on this issue, but I believe that \nthose of us in Congress who support a robust package of U.S. assistance \nto international family planning organizations must not back down. I \nwas dismayed when on July 22, 2002 Secretary of State Colin Powell \ndecided to withhold the $34 million U.S. contribution to the United \nNations Population Fund, UNFPA--an amount allocated to it by law and \nafter months of negotiation and with bipartisan support--because he \ndetermined that UNFPA participated in coercive family planning programs \nin China. The administration's decision to withhold the funds and \nwithhold $25 million for Fiscal Year 2003 runs counter to common sense \nand counter to the findings of its own investigative team.\n  Just over a month earlier a three member State Department team \ninvestigated UNFPA programs in China and concluded quite clearly that \nthere was no evidence that UNFPA supported or participated in coercive \nfamily planning programs and recommended that it receive the full U.S. \n$34 million contribution. Nevertheless, the Administration chose to \nignore these findings and, in doing so, struck a terrible blow to U.S. \nleadership in combating overpopulation.\n  One can not underestimate the importance of family planning \nassistance, especially for the poor. The United Nations estimates that \nthe world's population will double to 12 billion by the year 2050. Most \nof this growth will occur in countries least able to sustain it and \neducational and medical services will suffer greatly as a result. In \nthe age of global terrorism where groups such al-Qaida find new \nrecruits among the poor, the sick, and the uneducated, this is \nespecially troubling.\n  No woman should be prevented from receiving the assistance she \ndeserves to plan and care for healthy families. When we help them, we \nreduce poverty, improve health, and raise living standards.\n  Each and every dollar the United States spend on international family \nplanning assistance--none of which, I might add, is spent on \ninternational abortion--is one less dollar we will have to spend on \ncostlier interventions in the future.\n  So many of my colleagues share my view and together we must work \nharder to ensure that the United States reclaims its leadership role on \ninternational family planning and reproductive issues. On International \nWomen's Day, I urge my colleagues to support full funding for the UNFPA \nand other international family planning programs.\n  Sadly, another year has gone by and the United States still has not \nyet ratified the Convention to Eliminate All Forms of Discrimination \nAgainst Women. As Americans, we can no longer afford to ignore this \nimportant document and put in jeopardy our status as a leader in \nadvancing human rights for women and girls.\n  Given that it has been over 20 years since President Carter signed \nthe Convention, one might think that the delay in ratification is due \nto the fact we are dealing with a treaty that requires years of study \nand consideration. Yet the Convention simply requires that \nparticipating states take all appropriate steps to eliminate \ndiscrimination against women in political and public life, law, \neducation, employment, health care, commercial transactions, and \ndomestic relations.\n  We are alone among the leading democracies in our failure to ratify. \nIn fact, our partners outside the Convention include Iran, North Korea, \nand Sudan. Are these the countries with whom we share our values of \ndemocracy, freedom, and respect for human rights? Are these the \ncountries we can count on in the international arena?\n  Women and girls around the world who turn to the United States for \nleadership in advancing their rights are\n\n[[Page S3407]]\n\nmystified that we do not take the simple step of ratifying the \nConvention. When we do, the sky will not fall, the sun will rise in the \nmorning, and the Constitution will still be the law of the land.\n  By ratifying the Convention, the United States will reclaim its \nleadership status as a champion of the rights of women and girls and \nsend a strong signal of warning to those states who abuse those rights.\n  On International Women's Day, I call on my colleagues in the Senate \nto move forward and ratify the Convention.\n  The use of rape as an instrument of war is a gross violation of the \nbasic human rights of women and girls and I have worked hard over the \nyears to raise awareness about this issue. The United States must work \nclosely with our friends and allies in the international community to \neliminate this practice once and for all.\n  We have seen far too often in recent years how soldiers have used \nrape in an organized, systematic, and sustained manner to intimidate, \nspread fear, and ethnically cleanse entire communities. In Bosnia, \nRwanda, and East Timor, women were kidnaped, interned in camps and \nhouses, forced to do labor and subjected to frequent rape and sexual \nassault.\n  Those who committed these crimes did not believe that anyone was \nwatching. They were wrong.\n  On February 22, 2001, the international tribunal in the Hague \nsentenced three Bosnian Serbs to prison for rape during the Bosnian \nwar. Judge Florence Mumba of Zambia stated, ``Lawless opportunists \nshould expect no mercy, no matter how low their position in the chain \nof command.''\n  Last year, in response to a report co-authored by the Shan Women's \nAction Network and the Shan Human Rights Foundation, I and 31 other \nSenators wrote to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to urge him to \ninvestigate rape cases by Burmese soldiers between 1996 and 2001 \ninvolving 625 women and girls.\n  The report was based on interviews with refugees on the Thai-Burmese \nborder. It found that the rapes were committed mostly by officers in \nfront of their troops and that 61 percent were gang rapes and 25 \npercent ended in the murder of the victims. The victims included girls \nas young as 5 years old.\n  The Burmese junta did not make a serious effort to investigate the \ncases. It called the report ``totally false and unjust'' and sought to \ndiscredit the authors.\n  Those who committed these heinous crimes in Burma must be brought to \njustice. The United States and the international community must \ncontinue to put pressure on the Burmese regime to come clean and take \nsubstantive action to punish those responsible.\n  I commend the victims who overcame their fears to report what \nhappened in Burma. I am hopeful more women and girls who have suffered \nthe same crime will come forward and speak up. On International Women's \nDay, I urge the administration and our friends and allies to join me in \ncontinuing the fight to end the practice of rape as an instrument of \nwar.\n  The situation for most women and girls in Afghanistan has improved \nsince the fall of the Taliban. Nevertheless, there is still a great \ndeal of work to be done and I am concerned that the administration is \nnot paying enough attention to the reconstruction of Afghanistan in \ngeneral and the condition of women and girls in particular.\n  The United States Congress made a strong statement in support of the \nwomen and girls of Afghanistan by passing the ``Afghan Women and \nChildren Relief Act of 2001'' and the ``Afghan Freedom Support Act of \n2002''. Now we must follow up with sufficient funding. I was proud to \nco-sponsor an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2003 Omnibus appropriations \nbill that directed $8 million of the money appropriated for \nhumanitarian aid to Afghanistan towards programs that support women's \ndevelopment: $5 million to the Ministry of Women's Affairs, $1.5 \nmillion to the Human Rights Commission, and the rest to USAID.\n  The future for women and girls in Afghanistan is by no means assured. \nThere are credible reports that in Herat, the local governor Ismail \nKhan has censored women's groups, intimidated women leaders, and \nremoved women from his administration. In all parts of Afghanistan, \nwomen still fear abuse from authorities, avoid attending school, and \nface undue harsh restrictions.\n  I am particularly concerned to learn of reports that police in Herat \nare detaining women and girls caught with unrelated men and forcing \nthem to undergo medical examinations to determine if they recently had \nsexual intercourse. I and my colleague from California, Senator Boxer, \nwrote to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of State \nColin Powell urging them to put pressure on Ismail Khan to stop these \npractices and do more to protect the rights of women and girls.\n  Our victory in Afghanistan will be lost if women and girls are not \nafforded basic human rights. On International Women's Day, let us \nreaffirm our commitment to them for a better future and let us let them \nknow that we will not turn our backs on them again.\n  We must debate and ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All \nForms of Discrimination Against Women. We must rededicate ourselves and \nour resources to international family planning programs. We must not \nignore the use of rape as an instrument of war.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a special \nfriend and outstanding public servant, Bruce Gwinn, who passed away on \nJanuary 29, 2003, following a year-long battle with cancer.\n  I share the grief of many here in Washington who came to know and \nlove Bruce Gwinn in the course of his 30 years working on Capitol Hill. \nAnd, of course, my most heartfelt sympathies go out to Bruce's wife, \nMay, his three children, Dylan, Maria and Byron, and his entire \nextended family.\n  Bruce was born and raised in Charleston, SC, and graduated from Duke \nUniversity in 1971. After serving in the Army, Bruce moved to \nWashington to begin a career in public service. Following my election \nto the House of Representatives in 1974, Bruce came to work for me as \nmy first Legislative Director, and he served with me right up until I \nwas elected to the Senate in 1980.\n  Bruce was far more than a superb advisor--he was a valued and trusted \nfriend.\n  From 1981 to 1990, Bruce worked as a professional staffer on the \nHouse Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, where he \nserved under three chairman. He then served as a senior policy advisory \nfor the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, where he was \nresponsible for all regulatory issues.\n  In 1997, Bruce returned to work on the Energy and Commerce Committee, \nwhere he served as Congressman John Dingell's top advisor on \ninternational trade policy. True to inform, he worked full-time right \nup until days before he passed away.\n  Bruce Gwinn was of a rare and special breed. He was known by everyone \nwith whom he came in contact as a supreme optimist. Although he had his \nshare of challenges in life, Bruce was always thankful for what he had, \nand always thought the best of others. People were naturally drawn to \nBruce because of his contagious smile and enormous heart. And he had \nthe most uncanny ability to diffuse any tense situation with his \nendearing sense of humor.\n  Although Bruce was a very soft-spoken man, when he spoke, you knew \nyou could take his words to the bank. He was as knowledgeable as anyone \non Capitol Hill, on a whole variety of issues.\n  At any point in the past 20 years, Bruce could have taken his \nexpertise on trade, commerce, consumer protection, and other important \nmatters, and\n\n[[Page S3408]]\n\nleft the Hill for more lucrative employment.\n  Bruce chose to stay in government. This surprised nobody. Bruce chose \nto stay in government because that's where he felt he could best serve \nthe interests of hard-working Americans and their families. He chose to \nstay in government because he wanted to dedicate himself to improving \nthe lives of others. Bruce Gwinn was, above all, an extraordinarily \ndedicated public servant.\n  Edmund Burke once said, ``There is no greater glory than to work for \nthe public's good.''\n  Bruce lived by those words every day, and our nation owes him a debt \nof gratitude.\n  Mr. President, Bruce Gwinn's life was cut short--he was only 53 years \nold, and in the prime of his life. And he will be terribly missed.\n  But I came to the Floor of the Senate today not simply to mourn a \nloss--I came to the Floor to celebrate a life. The life of Bruce Gwinn \nwas truly a life well-lived. He touched so many, and everyone of us he \ntouched is a better person because of it. I am proud to have worked \nwith Bruce, and lucky to have had him as a friend.\n  I thank the President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/10/senate-section/article/S3408-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need \nfor hate crimes legislation. In the last Congress Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred September 28, \n2001 in Falls Church, VA. A man of Middle-Eastern descent had to flee \nin his car from another driver, who repeatedly rammed and chased him in \nhis vehicle. Police said that the assailant, a white male 50- to 60-\nyears-old, yelled racial slurs at the victim while attacking him with \nhis car. The victim was able to escape without serious injuries.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/10/senate-section/article/S3408-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SALUTE TO DOTTIE ASHLEY\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS.

CHANDLER, ``MR. YMCA''\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to an \noutstanding citizen of the great state of Alabama, William C. Chandler.\n  For over 50 years, Mr. Chandler's mission has been to help the youth \nand community around him. His work and endeavors have improved the \nlives of so many disadvantaged children and greatly enriched the \nMontgomery community. The foundation of good will he has laid will \nundoubtedly continue to help countless more as he settles into \nretirement.\n  His career began in 1945 when he received his Naval ROTC Officer \ncommission and served 16 months in the Pacific theater. Upon returning, \nhe finished two degrees, taught mathematics and became assistant \ndirector at the Young Men's Christian Association, YMCA, in Athens, GA. \nTwo years later, in 1956, he moved to Alabama where he spent the next \n54 years working hard to help the children and families of Montgomery, \nstarting as the Boy's Work Secretary and as a Junior Lion's Camp \nDirector. When he got to Montgomery, the YMCA program was very small \nand in need of financial support. Though the program was small and not \nwell supported, Mr. Chandler had a larger and more significant vision \nfor the Montgomery YMCA. He spearheaded their Capital Campaign and \nraised over $1 million, a truly impressive amount considering it was \nthe 1950s. With this money, two more local YMCA facilities were \nintroduced, with even more being built in the 1960s and 70s. Today \nthese facilities serve over 65,000 people each year in seven local \ncounties.\n  Though Mr. ``YMCA,'' as he is popularly called, centered most of his \ntime and efforts around the YMCA, he also founded many other types of \nprograms to help young women and local families. Included in these are \nthe Alabama Youth in Legislature Program, which gives high school \nstudents a hands-on experience with the government. He also started the \nHi-Y and Tri-Y programs, which are social and service organizations for \nhigh school aged men and women. He also began the Moral Education \nProgram for young men and women; created the Jimmy Hitchcock Award, \nhonoring outstanding high school Christian youth; launched the \nMontgomery Lions International Youth Camp; and, started the Youth to \nEurope Program. He also established the After School Child Care \nProgram,\n\n[[Page S3409]]\n\ncurrently serving more than 3,000 children, began the ``Success by \nSix'' Program, which teaches young children how to lead good lives by \nthe time they're six, as well as the ``Gift of Life'' Program, helping \nmothers and their children in need of help.\n  In addition, to the great many programs he established, Mr. Chandler \nserved in several significant and distinguished roles throughout his \ncareer. Beginning in 1953, he became General Director of the Montgomery \nYMCA, which he served in until May, 2002. In the 1960s, he served as \nthe Chairman of the Helen Keller Memorial Project of the Montgomery \nLions Club and then became their chapter president 1965. He also held a \nlarge leadership role in the YMCA Youth Conference on National Affairs, \nand became Lions Club International President in 1980, during which he \nvisited 42 countries meeting with many dignitaries, including Pope John \nPaul II.\n  For his great work, Bill has been awarded many honors, including 18 \nInternational President's Awards, the Melvin Jones Extension Award, the \nKey Member Award and the District Governor's Extension Award. He is a \nMelvin Jones Fellow, and a recipient of the Ambassador of Goodwill \nAward, the highest honor a Lion can receive from the association. He is \nalso the recipient of three very prestigious awards, including the \nMontgomery Advertiser's ``Citizen of the Year'' award, the Alabama \nJournal's ``Citizen of the Year'' award in 1991, and he was named \nMontgomery's ``Man of the Year'' in 2001.\n  Mr. Chandler's many good deeds can never be counted because his \ncharitable pursuits were countless and often done anonymously. He is an \nexample of a great statesman and leader. He has helped so many people, \nparticularly those in need, and has served as a great role model for \nthe young lives he has so generously helped.\n  I am very proud of his great work. I have seen him lead for good in a \nhost of areas. For a time, I served on his YMCA board. It was easy to \nsee the love and respect those outstanding city leaders had for Bill. \nIt was a respect fairly earned and came as a product of a long and \nproductive life of able service to those less fortunate. I have had the \ngreat opportunity in my life of over one half a century to meet and \nknow many great and selfless Americans. As the leader the YMCA and of \nAlabama's Lions Club, of which I am one, I have seen his unsurpassed, \nand remarkable leadership for good. I know Bill will continue to help \nthose around him, even in retirement. I applaud his tireless efforts on \nbehalf of all Alabamians and would like to take this opportunity to \nthank him for all that he has contributed to Montgomery, the State of \nAlabama, and our Nation.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing Mr. William \nChandler for his outstanding achievements and wish him well in his \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/10/senate-section/article/S3409-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:26 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 13.

A bill to authorize the extension of nondiscriminatory \ntreatment (normal trad relations treatment) to the products of Russia; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation to repeal \nthe Jackson-Vanik amendment to Title IV of the 1974 Trade Act as it \nrelates to Russia and to authorize the President to grant permanent \nnormal trade relations to Russia.\n  Congress passed the 1974 Jackson-Vanik amendment to deny permanent \nnormal trade relations to communist countries that restricted \nemigration rights. Over the years, it has been an effective tool to \npromote free emigration, but its continuing applicability to Russia no \nlonger makes sense in the context of the many changes that have \noccurred since the fall of the Soviet Union.\n  Since 1994, successive Administrations have found Russia in full \ncompliance with the requirements of freedom of emigration. Because \nRussia continues to be subject to Jackson-Vanik, the Administration \nmust submit a semi-annual report to the Congress on Russia's continued \ncompliance with freedom of emigration requirements. Since 1991, \nCongress has authorized the removal of Jackson-Vanik restrictions from \nEstonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, \nHungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Kyrgyzstan, Albania, and Georgia. The \nconditions that have warranted these countries' removal from Title IV \nreporting apply equally to Russia.\n  For more than 8 years, Russia has satisfied the requirements of the \nJackson-Vanik legislation. It has supported free emigration and it has \nsigned a bilateral trade agreement with the United States allowing the \napplication of normal trade relations status. Last year, the United \nStates declared that Russia would no longer be considered a nonmarket \neconomy for the purposes of trade remedies laws. Russia has made \ntremendous strides in the last decade. While Russia currently receives \nnormal trade relations treatment with respect to its exports to the \nU.S., repealing Jackson-Vanik will remove the requirement of semi-\nannual reports that have been an irritant in U.S.-Russia relations. \nGranting permanent normal trade relations also will provide certainty \nthat will improve the investment climate and promote enhanced economic \nrelations between the U.S. and Russia. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BUNNING:\n  S. 582.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nVoinovich, DeWine, Mikulski and Warner to offer health legislation that \nwill bring great benefits to many of our Nation's families.\n  Bacterial meningitis affects 3,000 people across the United States \neach year. Approximately 10 percent of patients with bacterial \nmeningitis die despite receiving antibiotics early in the course of the \ndisease. Meningitis occurs most frequently in infants and young adults \nliving in dormitory settings. The disease can result in permanent brain \ndamage, hearing loss, learning disability, limb amputation, kidney \nfailure or death.\n  In 2001, Lydia Evans entered her sophomore year at North Texas \nUniversity as a healthy 20-year-old. Now she's lost both of her legs, \nparts of seven fingers and endured 15 surgeries and intensive physical \ntherapy. She is a victim of a terrible, yet little-known disease called \nmeningococcal meningitis.\n  Carolyn Waghorne of Dallas contacted me after the tragic death of her \nson, Carter, who contracted meningitis at boarding school in 1998. Mrs. \nWaghorne has led the battle in our State to create awareness about the \ndangers of the illness. After hearing her story, I knew we needed to \nhelp educate all Americans about this devastating--yet preventable--\ndisease.\n  My bill would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in \nconsultation with the Director of the Centers of Disease Control, CDC, \nto develop and make information available about bacterial meningitis. \nIn addition, it would provide information about the availability and \neffectiveness of bacterial meningitis vaccinations for children and \nadults.\n  The information would be distributed at institutions, including child \ncare centers, schools, universities, boarding schools, summer camps, \ndetention facilities, and other entities that provide housing in a \ndorm-like setting.\n  Meningitis is spread through close contact such as coughing or \nsneezing and direct contact with persons infected with meningitis. The \nbacteria cannot live outside the body for very long, so the disease is \nnot as easily transmitted as a cold virus. Many healthy people carry \nthe bacteria, but if a person has a suppressed immune system they may \ncontract the disease. A spinal tap procedure enables doctors to \ndiagnose meningitis, and if the disease is discovered, it is treated \nwith antibiotics.\n  The disease can result in permanent brain damage, hearing loss, \nlearning disability, limb amputation, kidney failure or death.\n  The CDC reports that two-thirds of cases on college campuses could \nhave been prevented with a vaccine. In fact, the Advisory Commission on \nImmunization Practices, part of the CDC, recommends what this bill \nprovides.\n  I commend the Senators for their support and hope other Senators will \njoin us in this effort to prevent the tragedies that befell Lydia Evans \nand Carolyn Waghorne as well as thousands of families every year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 583\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Meningitis Immunization \n     Awareness Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Approximately 3,000 cases of meningococcal disease \n     occur each year in the United States. Approximately 10 to 13 \n     percent of patients with such disease die despite receiving \n     antibiotics early in the disease. Of those individuals who \n     survive, an additional 10 percent have severe after-effects \n     of the disease, including mental retardation, hearing loss, \n     and loss of limbs.\n       (2) There is a vaccine that protects individuals against \n     some types of bacterium Neisseria meningitidis (also known as \n     meningococcus), an important cause of bacterial meningitis \n     and sepsis in children and young adults. A single dose of the \n     vaccine is recommended, and vaccination will decrease the \n     risk of the disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis.\n       (3) Currently, the only group of individuals that is \n     vaccinated against bacterial meningitis is the members of the \n     armed forces. The only other group of individuals that have \n     been encouraged to get the vaccine are those individuals \n     attending college.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROVISION OF INFORMATION.\n\n       (a) Development of Information.--The Secretary of Health \n     and Human Services, in consultation with the Director of the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, shall develop and \n     make available to entities described in subsection (b) \n     information concerning bacterial meningitis and the \n     availability and effectiveness of vaccinations for \n     individuals 2 years of age or older with respect to such \n     disease.\n       (b) Entities.--An entity is described in this subsection if \n     the entity--\n       (1) is--\n       (A) a child care center or provider that is licensed or \n     certified under an appropriate State law;\n       (B) an elementary or secondary school (as such terms are \n     defined in the Elementary and Secondary School Act of 1965 \n     (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.);\n       (C) a college or university;\n       (D) a boarding school or summer camp;\n       (E) a prison or other detention facility; or\n       (F) any other entity that provides for the housing of \n     individuals in a dorm-like setting; and\n       (2) any other entity determined appropriate by the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 584. A bill to direct the Consumer Product Safety Commission to \npromulgate a rule that requires manufacturers of certain consumer \nproducts to establish and maintain a system for providing notification \nof recalls of such products to consumers who first purchase such a \nproduct; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I am happy to join my colleagues \nin the House of Representatives, Congressman Moran and Congressman \nMcGovern, in re-introducing the Product Safety Notification and Recall \nEffectiveness Act. As my colleagues may recall, this legislation makes \nit easier for parents to learn when a product they bought may harm \ntheir children, so that they might take steps to return the item or \nhave it repaired.\n  On January 6 of this year, the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration released a study that contained a lot of good news for \nparents. In its study, NHTSA found that its child safety seat \nregistration program has been incredibly successful. NHTSA implemented \nthis program in March of 1993, and the information that is starting to \ncome in shows that nine times more child safety seats are now \nregistered than before the program was launched. In fact, in 1993 only \n3 percent of seats were registered; now 27 percent are. And this is \nsignificant, because this has directly led to more effective recalls of \ndefective child seats--the recall repair rate has increased by more \nthan half since 1993, from 13.8 percent to 21.5 percent.\n  The reason I mention this study to my colleagues is because NHTSA's \nprogram is very much like the one that this bill would establish. This \nlegislation would require the Consumer Product Safety Commission to \nissue a rule requiring manufacturers to establish and maintain a system \nfor notifying consumers of the recall of certain products that may \ncause harm to children. The database could be assembled through the use \nof shortened product registration cards, Internet registration, or \nother alternate means of encouraging consumers to provide vital contact \ninformation.\n  There is a very clear reason why such a database is necessary. As we \nall know, these products come with registration cards. The intent of \nthese cards should be that customers will fill them out and send them \nin, which gives the companies a way to contact purchasers. \nUnfortunately, many times consumers do not return these cards, and \nthere is a good reason behind this. These cards sometimes contain 40 to \n50, or even more, different questions or boxes to fill out. They ask \nabout marital status, salary information, and about what kind of \nproducts a person buys. Either a person does not wish to\n\n[[Page S3419]]\n\nreveal that much personal information, or they simply do not have time \nto fill out the card. In fact, the intent seems to be more to get \npersonal marketing information from consumers than anything else. That \nis why its such a good idea to shorten the card and just ask for the \nbasic information, like a customer's name, address, phone number, and \ne-mail address. Not only have studies done by companies like Mattel and \nBrandStamp shown that these methods increase the number of consumers \nwho respond, NHTSA--working on almost ten years of real data--has \nclearly proven a dramatic increase in registration and, as a result, in \nthe number of products successfully recalled.\n  But a card is not the only way to compile this information. For \ninstance, many companies are now using online registration, where \ncustomers can log on to their website and quickly enter the \ninformation. For Americans with Internet connections, this is often \nmuch less of a hassle than filling out a card, attaching a stamp, and \nmailing it in. It's quick and easy. And this legislation allows for the \nuse of alternate methods such as this in compiling this database.\n  I am sure that some of my colleagues might be concerned about the \ncost of setting up such a program. I say to my colleagues that I also \nhave no desire to pass along more costs to the companies that make \nthese products and, ultimately, to the consumer. However, let me again \npoint to the NHTSA study. The indirect cost of consumers for the car \nseat program is 43 cents per seat sold. Forty-three cents. I do not \nknow of a single parent who would not pay an extra forty-three cents to \nensure the safety of their child. But I would say to my colleagues, \ndon't take my word for it--ask the thousands of parents who have \nreturned recalled car seats since 1993. I'm sure they would tell you \nthat was the best 43 cents they had ever spent.\n  The need for this legislation is only highlighted by the CPSC's \nrefusal to consider such a rule last Friday, despite intense efforts by \nconsumer groups like the Consumer Federation of America and SAFE to \nhighlight the importance of this change to the way recalls work. I \nworld urge my colleagues to join me in sponsoring this important bill, \nand I hope that we can pass this legislation into law as soon as \npossible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 584\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Product Safety Notification \n     and Recall Effectiveness Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Consumer Product Safety Commission conducts \n     approximately 300 recalls of hazardous, dangerous, and \n     defective consumer products each year.\n       (2) In developing comprehensive corrective action plans \n     with recalling companies, the Consumer Product Safety \n     Commission staff greatly relies upon the media and retailers \n     to alert consumers to the dangers of unsafe consumer \n     products, because the manufacturers do not generally possess \n     contact information regarding the purchasing consumers. Based \n     upon information received from companies maintaining customer \n     registration lists, such contact information is known for \n     generally less than 7 percent of the total consumer products \n     produced and distributed.\n       (3) The Consumer Product Safety Commission staff has found \n     that most consumers do not return purchaser identification \n     cards because of requests for marketing and personal \n     information on the cards, and the likelihood of receiving \n     unsolicited marketing materials.\n       (4) The Consumer Product Safety Commission staff has \n     conducted research demonstrating that direct consumer contact \n     is one of the most effective ways of motivating consumer \n     response to a consumer product recall.\n       (5) Companies that maintain consumer product purchase data, \n     such as product registration cards, warranty cards, and \n     rebate cards, are able to effectively notify consumers of a \n     consumer product recall.\n       (6) The Consumer Product Safety Commission staff has found \n     that a consumer product safety owner card, without marketing \n     questions or requests for personal information, that \n     accompanied products such as small household appliances and \n     juvenile products would increase consumer participation and \n     information necessary for direct notification in consumer \n     product recalls.\n       (7) The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has, \n     since March 1993, required similar simplified, marketing-free \n     product registration cards on child safety seats used in \n     motor vehicles. The National Highway Traffic Safety \n     Administration has found this requirement has increased \n     recall compliance rates.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to reduce the \n     number of deaths and injuries from defective and hazardous \n     consumer products through improved recall effectiveness, by--\n       (1) requiring the Consumer Product Safety Commission to \n     promulgate a rule to require manufacturers of juvenile \n     products, small household appliances, and certain other \n     consumer products, to include a simplified product safety \n     owner card with those consumer products at the time of \n     original purchase by consumers, or develop effective \n     electronic registration of the first purchasers of such \n     products, to develop a customer database for the purpose of \n     notifying consumers about recalls of those products; and\n       (2) encouraging manufacturers, private labelers, retailers, \n     and others to use creativity and innovation to create and \n     maintain effective methods of notifying consumers in the \n     event of a consumer product recall.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Therefore, I encourage any Senators who wish to \noffer an amendment to the bill to work with the bill managers so they \ncan arrange time for amendment consideration.\n  At 11 a.m., the Senate will return to the Estrada nomination and \nbegin a critical debate on the judicial nominations process and the \nlong-term implications the current filibuster will hold for this body. \nMembers are encouraged to come to the Chamber and engage in this vital \ndiscussion.\n  Following the recess, the Senate will return to consideration of the \npartial-birth abortion bill. Additional amendments are expected, and \ntherefore Members should anticipate votes during tomorrow's session.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/10/senate-section/article/S3420-7", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
