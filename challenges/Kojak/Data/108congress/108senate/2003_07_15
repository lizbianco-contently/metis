Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \nextraordinary individual, a woman of great vision and passion who has \ndedicated her life to helping people in their time of need. Her name is \nLuceille Fleming, and she just retired this past Friday, ending her \nover 14-year tenure as the first and only Director of the Ohio \nDepartment of Alcohol and Drug Addiction Services.\n  Luceille Fleming is an extremely intelligent, wonderfully caring \nwoman who has given so much to the State of Ohio. To say that she will \nbe missed is an understatement, because Luceille Fleming built this \nOhio agency from the ground up and turned it into a nationally-\nrecognized statewide drug and alcohol treatment network. Simply put, \nLuceille Fleming has spent the last 14 years saving lives. She led the \neffort to create a system that has helped countless Ohioans to help \nthemselves, to reclaim their lives from all-consuming addictions.\n  While I have come to the Senate Floor today to speak about Director \nFleming's contributions to my home State of Ohio, she actually came to \nOhio from Pennsylvania. After graduating from Chatham College in \nPittsburgh, Director Fleming began her career as a communications \nspecialist for a CBS affiliate in Harrisburg, PA. She\n\n[[Page S9358]]\n\nthen went on to found and run her own company called Dunhill of \nHarrisburg. In these positions, she cultivated her skills as a great \nleader and a great motivator.\n  In 1977, she became the executive director of the Alcoholism and \nAddiction Association of Pennsylvania. In this position, she \nestablished the first successful statewide collaboration in \nPennsylvania between alcoholism treatment efforts and drug abuse \ntreatment efforts. She brought the treatment groups together with the \nrecognition that both alcoholism and drug abuse are addictions. Today, \nthat connection between alcoholism and drug addiction seem so logical. \nIt has become an accepted notion. But it was Luceille who was at the \nforefront of bringing these two groups together.\n  From there, Luceille was appointed deputy secretary of Health for \nDrug and Alcohol Programs in Pennsylvania. She supervised the policy \nand implementation of the State's drug and alcohol treatment effort. \nThis experience at the State government level gave Luceille insights \ninto how an effective statewide alcohol and drug addiction services \nagency should be run.\n  Fortunately, Luceille was willing to bring these insights to our \nState of Ohio. In 1989, Luceille was hired after an exhaustive search \nto develop a cabinet-level agency to manage a statewide substance-abuse \ntreatment network. She was hired by then-Governor Dick Celeste. Prior \nto her arrival, Ohio had two different agencies overseeing drug and \nalcohol treatment programs. A panel recommended combining the two \nagencies. Luceille was tasked with the creation of that single agency. \nIt was a huge job but one for which she was more than qualified. While \nshe excelled in her previous positions, as director of the Ohio \nDepartment of Alcohol and Drug Addiction Services, Luceille truly \nthrived. Under Director Fleming's leadership, the agency developed \ninnovative programs, reaching out to many different communities. \nDirector Fleming fostered programs for juveniles and children, \nincluding youth mentoring, Head Start, and underage drinking \nprevention. She also established and supervised programs that served \nwomen recovering from substance abuse, helping them to reunite with \ntheir children. What could be more important than that?\n\n  During her 14-year tenure under three Ohio Governors, including the \ncurrent occupant of the chair, one of Director Fleming's top priorities \nwas the expansion of the drug courts program which helped reduce \nrecidivism, encouraging the proper treatment of offenders with \nsubstance abuse programs. When Director Fleming started, there was only \none drug court in the State of Ohio. Today, there are 55. That is \nthanks, certainly, to the current occupant of the chair, and it is also \nthanks to Director Luceille Fleming.\n  I have had the pleasure of working with Luceille directly, both when \nI was serving as lieutenant governor and now as Senator. Her \nexperience, her judgment have proven invaluable to me. I have sought \nher advice many times, both as lieutenant governor and now for the last \n9 years as Senator. I can tell Members of the Senate, many days I have \npicked up the phone and called Luceille to get her advice on a bill or \nprogram. She has always been very candid, very open, very helpful, and \nhad very good insight.\n  I am grateful for her advice and her expertise as we collaborated on \nthe safe and drug-free schools bill and other bills. Luceille's \ninsights and contributions added tremendously to that law and helped \nmake it a truly effective piece of legislation.\n  After Luceille's retirement was announced, I read several news \nstories about her career and her contributions to the State of Ohio. \nWhile reading, I was struck in particular by one quote from Paul \nColeman, president of Maryhaven, a substance abuse treatment center in \nOhio. He said Director Fleming has ``a passion that burns to help \npeople.'' Paul Coleman's statement says it all. If I had to come up \nwith one statement that sums up Luceille Fleming, it would be she truly \nhas a passion that burns to help people and she has channeled this \npassion into a life of service and dedication to others.\n  Luceille Fleming retired last week at the age of 79--yes, 79--to take \na breather and enjoy some time off. Those who know Luceille know she \nprobably won't take a lot of time off and she will plunge back into \nsomething. She has been working at the Department of Alcohol and Drug \nAddiction Services since she was 65 years old. Most people at that \npoint in their life would have decided to take it easy, kick back, and \nmaybe relax. But not Luceille. She instead decided to take a position \nin government to build a State agency from the ground up. Her energy \nand her drive are truly remarkable.\n  I conclude my remarks with a quote from Luceille herself. Upon taking \nher position with the agency, somebody asked at her first press \nconference about her age. To this question she simply said: ``Well, you \nknow, I think the hair thins, the hips thicken, but the mind \nsharpens.''\n  I cannot speak to the first two parts of that statement, but I can \ntell you for certain that the last part is true in regard to Luceille. \nLuceille is sharp, she is bright, she is focused--more today than ever. \nShe has helped so many people during her career, and the people of Ohio \nand the Nation are, indeed, grateful.\n  Luceille, you will be missed at the agency. You will be missed in the \nState of Ohio. We are grateful for what you have done.\n\n  The Presiding Officer and I had the opportunity to work with \nLuceille. It was my job as lieutenant governor to work with the current \noccupant of the chair, my colleague from the State of Ohio, in the drug \naddiction area, substance abuse area, when I was lieutenant governor \nand the current occupant of the chair was Governor. Dick Celeste, \nformer Governor, picked Luceille to head up this new agency, to create \nthis new agency. She had run it for a number of years and built it up. \nThen-Governor-elect Voinovich had taken over, and it was our job to \ndecide whether Luceille was going to continue in that position. We \nlooked all over the State of Ohio and across the country to determine \nwho should occupy that position. After a long search, we decided--then-\nGovernor-elect Voinovich decided that Luceille Fleming, the person who \nwas in that position, was the best person to continue.\n  We were not disappointed. We had the opportunity to work with \nLuceille, to sit in Cabinet meetings with her. I had the chance to work \nwith her many times on a detailed basis to talk about substance abuse \nproblems, alcohol and addiction problems, wrestled with these problems, \nproblems in the prisons, problems in our communities. She is just an \namazing person, someone who truly understands the gravity of the \nproblem, how it infests our communities, the damage it does to our \nyoung people. She was always optimistic, always believed we could do \nmore, always said: Mike, if we could just move in this direction, if we \ncould just move forward a little bit more, we could save some lives. We \ncould turn some young people's lives around. We can make a difference. \nLet's try this. Let's try that. We can do better. To see someone now 79 \nwho still has that optimism, who still has that belief--we can do \nbetter, we can do more--is a wonderful thing to see.\n  I salute Luceille Fleming for her 14 years of service to the State of \nOhio, for her optimism, for her vision.\n  Luceille, thank you for the work you have done. Those in Ohio who \nhave worked with you are truly grateful for your service to the people \nof the State. We appreciate it very much. You are a true visionary. You \nare a dear person, someone who has contributed a great deal to our \nState and to the people we always serve.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/15/senate-section/article/S9358-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9358-S9360]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BUILDUP TO WAR ON IRAQ\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last week, CIA Director George Tenet \naccepted responsibility for having gone along with the African uranium \nstatement in the President's State of the Union address. His \nacknowledgment that it should not\n\n[[Page S9359]]\n\nhave been included in the address and his acceptance of responsibility \nwas appropriate. But his explanation of the CIA's acquiescence in \nallowing the use of a clearly misleading statement raises more \nquestions than it answers, and statements by other administration \nofficials, particularly National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, \ncompound the problem.\n  Even more troubling, however, is the fact that the uranium statement \nappears to be but one of a number of several questionable statements \nand exaggerations by the intelligence community and administration \nofficials that were issued in the buildup to the war. The importance of \nobjective and credible intelligence cannot be overstated. It is \ntherefore essential that we have a thorough, open and bipartisan \ninquiry into the objectivity, credibility and use of U.S. intelligence \nbefore the Iraq war.\n  First, relative to the uranium issue:\n\n       The President in his State of the Union Message said that \n     the British Government had learned that Iraq recently sought \n     to purchase significant quantities of uranium from Africa. \n     The sole purpose of that statement was to make the American \n     people believe that the American Government believed the \n     statement to be true and that it was strong evidence of \n     Iraq's attempt to obtain nuclear weapons. But the truth was \n     that, at the very time the words were spoken, our Government \n     did not believe it was true. Condoleezza Rice's effort to \n     justify the statement on the grounds that it was \n     ``technically accurate'' doesn't address the heart of the \n     matter, which is that the statement was calculated to create \n     a false impression. It is simply wrong to make a statement \n     whose purpose is to make people believe something when you do \n     not believe it yourself.\n\n  It is all well and good that the CIA has acknowledged its role in \ncaving in to pressure from the National Security Council to concur in \nsomething which it did not believe. But Director Tenet's acknowledgment \nraises further questions of who was pushing the false impression at the \nNational Security Council. The NSC should not misuse intelligence that \nway.\n  The President's statement that Iraq was attempting to acquire African \nuranium was not a ``mistake.'' It was not inadvertent. It was not a \nslip. It was negotiated between the CIA and the NSC. It was calculated, \nand it was misleading. And what compounds its misleading nature is that \nthe CIA not only ``differed with the British dossier on the reliability \nof the uranium reporting,'' to use Director Tenet's words, but the CIA \nhad also ``expressed [its] reservations'' to the British in September \n2002, nearly 5 months before the State of the Union Address. \nFurthermore, the CIA pressed the White House to remove a similar \nreference from the President's speech on October 7, 2002, and the White \nHouse did so--nearly 4 months before the State of the Union Address.\n  The uranium issue is not just about sixteen words. It is about the \nconscious decisions that were made, apparently by the NSC and concurred \nin by the CIA, to create a false impression. And it is not an isolated \nexample. There is troubling evidence of other dubious statements and \nexaggerations by the intelligence community and administration \nofficials.\n  Relative to aluminum tubes, in a speech before the U.N. General \nAssembly on September 12, 2002, President Bush said, ``Iraq has made \nseveral attempts to buy high-strength aluminum tubes used to enrich \nuranium for a nuclear weapon.'' In fact, an unclassified intelligence \nassessment in October acknowledged that some intelligence specialists \n``believe that these tubes are probably intended for conventional \nweapons programs,'' and on February 5, 2003, Secretary of State Colin \nPowell told the U.N. Security Council that ``we all know there are \ndifferences of opinion,'' and that ``there is controversy about what \nthese tubes are for.'' The International Atomic Energy Agency, after \nconducting an inquiry into the aluminum tubes issue, concluded they \nwere not for uranium enrichment.\n  On the Iraq-al-Qaida connection: On September 27 of last year, \nSecretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld described the administration's \nsearch for hard evidence for a connection between Iraq and al-Qaida. He \nsaid, ``We ended up with five or six sentences that were bullet-proof. \nWe could say them, they are factual, they are exactly accurate. They \ndemonstrate that there are in fact al-Qaida in Iraq.'' While Secretary \nRumsfeld later went on to say, ``They are not beyond a reasonable \ndoubt,'' he did not say there was considerable uncertainty in the \nintelligence community about the nature and extent of ties between Iraq \nand al-Qaida. It was certainly never a ``bullet- proof'' case.\n  On nuclear reconstitution, last Sunday, Ms. Rice said, ``We have \nnever said that we thought he [Saddam] had nuclear weapons.'' But Vice \nPresident Cheney said on March 16, ``We believe he [Saddam] has, in \nfact, reconstituted nuclear weapons.''\n  On the question of certainty that Iraq possesses chemical and \nbiological weapons, on August 26, 2002, Vice President Cheney said: \n``Simply stated, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons \nof mass destruction. There is no doubt he is amassing them to use \nagainst our friends, against our allies, and against us.'' On September \n26, 2002, President Bush said, ``The Iraqi regime possesses biological \nand chemical weapons.'' On March 17, 2003, President Bush told the \nNation that ``intelligence gathered by this and other governments \nleaves no doubt that the Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal \nsome of the most lethal weapons ever devised.'' And on March 30, 2003, \nSecretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said, ``We know where they \n[weapons of mass destruction] are. They're in the area around Tikrit \nand Baghdad and east, west, south and north somewhat.'' The fruitless \nsearch to date for Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction during \nand after our entry into Iraq suggests that our intelligence was either \nway off the mark or seriously stretched.\n\n  As to mobile biological warfare labs, on May 28, 2003, the CIA posted \non its Web site a document it prepared with the Defense Intelligence \nAgency entitled, ``Iraqi Mobile Biological Warfare Agent Production \nPlants.'' This report, which is still on the CIA Web site, concluded \nthat the two trailers found in Iraq were for biological warfare agent \nproduction, even though other experts and intelligence community \nmembers do not agree with that conclusion, or believe there is not \nenough evidence to reach such a conclusion. None of these alternative \nviews have been posted on the CIA's Web page.\n  On White House Web site photos, on October 8, 2002, the White House \nplaced three sets of satellite photos on its Web site, with the \nheadline, ``Construction at three Iraqi nuclear weapons-related \nfacilities.'' Although one of the facilities was not nuclear-related, \nthe captions of the photos gave the impression that Iraq was proceeding \nwith work on weapons of mass destruction at these facilities, although \nUNMOVIC and IAEA inspections at these facilities found no prohibited \nactivities or weapons. For instances, related to the Al Furat \nmanufacturing facility, the caption notes that ``the building was \noriginally intended to house a centrifuge enrichment cascade operation \nsupporting Iraq's uranium enrichment efforts'' and that after \nconstruction resumed in 2001, ``the building appears operational.''\n  So the misleading statement about African uranium is not an isolated \nissue. There is a significant amount of troubling evidence that it was \npart of a pattern of exaggeration and misleading statements. That is \nwhat a thorough, open and bipartisan investigation should examine.\n  Finally, again relative to the uranium statement, I am deeply \ntroubled by Ms. Rice's continuing justification of the use of the \nstatement in the President's State of the Union Address. She repeatedly \nsays it was ``accurate,'' despite the fact that its clear aim was to \ncreate a false impression. Her statement and Director Tenet's statement \nraise more questions than they answer. Here are some of those \nquestions:\n  One, who in the administration was pressing the CIA to concur in a \nstatement that the CIA did not believe was true, and why did they do so \neven after the CIA objected to the text?\n  Two, who at the CIA was involved in pressing the White House to \nremove the similar reference from the October 7 speech, and what \nreasons did they give for removing it?\n  Three, who in the White House was involved in removing a similar \nreference from the President's speech on October 7, nearly 4 months \nbefore the State of the Union speech?\n  Four, who at the CIA knew about the decision to tell the British \nintelligence\n\n[[Page S9360]]\n\nservice in September, 2002 of CIA's ``reservations'' about the \ninclusion of references to Iraqi efforts to obtain uranium from Africa \nin the British intelligence service's September 24 dossier?\n  Five, given the doubts of the U.S. Intelligence Community, why didn't \nthe President say in his State of the Union speech not only that ``The \nBritish Government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought \nsignificant quantities of uranium from Africa'' but that ``our U.S. \nintelligence community has serious doubts about such reporting''?\n  Six, how and when did the U.S. Government receive the forged \ndocuments on Niger, and when did it become aware that they might be \nbogus?\n  And, seven, what role did the Office of the Vice President have in \nbringing about an inquiry into Iraq's purported efforts to obtain \nuranium from Niger? Was the Vice President's staff briefed on the \nresults of Ambassador Wilson's trip to Niger?\n  These and many other questions underscore the critical importance of \na bipartisan, open, and thorough inquiry into the objectivity and \ncredibility of intelligence concerning the presence of weapons of mass \ndestruction in Iraq immediately before the war and the alleged Iraq al-\nQaida connection, and the use of such intelligence by the Department of \nDefense in policy decisions, military planning and the conduct of \noperations in Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the hour of 10:30 \nhaving arrived, the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 2658, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2658) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2004, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Senator \nfrom Michigan for his thorough and thoughtful statement involving many \nof the questions that need to be asked and need to be answered. His \nrecommendation to the Senate and to our country that there be a \nthorough investigation, a bipartisan investigation, where these \nquestions can be answered and the information provided, in my view, is \nessential.\n  We have become more and more confused over the course of the last \nseveral days with regard to the conflicting information provided by the \nadministration on these and other key questions. We must find a way \nwith which each of these questions can be clarified and for the \nadministration to come forth with a clear acknowledgement of the need \nfor this clarification is essential.\n  The American people deserve a thorough, complete, open review of each \nand every one of these questions. The Intelligence Committee has begun \nits work, and I commend the distinguished ranking member for his \nefforts and his persistence in bringing it to this point. I think this \nhas now gone beyond the matter of just intelligence, as the Senator \nfrom Michigan has pointed out with questions and the concerns he raised \nin his speech this morning.\n  We will address these questions both legislatively and rhetorically \nover the course of the next several days. But I have very fundamental \nquestions with regard to the bill itself. Others have raised them.\n  Why is it that there is not one dime requested for the Iraqi \noperation in the Defense appropriations bill? Why is it that there is \nnot one dime requested for the Defense Department's efforts in the war \non terror? Not one dime. I am just baffled. It is sort of legislative \nnever-never land for us to be involved in a war that we are already \ntold by the Secretary of Defense--at least with regard to Iraq and \nAfghanistan--is costing this country $5 billion a month, and there is \nnot $1 requested in this bill for that operation.\n  How in the world can we be on the Senate floor talking about \nsomething as consequential as this--not only to us but to the world--\nand not have a better appreciation of what the costs and implications \nand fiscal consequences are? So that, too, will be a matter that I hope \nwill be the subject of great debate in the Senate Chamber.\n  We admire the work done by our military. We are grateful for the \nextraordinary effort and sacrifice made by the Armed Forces. Many of \nour National Guard and Reserve personnel have been in that country now \nfor over 6 months. The sacrifice and the extraordinary effort they have \nmade on behalf of their country ought to be commended. But another \nquestion comes to mind as we consider that sacrifice: Why are we doing \nit alone? And why is it the administration continues to refuse to \nrequest additional resources, officially, from NATO? Why is it they are \nunwilling to ask the United Nations to urge its members to provide \nmilitary force and civilian police? Why is that not a part of the \nadministration position?\n  We find ourselves in a very unusual set of circumstances. We are \ndebating the single largest Defense appropriations bill in history but \na bill that does not in any way reflect the cost of our presence and \nthe effort being made at this very moment in Iraq or in Afghanistan or \nthe war on terror.\n  We know it is going to continue to cost this country billions of \ndollars each and every month, but we do not know why the administration \nrefuses to ask others officially for help, especially NATO, and we \ncertainly do not know the answers to the questions raised by the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan just moments ago.\n  We must have those answers, and I hope during the course of this \ndebate we can find mechanisms and subscribe to procedures that will \nensure that the American people have all the facts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I do not mean to be disrespectful and \ninterrupt the distinguished leader, but I wonder if the Democratic \nleader knows that I am responsible for not having more money for Iraq \nin this bill. We met with the President and the Secretary of Defense \nand pointed out the enormous amount of money we had provided in the \nsupplemental passed earlier this year for that action in Iraq. We had \nto have money to meet some of the problems caused by my interpretation \nof the budget resolution in not having enough money for some of the \nother subcommittees.\n  We worked out the arrangement whereby we took $3.1 billion out of \nthis bill and allocated it to other subcommittees with the \nunderstanding that if additional moneys are needed in Iraq because of \nour actions there, beyond what we have already provided, that we will \nhave a supplemental in the spring.\n  We anticipate the moneys we provided in the massive supplemental, \n$62.6 billion, is sufficient to carry them forward. As a matter of \nfact, there are not only sufficient funds, but in this bill we actually \nrescinded about $3 billion of the supplemental to make it available to \nother areas of defense, not having it totally earmarked to Iraq.\n  We are trying to manage this money. The distinguished Democratic \nleader is exactly right. The costs are running somewhere around $4 \nbillion to $5 billion a month. We expect that to start tapering down as \nthis involvement in Iraq continues. It is certainly not the same as \nwhen we were building up forces and transmitting personnel and material \nto Iraq. We have tried to manage this situation and keep a firm hand on \nthe expenditures in Iraq. In doing so, we made more money available to \nother subcommittees because they have problems related to homeland \nsecurity and other matters.\n\n  While I am honest in the fact that I do not think we have enough \nmoney yet for some of those subcommittees, I do think we have more \nmoney available for nondefense matters, for homeland security matters, \nthan we would have had had we continued with the approach that was in \nthe budget to start.\n\n[[Page S9361]]\n\n  I congratulate the Democratic leader for stating frankly his feelings \nabout the overall involvement in terms of our being in Iraq almost \nalone. We do have support from other nations, but we do not have the \ninvolvement of other troops to the extent I, too, would like to see \ntake place. I hope that will occur. But I hope the leader will \nunderstand, one of the reasons the money is not there now, in terms of \nasking for more money for Iraq, is that I pleaded with the President \nand the Secretary to give us a little running room on those other bills \nand to realize that we thought there was adequate money to carry us \nthrough this calendar year--that means at least the first quarter of \nthis next fiscal year--for the involvement in Iraq.\n  It is my hope that by the time we get to January and February, we \nwill find the amount of money we are spending in Iraq is much less than \nit is right now, and that we can, in fact, shift gears a little bit as \nfar as that involvement.\n  Iraqis should have, I am told, somewhere around $7 billion of income \nfrom oil by the end of this year. If that cashflow starts going into \ntheir economy and into their own local security rather than into the \nmilitary budgets, as it was in the past, I think we will achieve the \nconstraints we need in terms of the expenditures of Federal U.S. \ndollars in Iraq. I hope the Senator understands that point.\n  I just happened to be here at the time the Senator made his \nstatement. I do, as a matter of fact, take pride in the fact the \nPresident and his people did listen to us. Chairman Young and I \nexplained the problems of this budget resolution and its impact on the \nother subcommittees which, as the Democratic leader knows, the budget \nresolution was less than the President had requested in this year's \nappropriations process.\n  I hope we will await the developments in Iraq and we can all see \nwhether the administration will ask for more money in 2004, starting \nsome time after the first of next year, if that is necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if I may respond, as the Senator from \nAlaska knows, I am a big admirer of the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. There are no two \nmore able Members of this Senate than the Senator from Alaska and the \nSenator from Hawaii, his ranking member.\n  I appreciate, first, the chairman's explanation, and I also \nappreciate the fact that he could foresee the budgetary and \nappropriations problems that could have been generated as a result of \nthe allocation made initially by the administration. We are able to \naddress some of the other concerns in other subcommittees on \nappropriations in part because he saw the problems arise and took \naction to avoid them.\n  I guess I go back to a fundamental question of management, not by him \nbut of the administration, a fundamental question about what it is they \nanticipate will be the costs involving fighting the war in Iraq--not \nfor this year but for the next fiscal year that this particular \nappropriations bill addresses.\n  It will take $60 billion to address those concerns in the next fiscal \nyear. We appropriated in the supplemental $68 billion in this fiscal \nyear. Obviously, that will take us into the first part of the next \nfiscal year. The question from us to the administration ought to be: \nWhy have you not made a specific proposal with regard to the commitment \nthat will be required in Iraq for the next fiscal year? If it is $60 \nbillion, request it. If it is $60 billion, defend it. If it is $60 \nbillion, give us some appreciation of how it will be spent and why we \nare the only ones spending it. Why is it that other countries are not \nmore engaged? Why have you not asked? Those are the questions that any \nappropriations bill ought to address.\n  I supported the supplemental and most likely, whenever another one is \nrequested, if it comes, I will support it. But it is not good fiscal \nmanagement to take these matters piecemeal, to expect through a \nsupplemental process--which, I might add, is not offset, which simply \nadds to the deficit. We now see a deficit of some $450 billion. If we \ntake Social Security out, it is $600 billion, and we are still not at \nthe end of this fiscal year.\n  We have serious management and budget considerations that have to be \ntaken into account but are only exacerbated by these supplemental \nbudgets that are offered, considered, and voted upon throughout the \nyear.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1232\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I will make a statement while I am trying \nto locate the amendment I am going to offer. The 2004 budget request \nincluded no funding for the establishment of additional weapons of mass \ndestruction civil support teams. There are currently 32 teams that are \ncertified and operational. The plan is to field a total of 55 teams to \nensure there is at least 1 team established in each State and \nterritory.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee included additional manpower and \nfunding to establish 12 additional teams in fiscal year 2004. We \nincluded additional National Guard manpower for these teams, but we did \nnot provide operation and maintenance or procurement funding.\n  I will send an amendment to the desk and ask that we consider it. \nThis amendment conforms our bill to that of the Senate-passed national \ndefense authorization bill regarding what we call CSTSs of the funds \nprovided to the Department of Defense. This amendment would earmark \n$39.3 million in operation and maintenance funds, $25.9 million in \nprocurement, and $1 million in research and development funds. I \npresent the amendment as one that is offset and merely allocates funds \nto these teams as required by the Senate-passed authorization bill. I \nbelieve it has the support of my colleague Senator Inouye.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for himself and Mr. \n     Warner, proposes an amendment numbered 1232.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To provide funds for 12 additional Weapons of Mass \n                    Destruction Civil Support Teams)\n\n       On page 120, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8124. Amounts appropriated by this Act may be used for \n     the establishment and support of 12 additional Weapons of \n     Mass Destruction Civil Support Teams, as follows:\n       (1) Of the amount appropriated by title II under the \n     heading ``Operation and Maintenance, Army'', up to \n     $23,300,000.\n       (2) Of the amount appropriated by title II under the \n     heading ``Operation and Maintenance, Army National Guard'', \n     up to $16,000,000.\n       (3) Of the amount appropriated by title III under the \n     heading ``Other Procurement, Army'', up to $25,900,000.\n       (4) Of the amount appropriated by title IV under the \n     heading ``Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, \n     Defense-Wide'', up to $1,000,000.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for the immediate consideration and adoption of \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1232) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and to lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the Senator wish some time?\n  I say to the Chair, in about 20 minutes we will have a package of \namendments we have cleared and we are prepared to offer under unanimous \nconsent.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we have a period for routine morning \nbusiness until the hour of 11:15 with Senators being permitted to speak \ntherein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have Senators who want to speak on the \nbill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am misinformed. I withdraw that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n[[Page S9362]]\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee for his forbearance. I thank my colleague, \nSenator Reid, for making this arrangement for me to speak out today on \nthe 2004 Defense appropriations bill as a member of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee.\n  As I begin my remarks today, I am cognizant that a funeral service is \nabout to begin in Minnesota. It is the funeral of the first Minnesota \nsoldier to die in Iraq this year, PFC Edward J. Herrgott of Shakopee, \nMN. Private Herrgott was only 20 years old. He said he joined the Army \nso he could earn some money to go to school and become a police \nofficer. He was patrolling in front of the Baghdad Museum on September \n3 when a sniper's bullet ended his life.\n  Private Herrgott is an American hero. He stood guard in 115-degree \nheat, in the most dangerous city in the world, because his commanding \nofficer assigned him that duty. He went to Iraq because his Commander \nin Chief, the President of the United States, assigned him that duty.\n  It took extraordinary courage and patriotism for him to perform that \nduty, to stand guard in that sweltering heat in the midst of that ever-\npresent danger. Private Herrgott lost his life performing his duty. He \nlost his life 63 days after his Commander in Chief declared that major \nhostilities were over in Iraq. They did not end on May 1 for Private \nHerrgott, nor for the 77 other American soldiers who have died in Iraq \nsince then, nor for the hundreds more who have been wounded, nor for \nthe 145,000 other American soldiers who still risk their lives in Iraq \nevery day and every night and wonder when will they come home.\n  Congress also bears responsibility for sending Private Herrgott and \nthose 145,000 other brave men and women to Iraq. Last October, Congress \nvoted to give their constitutional responsibility to declare war over \nto President Bush. Congress gave the President what he wanted, what he \ninsisted then he must have, a blank check, a blank check signed in \nadvance, authorizing the President to use whatever means necessary, \nincluding the use of force in Iraq, whenever, and with whomever, for \nhowever long, at whatever cost, until the President decides to end that \nwar. Congress gave the President all of that authority and all of that \nresponsibility. I did not vote for it, but a majority did, and now we \nmust pay for that war.\n  Last week in the Senate Armed Services Committee, we were told by the \nSecretary of Defense that the war in Iraq is costing $3.9 billion per \nmonth and that the continuing military operations in Afghanistan are \ncosting $900 million per month. That is a combined $4.8 billion a \nmonth, totaling $57.6 billion over 12 months. That is $57.6 billion \nwhich I thought was going to be in this 2004 Defense Appropriations \nbill, and the distinguished chairman of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, who has been engaged in these matters for far more years \nthan I have been around, has clarified the circumstances why that money \nis not in there now.\n  But I point out that the estimate of over $1 billion a week is \nprobably way too low. According to this week's Newsweek magazine:\n\n       That billion a week is just the beginning. It doesn't \n     include the cost of running Iraq's government and rebuilding \n     it, which could be an additional billion a month--according \n     to pre-war United Nations estimates.\n\n  Nor does it include presumably, as this article details, the $1.2 \nbillion which Ambassador Bremer's budget says must be spent up front in \ncapital improvements if Iraq's oil production is to get under way \nagain. Nor does it include the $680 million given to the Bechtel \nCorporation for infrastructure improvements; nor, I suspect, the $3 \nbillion to $5 billion that it is estimated is necessary to make \nemergency repairs to Iraq's electrical power system.\n  So why is it that we cannot get from the administration a clear, \ndirect, and reliable accounting about the cost of this war? I am \nguessing it has something to do with today's report that the Federal \nbudget for fiscal year 2003 is expected to run a $450 billion deficit, \nand the next year's deficit may be as high as $500 billion, without \neven including all of the costs of the war efforts.\n  Those are staggering deficits. This year's deficit will be over 50 \npercent greater than the largest annual deficit in U.S. history, and it \nresults from the most colossal financial mismanagement that has ever \nbeen witnessed in this country's history, the worst ever.\n  Just 2 years and 2 months ago, President Bush submitted his \nadministration's first budget for fiscal year 2002 and the years \nbeyond. It was a proud document dated April 9, 2001. The President \nstated:\n\n       This budget offers a new vision of governing for our \n     Nation.\n\n  His budget projected a $5.6 trillion surplus for the 10 fiscal years \nfrom 2002 through 2011. It promised to save the entire Social Security \nsurplus of $2.6 trillion; to spend every penny, it said, of Medicare \ntax and premium collections on Medicare; to achieve historic levels of \ndebt reduction, $2 trillion over 10 years; to provide $1.6 trillion in \ntax relief; and set aside a $1.4 trillion reserve for additional needs, \ndebt service, and contingencies.\n  As we all know, there have been big contingencies since then, but not \nenough to justify the total destruction of all of those promises, not \nenough to warrant the abandonment of a fiscally responsible Federal \nbudget, which was bequeathed to this administration by the \nadministration which preceded it.\n  For fiscal year 2003, the fiscal year we are in presently, just 2 \nyears and 2 months ago President Bush predicted a $262 billion surplus \nin the combined Federal budget for that year. The on-budget operating \nfund surplus was expected to be $49 billion; the off-budget Social \nSecurity surplus, $193 billion.\n  The Social Security surplus now is expected to be slightly less than \nwas predicted then, but still $160 billion. But combined, the Federal \nbudget deficit of $450 billion means the operating fund, the main \noperating account of the Federal Government, this year will run a \ndeficit of over $600 billion. A $49 billion surplus was expected 2 \nyears and 2 months ago and a $610 billion deficit is expected today.\n  The non-Social Security revenue for this year, in personal and \ncorporate income taxes, capital gains tax, estate tax, and the excise \ntax was projected to exceed expenditures in fiscal year 2002, as they \ndid in the year 2000 under President Bill Clinton--for the first time \nin 40 years. But now in actuality, those progressive taxes, which have \nconstituted almost the entire tax base of the operating accounts of the \nFederal Government for all these years, those revenues generated will \nonly amount to two-thirds of expenditures. The two tax bills of 2001 \nand 2003 have decimated the progressive tax base of the Federal \nGovernment. And 2004 is expected to be no better. If anything, it is \nprojected to get even worse. The change from expectations to now the \nprojection of a $500 billion deficit means a change of over $750 \nbillion in projections.\n  Saving the Social Security surplus--that is gone. Every year--this \nyear, next year, every year in the foreseeable future--it is going to \nbe wiped out to nothing.\n  Reducing the national debt by $2 trillion? That is gone. In fact, \naccording to the President's own Office of Management and Budget, if we \nadopt his budgets as he has proposed them, we will increase the \nnational debt by $2 trillion over the next 10 years.\n  Setting up a reserve fund? Forget that, too.\n  Lowering the growth in discretionary spending to 4 percent a year? \nNot yet. The President's request for the last 3 years has increased \nthat by 9 percent, 10 percent, and 11 percent, and that does not \ninclude these so-called supplemental appropriations, which is maybe one \nof the reasons that is the preferred approach--come back in, in the \nmiddle of the year, and ask for the increased money everybody knows is \ngoing to be needed to fund the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  It is very frustrating, I find, to not be able to get clear, reliable \nfacts from this administration. They act as though this is their \ngovernment, that we in Congress do not even exist, or that we are an \nunnecessary and unwanted intrusion into their affairs. So much for a \nnew vision of government. So much for a new tone of bipartisanship. It \nhas become worse, not better. Instead of facing up to these realities, \nthe administration is trying to hide them.\n\n[[Page S9363]]\n\n  When I returned from Minnesota last night, I was given a book, by a \ncolleague, Senator Bennett of Utah: ``Reagan, Man Of Principle,'' by \nJohn Harmer, a former State senator in California. I just glanced \nthrough the beginning pages of it.\n  I was struck by this anecdote from the senator. He had been involved \nas the majority leader there, trying to work out the redistricting bill \nfor 1971. California was going to set the lines for the legislative \ndistricts for the State for the next 10 years. They finally, after all \nthis thrashing back and forth and cutting deals and making \narrangements, got agreement. Governor Reagan--President-to-be--vetoed \nthat bill.\n  So in frustration, the State senator came to President Reagan. He \nsaid, reading now directly:\n\n       ``What exactly do you want?'' I asked, in total \n     frustration.\n       His response was so purely honorable that I dared not \n     repeat it to my senatorial colleagues, knowing that they \n     would hoot me out of the room. Yet, though I did not fully \n     appreciate it at the time, the response was just one of many \n     examples of Reagan's strength as a political leader. Reagan, \n     like Thomas Jefferson, had a fundamental faith in the \n     American people and their ability to make the right decisions \n     if only they had all the facts. Not just the Republicans \n     among the people, but of all the people, once they had all of \n     the facts. . . .\n\n  I am skipping ahead here, but Governor Reagan said to State Senator \nHarmer:\n\n       ``I am really disappointed . . . that individual \n     Republicans are so willing to sell out the best interests of \n     the people in order to save themselves. That is not what I \n     regard as worthy of my signature.''\n       ``John,'' he said, ``I'm as dedicated to the Republican \n     cause as you are. Our party's core philosophy represents the \n     best assurance for the continued freedom and prosperity of \n     the nation. But I am not the governor of just the \n     Republicans. There are millions of people out there who, \n     whether they voted for me or not, expect me to represent them \n     with good judgement and integrity. The issue is not one of \n     protecting what you call the Republican base. The issue is to \n     do that which is right in principle.''\n\n  That could apply to the Democratic majorities in other States. There \nis no monopoly, I have learned here, in truth or wisdom or virtue. But \nthat principle, ``to do what is right,'' and that principle, ``to \npresent all the facts forthrightly to the American people,'' are \nprinciples that are certainly needed even more in Washington today, and \nthat stands in marked contrast to what we experience in Washington \ntoday.\n  We are not being trusted with the facts: Not about the budget, not \nabout the timetables for troop deployments and bringing the troops back \nhome, and not about the circumstances that led up to this war in Iraq. \nWe have a right to those facts here in the Congress. More important, \nthe American people have a right to those facts. We have a right to \nknow how much this war is costing and how we are going to pay for it. \nWe have a right to know how long our troops are going to be over there \nin Iraq. We have a right to know how we got into that war in Iraq and \nhow what we were told over the last months squares with the truth as it \nwas known at the time.\n  What were the facts that led President Bush to say before the Nation, \nin a televised speech last October 7, that Saddam Hussein could have a \nnuclear weapon in less than a year when we now know there was no such \nprogram in evidence there? Or that Iraq is exploring using unmanned \naerial vehicles for missions, targeting the United States, when in fact \nit was known back then and certainly is known today that those \nmissiles, which were not even used against our invading forces, thank \nGod, had a range of only a few hundred miles and were no threat to the \nUnited States?\n  What facts led Vice President Cheney to say last August 26 that there \nis no doubt Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction, there \nis no doubt that he is amassing them to use against our friends, our \nallies, and against us? What caused National Security Adviser \nCondoleezza Rice to say last September that Iraq had provided chemical \nweapons training to al-Qaida members? What prompted Secretary of \nDefense Rumsfeld to say last fall that the United States must act \nquickly to save potentially tens of thousands of citizens? What led the \nPresident to say that Saddam Hussein could strike the United States \nfirst and inflict massive and sudden horror?\n  These are the questions I have. These are some of the facts that need \nto become known, as the distinguished ranking member of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee said just before me on the floor. We need a \nbipartisan investigation into all these circumstances, into what was \nknown by the intelligence community, what was reported to members of \nthe administration.\n  What was reported in top secret briefings to members of the Armed \nServices Committee which I was invited to attend, 20 or more such \nbriefings over the course of last fall and early into this year?\n  What was being told to the administration that was at variance with \nthat information? What caused the administration to speak so \nemphatically, with certainty, about acts which it seems were not so \nfactual and which were not even presented as absolute facts in the \nbriefings which I attended at the time? We have a right to those \nanswers. Thus far it has been very difficult to get the agreement from \ncolleagues on the other side to undertake these investigations or \ninquiries, whatever euphemism we use.\n  The Senate Intelligence Committee evidently, and hopefully, has \nagreed to undertake such an inquiry. We have not been able to obtain \nthat consent in the Senate Armed Services Committee. In fact, we are \nbeing told such a bipartisan investigation is not going to be \nforthcoming.\n  What recourse does that leave? How do we get to the truth when those \nin possession of the facts and the information will not provide them? \nHow can we get to the truth when we cannot conduct a bipartisan inquiry \nor intelligence into obtaining that truth? What does it say about those \nwho would not provide that information or that opportunity to seek the \ntruth? What do they have to hide? What are they afraid we might find \nout? Why is it we cannot know the circumstances that caused the \nCommander in Chief to send 150,000 U.S. troops to Iraq, including PFC \nEdward Herrott being buried in Minnesota this morning, to whom I pay my \ngreatest respects.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I remember reading a book I enjoyed very \nmuch by James Michener called ``Caravans,'' an excellent history of \nAfghanistan. Of all the books he wrote, the only one I enjoyed more \nthan that was ``Hawaii.'' When I read ``Caravans,'' I knew very little \nabout Afghanistan. After I finished the book, I knew a lot more about \nAfghanistan and the constant struggles of the Afghan people.\n  America first focused on Afghanistan during the Cold War. The Soviets \ncame in and brutally tried to take over that country. As we know now, \nAmerican forces supplied arms to the Afghan people, who courageously \ndrove the Soviets out of Afghanistan. Many scholars believe that defeat \nmarked the beginning of the end of the Soviet Union. After almost 80 \nyears, the impoverished country of Afghanistan was the reason for the \nfall of one of the greatest powers in the history of the world.\n  I will return to the subject of Afghanistan in a moment, but first I \nwant to comment on what some of my colleagues have said this morning \nabout the situation in Iraq. I supported the resolution that authorized \nthe use of force in that country, and my vote was based on more than \nthe evidence of Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction. Still, \nthe controversy that has arisen concerning these weaspons has hurt \nAmerica in the international community. All the turmoil going on now, \nthe accusations of coverups, the exaggerations and half truths, which \npersuaded some of my colleagues to vote for the resolution--it has \ndamaged our country's credibility. It could take a long time to repair \nthat damage.\n  The ongoing fight against terrorism has challenged our military as \nnever before. But I think all my colleagues would agree that our men \nand women in uniform have risen to the task and performed heroically.\n  As pointed out by the distinguished senior Senator from Minnesota, \nMr. Dayton, American soldiers are still dying in Iraq. Another was \nkilled just yesterday.\n  I was impressed with the statement of the Senator from Minnesota \nbecause he mentioned not only a fallen soldier,\n\n[[Page S9364]]\n\nbut also the other casualities of war; that is, people who have lost \nlimbs, people who are paralyzed, people who are disfigured as a result \nof incendiary devices, people who are scarred permanently--and I'm \nreferring also to the psychological scars that will be with these men \nand women for the rest of their lives.\n  All of our troops have performed heroically. It is our constitutional \nresponsibility to ensure that our military gets the resources it needs \nto remain the strongest in the world. The bill we are considering today \ndoes that. It was not an easy task, and it is a tribute, as I have said \nalready, to the two managers of the bill, the senior Senator from \nAlaska and the senior Senator from Hawaii, and of course their fine \nstaffs. But, interestingly enough, as the Democratic leader mentioned \ntoday, this bill does not fund continuing operations in Afghanistan or \nIraq. I have great admiration for the two managers of this bill, as I \nsaid on the floor yesterday. These two Senators are role models for me. \nThese Senators have distinguished careers and represent their States as \nwell as they can be represented. They both understand Defense issues \nfrom personal experience.\n\n  They both served their country in war. The Senator from Hawaii earned \nthe highest honor that our country can confer upon an American military \nhero--the Congressional Medal of Honor. We sometimes take this great \nman for granted, but I try never to do that.\n  I can remember traveling with the distinguished Senator from Alaska \nto Czechoslovakia when the Iron Curtain was still down. I can remember \nin Prague, Czechoslovakia, encountering a man in a World War II flight \njacket. It led to a conversation with the Senator from Alaska because \nthat is the kind of jacket he wore.\n  I have the greatest respect for these two fine men. But I think this \nbill should have money in it to fund military operations for the next \nfiscal year in Afghanistan and Iraq. I say, as one of the \nappropriators, that I think it was genius how the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee has allowed the appropriations bills to go \nforward this year. I think we are going to finish all of the \nappropriations bills in a reasonable period of time. It was genius how \nthe Senator from Alaska found the money. It was enough to set what we \ncall 302(b) allocations. Those are allocations for the 13 \nsubcommittees. But for his ability to take some money from defense and \nput it into domestic programs, we could not have gotten that done. I \nacknowledge from a legislative standpoint how important it was to do \nthat.\n  But I think we should fund these bills prospectively as we do with \neverything else.\n  I heard an exchange between the Senator from Alaska and the \nDemocratic leader about the decision being made by the President and \nthe Republican leaders on enough money to take the military in \nAfghanistan and Iraq probably up to the first of the year. But we can't \nfund appropriations bills based upon one-quarter of a fiscal year. We \nhave to fund them for a full year.\n  The reason this is done, of course, is that we have a supplemental \nappropriations bill for emergency expenditures. They don't count \nagainst the budget rules we have around here. As a result of that, they \nadd to the deficit. I wish that were not how we had to do things this \nyear. But I accept that it has been done. Unless there is some magic \nthat occurs, or something that I don't see which is untoward, I will \nsupport the supplemental appropriations bill. We have to support the \nmilitary.\n  But I have to say this is not the way to do things around here. I \ncontinue to believe that any operation that puts our young men and \nwomen at risk should be funded through the regular appropriations \nprocess which allows people an opportunity to weigh in on our \npriorities, policy judgments, and efforts.\n  Last week, I came to the Senate floor and urged my colleagues to \nsupport our neighbor, Mexico. I acknowledge and appreciate the Members \nof the Senate having supported that amendment. Today, as we consider \nour military priorities for the coming year, I want to speak today \nabout what I fear has become another forgotten commitment, the \nreconstruction of Afghanistan.\n\n  Keep in mind, Mr. President, that we walked away from the people of \nAfghanistan once before. We supplied them with weapons. After the \nSoviets took tail and ran, the United States followed suit. We no \nlonger were interested in Afghanistan after we won that battle of the \nCold War. The chaos that ensued after we left led to the rise of the \nTaliban, one of the most brutal, repressive tyrannies in the history of \nthe world. Remember. We walked away once before. We cannot allow \nhistory to repeat itself.\n  When U.S.-led forces defeated the Taliban more than 19 months ago, \nPresident Bush promised a ``Marshall Plan for Afghanistan,'' and he \nassured us that our Nation would help Afghanistan become a stable, \nself-governing state free from the clutches of terrorism. I welcome \nthat commitment from the President. The people of Afghanistan deserve \nthat.\n  In the months immediately after the war, Afghanistan appeared to be \nmaking progress. A council of Afghans elected Hamid Karzai, a very \ncourageous man, to lead an interim government. But we haven't done much \nto help this courageous man. As hope returned to Afghanistan for the \nfirst time in many years, the administration redirected its focus \ntoward Iraq. Afghanistan virtually fell off the radar screen. Now, the \nAfghan people are paying the price. In short, all is not well in \nAfghanistan.\n  What are the current conditions? The security situation is \nparticularly threatening. I was in a meeting this morning. I asked my \nSenate friends to guess how many troops are in Afghanistan today. The \nanswer surprises people. I got different estimates--40,000, 20,000. We \nhave 9,000 troops in Afghanistan. Where are they? They are in Kabul. \nThe rest of the country is a jungle.\n  Outside Kabul, there is no security unless you are on the good side \nof one of the warlords. Aid workers don't feel safe. They don't travel \nthrough the country anymore. Many of the organizations have pulled out. \nIn some of the provinces of Afghanistan--particularly in the southeast \nregion--there is anarchy. Where there isn't anarchy, warlords are in \ncontrol. These warlords seek only to enrich and empower themselves \ninstead of helping President Karzai to address the urgent needs of the \npeople. They fight among themselves and hoard Afghanistan's precious \nresources. Afghanistan does enjoy the luxaries of fertile land, oil and \nriches. Afghanistan is a country that is driven by poverty. It is a \ndesert.\n  On rare occasions when the warlords aren't battling each other, they \nare joining together to weaken the central government. The absence of \ncentral authority in Afghanistan isn't anything new. That is why we had \nto cooperate with some of these warlords when we fought the Taliban. \nBut when the war ended, we promised the Afghan people we would help \nthem develop a stable country. That came from our President. We are \nreneging on that promise.\n  We simply can't accept a warlord-dominated Afghanistan. That would \nspell certain defeat for a long-term war against terrorism.\n  I came to this floor and said there is a need for the interim \ngovernment in Afghanistan to include women. The Taliban brutalized \nwomen, but in some areas of Afghanistan women are not doing much better \nnow than they were under the old regime. Some warlords are imposing \nTaliban-like restrictions on women and girls.\n  What does that mean? This means they are treated like nonpeople. It \nmeans they cannot show their faces. It means they cannot go anyplace \nunless they have their husband with them. They cannot even go to \nschool. Some of the schools that were opened just for girls after the \nwar have closed up.\n\n  Border security in Afghanistan is nonexistent. Is Osama bin Laden in \nAfghanistan? Is he near the country's border with Pakistan? It does not \nmatter. He's certainly not in Kabul, where most of our forces are \nstationed. The rest of the territory is controlled by warlords or is in \ncomplete anarchy.\n  Afghanistan's porous border with Pakistan has allowed pro-Taliban \nelements to slip in and out at will, on the rare occasions they need to \nescape U.S. forces searching remote areas. Iran continues to try to \ninfluence affairs in the areas around Kabul.\n  The Afghan army does not have the manpower, training, or the \nresources\n\n[[Page S9365]]\n\nto deal with these cross-border incursions. The hinterlands of \nAfghanistan are essentially up for grabs to the lethal, devious, and \ndangerous insurgents that were cast out of Kabul at the start of \nOperation Enduring Freedom some 20 months ago.\n  Economically, the landscape is bleak, to say the least. Fifty percent \nof the population in Afghanistan lives in absolute poverty. The average \nlife expectancy in Afghanistan is 46 years. It goes without saying \nthere are exceptionally high rates of malnutrition and child and \nmaternal mortality. Up to 7.5 million Afghans are said to be dependent \non external food aid. It is the only food they get. Unemployment--we \ndon't know how high it is but we know it is well over 50 percent. \nIlliteracy--maybe one out of four can read and write; maybe one out of \nfour. Seventy percent of Afghans cannot read or write.\n  But the real impetus for me to come here and say how I feel about \nthis issue is the result of my reading Newsweek magazine last week. \nNewsweek had a feature story about the No. 1 product in Afghanistan: \npoppies, used in the production of heroin. Unfortunately, the \ndevelopment of illegal narcotics is the one sector of Afghanistan's \neconomy that has experienced positive growth.\n  Last year, Afghanistan regained the dubious title of the world's \nlargest opium producer, and it is on track this year to produce even \nmore. Afghanistan accounts for almost 80 percent of the world's illicit \nopium production.\n  It has been a long time, but I used to do criminal law work. The \nfirst case I ever had--at that time Clark County, Las Vegas, did not \nhave a public defender. I was appointed by Judge Zenoff, Department 1, \nthe Eighth Judicial Court, Clark County, to represent a young man who \nwas in jail. I can still remember his name: Humbert Gregory Torres, the \nfirst criminal case I ever had.\n  I went to the jail. I was a new lawyer. I had my suit and tie on. I \nwent to the jail and talked to a man through the bars. I thought: This \nguy's a criminal? He should be a movie star. He was so handsome. He was \na heroin addict, and had been since he was 15 years old.\n  When I met him in that jail, he was 20 years old. He was smart, \nhandsome but terribly addicted to heroin. I saw the life he led after \nthat. Because it was my first case, I kept in touch with him, \nrepresented him in many different battles with the law. He went to \nprison. I don't know where Greg is now. I am sure he is not in a good \nsituation. Last I heard, he was back in prison.\n  Heroin destroys people, families, neighborhoods, and societies. It is \na horrible thing. That young man did not want to be addicted to heroin. \nHe got addicted to it when he was a little boy in New York City. He \ncould have done anything with his life had he not been addicted to \nheroin. Instead, he became a criminal.\n  Well, almost 80 percent of the product that gets to people like Greg \nTorres comes from Afghanistan. Drug laboratories are sprouting up \nacross Afghanistan, producing heroin that eventually finds its way into \nour country, our cities, and our neighborhoods.\n  Most of the money from this deadly trade does not even go to the \nimpoverished farmers, but instead to corrupt civil servants and drug \nlords. Look at the Newsweek article. It tells of a senior general in \nnorthern Afghanistan who brought in experts from Burma to help him \noperate a string of heroin labs, and of a senior police official in a \nnortheastern province operating a heroin lab in the garden of his home.\n  The nexus between the illegal drug trade and civil servants is very \nclear but even more troubling is the link between the opium trade and \nthe remaining Taliban extremists. It is no coincidence, according to \nthe United Nations, that Taliban insurgents are most prominent in the \npoppy-producing provinces of Afghanistan. This ``unholy alliance'' \nserves the interests of the drug lords, who need the protection, and \nthe Taliban, who want the money.\n  We have the Drug Enforcement Administration, of course. Its agents \nare very professional, and very well trained. We have really unloaded \non Afghan drug lords with these agents. We have two in Afghanistan--two \nDEA agents in the entire country. Eighty percent of all the heroin in \nthe world is produced in that country, and we have two Drug Enforcement \nAdministration officers there. With that kind of manpower, I'm sure \nwe'll get to the bottom of this. I am being a little facetious, but I \ndon't know what two agents can expect to accomplish.\n  Amid the drug, economic, and security crises plaguing Afghanistan, we \ncannot forget that the key government and private financial \ninstitutions were all destroyed under the Taliban. The image I see when \nI think of the Taliban is of them destroying that huge, historic, \nreligious monument, which had been there for more than 1,000 years, by \nshooting rockets from airplanes. That is what the Taliban is all about.\n  We can't forget that they destroyed key government and private \nfinancial institutions. Recovery and reconstruction in Afghanistan \ntherefore is an enormous challenge, but if we fall short, the \nconsequences will be enormous. We cannot afford to fail in Afghanistan, \nand yet we are not doing anything to address the problems there.\n  Some are saying: So what? Does it matter? I don't think it is \npossible to exaggerate the stakes in Afghanistan. It is, of course, the \nfront line in the war on terrorism. That is why we went there in the \nfirst place. Terrorists had built training camps there. The September \n11 attackers all had contact with terrorists in Afghanistan.\n  Although a diverse and committed international force is participating \nin the reconstruction effort--there are several thousand international \npeople in Kabul--we can't pass the buck and say reconstruction in \nAfghanistan is somebody else's responsibility. It is our \nresponsibility. We led the war there. We need to lead the \nreconstruction.\n  We have a responsibility to help Afghans create a stable, self-\ngoverning state with the resources for long-term economic development. \nIf we succeed, we will have denied the terrorists a strategically \nlocated base. We will have put a long-suffering people in a position to \nlift themselves to freedom and prosperity. We will have created a model \nthat can help the international community in reconstruction efforts \nelsewhere. And we will have silenced skeptics around the world who \nthought the United States would not fulfill its promise to Afghanistan \nand would cut and run a second time. These are the benefits of success.\n  The costs of failure are almost too troubling to imagine. Terrorists \ncould again regain a foothold. The Afghan people would remain \nimpoverished under a fundamentalist regime. And this confluence between \na failed state in a strategically vital area and terrorist forces could \nresult in lethal consequences, as we so painfully learned in 2001.\n  What can we do? As the President stands ready to deploy troops to \nLiberia--and I have been to Liberia and acknowledge that it deserves \nour attention--we cannot forget about Afghanistan. The President also \nis weighing options on what to do about force protection in Iraq. As \nimportant an issue as that is, I again implore him not to forget our \npromise to the Afghan people.\n  There is much more we can do. The report issued last month by \nAmbassador Frank Wisner and the Council on Foreign Relations provides \nan excellent roadmap. First, with regard to security measures, we need \nto maintain adequate military forces until Afghanistan can assume the \nresponsibility itself. We should also be seeking ways to bolster the \ninternational security forces there as well as substantially expanding \nthe proposed size of the Afghan Army, which at its peak will stand at \n10,000 soldiers. This hardly seems adequate for a country of 28 million \npeople. Reconstruction efforts cannot be effective until the territory \nbeyond Kabul is secure.\n  Second, politically and diplomatically we need to support the Afghans \nas they organize presidential and parliamentary elections to be held \nnext year. We need to continue to press Iran and Pakistan to secure the \nborder region and end their interference in Afghan affairs, and we need \nto continue to assist the Afghans in developing a vibrant civil society \nthat is inhospitable to extremism.\n  Third, reconstruction measures must resume fully. Despite the urgency \nof the situation, road building and other major reconstruction projects \nhave stalled. Despite receiving billions of dollars in financial \ncommitments from\n\n[[Page S9366]]\n\nthe international community, President Karzai still faces a gap of $276 \nmillion in his very modest budget. Afghanistan will require $15 billion \nover the next 5 years in reconstruction funds, over and above \nhumanitarian aid.\n\n  Congress has authorized funds to cover one-third of this total. \nAuthorizing it, as we have learned, doesn't mean much. We have to \nappropriate the money. It is great to issue press releases about all \nthe things we are going to do with this program and that program, but \nin the Congress there is a two-step procedure: We authorize and \nappropriate. If we don't appropriate, the authorization is meaningless. \nWe should fully fund the authorization so that, among other things, we \ncan complete construction of the road linking Kabul and Kandahar.\n  The United States obviously can't cover reconstruction costs on its \nown. I don't expect us to do so. The reconstruction effort will fail \nunless we persuade other countries to live up to their financial \ncommitments. But we cannot do that until we fulfill our own \nobligations.\n  President Bush has the power to place the reconstruction of \nAfghanistan back on the world agenda. But as I said earlier, the issue \nseems to have fallen off the White House radar screen. I say to \nPresident Bush: Fulfill the promise you made to the Afghan people and \nto the American people, and deliver on your Marshall Plan for \nAfghanistan. The Congress will support those efforts. We will do so not \nonly for the Afghan people but also for the security and safety of the \nUnited States and its allies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I just came from a conference about 30 \nminutes ago dealing with the issue of travel; that is, the right of the \nAmerican people to travel. We have the right to travel almost anywhere. \nI have been to China, a Communist country; Vietnam, a Communist \ncountry; I can go to Iran or North Korea.\n  The American people have a right to travel almost anywhere in the \nworld--except for Cuba. Why? Because with respect to Cuba, we have had \na 40-year embargo, which not only embargoes trade between this country \nand Cuba but prohibits the American people from traveling in Cuba.\n  We have an organization in the Department of Treasury called OFAC, \nOffice of Financial Assets Control, I believe it is. OFAC is an agency \nthat is supposed to be tracking terrorists at this point. Following 9/\n11, we understand there are all kinds of terrorists and others who wish \nthis country ill and are willing to murder Americans. We have the FBI, \nthe CIA, and a whole range of interests trying to track terrorists. As \nI said, one part of that is a little organization inside the Treasury \nDepartment called OFAC.\n  OFAC is supposed to look at all the money trails to track terrorists. \nBut that is not all they do. OFAC, as I speak today, has folks in the \nTreasury Department tracking American citizens who are traveling in \nCuba.\n  I want to give an example of what they are doing. There is a woman \nnamed Joan Slote. She is a grandmother. She is also a world-class \nsenior citizen cyclist. She was a medal winner at the 1993 senior \nolympics. She has bicycled through 21 different countries. She still \nbicycles 100 miles a week. She is in her seventies. This weekend, the \nWashington Post wrote a story about Joan Slote. She went with a group \nof Canadians to take a bicycling trip to Cuba. She believed it was \nlegal for Americans to bicycle in Cuba. It was certainly legal for \nCanadians to do so. She openly told the U.S. Customs agents that she \nhad been there.\n\n  When she got home, she received from OFAC, this little agency in the \nTreasury Department, a notice that she was being fined $10,000. She did \nnot respond to OFAC's missive because her son had a brain tumor and she \nwas attending to her sick son, who later died. So OFAC said: Sorry, you \nare fined $10,000. You did not respond, so you know what we are going \nto do? We are going to start taking your Social Security payments.\n  Here is a retired grandmother of six attending to her son who dies, \nwho went bicycling in Cuba prior to that and now gets fined $10,000 and \nhas the Treasury Department saying they are going to take this woman's \nSocial Security payments.\n  I do not understand it. I guess it is the Forrest Gump film, isn't \nit, that says: Stupid is as stupid does. Life is just a box of \nchocolates. I have no idea.\n  What on earth can be happening at the Treasury Department that has \npeople in OFAC, who are supposed to be tracking terrorists, tracking \nlittle old ladies, retired people bicycling in Cuba, and fining them \n$10,000. Or if it is not Joan Slote, perhaps it is a 77-year-old World \nWar II veteran who fought for this country many years ago. He posted \nsome information on a Web site he created about a licensed meeting of \nUnited States/Cuba Sister Cities Association in Havana. The OFAC \norganization down in the Treasury Department accused this 77-year-old \nWorld War II veteran of organizing, arranging, promoting, and otherwise \nfacilitating the attendance of persons at the conference in Cuba \nwithout a license. The fact is, this guy did not even attend. He did \nnot go to the conference. It was licensed by OFAC. He did not attend \nthe conference, but he put something on his Web site that had to do \nwith sister cities, and now OFAC is after him. So this 77-year-old \nWorld War II veteran has to hire a lawyer. Or perhaps it is the fellow \nfrom Washington State whose dad was a Cuban. His dad died, and he \nwanted his ashes spread on the soil in Cuba. So this young man took an \nurn with his father's ashes to Cuba. Guess what happened to him. We \nhave these vigilant folks down at the Treasury Department--no, not \ntracking terrorists, not protecting this country--tracking a man who \ntook the urn with his father's ashes to distribute them in Cuba.\n  What on earth can they be thinking about? Yes, it is true, we have a \nlaw, and the law in this country says: Let's punish Fidel Castro by \nlimiting the right of the American people to travel. Some of us think \nthat is dumb--d-u-m-b dumb. It does not hurt Fidel Castro to say to the \nAmerican people we are going to limit your travel opportunities. We \nhave had debate after debate in this Chamber, and in every circumstance \nwe have said the same thing: The way to resolve the issue with \nCommunist China is to lead them to a better place on human rights. How \ndo we lead them? Through engagement, trade, and travel. We encourage \ntrade and travel with China, a Communist country.\n  Vietnam: How do we engage Vietnam to lead them toward a better future \nwith more rights for their citizens--more civil rights, more human \nrights? Through engagement, through travel, and trade, because we do \nthat with Communist countries. Both political parties have said that is \nthe right thing to do.\n\n  For 40 years, our country has had an embargo with respect to the \ncountry of Cuba. For 40 years, we have indicated that we will punish \nFidel Castro by limiting the right of the American people to travel. \nForty years of failed policy ought to be enough to convince us to \nchange the law.\n  I have no interest in Fidel Castro except that he limits the rights \nof the Cuban people. I went to Havana on an official trip. I demanded \nto see an economist named Martha who was imprisoned. I was refused the \nopportunity to do so.\n  The fact is, human rights and civil rights in Cuba are not where they \nought to be. The Cuban people are not free, but we will not, in my \njudgment, advance rights for the Cuban people by deciding to embrace a \npolicy that has failed for 40 years. We will and should, it seems to \nme, encourage trade and travel with respect to Cuba because that is the \nquickest way to undermine Fidel Castro. The quickest way to undermine \nthis regime is through trade and travel, just as we preach it will do \nin China, in Vietnam, and in other areas of the world.\n  In addition to restricting travel, we have had this terribly ill-\nconsidered ban on trade. It is, in my judgment, always immoral to use \nfood as a weapon, and yet we have done that with Cuba. It is \ninteresting; the law was changed briefly, and as result of the law \nchange I helped engineer in the Senate, along with my former colleague \nwho is now Attorney General, Senator Ashcroft--I offered with Senator \nAshcroft, legislation that became law that opens just a bit the ability \nto ship food to Cuba so\n\n[[Page S9368]]\n\nwe can sell food to Cuba. Last year, for the first time in 42 years, 22 \ntrain carloads of dried peas left North Dakota's farms and elevators to \nbe shipped to Cuba.\n  Using food as a weapon, as we have done for four decades with Cuba, \ndoes not hurt Fidel Castro. Does anybody here think he has missed a \nmeal in 42 years because we have an embargo on food shipments to Cuba? \nDoes anybody think Fidel Castro misses breakfast, dinner, or lunch? \nAbsolutely not.\n  Using food as a weapon hurts sick people, poor people, and hungry \npeople, and it is basically an immoral policy, in my judgment.\n  The issue of trade and travel is important. It is not in any way \nsupportive of Fidel Castro for us to say a 40-year embargo does not \nwork and that the same strategy we use with respect to China and \nVietnam does work, and that is engagement through trade and travel. It \nundermines the ground on which dictators sit. It undermines their \ncapability to govern, and that is what we ought to do.\n  This afternoon, we are marking up the Agriculture appropriations \nbill, and I am going to offer an amendment to that bill. We have U.S. \nagricultural experts who have been denied the opportunity to go to Cuba \nto sell American agricultural products. As I said, Senator Ashcroft and \nI opened the door just a bit, and we have been selling some products to \nCuba. But in order to do that, Cuba has to run the transaction through \na French bank because it cannot even be run through a U.S. financial \nenterprise. It makes no sense to me, but that is the restriction.\n  I am going to offer an amendment that says at least those who are \nmoving back and forth to sell and buy agricultural commodities ought to \nbe able to travel. Let's at least begin the first step dealing with \nthis issue of travel.\n\n  I will end by saying again, it is illogical, in my judgment, to \nattempt to injure Fidel Castro by restricting the right of the American \npeople to travel. Does anybody really think that at the Treasury \nDepartment today we have these folks in gray suits and tiny little \nglasses, and probably green eyeshades, pouring over all this data--what \nare they looking for? Are they looking for financial information to \ntrack terrorists to put terrorists in jail? No, that is not what they \nare looking for. They are trying to find a grandmother from Illinois \nwho answered an ad for a bicycling trip in Cuba so they can fine her \n$10,000 and attach her Social Security checks. Shame on them. Yes, that \nis what the law says. Shame on us. In my judgment, we ought to change \nthe law. It does not make any sense.\n  My hope is that perhaps with my colleague, Senator Enzi, who just \nleft the Chamber, and others--Republicans and Democrats--who believe \nthe restricting of the right of the American people to travel makes no \nsense at all, my hope is that Republicans and Democrats can work \ntogether to change this law and stop OFAC from doing what it is now \ndoing. It is hard to find adjectives to describe the basic stupidity of \nour country chasing little old ladies who ride a bicycle in Cuba and \nlevying $10,000 fines on them and then saying: If you do not pay it, we \nwill attach your Social Security check.\n  Why are we doing that? Because we are saying a person cannot travel, \nor we are restricting their right to travel because we want to injure \nFidel Castro. The way to injure Fidel Castro is the way we have done \nwith China and Vietnam, which are Communist countries, and that is \nengagement through trade and travel that undermines the governments of \nthose countries. That is what we ought to do with Cuba.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/15/senate-section/article/S9368-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9368-S9369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF LONNY R. SUKO, TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE, FOR \n                   THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now go into executive session to consider the nomination of \nLonny R. Suko, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Lonny R. Suko, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the Eastern District of Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWashington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, my colleagues will be voting momentarily \non the nomination of Lonny Suko, and I rise today to support his \nnomination for U.S. District Court Judge for the Eastern District of \nWashington State.\n  Lonny Suko is a distinguished lawyer and U.S. magistrate judge from \nmy home State of Washington. I am honored to support his confirmation \nas a district court judge. He was unanimously reported out of the full \nJudiciary Committee on July 10. Judge Suko has strong bi-partisan \nsupport, and for good reason. He has handled some of the most difficult \ncases in Eastern Washington in the past decade, and he has won the \nrespect of everyone who has come before him. That is one of the reasons \nwhy Judge Suko enjoys such strong support from a diverse group of \nattorneys and community leaders in Washington State.\n  Both Senator Cantwell and I assisted the President in choosing him \nfrom a list of very qualified candidates. Lonny Suko has spent his life \nliving and serving Eastern Washington. He is a graduate of my alma \nmater, Washington State University, and of the University of Idaho \nSchool of Law. He has had a distinguished career as a lawyer and a U.S. \nmagistrate judge. In private practice, Lonny Suko had a sucessful \npractice defending both plaintiffs and defendants in a variety of tort, \ncontract, creditor-debtor, and public sector cases. He has also \ndistinguished himself as a U.S. magistrate judge, serving part-time \nfrom 1971 to 1991, and full time since 1991. As I mentioned, Judge Suko \nhandled some of the most challenging cases in recent history in Eastern \nWashington. He heard the injury and death claims of more than two dozen \nplaintiffs who were victimized by a gunman at Fairchild Air Force Base \nin the early 1990's. He was involved in several other high profile \nsettlements.\n  In all of those cases, Judge Suko won high praise for his judicial \ndemeanor, his fairness and his respect for all parties. Judge Suko \nclearly meets the standards of fairness, even-handedness, and adherence \nto the law that we expect of our Federal judges. Outside of his many \nprofessional credentials, I have met with him, and have been impressed \nby his professionalism and decency. Therefore, it is my pleasure to \nsupport for confirmation to the Federal bench such a great lawyer and \njudge who I believe will make an exceptional Federal judge. He has \nserved the people of our State well. I urge my colleagues to support \nhis nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this nomination from Washington State has \nthe support of the Democratic Senators from that State. Senator Murray \nand Senator Cantwell have both worked hard to establish a bipartisan \nprocess for making recommendations to the President for Federal \njudicial vacancies in their State. They are to be commended for their \nwork. They support the nomination of Lonny R. Suko, whose nomination is \na product of Washington's bipartisan selection commission.\n  With this confirmation today, the third so far this week, the Senate \nwill have confirmed 136 judicial nominees of this President. These \ninclude 36 confirmed just this year. That number equals the number of \njudges confirmed during all of 1997, exceeds the 34 judges confirmed in \nall of 1999, and is more than double the number of judges confirmed in \nthe entire 1996 session. Thus, we are well ahead of the pace that the \nRepublican majority used to maintain when reviewing President Clinton's \nnominees.\n  We have reduced judicial vacancies to the lowest number in 13 years \nand currently have more Federal judges on the bench than at any time in \nour history.\n  Working with home State Senators from both parties helps make the \nconfirmation process proceed more smoothly as we have demonstrated over \nand over and demonstrated again today.\n  I congratulate the nominee and his family on his confirmation today\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate will \nbe acting today to confirm Lonny Suko as a District Court Judge for \nEastern Washington.\n  Lonny Suko is extremely well qualified. He has been a full-time \nFederal\n\n[[Page S9369]]\n\nmagistrate judge in Yakima, WA, since 1995. And before that he was a \npart-time magistrate judge from 1971 until 1991. With 28 years of \nexperience on the Federal bench, elevating him to be a Federal district \ncourt judge is a natural step.\n  Lonny Suko's nomination is the result of the hard work of an eastern \nWashington-based judicial selection committee. The selection committee \nprocess was negotiated between the White House, Senator Murray, and \nmyself. Six qualified members of the legal community in Eastern \nWashington selected by our local Members of Congress and by Senator \nMurray and myself put in long hours interviewing and selecting three \nqualified candidates to send to the President. The White House agreed \nwith my judgment that Lonny Suko was the most qualified candidate for \nthis position.\n  Prior to his full-time work as a U.S. magistrate judge, Lonny Suko \nwas also a partner in the firm of Lyon, Weigand & Suko, where his \ncareer in private practice involved extensive representation of \nplaintiffs and defendants in civil litigation as well as extensive \nmediation experience. Though he has lived in Yakima for the past 30 \nyears, Mr. Suko has connections throughout eastern Washington. He is \noriginally from Spokane, graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Washington State \nUniversity in Pullman, and started his legal career as a clerk to Judge \nCharles L. Powell, who was then the Chief Judge of the Eastern District \nof Washington in Spokane.\n  We wish Judge Suko well in his new position and have confidence that \nhe will be an excellent addition to our distinguished Federal bench.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination \nof Magistrate Judge Lonny R. Suko to be a U.S. District Court Judge for \nthe Eastern District of Washington.\n  Judge Suko has been part of the Washington legal community for over \nthree decades. After graduating from law school in 1968, Judge Suko \nclerked for the Honorable Charles L. Powell in the Eastern District of \nWashington. In 1969, he joined the Lyon Law Offices, where he served as \nassociate, partner, and shareholder. As an attorney, Judge Suko \nlitigated primarily civil matters.\n  In 1971, Judge Suko was appointed part-time United States magistrate \njudge, a position he held while practicing law full time until 1991 \nwhen the position was discontinued. In 1995, Judge Suko ascended to the \nbench once again when he was appointed as a full-time Federal \nMagistrate Judge for the United States District Court Eastern District \nof Washington. As a magistrate judge, Judge Suko presides over both \ncriminal and civil matters.\n  Judge Suko has been rated unanimously well qualified by the American \nBar Association, and enjoys bipartisan support. I am confident Judge \nSuko will make an excellent Federal judge. I commend President Bush for \nnominating him and urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nnomination.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered on this \njudicial nomination?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. LOTT. I suggest that we move to the vote. Is there a prearranged \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote is to occur at 12:15.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Lonny R. Suko to be a United States District Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Washington?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. \nSununu) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham), the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry), the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. \nLieberman), and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Miller) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``aye''.\n  The result was announced--yeas 94, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 276 Ex.]\n\n                                YEAS--94\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--6\n\n     Edwards\n     Graham (FL)\n     Kerry\n     Lieberman\n     Miller\n     Sununu\n  The nomination was confirmed\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, I approach the current Department of \nDefense appropriations bill and our current status in Iraq and the \nMiddle East from somewhat of a unique circumstance: as a Senator but \nalso the father of a soldier who has served in Iraq. My oldest son \nBrooks, a staff sergeant with the 101st Airborne Infantry over the past \nroughly 5 years, has now served in four wars--in Bosnia, Kosovo, \nAfghanistan, and most recently Iraq. I appreciate profoundly how much \nour Nation owes to our military. These young men and women are \nprofessional. They are skilled. They are courageous. They are taking on \na job few other Americans would want to do for any amount of \ncompensation. We can take great pride in America that our military is \nthe finest in the world.\n\n[[Page S9370]]\n\n  In that context, no one is more supportive of our military personnel \nand their families than I am. The deployment tempo has been enormous. \nMany families have seen the absence of their husbands and wives, \nbrothers and sisters, sons and daughters for a great amount of time, \nand the tension and stress of the families has been great. We owe \ngratitude to the families of our military as well.\n  I voted for a resolution authorizing force. I think the world is a \nbetter place without Saddam Hussein. But that resolution was based on \ntwo major pillars. One was that there was an imminent threat to the \nsecurity of the region and to America because of the presence of \nweaponized weapons of mass destruction and, secondly, that the \nPresident was to go to the United Nations and our allies and try to \ninternationalize a strategy relative to Iraq to the best degree \npossible.\n  Now we find ourselves in a circumstance where there is great doubt \nabout the quality, the credibility of the intelligence the President \nshared with the American public. He was quoted in the paper this \nmorning saying, our intelligence is ``darn good.''\n  What is at stake is not just the presence of weapons of mass \ndestruction. It is possible that perhaps some will ultimately be found. \nBut what is at stake is the credibility of America in the world \ncommunity. It turns out that the statements about nuclear weapons were \nsimply false. The CIA knew that. It turns out that ties between Saddam \nHussein and al-Qaida at 9/11 were nonexistent. Yet over half of America \nto this day thinks there is some connection between Saddam Hussein and \n9/11, when there was none--zero.\n  Well, this is particularly troubling at a time when this \nadministration has enunciated a radically new approach to military \naffairs abroad, saying that we will from now on be willing to take on \npreemptive war--preemptive war, of course, is based on the quality of \nintelligence--and that we will do it unilaterally if need be; the rest \nof the world community doesn't count.\n  Thirdly, that if we so choose, we will use nuclear weapons in a \nfirst-strike capacity. This new Bush doctrine is intended, apparently, \nto make the United States sound like the toughest country on the block. \nTo the contrary, it should not be a surprise to anyone that this kind \nof strategy, coupled with faulty intelligence and perhaps a \nmanipulation of what intelligence was there in a false, misleading way, \nhas in fact lost the support of our allies around the world when, after \n9/11, the United States had the near unanimous support of the world \ncommunity. Now that has been largely lost, and even our allies express \ncontempt for the American policy abroad and our role in the world.\n  It should come as no surprise to anybody that this unilateralist, \nfirst-strike capability, all premised on faulty and shaky intelligence \nand manipulation of intelligence, actually puts America at greater risk \nthan before. It leads to--and it should come as no surprise--an arms \nrace greater than before, where other countries may believe that the \nonly way to defend themselves against a unilateral, preemptive nuclear \nattack from the United States is to arm themselves to the hilt, perhaps \nwith their own nuclear weapons--certainly weapons of mass destruction. \nNow we find that this strategy will lead to a less secure, more \ntroubled world. It is something this Congress and this Senate need to \nrethink.\n  With the contempt toward the United States this spurs, like \ninternationalism, greater terrorism, more people willing to join \nterrorist groups, I think it is fair to say there is a greater threat \nof terror applied to the United States and our allies today than there \nwas before.\n  Secondly, the lack of international concern, the lack of diplomacy, \nand the failure of American diplomacy to pull together a greater \nalliance and cohesion--certainly in the Western World, but in the world \nin general--have led to America being even more targeted than before by \nthe powers of hate around the world.\n  We were told at the time that there was great urgency for this \nconflict and that we would be in and we would be out and we would \nrestore democracy. How foolish and naive that looks today. Now we are \nbeing told that this conflict and our presence in Iraq could easily \nlast 4 years, perhaps 10 years, at a cost of $100 billion, conceivably, \nover the coming year, while our men and women in uniform, who are doing \ncourageous work, find themselves in a near shooting gallery environment \nin Iraq, with very little contribution from our allies. Some of those \ncontributions are even discouraged by the United States.\n  To put some context on this--because our troops are on the ground and \nour troops are being killed daily, because our taxpayers are paying \nvirtually 100 percent of the cost of this--we now find ourselves with \nan administration telling us we cannot afford full funding for VA \nhealth care so our veterans can get the medical services they need \nbecause we don't have the $2 billion extra. We are spending $4 billion \na month in Iraq, and we are going to do that for years, perhaps for a \ndecade. We are being told we don't have enough money for Amtrak because \nit costs a half billion dollars more. We are going to spend $100 \nbillion in the coming year in this faraway place, but we don't have the \nfunding for education or health care. And the reason the prescription \ndrug plan is so faulty and viewed with dissatisfaction by American \nseniors is that the funds are not there to fund a decent plan. Yet all \nof those costs are a tiny fraction of what we are committed to send \ninto the far distant future in the Middle East.\n\n  We have 200,000 troops abroad total, with some 140,000 to 150,000 in \nthe Middle East; we have 1,000 in Saudi Arabia; we have 1,300 in \nBahrain; we have 4,000 in Qatar; we have 145,000 in Iraq; we have \n11,000 in Pakistan; we have 14,000 in Turkey; we have 1,000 in Egypt; \nand we have over 1,000 in Djibouti.\n  We have troops scattered all over the world. Their families want to \nknow when they are coming home. Employers want to know when they are \ncoming home. Nobody can say. Nobody has a timeframe, other than to know \nthat our military is going to be under tremendous stress for a long, \nunforeseeable time.\n  At the same time, we have budding conflicts in North Korea, Liberia, \nIran, and the existing conflict in Afghanistan. It doesn't take a \ngenius to figure out that this is going to lead to enormously difficult \nproblems in terms of recruiting and retaining military active-duty \nGuard and Reserve. My son confides in me, after 4 wars in 5 years, in \ntalking to his colleagues in the U.S. Army, there are more and more of \nthem saying: I thought this would be a career, but frankly this is \ndestroying my family, my future. We cannot be deployed at this kind of \ntempo forever.\n  It appears that that will be the case because the United States has \ntaken such a unilateral approach--to become the policeman for the \nentire world without the participation of our allies, without the U.N., \nwithout the regional groups. When will this President learn that we are \nthe world's major military power but we cannot be the policeman for the \nworld, we cannot be doing all this ourselves? We need to bring together \nour allies, and we need the diplomacy to make that happen.\n  So while we are asking our military to be deployed at an enormous \ntempo, while we are losing men and women daily in Afghanistan and \nIraq--and we have another conflict on the near horizon in Liberia--the \nPresident says we cannot afford the full combat pay increase that the \nSenate requested. How many of you would go live in a hole in the wall \nin Iraq and be fired at from every angle as you walk down the street, \nand your President says we won't give you that extra $100 a month. One \nhundred dollars a month? How many in this Chamber would encourage their \nchildren to serve in that environment?\n  We are being told by the White House we cannot afford the full \nfunding for health care. Our vets are going to have to wait in line for \nanother year to get the access to health care that they deserve and \nthat they are owed because we don't have the funding. The President \nsays he will veto any legislation we pass in the Senate to expand \naccess to health care for our National Guard and our Reserve troops. He \nwill veto it. There is plenty of money to go around for an enormous tax \ncut to enrich the wealthiest families in this Nation, but when it comes \ntime to do modest things for our own soldiers, the President is not \nthere. We need to hold him accountable for this irresponsibility.\n\n[[Page S9371]]\n\n  There is enormous damage being done to the credibility of our Nation \nby what has transpired over these past months. We can be proud of our \nmilitary, proud of our troops. We know Saddam Hussein was a thug and \nthe world is better without him. But when we see what has happened due \nto the lack of an international alliance, due to our unilateralism, due \nto faulty intelligence, or the manipulation of our intelligence, when \nwe see what happened to world opinion relative to the United States, \nand now the unwillingness of the rest of the world to work with us to \nstabilize the world military situation, we find ourselves in a terrible \nhole and how a $450 billion deficit reported just today--a record \ndeficit, where we are going to borrow from the Social Security trust \nfund for the remainder of the decade in order to pay for all of this--\nwe need to regroup.\n  Our U.S. troops, our men and women in uniform, deserve better. We \nAmerican citizens deserve better as well. I simply have to share my \nfrustration and, yes, my anger, at the circumstances we find ourselves \nin today due to profound failings of this administration in the conduct \nof our military strategy in the Middle East and all that portends for \nthe future of this country and our role in the world, all that means \nfor the taxpayers of this country, all that means in the inability to \nfund our schools, our health care, our environment, and all the needs \nof infrastructure we need to get our economy going again. Our country \ndeserves better.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senator from South Dakota leaves \nthe floor, I wish to say that many of us speak about the conflict in \nIraq and Afghanistan from a distance. The Senator from South Dakota \ndoes not speak from a distance. His son has been involved in both \nconflicts, carrying a rifle for the U.S. Army and being shot at.\n  I was with, as many of us were, Senator Johnson during the height of \nthe military conflict in Iraq when every day he was happy the day ended \nwithout getting a message that his son had been injured or killed in \nIraq. I was here when Senator Johnson received a letter from his son \nwritten on a K-ration wrapper from a foxhole in Iraq. So Senator \nJohnson has a right to be upset, to speak with indignation because he \nlooks at it differently than all the rest of us because he was the only \nSenator with a son in combat in Iraq.\n  His son has come home. He is one of the lucky ones. As we see on the \nfront of the Washington Post today, large contingencies which were \nexpecting to come home next month have been ordered to stay in Iraq. \nThey do not know when they will be home.\n  I extend my appreciation to Senator and Mrs. Johnson for being the \nparents of a stalwart American hero, someone who has fought over the \nlast 5 years in four American wars.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, may I respond to my colleague and my \nfriend from Nevada. There are hundreds of thousands of parents all \nacross America who do daily, as my wife Barbara and I have done, and \nthat is to watch the news, follow the news as closely as possible with \nboth pride in our sons and daughters, husbands and wives, but dread as \nwell.\n  As we did, there are hundreds of thousands of parents and loved ones \nacross this country who follow with great intensity the daily reports \nabout deaths and injuries. There are families all across our country as \nwe speak who know that at any moment there could be a catastrophic, \nlife-shattering report of the loss or injury of their loved ones.\n  When people talk about acceptable levels of casualties, I hope more \nand more Americans understand there are real families, real faces \ninvolved, and that we owe an enormous debt of gratitude to our \nmilitary. They are the greatest in the world. They do as they are \nordered to serve, and I hope we stand not only with these men and women \nin uniform but with their families who have no idea, in most cases, \nwhen they are coming back, many suffering great financial hardship but \nalso emotional hardship, the loss of parenting, the loss of key \nemployers as a great consequence.\n  While we follow this war and the aftermath of the war with great \nconcern, we also should remember this is not just numbers. This is not \na game. This is a very real situation that is going on in the lives of \nvery real American families, and all of these issues need to be \napproached with that kind of somber awareness and commitment that we do \nthe best we can for our troops and their families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wish to join with my colleague from \nNevada in commending the distinguished Senator from South Dakota for \nhis powerful statement, for the eloquence and the passion he has \ndemonstrated in expressing himself this afternoon.\n  I have said on countless occasions that no one could be more proud to \ncall him a colleague than I. We have heard yet another demonstration of \nthe reason I am so confident in my ability to say that as we heard him \nthis afternoon.\n  I will never forget my colleague sharing with me a postcard his son \nsent while he was in Iraq. It was on the back of an MRE, one of these \nmeals the military eats every day. He had carved it out, writing on the \nback, put the address on the front, and sent it to his father and \nmother to report that he was well, to report that he believed in what \nhe was doing.\n  It has to be an emotional moment to receive that from your son. He \ninvoked that emotion again today in speaking for all families who have \nmembers of the military in Iraq; that it is wrong to minimize these \nlosses; that it is wrong to, in some way, depersonalize the \nextraordinary impact it has when one of these sons or daughters is \nlost.\n  Hans Gukeisen was one of those who did lose his life. He was from \nLead, SD. He was a helicopter pilot. He lost his life rescuing an Iraqi \nchild. He is now buried in the Black Hills National Cemetery. I just \nreceived a message from his father a couple of days ago lamenting, \nexpressing the sense of loss that only a father can.\n  As we face these questions, as we struggle to ensure we have the \ninformation this Congress deserves, let us also be appreciative of the \nextraordinary sacrifice made by those who are there; those who are no \nlonger living as a result of having been there; and those, hopefully, \nwho will never have to go but are prepared to do so today.\n  I was disappointed to learn just within the last week that the \nSecretary of Defense indicated that he could not support an amendment \nwe adopted 82 to 10, I believe, which would have provided health \ninsurance to National Guard personnel once they come home. They are \neligible for it now. They are not when they come home. That is a \ndisparity, an inequity, a problem I cannot fully appreciate, but they \ncan, and it is yet another indication of the sacrifice they made to be \nthere for their country.\n  As others have noted, they have been there for months and months. We \nowe it to them to give them some better understanding of the length of \ntime they will stay. We owe it to them to send as clear a message as we \ncan that we have a plan and that they can put their lives on a similar \nplan once they know what the plan for the country will be. But it \nappears there is no plan today. We do not know how long we will stay, \nand I think it is imperative that we find out.\n  These and other questions, as I said earlier today, Mr. President, \nare ones that have to be addressed during this debate and consideration \nof this bill. I am hopeful we can put in place legislatively the \nassurances that we will require before we vote on this bill later on, \nwhenever that may be.\n  So again, let me thank the distinguished Senator from South Dakota \nfor his eloquence, for his passion, and for his partnership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWest Virginia is to be recognized for the purposes of an amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1244\n\n       (Purpose: To prohibit excessive deployments overseas of \n     members of the Guard and Reserves)\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for his consideration and \ncourtesy.\n  Our National Guard and the Reserves of each of our military services \nhave\n\n[[Page S9372]]\n\nbecome more than a source of manpower during times of national crisis. \nMembers of the Reserve components have become an indispensable tool to \ncarry out military operations and homeland security missions.\n  As of last week, there were 204,100 Guard and Reserve personnel on \nactive duty. Some are stationed within the United States, performing \nhomeland security missions. Many are deployed overseas, in foreign \nlands, thousands of miles from home, to places such as Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  Since September 11, 2001, we have activated more Guard and Reserve \npersonnel than at any time since the Korean war but countless \nreservists, especially those who are now serving in Iraq, have not even \nbeen told when their deployment will end. Nobody knows when they will \nreturn home to their families, their friends, and their home \ncommunities.\n  Adding to the uncertainty, some Reserve units that are now being \nactivated are simply being told to prepare to deploy for 1 to 2 years. \nThis is no way to treat our National Guard and Reserve forces. How \nwould Senators like to be treated like that? Are we keeping our citizen \nsoldiers away from their jobs and their homes for too long? Are we? \nThere are a growing number of West Virginians who say yes.\n  My office has received an increasing number of letters, phone calls, \nand e-mails from West Virginians asking when their loved ones who serve \nin the Reserve components will be coming home. How long? How long will \nthat vacant chair be at the dinner table? How long will that husband, \nthat father, be away from home, unable to carry that child to bed and \ntuck it under the cover at night? How long, Mr. Rumsfeld, I ask?\n  Some of the reports in these communications are very alarming. \nSenators read their mail as I read mine. Other Senators, I am sure, are \ngetting the same question from those who are living there in the face \nof danger every second of every minute of every hour of every day, in \nthe hot sands, 130 degrees, 120 degrees, 110 degrees. There they are. \nAll of these letters express a deep frustration with the length of \ndeployment of National Guard men and women and other Reserve units.\n  A number of troops and their families have expressed desperation at \ntrying to get any sort of information about when their units will be \nreturning to the United States, and it is about the same frustration \nthat we as their elected representatives are getting when we ask \nquestions of this administration to appear before our committee.\n  After reviewing what some of these units have gone through, I can see \nwhy people are frustrated. Let us take the case of one engineering unit \nfrom West Virginia. After shipping out in January 2003, this unit \nadvanced deep into Iraq, along with front-line fighting forces. During \nthe war, they bridged a river under heavy Iraqi fire. I have several \nreports that members of this unit are able to call home only once every \nseveral weeks, and that now they are only helping to haul Iraqi \nammunition. This unit has not been given a date to return to the United \nStates, and rumors are now circling that they will remain in Iraq until \nJanuary 2004, until the snow falls in West Virginia.\n  Another National Guard unit has struggled through back-to-back-to-\nback deployments. This unit was mobilized for State duty in response to \nflooding in West Virginia in the summer of 2001. After September 11, \nthis unit spent 1 year in Federal duty performing homeland security \nmissions. After 3 months' rest, the unit was again called to duty and \nthis time sent to the Persian Gulf region in February 2003, where they \nremain to this day. There has been no word, none, on when this unit \nwill return home. Hear me, Senators.\n  One of my constituents wrote about her husband who was deployed to \nthe Persian Gulf in December 2002, told he would return as soon as the \nwar was over. After the President made his visit to the aircraft \ncarrier Abraham Lincoln and gave his speech under the giant banner \nwhich read ``Mission Accomplished,'' this reservist still has not been \nsent home. In fact, he was given five different dates to return to West \nVirginia and then sent to another country in the region with the \npossibility of extending his deployment to September. To add insult to \ninjury, this reservist had to pay for his own food and lodging while he \nwas awaiting new orders after the war.\n  Hear me. Hear me, Mr. President. These stories should not come as a \ncomplete surprise to my colleagues. I am confident every Senator has \nbeen receiving mail with similar reports of deployments with no end, \nunclear missions, shortages in supplies, and countless other problems.\n  I have read similar problems in the newspaper about members of the \nActive-Duty Forces. This morning, there is an article in the Los \nAngeles Times about another delay in the homecoming of the war-weary \n3rd Infantry Division. Less than a week after Secretary Rumsfeld \nannounced to the Armed Services Committee that this division would be \nhome by September, 10,000 of these soldiers have now been told to \nprepare to stay in Iraq indefinitely, an equal number of that army of \nGreeks which was led by Xenophon back home after the war, after the \nBattle of Cunaxa. Ten thousand have now been told to prepare to stay in \nIraq indefinitely. These troops ought to have the chance to come home, \ntoo.\n  There are two reasons why I am particularly concerned about the long \ndeployments of the Guard and Reserve. First, the National Guard has \nimportant responsibilities to their own States. Right now, this very \nminute, West Virginia has all of its Guard and Reserve engineer units \ndeployed overseas, along with all of their earthmovers, their dump \ntrucks, their equipment. If the summer storms cause more flooding and \nmudslides in the West Virginia hills, who is Governor Wise going to go \nto for help?\n  We have watched those storms sweep over the mountains of West \nVirginia and come down those rugged, ragged, steep slopes into the \nvalleys and cause terrible floods to come rushing down, wiping out \nlives and property. Who is Governor Wise going to go to for help? The \nengineers of the West Virginia National Guard cannot answer the call \nfrom the hot sands of Iraq. My State would either have to rely on \nexpensive contractors to recover from the storms or wait 2 or 3 days \nfor National Guard units from neighboring States to respond. West \nVirginians need our National Guard in West Virginia.\n  Second, members of the Guard and Reserve are part-time soldiers. They \nare proud to serve their country but they did not sign up to serve \nfull-time duty. We must exercise greater discretion when mobilizing the \nreserves just as we did decades ago.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, from 1945 to 1989, \nthere were only four involuntary callups of Reserve Forces. In 1945, I \nwas in Florida, welding in the shipyard to the end of World War II. \nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, from that date 1945 to \n1989, there were only four involuntary callups of reservists. Since \nthen, there have been six involuntary deployments. It is unreasonable \nto dip into the Guard and Reserve so frequently, to pull those men and \nwomen away from their civilian careers and away from their families and \nexpect them to serve overseas with no indication of when their mission \nwill end.\n  There are serious defects from protracted deployments of the National \nGuard and the Reserve. There is growing frustration, I am telling you. \nIt is growing. The frustration is there and it is growing.\n  Hear me, Mr. President, down at the other end of the avenue. Hear me, \nMr. Rumsfeld. Hear me, Senators. That frustration is growing. Growing \nfrustration among members of the Guard and Reserves mean that many \ntroops may finally elect to take their hard-earned retirement. Many \njunior personnel are likely to decide they do not want to put their \nfamilies through months or even years of hardship again and they will \nchoose not to reenlist once their duty has been completed.\n  As we speak, unit commanders are bracing for a heavy loss of \npersonnel once the deployed units are rotated home. The time has come \nfor Congress to say: Enough is enough. Let us put an end to open-ended \nand back-to-back deployments of the National Guard and Reserve. Our \npart-time troops need to get back to their homes. They need to get back \nto their families.\n  They need to get back to their full-time jobs.\n  That is why I offer an amendment to limit the involuntary deployment \nof\n\n[[Page S9373]]\n\nNational Guard and Reserve personnel to 6 months for any single \noverseas deployment and not more than 1 deployment in any 12-month \nperiod.\n  When we send the National Guard to peacekeeping missions in the \nBalkans, they are overseas for 6 months. Why should we ask our \nreservists to serve longer in Iraq or Afghanistan? Why should we ask \nour reservists to put up with back-to-back deployment?\n  Secretary Rumsfeld announced this week that he is seeking long-term \nchanges to reduce dependence on the involuntary mobilization of \nNational Guard and Reserves for not more than 1 year out of every 6 \nyears. This is a commendable action, and we need to take a look at the \nlong-term structure of our Armed Forces. But Secretary Rumsfeld's \nproposed changes do nothing to address the problems our reservists and \ntheir families are facing today.\n  My amendment will make an immediate impact on the problem of open-\nended deployments for the National Guard and the Reserves. My amendment \nwill make the Defense Department tell our reservists when they will be \ncoming home because no funds in this bill may be spent to keep a Guard \nor Reserve unit overseas for more than 6 months.\n  We need to start rotating our Reserve Forces back home. Right now, \nthere are 204,100 Reserve personnel who are not at their civilian jobs. \nThese absences are leaving huge gaps in private businesses and \nessential government services.\n  In West Virginia, 10 percent of the State police have been called to \nactive duty. Countless employers across the country are working \nshorthanded, waiting for the day that one of their employees will \nreturn home from their service to our country. Families are struggling \nto make up the income lost by having a provider receive modest \npaychecks from the Pentagon as opposed to the good pay of civilian \ncareers, such as doctors, lawyers, coal miners, teachers, or even \nplumbers.\n  One can only wonder how much the endless cycle of deployments has \naffected our economy over the last 2 years. But it is clear that we \nneed these part-time members of the military back in our communities.\n  My amendment would allow us to tell the members of the National Guard \nand the Reserve that they will return home within 6 months of being \nsent overseas. Congress should act in order to provide a measure of \nstability to the deployment our reservists are facing. We should give \nthe same measure of stability to their families and their employers.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I send it to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1244:\n       Insert after section 8123 the following:\n       Sec. 8124. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no \n     funds appropriated or otherwise made available for the \n     Department of Defense, including funds appropriated for the \n     Department before the date of the enactment of this Act that \n     remain available for obligation as of that date, may be \n     available for the involuntary call or order to active duty of \n     any member of the National Guard or other Reserve component \n     for purposes of the deployment of the member overseas as \n     follows:\n       (1) A single deployment overseas of 180 days or more.\n       (2) More than one deployment overseas in any 360-day \n     period.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia has \ntouched on a subject that many of us believe should be explored. I \nthink in order to look at it, we have to look at a little bit of \nhistory. That history, as far as the Department of Defense is \nconcerned, is not too pleasant.\n  In the Clinton administration, I remember distinctly being down at \nthe White House when the President showed us his plan for defense \nexpenditures. He showed us a chart that showed a constant decline in \ndefense expenditures. At the end of 6 or 7 years, it started to go back \nup. He was going to use that money to reorder priorities of the \ncountry. That was his plan, and that is what he executed.\n  As a consequence, the military people of this country had to figure \nout how to defend the country. Many of us who worked in matters \nrelating to defense here in the Congress worked with them. The concept \nthat was developed by the Defense Department and approved by Congress \nwas the total force concept. The total force is those who are regularly \nin the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines. And it was augmented by the \nNational Guard and by the Reserve.\n  When we deploy forces now overseas, almost every unit of the regular \nmilitary has, along with it, portions of its personnel who come from \nthe Guard or Reserve. They are already identified before deployments \ntake place. This is the total force going out into these operations. \nThis happened during the Clinton administration in Bosnia, and it \nhappened in Kosovo. There were National Guard as well as Reserves \ndeployed with the regular units. The concept of deployment is one that \npeople in the services understand.\n  The problem the Senator from West Virginia has correctly identified \nis the repeated deployments that have taken place. When we think about \nit, starting in Haiti, starting in Bosnia and in Kosovo, we had a \nseries of deployments, and then in this administration in Afghanistan \nand Iraq.\n  Those have all taken place in a continuum of a lifetime of the \ncurrent force. It is an evolving force. People enter and others leave. \nBut we are still dealing with a total force. You are not dealing with \nthe kind of forces that were in place when I first came to the Senate \nor when we served in in World War II. There were massive divisions \ncalled up. They had a cadre of permanent people in the U.S. Army. Back \nthen, we were in the Army of the United States. That was the draftee \nportion that was added to the Army. Each section of the military had \nthat in days gone by. But they were temporary people. They were \ndrafted. They were not involved in a citizen-soldier-citizen military \nconcept.\n  When we evolved into this picture that we are in right now, we \ndeveloped recruiting techniques to recruit people.\n  The Senator from West Virginia mentions the police of West Virginia. \nI am sure the same thing happens in almost every State in the Union. \nThe police are encouraged to join the National Guard and the Reserve so \nthey can be part of the military police forces as they are deployed. \nThey may even have expertise that they got in the military services \nbefore they became policemen. And they agreed to come back and fulfill \nthat same expertise as a member of the service when their unit was \ndeployed. The Reserve and Guard units are called up because they have \nexpertise in particular areas. They are part of a function that is \nincluded in the total force.\n  The problem isn't the duration of the deployment; it is the frequency \nof the deployments, as far as I am concerned.\n  The Senator from Hawaii will recall that he and I went to Prince \nSultan several years ago and talked to the pilots who were not \nreenlisting. This was occurring during the Clinton administration. They \nwere not reenlisting because they had been deployed to Italy; they had \nbeen deployed to Bosnia; they had been deployed to fly what we call the \n``continuous air patrol''--the cap over Iraq. Once they finished the \ncap over Iraq, they were back in Bosnia again or they were deployed to \ndo some special activities in the Korean area.\n  Several times when forces were built up as tensions increased, we \ndeployed some forces. They were brought back later. But it wasn't the \nduration of any one of the deployments, in my judgment; it was the \nfrequency of several deployments.\n  I remember talking to one pilot who was not going to reenlist because \nhe had been away from his family I think 10 months out of the year.\n  This was something that was just not contemplated by the total force, \nwhether they were Regular or Guard or Reserve. It is not just the Guard \nand Reserve. It is the total force in terms of the number of \ndeployments and the length and duration of the rotations that are \ntaking place. Those I think have to be studied, and they have to be \nstudied very carefully to determine where we are going.\n  Unfortunately, I must disagree with my friend from West Virginia. If \nwe followed his suggestion, we would put down just a blanket rule \nconcerning the time of the deployment period or the number of \ndeployments in any 360-day period. And this would be not more than one.\n\n[[Page S9374]]\n\n  President Clinton could not have fought in Bosnia and Kosovo and \nmaintained the blockade of Iraq, as he did as Commander in Chief, under \nthis kind of a law. In fact, I do not think any Commander in Chief \ncould command our total force with that kind of a law. But what we have \nto look at is the number of times that you are deployed in any one \nperiod of your service. There are people who still enlist for a period \nof time. If they enlist in the Guard or the Reserve or the regular \nforces, I think we ought to assure them, if they are in each category, \nthere ought to be a different standard. In the regular services, those \nare 365-day-a-year deployments, period.\n  This concept of applying this policy only to the Reserve component, I \nthink--and I assume by that the Senator includes the National Guard--is \nnot proper, in my judgment. We have to look at the total force and say, \nif you are a part of that force, this is what will apply to you.\n  I think there should be some distinctions between the regular \nservices and the Guard and the Reserve so that a person could make a \nchoice based on his or her circumstance as to how often and for what \nduration deployments might take place.\n  We developed, in World War II, a concept of points. Again, my friend \nfrom Hawaii and I probably are of the few people in the Senate who can \nremember that. But you got points for the number of months you were \ndeployed overseas. You might have been deployed to France or Italy or \nEngland but you built up points. As you reached the zenith on points, \nyou were eligible then to be rotated back home, back to the continental \nU.S.\n  That system is almost implied in what the Senator is raising because \nif you have been deployed more than once in a 360-day period, you could \nnot go again, I take it, until that period was exhausted. But the \nconcept of when a person should be entitled to be returned to the \ncontinental U.S., and how many times they can be deployed overseas in \nany one--we used to call them ``hitches''--enlistment period I think \nhas to be explored.\n  I have just reviewed this, and I want to find a way to raise this so \nthe Senate will understand the issues as we see them with regard to \nthis policy. We need to establish a review by people who are decidedly \ninterested in addressing the problems that Senator Byrd has outlined to \ngive us some judgment, as quickly as possible, on what we should do.\n  One of the basic questions, in my mind, is, should it be a law, or \nshould we mandate there be regulations issued that encompass certain \ncriteria that must be met by those regulations, or should we direct the \nCommander in Chief to issue an Executive order?\n  There are several ways this could be changed. I take it one of the \nquestions that should be addressed in this amendment, too, is the \nquestion of whether the rules should be the same during a period such \nas we are in now--this is a period of engagement overseas, at the \ndirection of the President, approved by the Congress, by the way, but \nit is not in response to a declaration of war. I think once we get into \na period of total war, as in terms of a declaration of war passed by \nCongress, then all bets are off. In fact, that triggers, once again, if \nthat happens, as I understand the law, the draft again. We go into \nentirely different circumstances in terms of manpower and encouraging \npeople to come. We will have to address that sometime.\n\n  Just parenthetically, I remember offering the amendment, once in my \nyouth, on the floor, to extend the draft to cover women. Maybe the \nSenators do not remember that but I did, and it was defeated. We \nthought it would be defeated but we then went ahead to defeat the \ndraft. We eliminated the draft. Once we agreed we would not draft \nwomen, we eliminated the discrimination in being able to draft men. I \nthink, should we ever get into total war again, God forbid, we will \nhave to look into the concept of a draft and how we execute it.\n  But, very clearly, what we are talking about now, being deployed for \nmore than one 360-day period--I would have been able to come back from \nChina very quickly if we only had 360 days. There were many people who \nserved overseas for more than 2 to 3 years during World War II. By the \nway, they did not build up the points that were necessary to come home \nbecause those points primarily arose, as I recall, in periods of \ncombat--at least you got greater credit while you were in combat.\n  I never had to worry about points, Mr. President. I enjoyed what I \nwas doing, and maybe I didn't want to quit flying, so I was very \npleased to stay where I was.\n  What we are trying to do is develop a policy that comprehensively \nexamines the issue of overseas deployments and analyzes any resulting \npersonnel readiness or operation tempo strains on the Active Guard and \nReserve Forces, and to apply this concept to the total force.\n  We want to examine overseas rotation policies and practices and \ndetermine how those policies--for the whole force--impact military \nreadiness, individual and unit training, the quality of life for \nmilitary service members and their families, their dependents, the \nretention of career and noncareer military service members, and the \nimpact on reenlistments of the policies that are pursued.\n  We want to specifically get some recommendations on ways to reduce \nthe burden of overseas military deployments while maintaining military \nreadiness, overseas presence, and supporting the national military \nstrategy and the ability to respond to the President's orders as \nCommander in Chief.\n  I particularly think we ought to find some way to recognize that \nthere has to be times when the Commander in Chief has the right to \nobtain the forces that he and his military advisers believe are \nnecessary to maintain our national defense.\n  Again, parenthetically, I am reading a novel now. I believe I told \nSenator Byrd and others about it. It is about the Revolutionary War. \nDuring that period, the Washington Army was a national army but there \nstill was not a national government and they did not have permanent \nenlistments. They had enlistments for periods of days or weeks or \nmonths. Often Washington found he did not have the forces in one week \nthat he had the week before, and he had to wait until he was augmented \nby further forces that came to him from the State militias.\n  What are the State militias today? They are the National Guards. Our \nhistory of militias in the United States has given us the National \nGuards.\n  This amendment offered by Senator Byrd really applies to the National \nGuard, too. The National Guard has another commander in chief, unless \nthey are, in fact, mobilized by the President; and that is the Governor \nof each State. It is only when they are mobilized that they would come \nunder this proposal of Senator Byrd.\n  What I am saying is, we have many problems out there that have now \nbeen perceived because of the multiple deployments of our forces in the \nlast 10 to 12 years. One of them became apparent to me as I talked to \nmilitary people in my home State of Alaska; that is, we now have, in \nmany instances, couples who are both in the military. Sometimes they \nare actually in different units, at different bases, but they are \nmarried and they have families. We have the problem of units being \ndeployed and finding that both parents might be deployed at the same \ntime, with minor children involved. That is something that ought to be \nlooked at. We ought to have some limits on overseas deployment, period.\n  Now, for instance, I believe about half of our marines today are in \nOkinawa. They are stationed there almost permanently. The Marines have \nfewer married people, I understand, but they do have some problems with \nregard to family deployments, and I think that concept ought to be \nlooked at.\n  We ought to look at the question of unaccompanied tours, the reverse \nside of that. How long should the marines or any of these individuals \nbe stationed overseas when they are not accompanied by their spouse or \ntheir families?\n  I distinctly remember the time Senator Hollings and I were asked to \ngo to Europe by Senator Stennis. We went to study a problem that was \ncoming because in those days, this is back in the 1970s, we had \nunaccompanied tours in terms of our basic force assigned to the \nprotection of Europe and NATO. When these young people got a leave, \nthey came home. They got married. And pretty soon the wives and younger \nchildren would follow the father, and they\n\n[[Page S9375]]\n\nwere living in these really sad circumstances.\n  Senator Hollings and I went to what we called a walkup, cold-water \nflat in Germany, where a young woman and her children were living. They \nhad one little burner, and they had cold water. This young woman had to \ncare for those children, and the husband was not allowed any funds for \nthat deployment because he was unaccompanied. They had to literally \nlive off the local economy and somehow survive.\n  I have to tell you, these young people, who were then draftees still \ngoing to Germany, weren't very well paid at all. They had a tough life. \nI still give much credit to Senator John Stennis for what he did for \nthe military people because we followed through on every single issue \nhe raised. And one by one we tried to solve the question of the quality \nof life of these young people. We increased the rotation with families. \nWe increased the allowances for housing and various other quality-of-\nlife items. Senator Stennis rightly has been credited as one of those \nwho brought about a great deal of that change.\n  This is another change, however. This is a change of a rapid number \nof deployments on various issues where we have been involved--Somalia, \nHaiti, Kosovo, Bosnia, Afghanistan, and Iraq. They all happened during \nour watch. And in many instances they involved the same people.\n  I congratulate Senator Byrd for raising the issue, but I respectfully \nsay his amendment is not the way to do it. I didn't see the Senator's \namendment until just a few minutes ago. I am drafting an amendment \nwhich I will offer to the Senator's amendment.\n  There is a great deal of interest in what is going on. I have just \nbeen notified that the Enlisted Association of the National Guard, the \nReserve Officers Association, and the National Guard association has \nasked me to oppose the Senator's amendment. We believe Senator Byrd has \ngood intentions but that the way this is done, if this would become \nlaw, would be too abrupt and would not really alleviate the pressures. \nWe believe there should be much more consideration going into how these \nlimitations on deployment will be brought about. We particularly do not \nwant to take the risk that passing a very strict limitation on either \nthe number of deployments or the time for the deployments would have on \nour national security.\n  We are about ready to enter into another deployment. We all know the \nCommander in Chief has decided that some of our forces will go to \nLiberia. This again is going to raise the issue. But we have tried to \ndeal with some of these issues by increasing compensation, by doing the \nthings we think we should do to ease the burden on National Guard and \nReserve personnel when they serve and to increase the amount they get \ntowards credit for retirement and for promotion and for an increase in \neligibility for pay.\n  I do think we are dealing with something that everyone is talking \nabout restructuring and everybody is talking about revamping the \npolicies. Secretary Rumsfeld has told us he intends to issue a draft of \na plan for a sweeping restructuring of the 900,000 National Guard and \nReserve forces. He wants to deal with the question in a way that would \nbring about a reduction in the need for calling up large numbers of \nreservists in a war and do away with the concept in some instances.\n  He considered it to be, according to the clipping I have just \nreceived, a matter of utmost urgency. I believe it is of utmost \nurgency, too. I would like the opportunity to review the plans the \nSecretary wants to put into effect. I think if they are plans that \nwould be counter to the goals we currently are trying to achieve, we \nshould find a way to work together.\n  The Secretary issued a statement on July 9. I ask unanimous consent \nthat it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 2003.\n     Memorandum for Secretaries of the Military Departments, \n         Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Under \n         Secretaries of Defense.\n     Subject: Rebalancing forces.\n\n       The balance of capabilities in the Active and Reserve \n     components today is not the best for the future. We need to \n     promote judicious and prudent use of the Reserve components \n     with force rebalancing initiatives that reduce strain through \n     the efficient application of manpower and technological \n     solutions based on a disciplined force requirements process.\n       To that end there are three principal objectives that I \n     want to achieve. They are:\n       Structure active and reserve forces to reduce the need for \n     involuntary mobilization of the Guard and Reserve. Eliminate \n     the need for involuntary mobilization during the first 15 \n     days of a rapid response operation (or for any alerts to \n     mobilize prior to the operation). Structure forces in order \n     to limit involuntary mobilization to not more than one year \n     every 6 years.\n       Establish a more rigorous process for reviewing joint \n     requirements, which ensures that force structure is designed \n     appropriately and which validates requests for forces in time \n     to provide timely notice of mobilization.\n       Make the mobilization and demobilization process more \n     efficient. When Reservists are used, ensure that they are \n     given meaningful work and work for which alternative manpower \n     is not readily available. Retain on active duty only as long \n     as absolutely necessary.\n       I consider this a matter of the utmost urgency. I expect \n     each of you to tailor the actions in the attachment to your \n     specific organization and report back to USD (P) by memo on \n     your assessment and plan for implementation NLT July 31, \n     2003. Follow up actions may be reviewed at a future SROC as \n     necessary.\n                                                  Donald Rumsfeld.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. It reads:\n\n     . . . there are three principal objectives that I want to \n     achieve. They are:\n       Structure active and reserve forces to reduce the need for \n     involuntary mobilization of the Guard and Reserves. Eliminate \n     the need for involuntary mobilization during the first 15 \n     days of a rapid response operation (or for any alerts to \n     mobilize prior to the operation). Structure forces in order \n     to limit involuntary mobilization to not more than one every \n     6 years.\n       Establish a more rigorous process for reviewing joint \n     requirements.\n\n  I am just picking portions of this statement. It will be in the \nRecord.\n\n       Make the mobilization and demobilization process more \n     efficient.\n\n  We agree with that. We ought to agree that there should be a review \nof that. I hope, however, the Secretary also would undertake some \nreview of the impact of what he is talking about in terms of looking at \nwhat it will do to our enlistment rates, our retention rates and, in \nparticular, into the viewpoints of the individual Governors who, after \nall, have a basic responsibility for the National Guard itself.\n  I would like to introduce the amendment. I don't have it ready.\n  Does Senator Inouye have any comment on this? I need to get the draft \nof the amendment. Would the Senator wish me to yield the floor?\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I just want to say I support my chairman \non this matter. I congratulate Senator Byrd for bringing this to our \nattention because it is an important matter that concerns all \nAmericans. I hope this proposal by Chairman Stevens will be acceptable \nto all Members of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, while the Senate is awaiting Mr. Stevens' \namendment, let me read some excerpts from some of my constituents. I \nreferred to letters from my constituents during my comments on the \namendment which I offered. Here is a constituent who writes as follows:\n\n       I am writing to express some of my concerns with so many of \n     our West Virginia guardsmen and women deployed.\n       I am under the impression that the duty of the National \n     Guard and Air National Guard is to fill in and help the \n     active duty in times of need. Many of our West Virginia Guard \n     have been deployed for quite a while now, but it seems as \n     though very few have come home yet. The combat portion of the \n     war seems to be nearing an end, and a couple of months have \n     passed for supplies and human aid to reach the people of \n     Iraq. It seems to me that our Guards men and women have \n     fulfilled their duty and should be sent home soon. A recent \n     severe flooding in our State could use the help of service \n     men and women here at home. I feel that our West Virginia \n     Guards men and women have contributed their portion of duty \n     to this war for the time being and deserve to come home now \n     and begin rotations with other units to cover the needs of \n     our active duty overseas. I do not want to see our State \n     suffer during this time of need for their services here.\n       I am very proud of our service members within our State \n     because I believe they do an excellent job for us as a State \n     and for the Nation. They are always prepared to perform any \n     tasks they are called to do. I personally\n\n[[Page S9376]]\n\n     believe that we can use their services here at home for the \n     time being and that they have accomplished their duties \n     overseas. I wanted to explain my concerns to you about the \n     need for our Guard men and women to return home soon.\n\n  From another letter I present these excerpts:\n\n       I am writing asking for your intervention and help in the \n     swift return to the United States for my son's unit serving \n     in Iraq. His unit has had no real mission since it was sent \n     to Iraq.\n\n  He mentions his unit, which I will not mention here. He says:\n\n       They have been pumping fuel which is not fit for use in \n     trucks or planes. Most of the time, they end up pumping it on \n     the ground just to settle the dust. They have been in the \n     very dangerous sections of Iraq, north and east of Baghdad. \n     At a family support meeting, we were told that the soldiers \n     are now being rationed water--one 20-ounce bottle a day. They \n     have no way of communicating with us back home. Their food is \n     limited and they are living in extremely miserable \n     conditions. We were urged to contact you for help. Mail is \n     not getting to them and we rarely receive mail from them. \n     They are not part of the rebuilding of the country. They are \n     not involved in any constructive activity--only the danger of \n     being in convoys and the sniper fire which has been \n     reportedly happening regularly.\n       This war is not over, as our President continuously tells \n     the Nation. Our soldiers are not home. Please help. My son \n     chose to serve his country and for this I am very proud. But \n     this mission has gone into some bizarre and impossible \n     conditions for our sons and daughters. Please help bring them \n     home soon.\n\n  Another letter is as follows, and I will excerpt certain paragraphs:\n\n       As you are aware from my last letter that these men have \n     been deployed for quite a long time, they were gone for a \n     year with the last deployment, as well as State duty for \n     floods and now this deployment. For this deployment, these \n     men have been deployed since February of this year, and here \n     we are already in the middle of May. They were sent overseas \n     without any real kind of indication as to when they will \n     return home. I have gotten some form of answer [from a \n     certain office in the service] that the current policy is \n     for the men to be deployed for 6 months overseas. However, \n     that is not any guarantee either. We are still looking at \n     2 years of deployment for these men. I just find it so \n     hard to believe that there is no one out there that can \n     help get these men home before that timeframe. I don't \n     understand why it can't be a total of 6 months.\n       There are many family members, including mothers and \n     fathers, of these soldiers who would be very grateful to you \n     if you can make this happen for us.\n\n  Another letter:\n\n       On December 1, 2002, my husband [she writes his name, which \n     I shall not divulge] was deployed for the war in Iraq, and he \n     was told that he would return to continue in his normal \n     career when the war was over. Since then, he has been \n     scheduled to return to the United States on five occasions.\n\n  She gives the dates.\n\n       He is still in Germany. He is having to pay for his meals \n     and a hotel room, while awaiting a flight somewhere in \n     Africa, as directed by his commander, although there are no \n     legal or valid orders to do so. As of today, my husband has \n     been deployed, mobilized, 200 days. His orders state his \n     deployment is not to exceed 179 days. . . . My husband is a \n     West Virginia National Guard soldier who has been deployed \n     over 6 months, who by regulation should have been redeployed \n     to his home station before being assigned to a new theater, \n     as stated in his orders. . . . Morale is at an all-time low \n     for my husband, myself, and our family, and all the soldiers \n     and families I have spoken to.\n       Anything you could do to make this situation right would be \n     so greatly appreciated than I could possibly let you know. \n     Please help me get my soldier home.\n\n  It was signed by his wife.\n  Mr. President, I will not go further in reading letters, but I have \nmany of them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is a very complex issue.\n  I wish to remind the Senate that in this bill, we have added $2 \nmillion for employer support for Guard and Reserve to help address \nproblems with recent deployments. I was just informed there was a Rand \nstudy of deployments. The authors looked at the issue in the wake of \nthe high rate of military deployments through the nineties, and the \nprospect that deployment will rise even more.\n  The authors found, paraphrasing part of this report, that \nreenlistment was higher among members who deployed compared with those \nwho did not, and sizable increases in deployment all appeared unlikely \nto reduce reenlistment rates. Research suggested past deployment \ninfluences current reenlistment behavior because it enables members to \nlearn about their preferences of deployment and about its frequency and \nduration, which may revise members' previously held, more naive \nexpectations.\n  I have had some letters similar to what Senator Byrd has just read. I \ndo think there are individual problems, and that is our job as Members \nof the Congress, this body in particular, to look into those and try to \nremedy them and see they do not happen again. I again commend the \nSenator for addressing the problem.\n  There are existing provisions of the United States Code, specifically \nsections 12301, 12302, and 12304, that detail the varying levels of \nmobilization, the number of forces the President can call up and the \namount of time those forces can be activated and actions required with \nrespect to Congress.\n  There is no question there is already a law concerning this \nsituation, and by law the President of the United States has the \nauthority to deploy members of the Guard and Reserve overseas as \nappropriate and within the context of the laws I just mentioned.\n  This amendment would obviously change those laws, and if nothing \nelse, before we change those laws, we should give the legislative \ncommittees, the Armed Services Committee, the opportunity to look at \nthe subject. I think their review should be based upon a review of \npeople with competence who have had experience in the problem of \nassisting the Commander in Chief to deal with the Reserve components of \nour military.\n  I am told the standard rotation is a deployment of 180 days. Those \ndeployment days do not include preparation or recovery time, and \ntypically the units may be mobilized for 230 days in order to complete \nthe 180-day deployment. This would put a restriction on that past \npolicy as it has been carried out.\n  We should have some in-depth review of the relationships of these \npolicies of rotation, deployment, and mobilization days, as well as the \nimpact on families and upon their employers, as the Senator has \nmentioned.\n  Without question, employers are affected and without question small \ncities and towns, such as exist in my State and I know exist in West \nVirginia, are impaired if these durations are for too long.\n  Clearly, we have come through a period which now I think we ought to \nreview a little bit, and I will speak later today about the reliance of \nthe Department of Defense on supplemental appropriations for \ncontingency and peacekeeping operations in the past two decades. That \nis something that has to be addressed, and the Senator from Nevada \naddressed it earlier today, and I will discuss those.\n  For now, though, again coming back to this basic problem of this \namendment, do you think we can say the Secretary of Defense has already \nissued a statement of intent to devise a plan to deal with a portion of \nthese problems? There is no question we have a difficult future to deal \nwith because we still have forces in Kosovo; we still have forces in \nHaiti; we still have forces in Bosnia; we still have forces in Korea; \nwe still have forces in Okinawa; we still have forces in Diego Garcia; \nwe have forces at King Sultan Airfield in Saudi Arabia.\n\n  The Senator from Hawaii and I represent two areas that have what they \ncall forward-deployed forces. I say to the Senator from West Virginia, \noften when we have forces deployed from Alaska and Hawaii to go \noverseas, we then get replacements who are really people who have been \ncalled up, Guard and Reserve units, to come to our forward-deployed \nareas to fill in those spots. They are not considered deployed \noverseas. If they were from West Virginia, they would be away from West \nVirginia for a substantial period of time. The Senator's amendment \nwould not cover those people.\n  In terms of review, I hope, if we are successful in establishing a \ncommission to bring this about, that there will be a basic review of \nthe overall concept of deployment, whether it is overseas or otherwise, \nwhen it takes members of the armed services away from their home duty \nstation and their families and particularly those who have multiple \nfamily members of the military who could be affected by deployment at \nthe same time.\n\n[[Page S9377]]\n\n  One of the difficulties I have is now looking at Africa and what is \ngoing to happen in Africa. We have had repeated demands for the \nPresident to deploy forces there, increased demand to look at more than \none nation that is going through a period of rebellion and riotous \nconduct. I think that may be one of the worst deployment problems we \nwill have in the future, is to find forces to undertake those \nobjectives, fulfill the objectives of the Commander in Chief's orders \nif we are at the same time still in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Korea, Kosovo, \nand Iraq.\n  It is mind-boggling, to say the least, to deal with the concept of \ndeployment at the present time, the requirements overseas to maintain \nthe policies of the United States.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. The distinguished Senator speaks of our forces being \ndeployed in various and sundry continents, countries, and climes. Are \nthese guardsmen and reservists whom the Senator is talking about?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Under the total force concept, there could be National \nGuardsmen and Reserve in any of the units deployed overseas.\n  Mr. BYRD. He speaks of Kosovo. Are those National Guardsmen and \nReserve deployed there?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I do not know the current component, Mr. President, but \nwe did see some reservists and Guard people in Kosovo when we were \nthere. We visited Fort Bonnsteel. We saw them in Bosnia, and we saw \nthem in Afghanistan. I am specifically told the National Guard \ncurrently has a mission in Bosnia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Are they limited to 6 months?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Currently, I believe there is a 6-month deployment \nlimit, but they do not charge against that deployment period the time \nnecessary to get them ready to go over, or the time they use in \ndemobilization when they get back.\n  Mr. BYRD. But the time there, are they limited to 6 months?\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. BYRD. Then why shouldn't the people in the hot sands of Saudi \nArabia, Kuwait, and Iraq be likewise?\n  Mr. STEVENS. They are. I just read that law. They are subject to the \nsame law. I am told the standard rotation period is 180 days. Those \ndays do not include any preparation or recovery time. The units are \ntypically mobilized for 230 days or more to complete the 180-day \nrequirement, but it applies to all forces. It does apply to our forces \nin Iraq, Afghanistan, Kosovo--they are all subject to coming back after \n180 days.\n  Mr. BYRD. Is the Senator aware of any complaints from his National \nGuard in Alaska or other Reserve units there that they are being held \nlonger than the 180 days and being redeployed for a longer period?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator used the word ``redeployment,'' which is \nanother matter. Deployment is limited to 180 days. There is currently \nno limit on the number of deployments, as I understand it. The problem \nthat I and the Senator from Hawaii discussed with various members of \nthe armed services Regular Guard and Reserve has been the problem of \nsuccessive deployments. Active duty tours are limited to 180 days under \nmost circumstances when they are not considered to be a home station, \nsuch as Korea and Okinawa.\n  For the deployment into these areas, as I understand it, like the \nBalkans, Afghanistan, or Iraq, the limitation on the deployment is 180 \ndays, but there is no limitation on the number of rotations that one \ncould take to another place overseas when they are brought back.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am trying to get some predictability worked into the \nequation. That is the reason I have offered this amendment. I am \ngetting these letters from the men and women from West Virginia who are \nin Iraq. They want to come home. They think they have served the time \nthat was indicated to them they would serve and yet they are serving \nlonger.\n  Mr. REID. Will the distinguished Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Do I have the floor, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Yes, I am glad to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding this amendment does two things. I \nwonder if the Senator from West Virginia would indicate if my \nunderstanding of the amendment is correct. First, that Guard and \nReserve Forces could be deployed for no longer than 180 days. That is 6 \nmonths, is that right?\n  Mr. BYRD. Right.\n  Mr. REID. And the second part of the amendment says they cannot be \ndeployed twice during a 1-year period of time, is that right?\n  Mr. BYRD. In essence, the Senator is precisely correct.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from West Virginia that the people of \nNevada are like the people of West Virginia. We get inquiries all the \ntime about when their sons or daughters are going to be able to come \nhome. The Senator from Alaska said they not only are overseas for a \nlong period of time but they have training outside the State of Nevada \ngetting ready to go for long periods of time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. So I hope my colleagues will listen very closely to this \ndebate and approve the amendment of the Senator from West Virginia. It \nis very simple. If someone is a guard or reservist, they will be \ndeployed no more than 180 days, and if they are a guard or reservist \nthey cannot be deployed overseas twice in any 1-year period of time?\n  Mr. BYRD. They are entitled to know. They are employed and they are \nentitled to have their expectations met. Here we are with our men and \nwomen in Iraq. They are there like sitting ducks. It is like a shooting \ngallery. They are in an area I am sure we would find very difficult to \nlive in. We will be talking more about reasons why they were told they \nwere going and about the problems with certain intelligence that had an \nimpression, I am sure, a persuasive impression on some of the Members \nof Congress who voted to give this President the power to send our men \nand women into harm's way, but we will save that for another day.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. BYRD. What I am trying to do is make it possible for these men \nand women who are in the Guard and Reserve units to return home to \ntheir children, their families, their wives, their mothers, their \nfathers, their jobs, their communities. Communities have been hit hard \nin this country. Communities have been hit hard in West Virginia. These \nmen and women answered the call. They have served well. They \nhave demonstrated great courage, bravery, and patriotism. Why should we \nnot keep our word to these people? Why should we not be up front with \nthem?\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. One of the concerns I have and the reason we need some \ndefinition for the obligations of these men and women in the Guard and \nReserve is that we are having trouble in Nevada recruiting new people \nfor the Guard and Reserve. These weekend soldiers are becoming year-\nlong soldiers and we in Nevada, I think, are no different than any \nother State. I believe we need a definite period of time they can be \nobligated to go overseas and how many times they have to go overseas, \nare obligated to go overseas, or we are not going to get people to join \nthe Guard and Reserve.\n  Will the Senator agree with that statement?\n  Mr. BYRD. I agree with that statement, and I think the administration \nought to tell these people how long they are going to stay over there. \nThey are not told they are going to be over there just 6 months. They \nare not told they will be there 9 months or a year. This administration \nhas failed to tell our people, who are put in harm's way by this \nadministration's policy of preemptive strikes, what this administration \nintends. Congress has not been told how long these people are going to \nbe there, what are the costs.\n  We hear every day--the President spoke on the Abraham Lincoln with a \nsign, a banner, fluttering overhead, ``mission accomplished.'' The \nmission has not been accomplished. What was the mission? I am not sure \nwe know what the mission was.\n\n[[Page S9378]]\n\n  I appreciate the statements and the questions by the Senator from \nNevada. I appreciate also the words of the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska. He is a very reasonable man and a reasonable legislator.\n  We talk about a study, but we study things to death around here. We \nneed to act, and that is what I am trying to do. I am trying to bring \nsome succor, comfort, relief, and satisfaction to the families of our \nGuard and reservists who are waiting the return of those men and women.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. There may be some misunderstanding in the minds of those \nwho have been called up, or the dependents of those who have been \ncalled up, concerning existing law. The existing law does limit the \ndeployment for overseas to 180 days. They must be rotated in that \nperiod of time. As I have said, it takes 230 days to complete that \nbecause of the time to call them up. They have to give them notice. \nThey report. They then are put into units and then they are sent \noverseas.\n  When they come back, they come into the units where they are going to \nbe really demobilized and it takes some time then, too. I do not think \nwe have a disagreement with the Senator from West Virginia about the \nneed to ease the pressure on these continuing forces caused by the \nconcept of total force, but there seems to be one misunderstanding. It \nis the unit that is deployed for the 180 days--in some instances \nmembers are deployed individually to fill in units. They would be \nsubject to the same limitation, but the basic concept of the law deals \nwith being able to deploy members of the Guard and Reserve as \nappropriate within the context of the law I have mentioned.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1255 to Amendment No. 1244\n\n  Mr. President, I have my amendment, which I send to the desk, and I \nwill give a copy to my friend from West Virginia. I submit this \namendment on behalf of myself and the Senator from Hawaii as a \nbipartisan approach to deal with the issues and try to bring them \ntogether.\n  The Secretary of Defense has a group going ahead on this. We \nobviously believe the Congress should be involved in some way. I ask \nthat that amendment be in order to be called up at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I apologize. I am offering this amendment in the second \ndegree to the Byrd amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator wants his amendment to be a \nsecond-degree amendment, is that correct?\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is correct, as an amendment to the Byrd amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will withhold while we evaluate the \namendment and make the necessary changes.\n  The amendment is being revised to be a second-degree amendment to the \nByrd amendment. Is that the Senator's intent?\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is my intention.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for himself and Mr. \n     Inouye, proposes an amendment numbered 1255 to amendment No. \n     1244.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a commission to study overseas deployments)\n\n       Strike all after the word sec. and insert:\n       8124 (a) There is established a Commission on Overseas \n     Deployments.\n       (b)(1) The Commission shall be composed of 11 members of \n     whom--\n       (A) three shall be appointed the President;\n       (B) two shall be appointed by the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives;\n       (C) two shall be appointed by the Majority Leader of the \n     Senate, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense;\n       (D) two shall be appointed by the Minority Leader of the \n     Senate, in consultation with any person who served as \n     Secretary of Defense pursuant to an appointment to such \n     position by President Jimmy Carter or President Bill Clinton; \n     and\n       (E) two shall be appointed by the Minority Leader of the \n     House of Representatives.\n       (2) Members shall be appointed for the life of the \n     Commission. Any vacancy in the Commission shall not affect \n     its powers, but shall be filled in the same manner as the \n     original appointment.\n       (3) The Commission shall meet at the call of the Chairman. \n     The Commission shall hold its first meeting not later than 30 \n     days after the date on which all members of the Commission \n     have been appointed.\n       (4) A majority of the members of the Commission shall \n     constitute a quorum, but a lesser number of members may hold \n     hearings.\n       (5) The Commission shall select a Chairman and Vice \n     Chairman from among its members.\n       (c) The Commission shall--\n       (1) conduct a comprehensive examination of overseas \n     deployments of members of the Armed Forces, and analyze the \n     resulting adverse effects on personnel, readiness, and \n     operation tempos on members of the active and reserve \n     components of the Armed Forces;\n       (2) examine current overseas rotation policies and \n     practices for active and reserve component forces and how \n     those policies and practices affect military readiness, unit \n     and individual training, quality-of-life for members and \n     their dependents, and retention of career and noncareer \n     members.\n       (d)(1) Not later than 120 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Commission shall submit to the \n     congressional defense committees a report on the results of \n     the examination and analysis under subsection (c).\n       (2) The report shall include recommendations on ways to \n     reduce the burden of overseas deployments while maintaining \n     readiness, overseas presence, and support for the National \n     Military Strategy.\n       (3) The report and recommendations shall also address the \n     overall size, structure, and sufficiency of the Armed Forces \n     in relation to current requirements for overseas deployments \n     and presence, the adequacy of the current balance and mix of \n     active and reserve component forces, and the adequacy of the \n     current balance and mix of critical, high-demand low-density \n     units the rotation and assignment of members of the Armed \n     Forces married to each other, limitations on the periods of \n     overseas tours, and unaccompanied tours in hardship \n     locations.\n       (e) The Commission shall consult with the congressional \n     defense committees in carrying out its duties under this \n     section.\n       (f) The Commission shall terminate 90 days after the \n     submission of the report under subsection (d).\n       (g) Of the amount appropriated by title II under the \n     heading ``Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide'', up to \n     $3,000,000 may be used for carrying out this section.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CHAFEE). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If I could explain this proposal, it would create a \ncommission on overseas deployments to have 11 members: 3 appointed by \nthe President, 2 appointed by the Speaker, 2 appointed by the minority \nleader of the House, 2 appointed by the majority leader of the Senate, \nand 2 by the minority leader of the Senate. They would be appointed the \nterm of the commission. We ask for the commission to hold its first \nmeeting not later than 30 days after they have been appointed. They \nhave the duty to give us a report within 120 days after enactment of \nthe act--obviously, that would be a period of 90 days for their basic \nwork--and they would recommend ways to reduce the burden of overseas \ndeployments while maintaining readiness, overseas presence, and support \nof the national military strategy.\n  The report and recommendations shall address the overall side, \nstructure, and sufficiency of the Armed Forces in relation to current \nrequirements for overseas deployment and presence, and the adequacy of \nthe current balance and mix of Active and Reserve component forces, and \nthe adequacy of the current balance and mix of critical, high-demand \nlow-density units the rotation and assignment of members of the Armed \nForces married to each other, limitations on the periods for overseas \ntours and unaccompanied tours and hardship locations.\n  I believe this commission would have a duty to give us some basic \ninformation to address the problem raised by the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Incidentally, I now have the numbers the Senator from West Virginia \nasked. There were Reserve and Guard organizations deployed. They were \nin Operation Noble Eagle, which was Afghanistan, Kosovo, Iraqi crisis, \nBosnia, Haiti, Somalia, Kuwait, and Iraq. We have had a sizable \ndeployment of Guard and Reserve personnel--the Reserve component is \nwhat they refer to--in all of those instances. I do have the numbers \nand the duration.\n  As I indicated, the rotation schedule was that which I mentioned, \nwhich is 180 days for deployment overseas. I urge the Senator from West \nVirginia to consider supporting the amendment we have offered to his \namendment to assure we have the right mix of Active-Duty and Reserve \ncomponents and that\n\n[[Page S9379]]\n\nwe devise means to reduce our forces with the least disruption on the \nlives of the service members involved.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. The distinguished Senator said the reservists should be \ndeployed for 180 days.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is the current law.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is what my amendment says.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Not quite. We do not interpret it that way. It goes \nfurther than existing law.\n  Existing law says the units can be deployed for no more than 180 days \nbut under the current law, the time and preparing for that deployment \nand the time after that deployment to be redeployed, say, another place \nsuch as england or somewhere, to be put together so they can be brought \nhome, those times don't count against the 180 days.\n  The Senator's amendment adds a dimension not included in existing \nlaw, not more than one deployment in any 360-day period.\n  Mr. BYRD. Is there a final deadline for this commission to report?\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. One hundred and twenty days from enactment of the basic \nappropriations bills, yes, sir.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am afraid our guards men and women will have to serve a \nlong time. Many of them have already been serving a long time, in their \nestimation. They will have to serve a much longer time if they wait the \nappointment of the commission and then the rendering by that \ncommission. I see its first meeting will not be later than 30 days \nafter the date on which all members of the commission have been \nappointed.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is correct in many ways. The difficulty is \nthe current practice is 180 days but none of these people, to my \nknowledge, have been over there 180 days yet. This operation has not \nbeen ongoing for 180 days. There may, however, be people deployed \npreviously in this current timeframe who were deployed to one place, \nbrought home, and then deployed again in the same year. That is true. \nThat is what the Secretary of Defense has said he is trying to address. \nThat is what this commission is trying to address, some way to provide \nsome guidelines so members of the Active-Duty and Reserve components \ncan determine how long they will be deployed away from their homes in \nany period.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator gave me this amendment, a 4-page amendment but \npage 3 is missing.\n  I thank the Senator. The third page which was missing is the page \nthat had on it the provision:\n\n       Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Commission shall submit to the congressional defense \n     committees a report on the results of the examination and \n     analysis under subsection (c).\n\n  So that is 120 days, so that is 4 months, not later than 4 months, by \nthe time this commission is created, is established and has its first \nmeeting and then reports back to the appropriate committees. I hope \nsurely our young men and women will be home by then without any such \nreport. This is going to be a long time.\n  That is what I see with this. We need to act. We can study this to \ndeath. This is kind of like questioning Secretary Rumsfeld. When I \nasked him a question in the Armed Services Committee the other day, my \nquestion was, How much has our country been spending on the average per \nmonth in Iraq?\n  And he says to me: Well, I'm sorry, Senator, we don't have that \ninformation at hand. We will get it for you. We don't have that \ninformation at hand.\n\n  I asked, How much have we been spending per month in Afghanistan? I \ngot the same answer. Senator, we don't have that information. We will \nbe glad to get it for you.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. In a moment, if I may.\n  I am referring to the cavalier treatment that we peons on the Armed \nServices Committee get from this great Secretary of Defense that we \nhave downtown. He says, Well, Senator, we don't have that information.\n  Here we are with the top man--the man at the Pentagon, the greatest \ndefense department in the world, the most expensive one, the one that \nhandles more money than any other defense department in the world. As a \nmatter of fact, we are spending more money each year than all of the \nother 18 NATO nations combined, plus the six remaining rogue nations, \nplus China, plus Russia. That is almost half of the total moneys that \nthe world spends for defense. We are treated like children by this \nSecretary of Defense: Well, Senator we don't have that information.\n  It would seem to me that would be elemental. It would seem to me that \na Secretary of Defense would know how much money we spend on national \ndefense; that he would know how much money we are spending on average \nin Iraq per month. He would know that. He should know that would be one \nof the first questions he would be asked by the Armed Services \nCommittee when he comes before it. I would think so. You are the \nSecretary of Defense. How much are we spending in Iraq monthly? Then to \nhave to turn and say, Well, Senator, I don't have that information. It \nwould take us a while to assemble it. That is the way it is here. It is \ngoing to take quite a while.\n  It is going to take quite a while to get this commission started, if \nwe follow the recommendations of the distinguished Senator from Alaska. \nI ascribe to him a far greater degree of appreciation for what we are \ndoing and a far greater degree of understanding of the need for us to \nact than I do some of the people downtown. But here we are being asked \nfor a study.\n  What I am saying is that way of dealing with Members of Congress and \ncommittees, saying, Well, we don't have that information; we will get \nit for you--by the time we get that information, the time is long past \nfor the committee to ask the next question, if we need the answer to \nthe first question in order to ask the second question. We are going to \nhave to wait to be able to ask the second question. That is a cavalier \nway of handling people. I have been around here 50 years. I am on to \nthat kind of game.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Not yet. I am not talking about the Senator. I am talking \nabout our distinguished Secretary of Defense and the way he handles us \nchildren on the Armed Services Committee.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would like to tell the Senate about the way the last \nadministration treated this Senate.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator can wait a minute.\n  Mr. President, I have the floor. I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Now I yield to the Senator for whatever he wishes to say.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I think the Senator from West Virginia is \nwell aware of what the last administration did. They just spent money. \nThey didn't even tell us where they were taking it from. Twice in 1999, \nwe had to have supplementals. They didn't even tell us in the \nsupplementals what funds they used. They deployed forces, and they took \nmoney from the accounts we had already appropriated for other purposes. \nEvery time President Clinton deployed forces, that is what he did.\n  This time, this President came and asked for a supplemental. He has \nmoney he is spending, but he cannot tell us precisely day by day what \nthey are spending. They asked for money in advance. They got money in \nadvance.\n  He did not disturb the individual accounts of the various services. \nHe did not cause the chaos in terms of defense that the last \nadministration did.\n  I will defend my friend, this Secretary of Defense. If the Senator \nwants to defend the last Secretary of Defense, I will let him do it. \nBut I know what happened. In 1998, 1999, and 2000--we had 2 \nsupplementals in 1999. That represented money that was used under the \nfood and farm act concept of ancient law of the United States. The \nPresident took money from other accounts and just spent it. He didn't \nask us for it. He didn't tell us what he was using it for. He never \nwould account for it. Even when he asked for a supplemental, he didn't \ntell us what unit he took it from. We had to look for the unit and put \nthe money back where it belonged.\n  This administration is doing it right. When they ask for money in \nadvance, they are spending money and accounting for it as they account \nfor their bills normally in their normal reports. But they did not take \nmoney from the individual units.\n  They took money from the Air Force and Army and spent it somewhere \nelse without telling anybody.\n\n[[Page S9380]]\n\n  You want to get me excited about something, I will get excited about \nthe way the last administration handled the Department of Defense. They \ndecreased funding and used the money in a manner totally unheard of in \nthe history of the United States. It would have ruined the military had \nit not been for the concept of the consolidated force structure. The \nmilitary saved itself by using Reserve and Guard units in the proper \nway.\n  But their funding came from moneys that were for entirely different \npurposes. I believe they took money from the procurement account from \ntime to time. Normally, they took the operation and maintenance money. \nThat is the steaming money. That is money for flying hours. That is \nmoney for drilling. That is money for equipment. That is money for \nmunitions. They just depleted money, and deployed forces to Bosnia and \nKosovo without asking at all. There was no advance request. There was \nno notice given.\n  If the Senator wants to get excited about the way funding is being \nused now, they are using the funds which they asked Congress for. I was \nthe one who presented the bill. Congress approved it. The President \nsigned the law. And the Secretary of Defense has the right to use that \nmoney according to laws that we pass. And he is following those laws, \nto the best of my knowledge.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may I say to my distinguished friend, I \ndon't worry. He can get excited as many times as he wishes. I have \nexcited many people in my time around here, before the Senator from \nAlaska came here. He can get excited all he wishes. I will be glad to \nwait while he gets excited again, if he would like.\n  He reminds me of the pharisee and the publican who went up into the \ntower. The publican said, ``Oh, Lord, I don't do what this man does. I \ndon't do as he does. I give my tithes. I give one-tenth of all I \nearn.'' And he went on to talk about his attributes. The other poor man \nin the tower said, ``Oh, Lord. Forgive me. I am a sinner.''\n  So don't point to Clinton, when the Senator talks to me--or to any \nother President. I am talking about this administration. We can't \nexcuse this administration because of something some other \nadministration may have done. The people on that side are good at that. \nMany of them are always pointing out what we did, what Clinton did, or \nwhat this one did, or what that one did. That time is past. We can't \nexcuse our own sins on the basis of the sins of others.\n  I am talking about this President, this administration, your \nadministration, your Secretary of Defense. You can stand up and defend \nhim all you wish, my friend. And I shouldn't say ``you.'' I shouldn't \nspeak in the second person under the Senate rules. Maybe I got a little \nexcited also.\n  But the Senator isn't going to run that old fish along the side of \nme. He can get excited all he wants. He is noted for his temper. Temper \nis a good thing. We all have some of it.\n  But I am saying here that when we ask questions of his friend, the \nSenator from Alaska's friend, Mr. Rumsfeld, we get treated cavalierly, \nand many times get a lecture. It is about time we get rid of that kind \nof treatment. Secretary Rumsfeld, with all due respect to him, wasn't \nelected by the American people to that job he has today. He was \nappointed to it. He was confirmed in it by this Senate. I was not \nappointed to anything.\n\n  So let's don't attempt to respond to what I hope were sincere \nquestions here by pointing to what a previous administration may have \ndone. I did not agree with everything that happened in the previous \nadministration. The supplemental requested by the Clinton \nadministration is in no way appropriate to the cost of Iraq. Bosnia and \nKosovo were minuscule in comparison to the cost of Iraq.\n  Let's talk about Iraq, and let's talk about this administration. We \nhave to deal with the problems that confront the Senate today. I am not \ngoing to ask my constituents to settle for a study. We need to act. And \nwe Senators have a duty to vote on my amendment. When we talk about a \nsupplemental, that is a way to--and I speak always with great reverence \nto my friend, Senator Stevens; and he is my friend, he is going to be \nmy friend, and I am his, but this is a way to hide costs from the \nAmerican people, huge costs that can be anticipated, and that are \ndriven by policy decisions made in this White House.\n  There is no reason for a supplemental request in this instance. \nCongress is not an ATM machine. This White House wants to be \naccountable to no one. We have a responsibility to the taxpayer to \nexercise oversight over these monies.\n  I have nothing else I wish to say at this point. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I do agree to a great extent with the \nSenator from West Virginia, except that I reiterate I am proud to \ndefend this administration. This administration asked for the money, \ntold us what it was for. As a matter of fact, in one instance, the \nPresident asked for $10 billion for the global war on terrorism as a \ncontingency fund and, together with the Senator from West Virginia, I \nhelped deny that request. The Congress asked that the administration \ndefine the costs and contingencies, and they did. And that money was \nincluded in the big supplemental we passed for defense. We asked for it \nand received the statement of what the money was to be spent for.\n  We asked them to tell us what they were going to spend the money on \nin Iraq. It was detailed. It was in the fund that was given to them.\n  Again, I defend this administration because, to their credit, they \nagreed we have rescinded in this bill $3.1 billion of that supplemental \nwe gave to the Department and took the money back and put it for other \nfunctions in the Department. Now, the last administration would have \ntaken that money and put it there, anyway. They agreed we should take \nit back, and now we are going through the process of reappropriating \nthe same money in this bill for 2004 because it is not going to be used \naccording to what they told us they were going to use it for in terms \nof the Iraq supplemental.\n  But, Mr. President, a friend in the House, watching this event, has \nsent to me a statement that was made in the House Armed Services \nCommittee on April 3 of this year by Sergeant First Class Steven Davis \nof the U.S. Army Reserve. I think it is significant to have this \ncomment at this time, and I am pleased that my friends are listening. I \nam going to read the statement word for word.\n  Sergeant First Class Steven Davis said:\n\n       Mr. Chairman, members of this distinguished subcommittee, \n     thank you for the opportunity to be here today and for \n     allowing me to be a participant in this panel.\n       My name is Sergeant First Class Steven Davis and I am a \n     Military Policeman in the Army Reserve. I have been serving \n     in the United States Army for 15 years, seven of which have \n     been in the Army Reserve. I am assigned to the Military \n     Police Port Security Detachment in Pocahontas, Iowa. I have \n     been mobilized once since I have been in the Army Reserve. I \n     was mobilized on September 23, 2001, for Operation Noble \n     Eagle, and I served one year state side in North Carolina.\n       In my experience, with both the regular Army and the Army \n     Reserve, I believe that the two are very much integrated. I \n     had positive contacts with reserve soldiers when I was on \n     active duty, and I have also had positive contact with the \n     active Army since I have been a reserve soldier. Most \n     recently during our deployment to Sunny Point, North \n     Carolina, we were directly assigned to the 597th \n     Transportation Group. From the moment we arrived, I felt as \n     though we belonged there. I remember during a welcome \n     meeting, COL Heiter, the Commander of the 597th, made it very \n     clear to everyone in the room that the members of my unit \n     would be treated as any other soldier at Sunny Point. The \n     Command emphasis set the tone for our one-year star. Our \n     forces integrated flawlessly with the existing Department of \n     Defense forces, which is what we were trained to do. We were \n     able to work together as a cohesive team, and everyone's \n     moral was high.\n       As for the question, did the recent deployment change or \n     affect the reservist's intention to continue to serve. I \n     believe the deployment made our unit stronger and more \n     willing. From month to month we go ask ourselves, are we \n     really needed?? Why are we doing this? Then September 11th \n     came and all our questions were answered. Yes, we were \n     needed, and yes, we were important. On September 12, 2001, we \n     had 24 soldiers, myself included, volunteer to go on a \n     security mission to an unknown place. The 24 volunteers left \n     for Beaumont, Texas, on September 13th, 2001. Ten days later, \n     on September 23rd, the remainder of our unit was mobilized \n     and sent to North Carolina, where we spent our tour of duty. \n     When our year was up, and we all got the word that we were \n     going home, we were told the New York unit was going to take \n     our place, but that they did not have\n\n[[Page S9381]]\n\n     enough people. Twenty-two soldiers from my unit volunteered \n     to stay with them, not for 3 or 6 months, but for another \n     year. Some of the soldiers were married and some were college \n     students. Why did they stay when they did not have to? I \n     would say it was because they knew they had a job to do, and \n     they weren't going to leave until it was finished.\n       The one problem that we encountered during our deployment \n     was medical benefits. The Army did a great job of providing \n     the coverage, and teaching the soldiers how to use the \n     coverage. However, our family members did not have the \n     advantage of having a representative available to inform \n     them. This created many headaches for the soldiers, who would \n     try to trouble shoot the problems long distance. I believe a \n     local representative, available for family members would have \n     been very helpful and would have saved the soldiers a lot of \n     time on the telephone.\n\n  I read that because it is indicative of the feeling of our young \npeople. We talked at one of our hearings to the Guard and Reserve \nmembers, and we found that as the deployments increased, enlistments \nincreased; and as deployments increased, reenlistments increased.\n  We are having complaints from some people who believe they should \nhave come home sooner, but none have been over there a year yet. None \nof them have been over there 6 months yet. Even under the current, \nexisting law, the Senator's amendment will not affect them. Well, I am \ntold some in Kuwait have been there 6 months by now, and they should be \nrotating home. But, as a practical matter, the existing law provides \nfor the deployment limitation, the existing regulations and practice \nfor rotation in deployment every 180 days.\n  However, again, I come back and ask my friend from West Virginia to \nsupport us in this effort to have this reviewed. I hope the Senator has \nread the composition of the commission we would like to create: people \nappointed by the President, people appointed by the leaders of the two \nbodies. I do believe an 11-member commission is sufficient. I envision \nthat they would call on former Secretaries of Defense and their \nassistants, former commanding officers, generals, and members of the \nGuard and Reserve from the enlisted area. So we would have a \nrepresentative group to give us their advice.\n  Respectfully, I think we need their advice on how to deal with the \ncomplex problems of dealing with rotation and deployment limitations in \nthis day of a very complex total force that our military defense units \nface today.\n  I urge my friend to reflect and let us adopt our amendment and create \nthis commission, and we will be back here in 5 months. That, I think, \nwould be sufficient to deal with this problem. And it will give us a \nforward-looking concept as far as deployment strategy, rotation \nstrategy, and benefit strategy for members of our Armed Forces.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to address the amendment \noffered by the distinguished Senator from West Virginia and the second-\ndegree amendment offered by Chairman Stevens.\n  I think we all realize the tremendous strain that the deployments, \nthe call-ups have placed on our Guard and Reserve and actually the \ncontinuing deployments place upon the active members of the military. \nThat is a well-deserved concern. We must take into account how calling \nupon our troops, whether active or reserve, puts stress on them and \ntheir families.\n  I believe very strongly that Senator Stevens has in his amendment \nadopted the appropriate approach--appointing a commission to examine \nthe overseas deployments of members of the Armed Forces, the overseas \nrotation policies and practices for Active and Reserve component \nforces, and how these policies and practices affect military readiness, \nunit and individual training, quality of life for members and their \ndependents, and retention of career and noncareer members.\n  In examining this issue, as cochairman of the National Guard caucus, \nwe sent out a request, an urgent request, for information from the \nGuard on their views on these policies. MG Richard Alexander, retired \nmajor general, president of the National Guard Association, has written \nme a letter--which I will, at the end of my remarks, ask to include in \nthe Record--noting and commending the efforts of Senator Byrd to bring \nthis issue to the forefront but saying that the National Guard \nAssociation is opposed to the amendment. Understanding the intent \nbehind the amendment, it does, unfortunately, reduce the ability of the \nPresident to utilize the National Guard and Reserve and places a large, \nunnecessary restriction on the Department of Defense.\n  He writes:\n\n       The National Guard, as part of the Total Force, shoulders \n     the burdens of our nation. Senior level members of the Office \n     of the Secretary of Defense and the Department of Defense \n     have iterated the importance of the Guard and Reserve to be \n     able to carry out this nation's will.\n\n  The members of the National Guard and Reserve with whom I am most \nfamiliar take very highly their obligation and responsibility to be \navailable when the President must mobilize them in the national \ninterest. They wish to be considered an active part of the military \nwhen we are at war. The single deployment limitation of 180 days or \nmore, for example, may unnecessarily restrict the effectiveness of the \nGuard if they are called into service.\n  They say you can only be there 6 months and then you are gone. That \nreally ties the hands of the Secretary of Defense and makes the Guard \nless likely to be called upon. In those circumstances, the missions for \nwhich our Guard members in Missouri and around the Nation train so \nassiduously may be lost.\n  The Reserve Officers Association of the United States says, in \nreference to the amendment of the Senator from West Virginia:\n\n       Although we understand the amendment is well intentioned, \n     these restrictions are not needed and such determinations are \n     best left with the Military Departments and services.\n       In today's security environment we must ensure that our \n     military commanders have flexibility to execute their mission \n     with all available forces.\n\n  Finally, the Enlisted Association of the National Guard, EANGUS, the \nexecutive director, MSG Michael Cline, Retired, writes that there is \nclearly concern about the pressures of frequent deployment on National \nGuard and Reserve members. But much more consideration needs to go into \nhow that will be accomplished. Limiting deployment of National Guard \nand Reserve members could negatively impact our national security \nduring an overseas operation.\n\n  These are the reasons that I believe the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Alaska is the preferred means of dealing with this \nquestion. Clearly, it is of concern to all of us because while we all \nrecognize and acknowledge that the National Guard and Reserves have \nbeen called upon more and more over the last several years in various \nconflicts, our citizen soldiers have answered those calls to duty with \na forbearance and spirit of service to their Nation that we all admire.\n  I will reference a book authored by a good friend, former chief of \nthe National Guard Bureau, General John Conoway, ``Call Out the \nGuard.'' He underscores the commitment of our citizen soldiers. He \nsaid:\n\n       As we saw during Desert Storm, the readiness of the \n     individual Reservists was generally high in Operation Desert \n     Storm/Shield. An amazing 99.9 percent of Army National Guard \n     personnel who were called reported for active duty. Ninety-\n     four percent were ready for deployment; the remaining 5.9 \n     percent were either waiting for initial duty training, high \n     school students, members attending officer candidate, missing \n     pantographic x-rays, or were medical personnel willing to go \n     anyway, but prevented from doing so due to critical civilian \n     jobs.\n\n  My question is, why would we want to limit or restrict those who sign \nup to serve their country and defend freedom when their country needs \nthem?\n  If you ask any guards man or woman, he or she would not stand down \nwhen his or her country needed them. Whether the defense of freedom \nmerits a two-week deployment or a 180-day deployment, our guards men \nand women stand ready to contribute to the fight. The fact is, today \nour dedicated soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines in\n\n[[Page S9382]]\n\nthe Active Duty rely on and recognize the tremendous value the National \nGuard brings to the fight and the seamless interoperability that exists \nbetween the Guard, Reserve, and Active Duty. Again, to quote from GEN \nConoway, he quotes General Charles Horner, stating:\n\n       The Guard and Reserve performed very well.\n\n  He went on further to say that he ``couldn't even tell the difference \nbetween the active, Guard, and Reserve; and that's the way it is \nsupposed to be.''\n  That is what we found wherever the National Guard has been called--\nDesert Shield, Desert Storm, Kosovo, et cetera. They have been \nexcellent members of the team. It is a validation of the total force \npolicy that ensures the National Guard and Reserves are a ready, \nrelevant, and reliable fighting force, capable of responding to any \nmission they are called upon to conduct. I fear that limiting the role \narbitrarily to a 180-day deployment would be a limitation that would \nreduce the very real direct impact and connection our Guard has with \nthe citizens of this Nation and with their obligation for our national \nsecurity.\n  Just as we saw by calling up the National Guard and Reserves from \nover 6,000 communities during Desert Storm, community support was \nassured as their loved ones marched off to defend freedom. We all want \nour service men and women to return home as soon as possible. But under \nthis circumstance, I feel the original amendment is too restrictive on \nour military services by limiting the amount of time our Guard and \nReserve can be deployed. I urge my colleagues to support the \nalternative. There is a real question here, and I commend the Senator \nfrom West Virginia for raising these concerns. But I think they should \nbe studied, as the chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee \nand the full committee has suggested.\n  I urge we support the Stevens amendment. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe letters from the National Guard Association, Reserve Officers \nAssociation of the United States, and the Enlisted Association of the \nNational Guard be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                       EANGUS,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, July 15, 2003.\n     Hon. Christopher S. ``Kit'' Bond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: EANGUS understands that Senator Byrd has \n     introduced an amendment to the FY2004 Defense Appropriations \n     bill which would prohibit excessive overseas deployments of \n     members of the Guard and Reserves. EANGUS is strongly opposed \n     to this action.\n       This amendment would limit overseas deployments to less \n     than 180 days and prohibit more than one deployment per year. \n     This legislation is too restrictive.\n       Many believe that something must be done to alleviate the \n     pressures of frequent deployments of National Guard and \n     Reserve members, but much more consideration needs to go into \n     how that will be accomplished. Limiting deployment of \n     National Guard and Reserve members could negatively impact \n     our national security during an overseas operation.\n       Thank you for your diligence and efforts on behalf of the \n     Enlisted men and women of the National Guard.\n           Respectfully,\n                                   MSG (Ret) Michael P.

Christopher ``Kit'' Bond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: It is on behalf of the men and women of \n     the National Guard Association of the United States (NGAUS), \n     I am writing to express our concern about Senator Byrd's \n     amendment limiting the involuntary call up of the National \n     Guard and Reserve component to:\n       1. A single deployment overseas of 180 days or more.\n       2. More than one deployment overseas in any 360-day period.\n       The NGAUS is opposed to this amendment. While we understand \n     the intent behind the amendment, reducing the ability of the \n     President to utilize the National Guard and Reserves places a \n     large unnecessary restriction on the Department of Defense. \n     The National Guard, as part of the Total Force, shoulders the \n     burdens of our nation. Senior level members of the Office of \n     the Secretary of Defense and the Department of Defense have \n     iterated the importance of the Guard and Reserve to be able \n     to carry out this nation's will.\n       We applaud the efforts of Senator Byrd in bringing this \n     issue to the forefront. However, while judicious utilization \n     of the Guard is prudent, the Byrd amendment is not in the \n     best interest of the National Guard.\n           Respectfully,\n                                             Richard C. Alexander,\n                              Major General (Ret), AUS, President.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I want to congratulate my \nfriend and colleague, the Senator from West Virginia, for his constancy \nin terms of ensuring to the best of his ability and the best of this \ninstitution's ability that we were going to meet our constitutional \nresponsibilities some months ago, and understanding the Constitution, \nand that the issue of making war is something that was reserved to the \nCongress of the United States, and the extraordinary service he \nprovided for our country in reminding us of our responsibilities in the \nUnited States to make a judgment and decision about sending and \ncommitting our men and women overseas in this conflict.\n  I welcomed the opportunity to join with him at that time. His \neloquence, passion, and knowledge of this institution and the history \nof the Constitution still ring in my ears from that experience. I think \nhistory will show that even though he did not at that time persuade the \nmajority of the Members of the Senate, when history evaluates that \neffort it will be one of the important contributions he has made, and \nhe has made many to this institution.\n  As we all understand, he is a person who has placed the interests of \nthis institution at the forefront of his agenda on many occasions, and \nit is a better institution and it is living up to its historic role as \nour Founding Fathers wanted it to be because of his contribution.\n  So I thank him for what he has done and particularly in terms of the \nwhole issue of policy toward Iraq. I welcomed again his comments \nearlier today. I was unable to catch all of them, but I will study them \nclosely during the evening time, and I know as we are considering the \nDefense appropriations, we will hear more from him about the issue of \nAmerican troops overseas, the National Guard and Reserve here at home--\nthe importance of them, and also about what we as a country are going \nto do in terms of funding this commitment that has been made in terms \nof Iraq as well as Afghanistan.\n  The issue of the Guard and Reserve comes to us in a very clear way \nbecause of the number of troops we have over in Iraq at the present \ntime. As the Senator knows full well, we have effectively half of all \nof the Army divisions tied up either in Iraq or Afghanistan. Eighteen \nout of the 35 or 36 combat divisions are in Iraq. So even when we talk \nto 148,000 troops, and 22 percent or 23 percent of our Army over there, \nwhen you are talking about the combat arms of the United States and the \nlocation of those service men and women, we are talking about in Iraq. \nAnd when we are talking about the Reserve and the Guard, in my State of \nMassachusetts, it is the fastest tempo that we have had, I believe, \nsince the end of World War II--13 times higher today than the average \nover the previous years.\n  I know he has spelled this out in great detail about what this has \nmeant. What we do know is that it has meant really a stronger military \nbecause of the Guard and the Reserve in my own State, having known \nthose individuals and visited those facilities and met those leaders. \nThey are as committed as any military men and women who have served in \nour country. They provide indispensable services. But as has been \npointed out, we are straining these individuals.\n\n[[Page S9383]]\n\n  Mr. President, last fall, many of us emphasized in the Senate that 9/\n11 had not nullified the long-standing basic principle that war should \nbe the last resort. We felt that America should not go to war against \nIraq unless and until all other reasonable alternatives for a peaceful \nsolution had been exhausted.\n  Then--as now--I believed that the threat posed by Saddam Hussein was \nnot serious enough or imminent enough to justify a rush to war, and \nthat we were going to war under false pretenses. Then--as now--I \nbelieved that war would distract from our broader war against terrorism \nand that we should not go to war with Iraq without the clear support of \nthe international community. Then--as now--I believed that without a \nsystematic re-examination, with dubious and even false rationalization, \nand without the informed consent of the American people, the Bush \nadministration was drastically altering our long-standing foreign \npolicy against preventive war, in order to justify its preconceived \ndetermination to invade Iraq.\n  Supporters and opponents of the war alike were enormously proud of \nthe way our troops performed in Operation Iraqi Freedom. The speed and \nsuccess of their mission demonstrated the outstanding strength of the \nNation's armed forces. As a citizen of Massachusetts and a member of \nthe Armed Services Committee in the Senate, it never ceases to amaze me \nhow far we have come in the two centuries since the embattled farmers \nat Concord Bridge fired the shot heard around the world.\n  In the past decade alone, technology has put vast changes in warfare \non fast-forward. We redefined the nature of modern warfare in the \nPersian Gulf war, we redefined it again in Afghanistan, and yet again \nin Iraq. We have by far the world's best military on the ground, on the \nsea, and in the air. It is no accident that so few paid the ultimate \nsacrifice during those 3 tumultuous weeks in March and April in Iraq.\n  It was a foregone conclusion that we would win the war. But pride \ngoes before a fall, and the all-important question now is whether we \ncan win the peace. In fact, we are at serious risk of losing it.\n  Our policy toward Iraq is adrift. Each day, our troops and their \nfamilies are paying the price. Our clear national interest in the \nemergence of a peaceful, stable, democratic Iraq is being undermined.\n  Since May 1, when President Bush announced aboard the USS Abraham \nLincoln aircraft carrier that ``major combat operations'' in Iraq had \nended, 81 more American troops have died. For the men and women of our \nArmed Forces who are dodging bullets in the streets and alleys of \nBaghdad and other parts of Iraq, the battle is far from over. President \nBush says of the attackers, ``Bring `em on.'' But how do you console a \nfamily by telling them that their son or daughter is a casualty of the \npost-war period?\n  The debate may go on for many months or even years about our \nintelligence failures before the war began. As we now know, despite the \nclaim made in the State of the Union Address, Saddam was not purchasing \nuranium from Africa to build nuclear weapons.\n  Despite all the intelligence we were shown in the months leading up \nto war, despite the additional intelligence they said was there but \ncould not be shared, we have yet to uncover any evidence that Iraq was \nstockpiling chemical or biological weapons. There was and is no \nevidence that Saddam was conspiring with al-Qaida. What was the \nimminent threat to the United States that required us to launch a \npreventive war in Iraq with very little international support? It is a \ndisgrace that the case for war seems to have been based on shoddy \nintelligence, hyped intelligence, and even false intelligence. We have \nundermined America's prestige and credibility in the world and \nundermined the trust that Americans should and must have in what their \nnation tells them. How many will doubt a future claim of danger even if \nit is real?\n  The failures of intelligence were bad enough. But the real failure of \nintelligence was our failure to understand Iraq.\n  There is no question that long before the war began, a serious issue \nwas raised about the danger of winning the war and losing the peace. In \nfact, it was one of the principal arguments against going to war.\n  Before the war began, 11 separate agencies of the United States \nGovernment worked with 280 Iraqi citizens in the State Department's so-\ncalled ``Future of Iraq'' working groups.\n  In numerous briefings, Pentagon officials assured us on the Senate \nArmed Services Committee that firm plans were in place to secure and \nrebuild Iraq. But the reality is that the administration had no \nrealistic plan. We knew the post-war rebuilding of Iraq would be \ndifficult. Based on our experience in Bosnia, Kosovo, East Timor, and \nAfghanistan, we knew that security could be a profound problem, and \nthat there would be challenges from a restless population. We knew that \nbuilding a national police force and a credible new government would be \ncomplicated tasks. These are not new issues. But rather than learning \nfrom past experience in these previous conflicts, the administration \nwas blinded by its own ideological bravado. It rushed ahead without \nplanning for contingencies or raising even basic questions about likely \nevents.\n  The foundation of our post-war policy was built on a quicksand of \nfalse assumptions, and the result has been chaos for the Iraqi people, \nand continuing mortal danger for our troops. The truth, as our \ncolleague Senator John Kerry starkly stated last week, is clearer with \neach passing day and each new casualty: ``The administration went to \nwar without a thorough plan to win the peace.''\n  The Pentagon assumed that we would be able to draw on thousands of \nSaddam's police force to protect security--but in the critical early \nweeks that followed the war, they were nowhere to be found, and too \nmany of their officers turned out to be thugs and torturers.\n  The Pentagon assumed that the bulk of the Iraqi Armed Forces could be \nused to supplement our forces--but those soldiers did not join us.\n  The Pentagon assumed that some Iraqi exile leaders could return to \nIraq to rally the population and lead the new government--but they were \nresented by the Iraqi people and the exiles were put on hold.\n  The Pentagon assumed that after a few hundred of Saddam's top \nadvisers were removed from power, large numbers of local officials \nwould remain to run the government--but the government crumbled.\n  The Pentagon assumed that Americans would be welcomed as liberators--\nbut for large numbers of Iraqis, we went from liberators to occupiers \nin a few short weeks. The dancing in the streets after the fall of the \nstatue of Saddam was accompanied by an orgy of massive looting and \nchaos and was followed by growing frustration even from those who first \nsaw us as liberators.\n  There was egg on the face of the administration and its peace plan \nfrom Day 1. Plan A was so obviously the wrong plan that GEN Garner, the \nman sent to oversee it, was abruptly replaced on Day 21, and Paul \nBremer was rushed in to make up Plan B as he went along.\n  Today, Paul Bremer rules the country from Saddam's palace, while the \nIraqi people too often sit in the dark without adequate water or \nelectricity.\n  Hospital equipment and medical supplies have been stolen. Power grids \nin major cities are being sabotaged.\n  Cynicism and anger toward America are growing. Many Iraqis believe \nthat we are unwilling--rather than unable--to restore basic services. \nThey are losing faith and trust in our promise of a reconstructed, \nstable, peaceful future. They fear that Saddam may still be alive.\n  Under fire from guerrillas determined to see America fail, our \nsoldiers are now performing police functions for which they have little \ntraining. They are building schools and hospitals--a task for which \nthey are ill prepared. We are straining their endurance, and they want \nto know how long they will have to stay in Iraq.\n  That America would be seen as occupier should have come as no \nsurprise. Former Secretary of State James Baker wrote in the New York \nTimes last August, ``If we are to change the regime in Iraq, we will \nhave to occupy the country militarily.''\n  Retired four-star Marine Corps General and former Central Command \nCommander Anthony Zinni said last\n\n[[Page S9384]]\n\nAugust that we would ``inherit the country of Iraq'' and ``put soldiers \nthat are already stretched so thin all around the world into a security \nforce there forever.''\n  James Webb, an Assistant Secretary of Defense and Secretary of the \nNavy in the Reagan administration, warned last September that we could \noccupy Iraq ``for the next 30 to 50 years.''\n  We knew--or should have known--that if we went into Iraq without the \ngenuine support of the international community, there would be no easy \nway out. As James Webb also warned, ``Those who are pushing for a \nunilateral war in Iraq know full well that there is no exit strategy if \nwe invade and stay.''\n  The White House is only just beginning to face the truth. On July 3, \nPresident Bush finally agreed that rebuilding Iraq would be a ``massive \nand long-term undertaking.''\n  But that undertaking cannot be sustained--and no foreign policy in \nthis free society can succeed--unless it is supported by our people. \nWith the administration's credibility frayed, and distrust rising here \nat home, it is time for President Bush to level with America. It is \ntime for him to hear and heed the words of the great World War II \ngeneral and great post-war Secretary of State George Marshall in his \nhistoric commencement address at Harvard in 1947:\n\n       An essential part of any successful action on the part of \n     the United States is an understanding on the part of the \n     people of America of the character of the problem and the \n     remedies to be applied.\n\n  The Marshall Plan proposed in that address became one of the great \nachievements of the 20th century. It succeeded because it involved a \ncoordinated effort by the United States and many nations of Europe to \nadvance the recovery of the continent after the war, and Marshall won \nthe Nobel Peace Prize. Is it too much to ask that we now be guided by \nthat example?\n  President Bush should face the truth and level with the American \npeople about the cost of stabilization and reconstruction in Iraq--both \nfinancial and human. We need a plan--a real plan, to which we are truly \ncommitted--to share the burden with the international community, \nincluding old allies who can be enlisted if we make a genuine effort to \nheal the divisive past.\n  Our troops are now sent overseas for longer stretches than ever--\nbecause we rely on their skill and talents to meet commitments on a \nglobal scale. More than 150,000 of our troops are in Iraq, and many \nhave been deployed in the region for close to a year. Half of our Army \ndivisions are in Iraq or Afghanistan. Of 33 Army combat brigades, 18 \nare in Iraq.\n  The strain is also great for citizens serving in the Guard and \nReserves because we must depend upon them with greater frequency, ever \nsince we reduced our forces after the cold war.\n  More than 150,000 Guard and Reserve soldiers have been mobilized; \n13,000 have been on active duty for at least a year. Others return home \nfrom deployments, only to be turned around and sent overseas for \nanother tour. In fact, today our Reservists are spending 13 times \nlonger in active duty than they did a decade ago, forced to put their \nlives on hold, missing births of their children, dealing with family \ncrises by phone and e-mail.\n  Open-ended missions are a serious strain on our forces and their \nfamilies. It is difficult to continue to put these patriotic men and \nwomen through the deployment grinder year after year and expect them to \nhold up indefinitely.\n  It is also difficult to sustain the cost of such missions. We are now \nspending $3.9 billion a month in Iraq. With the ongoing cost of the war \non terrorism, our operations in Afghanistan, and our potential new \nresponsibilities around the globe, in places such as West Africa, let \nalone Iran and North Korea, we are creating an unsustainable financial \nburden at a time of exploding budget deficits, soaring demands for \nhomeland security, and mounting needs for health care, education, and \nother domestic priorities.\n  Despite the escalating cost of the military operation in Iraq, not \none cent of its cost is included in the defense-spending legislation \nbeing considered this very week in the Senate. Not one penny. How will \nwe pay the bill? To this question, there is only resounding silence at \nthe White House, another refusal to level with the American people.\n  As a Nation with honor, responsibility, and the vision of a better \nworld, America cannot invade and then cut and run from Iraq. But we \nalso can't afford the continuing cost--in dollars or in blood--of \nstubbornly continuing to go-it-alone. If our national security is at \nstake, we will spare no cost. But we have options here that reach \nbeyond the checkbook of the American people.\n  Working with the international community, we can develop and \nimplement an effective strategy to change a failed course, reduce the \nburden and risk to our soldiers, stabilize Iraq, and deliver on the \npromise of a better future for the Iraqi people.\n  As we all know, a number of countries supported our military action \nagainst Saddam Hussein. Many others did not. But if the administration \nis willing to put the national interest ahead of its own ideological \npride, I believe that we can secure broad international support and \nparticipation in the stabilization and reconstruction of Iraq. After \nall, so much is clearly at stake for the rest of the world.\n  At issue are the stability and the future of the entire highly \nvolatile region. None would be immune from the dangers that a disunited \nand disorganized Iraq could present for its neighbors and for nations \neverywhere.\n  These are not just American or British concerns. They are true \ninternational concerns. America cannot be effective in its mission in \nIraq if old wounds don't heal and bitterness continues to fester. We \nneed to take the chip off our shoulder, mend fences with France and \nwith Germany, and stop the divisiveness.\n  As we seek to stabilize and democratize Iraq, we do not need to go it \nalone and should not try to. If we diversify the faces of the security \nforce, it is far less likely that Iraqis will see us as the enemy, \noppressor, and occupier. We want the 25 million citizens of Iraq to see \nthe forces that are there as friends and partners in their pursuit of \nfreedom.\n  We need to bring regional forces into Iraq--especially Muslim ones. \nCountries like Jordan, Pakistan, and Egypt could transform this mission \nwith both their diversity and their expertise. The United Arab Emirates \nhave contributed to the effort in Kosovo. Morocco and Albania and \nTurkey have worked with us in Bosnia. Countries such as France, \nGermany, Italy, Argentina, and Spain could provide well-trained police.\n  Reaching out to other countries and bringing them into the post-war \nprocess is the surest path to a stable Iraq. But most other nations are \nunlikely to send troops to serve in what is perceived as an American \noccupation. They will be more likely to do their part if an \ninternational mission is approved by the United Nations and organized \nby NATO.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld insists that we are reaching out to the \ninternational community and that we are working with NATO. But the \nSecretary General of NATO, Lord Robertson, says that the alliance as an \ninstitution has never been asked to play the formal role in Iraq that \nit plays in Bosnia and Kosovo, and soon will play in Afghanistan. Nor \nhas the Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, been asked \nto seek international consent for a truly multilateral force. The \nUnited States insists on a coalition of the few, dominated and \ncontrolled by our Nation.\n  Instead of asking our Armed Forces to carry out a mission for which \nthey are not trained and to do so alone, we need to rely on the \nexpertise and resources of the international community. The United \nNations has assumed that responsibility in other countries in the past. \nIt is one of the major reasons why the U.N. was created--to bring \ninternational vision and strength to the difficult issues of peace \nkeeping and nationbuilding after the Second World War. Necessity is the \nmother of invention. In the case of Iraq, President Bush has at last \nbeen persuaded to abandon his strong opposition to nationbuilding. The \nchallenge now is to persuade him to move beyond unilateral \nnationbuilding.\n  The new Iraqi council announced on Sunday was a step in the right \ndirection. But it would have been much\n\n[[Page S9385]]\n\nmore effective if the U.N. Special Representative--and not the U.S. \nGovernment--was seen as sponsoring its creation.\n  If America alone sets up a new government in Baghdad, it may fail--if \nnot now, later; if not while our forces are there, as soon as they are \ngone. Those who join such a government run the risk of being dismissed \nby the Iraqi people as American puppets. And for as long as America \nalone is calling the tune, Iraqi moderates may remain in the \nbackground, and possibly even oppose us.\n  Our interests in the emergence of a true democracy in Iraq are best \nfulfilled by involving the world community and especially other Arab \nnations as partners in helping the Iraqis themselves shape a new Iraq. \nOnly then will a new Iraqi government be viewed as legitimate by the \nIraqi people.\n  So it is time for the administration to stop giving lip service to \ninternational participation and start genuinely seeking and accepting \nit--on reasonable terms, and with a real commitment to it. President \nBush's meeting with U.N Secretary General Kofi Annan at the White House \nyesterday should be the beginning of a renewed relationship and a shift \nin attitude at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue about the rightness and the \npractical imperative of working with others.\n  The U.N. has a mandate for humanitarian issues. But it has only an \nadvisory role in the civil administration of Iraq. That has to change. \nThe U.N. should have a formal role in overseeing the establishment of a \npolitical process. The U.N.--rather than the United States and \nBritain--should preside over the evolution of the new Iraqi government. \nDoing so will win international legitimacy and marshal international \nsupport for this challenge, minimizing the danger that Iraqis will \nregard their government as a puppet of ours.\n  With Arab-speaking spokesmen, the U.N. could also convey a different \nimage and a different message to the people of that country, a sense of \nreassurance that an overwhelmingly American occupation never can.\n  NATO, as an institution, should clearly be in Iraq as well. Military \nexperts believe it will take at least 200,000 troops to stabilize Iraq. \nOur goal should be to include NATO and some of its 2-million-member \npool of armed forces in military operations as soon as possible. \nAmerica would provide a majority of the troops, but over time the \noverall number of forces would decrease.\n  As in Kosovo and Bosnia, we should ask the United Nations Security \nCouncil to authorize NATO to organize an international security force \nto demilitarize and stabilize Iraq. Doing so does not mean that the \nUnited States should or must relinquish all military control. On the \ncontrary, we would have a significant role in the NATO force, and could \ncontinue to have the defining role in Iraq. An American commander was \nin charge of American troops in Bosnia, and the head of NATO forces in \nEurope is--and always has been--an American.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld told the Armed Services Committee last week that \nexcept for the area around Baghdad, most of Iraq is already secure. If \nthat is so--and we have to hope this estimate is more accurate than \nothers we have heard--then why not reduce the burden on our military \nand decide that this large area of Iraq, which needs police forces as \nwell as combat troops, should be turned over as soon as possible to a \nUnited Nations-approved and NATO-led force? Why not allow American and \ncoalition forces to secure the area around Baghdad, and allow other \nnations to provide security for the rest of Iraq?\n  Finally, as long as Iraq continues to dominate our attention, we \ncannot give other aspects of the war against terrorism the focus they \ndeserve.\n  Has the American occupation of Iraq defeated Osama bin Laden and al-\nQaida? No.\n  Has it increased our security against the continuing al-Qaida threats \nin Afghanistan and other terrorist sanctuaries? No.\n  Has our action in Iraq led Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida to lay aside \ntheir sworn purpose of killing Americans and destroying our way of \nlife? No.\n  It is not just what happens in Iraq itself, as important as that \nissue is, but the continuing urgency of the ongoing fight against \nterrorism that should compel this administration to enlist allies in an \ninternational plan for a peaceful Iraq. Otherwise, we run the grave \nrisk of exposing our Nation to more terrorist attacks.\n  America won the war in Iraq, as we knew we would, but if our present \npolicy continues, we may lose the peace. We must rise to the challenge \nof international co-operation. Saddam Hussein may no longer be in \npower, but the people of Iraq will not truly be liberated until they \nlive in a secure country. And the war will not be over until the \nfighting stops on the ground, democracy takes hold, and the people of \nIraq are able to govern themselves.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for \nhis statement in support of the amendment and also for his overly \ngracious and charitable statement at the beginning of his remarks \nconcerning my previous efforts in regard to the whole question of Iraq.\n  I am hoping other Senators will speak on the amendment, but in the \nmeantime I say that soldiers whom we are using in our National Guard \nand Reserve are entitled to fairness. They are entitled to know how \nlong their tour of duty will extend. After all, we were told that our \nmen and women would be welcomed not as occupiers but as liberators. We \nwere told that our men and women would be welcomed with flowers and \nsmiles.\n  Our men and women in the Reserve components are beginning to wonder \nif they were misled. We are using our National Guard and Reserve in a \nway which is unfair to them and to their families. We cannot ask them \nto wait for some study now while they bide their time. It is not their \nfault that the White House decided to wage a war without considering \nthe aftermath in Iraq. It is not their fault that a policy of \npreemption may demand many more troops than we can muster. We need to \ngive our Guard and Reserve some relief from the turmoil of being \nconstantly deployed. We owe them more than a study. We owe them action.\n  If this amendment were accepted, it would push the administration to \ninternationalize the peacekeeping in Iraq. I hope other nations will \njoin in keeping the peace in Iraq so that our own guardsmen and \nreservists will be relieved and will be able to come home.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, my understanding is that there is a \nfirst-degree amendment by my distinguished ranking member, the former \nchairman of our Budget Committee, that I very vigorously favor with \nrespect to the National Guard and the Reserve. I know that the Reserve \nofficers at the C-17 unit under General Black at the field in \nCharleston, SC, were alerted on September 12, the day after 9/11, and \nthey are still flying. Now, that is quite a burden. Many are straining \nto make their rent payments and their house payments.\n  When we had a hearing about 2 months ago and the distinguished \nSecretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, came, after listening, I said: \nMr. Secretary, what you need is not a money supplement but a manpower \nsupplement.\n  In that vein, I want to say as much as I can in support of my \nchairman, but I deter for the simple reason that the money is not in \nthis particular Defense appropriations bill for Iraq, and there is a \ngood reason for it.\n  Now, there should be gratitude for little things that happen. I first \nexpress my gratitude to the distinguished editor and publisher of the \nWashington Post, Mr. Donald Graham. I complained in an op-ed piece some \nweeks ago that they were not covering the budget amounts and that we \nought to have truth in budgeting, and because we have come to the \nhighest budget deficit in the history of the U.S. Government, that \nought to be covered as front-page news. Today it is. We have moved from \npage A4 to page 1. I have my copy of today's Post, and front and center \non page one are the articles:\n\n[[Page S9386]]\n\n``The Budget Deficit May Surpass $450 Billion'' and ``Budget Woes \nTrickle Down.''\n  I happened to be a State Governor, and I received a AAA rating from \nStandard and Moody's, and we have maintained that in South \nCarolina. We have to have a balanced budget.\n  I coauthored Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, which happened under President \nReagan. I have been in the vineyard. But the headline here states: \n``The Budget Deficit May Surpass $450 Billion,'' and I want to thank \nJonathan Weisman, the author of this particular story, and Fred Hiatt, \nthe editorial page editor, for including this.\n  I said we just move up in inches. Let's look at the Mid-Session \nReview of the Budget of the United States Government by the Office of \nManagement and Budget, the Executive Office of the President, signed by \nJoshua Bolton, Director, as of yesterday, July 15.\n  We find out why Mitch left town. Mitch Daniels is gone. Now we know \nwhy Ari Fleischer is gone. Both Mitch and Ari skipped town. Why? Just \nlook at this document. They have no tricky answers for this one. This \nis the Administration's writing, and I am reading on page 1 their \nstatement:\n\n       The deficit for 2003 is now estimated at $455 billion.\n\n  That is on page 1. One learns, after years up here, how to read these \nthings. So on page 57, you get to the actual deficit, how much we get \nin revenues and how much we spend, and if spending exceeds revenues, \nthen there is a deficit. If we look at table 20 on page 57, we will \nfind the total gross Federal debt for 2002 was $6,198,000,000,000 and \nit will go up to $6,896,000,000,000 this year. That is why Mitch left \ntown. Compute that and the deficit will not be an estimated $455 \nbillion; it will be $698 billion. They estimate a $698 billion deficit \nfor the year 2003.\n\n  But, wait, we have actual numbers as of this minute. As of July 14th, \nyesterday, the Treasury says the debt to the penny is $478 billion. So \nit is already more than the $455 billion they say it will be at the end \nof the year. I guess that is why Paul O'Neill left town, too. They are \nall leaving if they have anything to do with fiscal matters, and so now \nwe have John Snow as Treasury Secretary.\n  What did President Bush say when he came to town? I have the exact \nquote, taken from his first address to a Joint Session of Congress in \n2001:\n\n       To make sure the retirement savings of America's seniors \n     are not diverted in any other program, my budget protects all \n     $2.6 trillion of the Social Security surplus for Social \n     Security and for Social Security alone.\n\n  Well, he is spending the trust funds when he says on page 1, $455 \nbillion. He is spending $163 billion of Social Security, plus another \n$30 billion of other trust funds.\n  What we have is a Social Security trust fund, the Medicare trust \nfund, the military retirees trust fund, the civil service retirees \ntrust fund, the highway, the airport, the railway trust fund, the \nunemployment compensation trust fund--which will be drained, \nincidentally; we will have to fill that back up. We are spending it on \nany and everything but unemployment. This is Enron bookkeeping. We are \nspending Social Security moneys on any and everything but Social \nSecurity.\n  But the President, when he was speaking when he was speaking right \nafter he took office in February 2001, said that wasn't all he was \ngoing to do.\n  He goes on and says:\n\n       We should approach our Nation's budget as any prudent \n     family would, with a contingency fund for emergencies. We are \n     going to have a contingency fund for emergencies or \n     additional spending needs. My budget sets aside $1 trillion \n     over 10 years for additional needs. That is 1 trillion \n     additional reasons you can feel comfortable supporting this \n     budget.\n\n  Now, Iraq and Afghanistan and the whole kit and kaboodle, put in \nLiberia and whatever country he wants to run to, we have 14 \npeacekeeping missions, then we have Kuwait, then we have Afghanistan, \nthen we have Iraq, and now he is looking for another country to send \nthe military to. We don't have enough National Guard or anybody in \nuniform to get to that country, I can tell you that right now.\n  But that has not cost $1 trillion. It has not cost $1 trillion. But \nhe had $1 trillion set aside before September 11, so why can't he pay \nfor this out of that?\n  Now, let's find out what he said last year in the State of the Union:\n\n       Our budget will run a deficit that will be small and short-\n     term so long as Congress restrains spending and acts in a \n     fiscally responsible manner.\n\n  Well, all the spending bills were signed by President George W. Bush. \nSo I take it since that was his admonition to us, he must have had that \nin mind for himself. And he signed only fiscally responsible budgets.\n  He also said:\n\n       The way out of this recession, the way to create jobs, is \n     to grow the economy by encouraging investment in factories \n     and equipment and by speeding up tax relief so people will \n     have more money to spend.\n\n  There were plenty of tax cuts, but he hasn't created any jobs.\n  One more--let's go to January of 2003, to what he said in his State \nof the Union then:\n\n       We will not pass along our problems to other Congresses, to \n     other presidents and other generations. Tax relief will help \n     our economy immediately.\n\n  Immediately? He got yet more tax cuts, and we still have 3.8 million \nAmericans, the highest in 20 years, receiving unemployment \ncompensation. There have been over 3 million Americans who have lost \ntheir jobs since President Bush took office.\n  I think of President Clinton. He created 20 million jobs, and \nPresident Bush already has lost 3 million. Where is the immediacy that \nhis budget is going to take care of?\n\n       We will not pass along our problems to other Congresses, \n     other presidents and other generations.\n\n  That is exactly what we are doing--$698 billion in bills. Mark it \ndown. Poor Mitch, he got free. Mitch Daniels escaped to Indiana. He did \nnot want to come before the Budget Committee and answer any questions, \nI tell you, and Ari Fleischer says: This is enough for me, I'm gone. \nEverybody is going to run--out of Washington.\n  I have worked with the Senator from West Virginia and my chairman, \nSenator Inouye, who is most responsible on budget matters and we \nbalanced the budget. They want to forget that. Eight years under \nWilliam Jefferson Clinton and we came from a $403 billion deficit in \n1992 to finally getting in the black. We gradually got it down. I voted \nto increase taxes on Social Security. I voted to increase gas taxes. I \nvoted for all of those tax increases and we acted responsibly.\n  George W. Bush comes to town and what does he do? He says: Tomorrow, \ndon't worry about it. He has some fellow hidden out in the Pacific, he \nis far enough from Washington, out in California and Boston who says, \ndon't worry about deficits and all. The youngsters are keeping IRA \nsavings accounts and when their IRA savings accounts trigger you will \nnot have to worry about deficits. There is no conscience with this \ncharade. This is the best off-Broadway show you will find going on in \nthe National Government, the National Congress.\n  I hope we can sober up and pull in our horns. We have so much \nmanpower. We do not have the manpower of the Chinese. We have to \nmaintain our security on the superiority of technology, and Iraq proved \nthat. We had the superior technology. But we have been cutting back on \nthat.\n  I have a hearing tomorrow morning where we are going to be cutting \nback the advanced technology. We are cutting back on education \nprograms. We are cutting back on all the important investments.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print page 1 and page 57 of the Midsession \nReview for the fiscal year 2004 of the budget of the U.S. Government in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Summary\n\n       The President's Budget, released in February, focuses on \n     the challenges posed by three overriding national priorities: \n     winning the war against terrorism, securing the homeland, and \n     restoring strong economic growth and job creation. \n     Significant program has been made in all three areas.\n       This Mid-Session Review of the Budget revises the estimates \n     of receipts, outlays, and the deficit to reflect economic, \n     legislative, and other developments since February. The \n     deficit for 2003 is now estimated at $455 billion, up from \n     the $304 billion deficit estimated in February, for the \n     following reasons:\n       Economic and Other Reestimates. The economic assumptions \n     for this review, discussed\n\n[[Page S9387]]\n\n     later in the chapter ``Economic Assumptions,'' reflect \n     weaker-than-anticipated economic growth since February. \n     Slower growth, lower estimates of wage and salary income, and \n     other economic factors have reduced receipts from the levels \n     estimated in the budget. In the interest of cautious and \n     prudent forecasting, the revised estimates also include a \n     downward adjustment for revenue uncertainty of $15 billion in \n     2003, $30 billion in 2004, and $15 billion in 2005. These \n     reestimates in receipts are partially offset by lower outlays \n     due to revised economic and technical assumptions. The net \n     effect of all economic and other reestimates is to raise the \n     projected deficit by $66 billion in 2003 and $95 billion in \n     2004.\n       Iraq War. Funding for Operation Iraqi Freedom in \n     supplemental appropriations enacted in April, including costs \n     for military action and reconstruction assistance, increases \n     spending by $47 billion in 2003 and $20 billion in 2004. \n     These estimates do not reflect what the Administration has \n     previously indicated are expected but undermined additional \n     costs arising from ongoing operations in Iraq, extending \n     beyond 2003.\n       Jobs and Growth Act. Enactment of a jobs and growth bill \n     that was larger for 2003 and 2004 than proposed in the \n     February Budget raises the projected deficit by $13 billion \n     in 2003 and $36 billion in 2004. Of this increase, $9 billion \n     in 2003 and $11 billion in 2004 is due to temporary state \n     fiscal assistance included in the final enacted bill. In \n     later years, the enacted tax relief is smaller than proposed \n     in the Budget, which reduces the deficit projected in those \n     years relative to the February estimates.\n       Other Legislation and Policy Changes. Final 2003 \n     appropriations action, non-war related costs in the April \n     supplemental, extension of the program to help unemployed \n     Americans by providing an additional 13 weeks of unemployment \n     benefits, and other policy changes raise spending by $26 \n     billion in 2003, $17 billion in 2004, and smaller amounts in \n     subsequent years.\n       The reasons for changes in receipts and spending from the \n     February Budget are discussed further in the ``Receipts'' and \n     ``Spending'' chapters of this Review.\n       The deficit is projected to increase slightly from $455 \n     billion in 2003 to $475 billion in 2004. As a share of the \n     economy, the projected deficit remains steady in these two \n     years, at 4.2 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). These \n     deficit levels are well below the postwar deficit peak of 6.0 \n     percent of GDP in 1983, and are lower than in six of the last \n     twenty years.\n\n

decrease in the Treasury operating cash balance or compensating balances (which are assets) would be a means of financing a deficit and therefore\n  has a positive sign. An increase in checks outstanding (which is a liability) would also be a means of financing a deficit and therefore also has a\n  positive sign.\n\\2\\ Compensating balances are non-interest bearing Treasury bank deposits that Treasury mainly uses to compensate banks for collecting tax and non-tax\n  receipts under financial agency agreements. Most of the balances estimated at the end of 2003 are required to be invested in nonmarketable Depository\n  Compensation Securities issued by the Treasury; the rest of the balances, and the entire amount in previous years, is invested in the way that the\n  banks decide. The Administration has proposed legislation that would allow Treasury to replace compensating balances by an appropriation.\n\\3\\ Besides checks outstanding, includes accrued interest payable on Treasury debt, miscellaneous liability accounts, allocations of special drawing\n  rights; and, as an offset, cash and monetary assets (other than the Treasury operating cash balance and compensating balances), miscellaneous asset\n  accounts, and profit on sale of gold.\n\\4\\ Consists primarily of Federal Financing Bank debt in 2002.\n\\5\\ Consists of unamortized discount (less premium) on public issues of Treasury notes and bonds (other than zero-coupon bonds) and unrealized discount\n  on Government account series securities.\n\\6\\ The statutory debt limit is $7,384 billion.\n\\7\\ Treasury securities held by the public and zero-coupon bonds held by Government accounts are almost all measured at sales price plus amortized\n  discount or less amortized premium. Agency debt securities are almost all measured at face value. Treasury securities in the Government account series\n  are measured at face value less unrealized discount (if any).\n\\8\\ At the end of 2002, the Federal Reserve Banks held $604.2 billion of Federal securities and the rest of the public held $2,936.2 billion. Debt held\n  by the Federal Reserve Banks is not estimated for future years.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. There you go. Instead of $455 billion in deficits, we \nare running right this minute, according to the Secretary of the \nTreasury, in excess of $455 billion. We do not have to wait until the \nend of September.

Otherwise, you have heard the comments. It is going up ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto $698 billion, and it will probably be even more than that. They are ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntrying to be as conservative as they can, I take it.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I appreciate the distinguished author of the amendment yielding me ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntime to talk on a peripheral matter. But it goes right to the heart of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwhy they do not include money for Iraq in the Defense appropriations ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbills.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. BYRD. That is right. What the Senator has been quoting isn't ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nincluded either. They don't include the cost of the war.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. No, they don't put in the cost of the war.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, will the Senator yield?ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I would be delighted to yield to the Senator.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I think the point just made by the Senator ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfrom West Virginia and the Senator from South Carolina is most ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nimportant. With this misinformation about the budget, isn't it curious ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthat it comes at a time when we are discussing the Defense ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nappropriations bill? There is not one penny in this bill, as pointed ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nout by the Senator from West Virginia, for the war in Iraq. Just in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nIraq, the war is costing $1 billion a week--$4 billion a month. That ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndoesn't include all of the other necessary military expenditures, such ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nas in Afghanistan and in Bosnia. Yet we are considering a Defense ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nappropriations bill that does not have any money in here for the war in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nIraq.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield right there?ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The Senator from South Carolina controls the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntime.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I have the floor. I would be glad to yield to the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndistinguished Senator from Alaska for a comment.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has the floor.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. The money to pay the salaries for everyone in Iraq is in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthis bill. The money to pay for operations is in this bill. The problem ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nis the special money for the deployment costs were in the supplemental ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwhich we already passed. There was more than was necessary. We have ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nalready taken $3 billion out of that. They are operating on what is ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nleft. We appropriated $60-plus billion before.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Let me assure the Senator that there is money in this bill for Iraq. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nThere is money to pay the salaries and support for the military ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npersonnel. Some 60 percent of the money in this bill is support for ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthem. It is there. No matter where they are in the world, they are paid ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfrom money in this bill.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield?ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Let me yield the floor so the Senator from West ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nVirginia can straighten the point out.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. BYRD. The men and women are being paid their salaries, even if ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthey are from West Virginia. If they were all from West Virginia, they ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwould be paid their salaries. We are talking about the additional ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncosts, the incremental costs, and how much it costs this country to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwage war in Iraq per month. We are not talking about the salaries. They ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nget paid no matter where they are. We are talking about the additional ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncosts of Iraq. Let us be clear about that. Additional costs are almost ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n$1 billion a day for Iraq.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. No.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. BYRD. One billion dollars a week. That was a misstatement. I know ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbetter than that--$1 billion a week.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator from West Virginia yield?ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, this Senator would like for ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe Senator from West Virginia to clarify, since the Senator from South ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nCarolina has pointed out that we are talking about an annual deficit ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nnot close to $500 billion but now it might be approaching a $700 ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbillion annual deficit, is that not all the more the responsibility of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe Senate, which is part of the legislative branch? Under the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nConstitution, it is supposed to control the purse strings. Would that ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nnot make it all the more incumbent upon us to insist on what is going ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto be the supplemental bill to pay for the war so that we exercise our ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nconstitutional duty?ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely. The American people are entitled to know that. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nThey are going to pay the bill.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the distinguished Senator yield so I can bring ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthis into focus?ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, if you took the cumulative deficits ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfrom President Truman, President Eisenhower, President Kennedy, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nPresident Johnson, President Nixon, and President Ford--if you took the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndeficits for all of the 30 some years which these six President's ran ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nup--it would add up to $358 billion. The deficit this year, according ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto this President, is going to be almost at $700 billion.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Look at page 57 from the Mid-Session Review released today. See where ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe gross debt from 2002 to September 30, 2003, is in black and white; ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthat is almost $700 billion. We are doubling the 30 plus-year deficit ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nof Republican and Democratic Presidents--paying for the cost of World ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nWar II, all the costs of Korea, all the costs of 10 years in Vietnam. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nWe always paid our way.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Abraham Lincoln, the father of the party over there on the other side ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nof the aisle, put a tax on dividends and on estates in order to pay for ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe Civil War.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Now you folks come and want to take the tax off dividends, saying ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthere is no tomorrow.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, will the Senator yield?ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I would be delighted to yield.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I know it is a difficult thing to deal with when you talk ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nabout the benefits of reducing taxes and giving people more choices to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndo with it what they wish. A great Democrat President, John F. Kennedy, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nback inental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n[[Page S9389]]ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe 1960s, said: We need to have more money to put these programs ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntogether, and the best way to increase revenues is to decrease marginal ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nrates. He did that, and increased revenues nearly a third.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  In 1980, the total amount of money that was raised from marginal ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nrates was $244 billion. In 1990, it was $466 billion. It almost doubled ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nin the period of time that the greatest reduction in rates took place.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Every time since World War I, this has happened when we did that.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  This Senator doesn't like to sit here and hear somebody talking about ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nreducing rates and, therefore, that is the reason for the deficit.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. According to the Concord Coalition--let me refer first ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto them--you have diminished revenues $3.12 trillion in 3 years and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthree tax cuts.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I know the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma doesn't want to refer ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto the loss of all those revenues. But when the market sees that, they ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsay: Well, wait a minute. Yes, you can cut the interest rate a quarter ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nof a point under Alan Greenspan. But that means the Government will be ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncrowding the financial market with its sharp elbows crowding out ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncorporate finance, and they freeze in place. And we run huge deficits ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nin the balance of trade. We are running trade deficits of $500 billion, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthat is $1.5 billion a day. The foreign investors who helped cause that ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbubble are frozen in place. Then the poor worker finds as he opens his ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmouth that his job has gone overseas, so he gets lockjaw and freezes in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nplace.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  This is not like Jack Kennedy who inherited almost a balanced budget. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nWe started this fiscal year with $428 billion in budget deficits from ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nlast year. This year, it is $698 billion, according to the President of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe United States.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. If the Senator will yield on that point.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. This Senator wants to bring up the point that there is no ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nreason to come in here and talk about which party was responsible. We ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nall know, and the Senator from South Carolina knows, that the recession ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwe are in right now began in March of 2000.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. It only lasted for 3 years.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Not under a Republican administration. If the Senator ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfeels strongly about believing the Concord Coalition over that great ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nformer President John Kennedy, it is his option to do that.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is right. It is bipartisan. Kennedy wasn't ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbipartisan. He was a Democrat. This is bipartisan.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I didn't say he was bipartisan. He said he advocated a ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nreduction in tax rates to increase revenue, and it worked. Look at the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nDemocrat Governor out in New Mexico who did the same thing. It is one ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nof the very few States that is increasing revenue right now. He is the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nonly Governor I know--Democrat or Republican--who is reducing marginal ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nrates.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I am sure these other nine Republican ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nGovernors quoted in this ``Budget Woes Trickle Down''--I am sure they ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwould love to be able to reduce rates. I know my Republican Governor of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nSouth Carolina would love to reduce rates. They are not given that ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\noption. This ``Budget Woes Trickle Down'' and those nine Republican ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nGovernors are having to raise taxes. Kentucky let the prisoners out. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nThey are cutting back all the programs. Higher education is decimated. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nEvery college president is increasing tuition.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  ``Budget Woes Trickle Down.'' They are not cutting taxes.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Let's get right to where we are.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. If the Senator will yield, I agree they are not cutting ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntaxes. One of the Democrat Governors is cutting taxes and look what is ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhappening to the revenues out in the State of New Mexico. They are ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ngoing up.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Bill Richardson is the only exception I have been able ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto find.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield for a question?ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I want to ask the Senator, when this Senator ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwas assigned to the Budget Committee and the administration came forth ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwith a budget, I questioned the figures because what was expressed was ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthat we were not going to raid the Social Security trust fund to pay ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe normal expenditures of Government. Clearly, that is what the people ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nin the country do not want. They do not want the Social Security trust ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfund raided to pay for expenses.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Now, the Senator has come up with a new budget document that is ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsaying the annual deficit could be as high as $500 billion but it could ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nalso be, by the words on the paper, $700 billion?ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is right, $698 billion--spending Social Security ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntax moneys. That is the revenues. That is how they get to the $455 ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbillion on page 1.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  But let me point this out because we were here in 1983, and the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndistinguished Chair remembers this, we had the Greenspan commission. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nThat really started over on the House side with our good friend Wilbur ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nMills, who had been chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. He upped ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe ante along with President Nixon, decimating the trust fund.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  So by the end of the 1970s we appointed the Greenspan commission. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nAfter a 3-year study, they came with section 21. It says we are going ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto have an inordinate increase in payroll taxes, graduated up so as to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntake care of the baby boomers in the next generation. Section 21 says: ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nAnd put this money in trust and don't spend it on anything but Social ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nSecurity.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Now my friend from Florida, what happens is, it took us from 1983 to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n1990, I think it was. It was on November 5, 1990, George Walker Herbert ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nBush, President Bush's father, he signed into law section 13301. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nSection 13301 of the Budget Act, says: You shall not report a budget, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\neither the President or the Congress, spending Social Security trust ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfunds on anything other than Social Security. We put that into law and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthey continued to violate it. They continued to spend it. That is ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n13301.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The vote in the Senate was 98 to 2 for that particular provision. It ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nis in the law today, in the Budget Act. But that is what they are ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndoing. That is when the distinguished President started off and he took ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\noffice in 2001 and he said: I am setting aside $2.3 trillion to take ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncare of the needs of Social Security.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  He was following through on a pledge that he made in the campaign. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nBut we spend Social Security moneys on any and everything but Social ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nSecurity, and run around like a dog chasing his tail saying we have to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfix Social Security, we have to fix Social Security, we have to fix it, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nand they have all kinds of plans: invest in the stock market, get an ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nIRA, take this percent, that percent, retire early, don't retire--you ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nknow, on and on.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  All they need do is obey section 13301 of the law, the Budget Act, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nand not spend Social Security revenues on anything and everything but ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nSocial Security. That is all they have to do.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I yield the floor.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, since we are on the Defense ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nAppropriations subcommittee bill, I want to follow up on the remarks of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe Senator from South Carolina. I thank him for his comments.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I say this Senator is quite concerned about the legislated budgetary ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsleight of hand that has been apparent throughout this budgetary ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nprocess. I don't like it. I don't think it is instructive to the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncountry. I think it is budget fakery and that, although it has ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncertainly been employed on both sides of the aisle over the years in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe history of this Republic, particularly at a time now where the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nnumbers are getting so large, where the annual deficit--that is ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nspending more than we have coming in in revenue--is getting so large, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nif you believe the figures the Senator from South Carolina has just ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nspoken about from a budget document that was just released--upwards of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n$500 billion on one page and upwards of $700 billion on another page--ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthat is spending that much more in this fiscal year than we have coming ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nin in revenue--that is not a way to get our economic engine purring ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nagain. That is not a way of stopping the economic recession. Because if ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthere are more people chasing the available dollars that we need to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nborrow, then there is more demand on the money. What is going to be the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nresult on the cost of the money? The cost of the money is going to go ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nup. That is going to be the interest rates that are going to go up, and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthat is all the more going to stall us trying to get out of the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nrecession.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n[[Page S9390]]ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  It is perplexing to me, to say it in the mildest terms that I can, as ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto why we have all this budgetary sleight of hand, why we have this ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbudgetary fakery. Why can't we just be up straight, aboveboard: this is ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwhat it is and this is the plan to get out from under it. But there ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nseems to be an agenda to try to mask, to obscure what is the real ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsituation.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Since we are on the Defense Appropriations subcommittee bill, I want ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto bring up a matter of grave concern that I have. That is, as we ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncontinue to battle, as we continue to prosecute the war against ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nterrorists--be that in Afghanistan, be that in Iraq, be that in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nAmerica--we have to have timely and accurate intelligence. That has to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbe a given. There can't be any fudging or fakery or sleight of hand. It ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhas to be the best estimate of all the intelligence agencies. So I get ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nquite concerned.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I yield to the Senator from West Virginia.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. BYRD. And it should not be based on unsubstantiated----ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Unsubstantiated.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. BYRD. So-called evidence that is produced by the intelligence ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nagencies of another country, another state.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. That is precisely the point I want to make. I ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthank the Senator from West Virginia for underscoring that. Because I ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nget a little concerned, I got a little upset when I read in Sunday's ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nWashington Post:ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n       CIA director George J. Tenet successfully intervened with ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     White House officials to have a reference to Iraq seeking ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     uranium from Niger removed from a Presidential speech last ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     October. . . .ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Continuing:ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n       Tenet argued personally to White House officials, including ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     deputy national security adviser Stephen Hadley, that the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     allegation should not be used because it came from only a ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     single source, according to one senior official.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  That was in October. Three months later, in the President's State of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe Union speech, the very reference that was exorcised from the speech ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nin October was inserted.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I want the Senator from West Virginia to hear this reference. I want ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe Senator from West Virginia to verify what I am saying because, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\naccording to the Washington Post, when the Director of the CIA removed ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthat reference to Iraq seeking uranium from Niger in October, the very ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsame reference was inserted 3 months later in the President's State of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe Union speech but with a qualifier, and the qualifier was: according ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto British intelligence, even though 3 months earlier the CIA Director ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhad that reference stricken because it was not true.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. What does that suggest is going on with regard ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto accurate, timely, and truthful intelligence?ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, it suggests we are going down the wrong path when the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nPresident of the United States leads our country into war, leads our ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmen and women into war, based on evidence that is supposed to have been ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndeveloped by another country's agencies, that evidence not being ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsubstantiated by our own intelligence agencies.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  So it is very evident we were just grasping for a straw to hang our ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhats on. I happen to believe that this administration intended from the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbeginning to go to war in Iraq, that this administration intended from ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe beginning to invade Iraq.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  How many times has the Senator from Florida heard the President say, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwith reference to the U.N., ``If you don't do it, we will. If you don't ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndo it, we will''? They were not waiting on the U.N. to come along. We ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nalready had our minds made up to go into Iraq.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  And anybody who heard Karl Rove or read about Karl Rove's statement ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto the National Republican Committee--in January of last year, I ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbelieve it was, yes--when he indicated to the National Republican ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nCommittee that: this homeland security horse was the one we could ride ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto victory politically on, and that the national Republican efforts ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nshould make, as its center strategy, the subject of homeland security--ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nit was evident to me they were going to ride that horse to the utmost ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nuntil the horse dropped or got across the victory goal line in the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nelection.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator for his response.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. BYRD. And I think it was a misuse. It is a misuse. It is just an ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\neffort now, as they look back, to cover their skirts because it is ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nclear, so far as the evidence thus far is concerned, that there was no ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsuch uranium coming from Africa. That was virtually a fictitious thing, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nand our people knew it. They knew it in October of last year, as the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nSenator has pointed out.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I was in Iraq last week, as ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe blood of a Florida soldier was still soaking into the parched sands ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nof Baghdad. I still feel that we have sufficient security interests of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe United States for us to be in Iraq, and, clearly, we better draw ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthis to a successful conclusion to politically and economically ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nstabilize that country.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  But I can tell you, when I read this kind of information that ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsuggests that the American people and their Representatives in the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nCongress were being fed information that was not accurate--and it was ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nintentional--then I get very concerned for this country's ability to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nconduct our war against terrorists, for we are only going to be ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsuccessful in a war against terrorists from timely and accurate and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntruthful intelligence.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. BYRD. The administration misled the American people when it tried ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto leave the impression that the war on terrorism is engaged in by--in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nother words, that Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida could be linked. That has ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nnot been shown to be a fact. And the American people, according to the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npolls I read some time ago, seemed to be half of the belief that those ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwho took the planes into the Twin Towers were Iraqis. The truth is, not ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\none of those hijackers of planes flown into the Twin Towers on 9/11--ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nnot one of those hijackers was an Iraqi, not one. Not one was from ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nIraq.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  So where is the link? Where is the link?ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator from West Virginia. I will ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhave more to say about this as the debate continues on Defense ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nappropriations. I will speak to this issue that I have raised here. It ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nis of grave concern to me.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I want, in the course of this debate, for us to be told in this ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndebate a satisfactory explanation of why we are not planning for the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsupplemental on the Defense appropriations for the war in Iraq, why we ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nare not planning for that and stating that in this Defense ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nappropriations bill. I think that should be a part of the debate for ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nall of the Senators to engage in.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I yield the floor.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by Senator ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nByrd to assure that the deployments of National Guard and Reservists do ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nnot exceed 180 days. The amendment further mandates that Guard and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nReservists are not deployed more than once in a 60-day period.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I asked many ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nquestions of the administration as it made its case for war. Two of the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nquestions that were never answered involved the length of our ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndeployment and the ability of the international community to share the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nburden of rebuilding Iraq.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Because of the failure of the administration to answer these ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nquestions, some of our troops face the possibility of spending more ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntime than expected in Iraq. Our Guard and Reservists have fought ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbravely. We have to see that they are rotated home and replaced with ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nother troops on a timely basis.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I want to read part of a letter I received from one Californian ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nasking that a Marine Reserve Unit return to the United States:ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n       The members of the Marine Reserve unit ANGLICO are ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     important members of our society. They are hard working ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     citizens who contribute to our economy. Their families are ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     feeling the financial strain of their continued and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     unnecessary absence. These Marines are eager to come home to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     contribute to the continued success of our surrounding ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     communities. I am asking you to please look into this matter ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     and help facilitate the homecoming of our Marines.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Because of security concerns, the DoD was unable to shed any light on ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwhen this particular unit was to return home. But it highlights the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsacrifice our communities are making to support this action in Iraq.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I believe the U.S. should fulfill its duty and provide for the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nreconstruction of Iraq. However, I call on the President to ask our ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nallies to help share the burden and I ask him to ensure thatental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n[[Page S9391]]ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nour Guard and Reservists are rotated out of Iraq on a regular basis.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, this has been an interesting debate, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbut in the course of the debate we found that we have agreement that we ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhave to do something about the basic subject of rotation and deployment ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nas it applies to the Guard and Reserve as well as the active portions ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nof our total force.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I think, in the interest of all concerned, it would be best to put ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\naside both Senator Byrd's amendment and the one that Senator Inouye and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nI have offered and see if we cannot get further information from the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nDepartment and try to work with the Department in terms of this new ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npolicy that is projected.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  So on that basis and the debate that has taken place so far, I move ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto table Senator Byrd's amendment, which would take with it my second-ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndegree amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Senator from Missouri has a statement ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nI would like to respond to, and I ask unanimous consent that I be ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nallowed to yield to him for his portion of the statement.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The Senator from Missouri.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I rise in support of the bill in general, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nand second, I thank the chairman for his support of hypersonics funding ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nin the bill. The bill increases funding above last year's appropriated ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nlevel. I do have a couple of concerns and I appreciate the chairman's ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwillingness to address them with me in a colloquy.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Hypersonics are the future of aerospace. Later this year NASA will ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncarry out a further test of the X43-A. This will be done as part of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nNASA's hyper-X project, a program devoted to the study and creation of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nvehicles that use air-breathing engines at hypersonic speed. If this ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntest is successful, the aerospace industry will prove that the physics ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nof hypersonics are correct and our engineers can begin creating the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmodels that will become the future of the aerospace industry.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  This technology will yield unprecedented results, opening up new ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncommercial markets for industry, furthering human and robotic ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nexploration in the solar system, and significantly improving national ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsecurity. This transformational technology holds great promise for the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndevelopment of missiles, unmanned combat air vehicles, manned flight ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nand next-generation space shuttles. I thank the chairman for his ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsupport, and I ask him for his comments about hypersonics.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I appreciate the advocacy of our ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncolleague from Missouri on the issue of hypersonics, and I know, as a ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmember of the Armed Services Committee, he has been a champion of this ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nissue and raised it several times.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I agree with the Senator on hypersonics technology. It is very ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nimportant for the future of the aerospace industry. Over the next 10 ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nyears or more, the U.S. will develop and test a series of ground and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nflight demonstrators that will be powered by air-breathing rocket or ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nturbine-based engines or ram/scramjets. It is a very interesting ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntechnology. I agree with Senator Talent that this technology has the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npotential to revolutionize our commercial transport industry, space ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntravel, as well as the military capabilities.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I look forward to working with the Senator from Missouri on this ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nimportant issue as the chairman of the Defense Subcommittee and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ngenerally. I think it is a very interesting subject.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. TALENT. I close by thanking the chairman again and look forward ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto continuing to work with him and the committee to advance the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntechnology and research necessary to ensure a strong hypersonics ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nprogram. I thank the chairman for the colloquy.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Dorgan be ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nrecognized to offer an amendment on budget costs. I further ask consent ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthat when the Senate resumes consideration of the amendment on ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nWednesday, there be an additional 30 minutes equally divided in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nrelation to the Dorgan amendment; provided further that at the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nexpiration of that time Senator Bingaman be recognized to offer an ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\namendment regarding detainees; provided further that there then be a ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n40-minute period equally divided in the usual form; further, that ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfollowing that time the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nDorgan amendment to be followed by a vote in relation to the Bingaman ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\namendment with no amendments in order to the amendments prior to the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nvotes, and with 2 minutes for debate equally divided prior to each ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nvote.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The Senator from Nevada.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, at 10 a.m, the Secretary of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nState will be in the building for a briefing. The debate on the Burma ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\namendment should not involve all Senators. I thought originally we ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwould have a recess during that period of time but the majority leader ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhas decided not to do that. I understand why. But that is still ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\navailable.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have a further consent agreement. Does the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndistinguished leader wish to have that set forth before he agrees for ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe first unanimous consent?ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I reoffer the first request.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The amendment is as follows:ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  (Purpose: To require from the President a budget amendment for the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n   budget for fiscal year 2004 on the amounts requested for military ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n                operations in Iraq in fiscal year 2004)ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n       Insert after section 8123 the following:ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n       Sec. 8124. Not later than July 29, 2003, the President ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     shall submit to Congress a budget amendment to the budget of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     the President for fiscal year 2004, as submitted to Congress ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     in 2003 under section 1105(a) of title 31, United States ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     Code, setting forth in full the amounts required for fiscal ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     year 2004 for United States military operations in Iraq and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     Afghanistan in fiscal year 2004.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will speak briefly. I will speak further ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntomorrow on this subject. This relates to something I spoke about ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nyesterday. It may well be that the Congress--in this case, the Senate--ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfeels it is appropriate to ignore the added costs of Afghanistan and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nIraq in next year's budget, butental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n[[Page S9393]]ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nI happen to think that makes no sense at all. If we know, reasonably, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthat we are going to spend an additional $1 billion a month in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nAfghanistan and perhaps $4 billion a month in Iraq--that is perhaps a ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n$50 or $60 billion additional expenditure--it seems to me we ought to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\naddress that question now; not only address what are the additional ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncosts with respect to Iraq and Afghanistan but where we will find the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmoney.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  What will likely happen is what happened last year. The President ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmade the case he did not know what the costs might be in Iraq and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntherefore did not include anything in the budget for it, but we have ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbeen through now at least an initial phase of the war, with continuing ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nviolence in Iraq. We know from Secretary Rumsfeld's position earlier ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthis week we may well see an increase of troop strength in the area. We ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nknow the comptroller of the Pentagon says they have a pretty good sense ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nof what will be on the ground for the next fiscal year--referring both ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto Afghanistan and Iraq.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  If that is the case, and if we are now appropriating money for the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nDepartment of Defense, why not try to learn from the administration ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwhat figures they are using for additional costs in the coming year and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwhat they recommend we appropriate and how they recommend we find the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmoney.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  My amendment is very simple. It asks the President to submit an ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\namended budget to the Congress within the next 2 weeks setting out what ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhe thinks the costs will be in Iraq and Afghanistan above that which is ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nalready in the Department of Defense budget, and then recommending how ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwe would cover that, how we would pay for it. That, after all, is a ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nstarting point that comes from the executive budget, and then to be ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nconsidered by the Congress.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  This is a very incomplete picture and an incomplete process if we are ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nstaring anywhere from $50 to $60 billion in additional costs right ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsquare in the face and pretending it does not exist.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  My amendment is very simple. I deeply appreciate the work that ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nSenator Stevens and Senator Inouye have done on this bill. I happen to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbe on that subcommittee. These two are some remarkable men in this ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nSenate and have distinguished war records and have a distinguished ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nrecord of service to our entire country. I appreciate very much their ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwork on this bill. But I do think it is important for the Congress to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nanswer this question: Is this the way we should continue to handle ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthese extra costs?ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Now these extra costs are becoming very large, $5 billion a month. It ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nis quite clear from statements this week that the Pentagon knows or has ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsome notion of what these extra costs will be. It makes no sense to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npass an appropriations bill and pretend they do not exist.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I will speak at greater length tomorrow morning on this subject, but ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nI really believe we need to address this as a Congress.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I yield the floor.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, unless there is a unanimous consent ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nrequest to proceed to another matter, I would like to speak for a few ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmoments in support of Senator Dorgan's amendment.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I know the Senator from North Dakota has to leave and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwill be back tomorrow to discuss his amendment, but doesn't it strike ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthose following this debate as strange that we are considering the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nappropriation for the Department of Defense for the next year and it ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nincludes everything except Iraq and Afghanistan?ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  If this is truly an appropriations bill, if the Senate is meeting its ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nresponsibility in reviewing the requests of the administration to make ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncertain they are reasonable, how can we, in good conscience, pass a ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbill without any reference to the costs of the war? That, of course, is ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\na good turn of events for the administration because they do not have ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto explain how they will pay for it.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  This morning's newspapers across America disclosed we are facing a ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nrecord-breaking budget deficit. We have gone, over the span of 3 years, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfrom over $200 billion in surplus each year to over $450 billion in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndeficit. That does not count the Social Security portion which is about ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nanother $160 billion. We are facing record-breaking budget deficits. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nAnd now as we debate appropriations bills, these bills are not speaking ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto the reality of official spending under the Bush administration.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  To think we would consider this Department of Defense bill and not ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ninclude the money necessary for the war in Iraq is to suggest that this ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbill does not tell the whole story.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Just last week in the Armed Services Committee, Secretary Rumsfeld, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nour Secretary of Defense, appeared before the committee and was asked ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nby Senator Byrd of West Virginia, what is the cost of the war in Iraq? ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nSecretary Rumsfeld, in charge of the largest military operation on the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nface of the Earth, said, I don't know. Senator Byrd said, you better ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfind out. These are questions asked by Congress of Secretaries of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nDefense through history. So there was a break in the action and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nSenators came over for a vote and when we returned, Secretary Rumsfeld ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsaid, I have been told it will be about $3.9 billion per month, roughly ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n$1 billion a week for Iraq. When asked about Afghanistan, he suggested ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nit would be somewhere in the range of $1 billion a month.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  That means we are going to spend roughly $5 billion a month that is ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nnot accounted for in this bill. So we know we are going to spend the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmoney. We are never going to shortchange our men and women in uniform. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nWhy isn't this Bush administration, in all candor and honesty, coming ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto us with a bill that includes the costs of the war?ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Senator Dorgan, my colleague from North Dakota, asked that obvious ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nquestion and asked the Senate to vote on it. It will be interesting ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntomorrow to see if those who believe the Senate has a responsibility ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfor oversight and also believe this administration has a responsibility ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto be honest about the costs of the war, will, in fact, support the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nDorgan amendment. I certainly will. I hope my colleagues on both sides ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nof the aisle will, as well.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  This is a tough amendment because it puts the administration on the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nspot. They have to explain where they are going to come up with a ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsubstantial amount of money, but I think that is the burden they asked ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfor when they assumed office. We need to face it squarely, as do they.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I also say, despite the obvious monetary costs of the war, what I ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfind in traveling back to Illinois is the people are less concerned ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nabout the monetary costs than the human costs of this war. It is tough ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto calculate how many of our great men and women have died since ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nPresident Bush declared military victory in the first part of May. But ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwe know almost on a daily basis that we are losing some of our finest ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsoldiers, men and women, well trained for military combat, who are now ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nin the position of maintaining peace in Iraq, trying to establish a ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncivil society. It is not an easy task. These men and women, trained ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwith the highest technology, so successful on the battlefield, now find ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthemselves on patrol, guarding college campuses, guarding museums, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nenforcing curfews, dealing with scuffles and fights in public ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmarketplaces. As they go in to try to quell this violence and bring ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npeace to the situation, sadly, many of them are being attacked by ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nIraqis. Some are being killed.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  To those who follow this debate, I say we can try in this bill to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nignore the dollar costs of this war but, trust me, families across ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nAmerica, the people of this country, know the human costs on a daily ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbasis. They are asking us the hard questions.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Senator Lugar of Indiana, whom I respect very much, visited Iraq. He ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncame back and said, in all candor, he believed we would be in that ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncountry for 5 years. He said he felt that was a minimum. I hope he is ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwrong. But I respect his judgment and his insight. If we are to be ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthere for 5 years, if 150,000 troops or any portion of those troops ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwill remain for that period of time, it is a massive investment by the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nUnited States in Iraq. It calls into question our basic strategy in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntrying to establish civil order.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I cannot for the life of me understand why this administration has ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nnot gone to the United Nations and asked them to assume responsibility ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwith us for the future of Iraq. Why hasn't this government come to the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nSenate and asked the same thing? If we could replace American troops in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe field, guardsmen and reserves who have been there for long periods ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nof time away from their family, if we could replace themental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n[[Page S9394]]ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nand bring them home by bringing in troops from other countries, that ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwould certainly be very positive.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  In this morning's newspapers Prime Minister Vajpayee of India said ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe United States requested 17,000 Indian troops and he declined the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ninvitation. He said he might join an effort sponsored by the United ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nNations. Those are his conditions. I don't know the conditions of other ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncountries.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  What is clear to me now is that though the coalition of the willing ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwas enough to win the military end of the war, the coalition of the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwilling is incapable of meeting the responsibility today of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nestablishing and maintaining order in Iraq. That coalition has really ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncome down to two major countries, Great Britain and the United States. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nWe are shouldering this burden, not just on the monetary side but on ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe side of human cost.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I think this administration should be conscious of the fact that many ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nAmericans, supportive of the invasion of Iraq, supportive of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\neliminating Saddam Hussein, are now raising serious questions about the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nduration and cost of our occupation of Iraq.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The same thing can be said, obviously, of Afghanistan. I am a big ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsupporter of Hamid Karzai. I think he has done a remarkable job as the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nleader in Afghanistan, bringing some order to a country which has known ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nchaos for too many years. But we know he needs help. Too many tribal ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwarlords control portions of the country that should be controlled by ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsome central authority coming out of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nThat is not the case.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The President of Pakistan recently visited the United States. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nPresident Musharraf said to President Bush: If you want one piece of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nadvice, send more troops to Afghanistan. We don't have enough people ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthere to maintain order. Our troop strength is estimated to be between ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n8,500 and 10,000. That points to the need for this bill to be more ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ninclusive on the real cost of the war in Afghanistan and Iraq. We need ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto face this head on.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  For the Department of Defense appropriations bill to speak to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nnational security and ignore 150,000 men and women in uniform in Iraq ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nand the cost to our country, as well as another 8,500 or so in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nAfghanistan, really misses the point. We need a bill that is complete. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nThe Dorgan amendment will move us in that direction. I will support it ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntomorrow, and I hope my colleagues will join me.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I yield the floor.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, no one regrets the deaths that are ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\noccurring in Iraq any more than I, or anyone else here, particularly ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthose of us who served in the uniform of our country. We know the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nseriousness of being involved in Iraq.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The offensive operations in Iraq started in March. I believe it was ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nMarch 19. This budget was presented to us long before that. It did not ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhave money for Iraq. As a matter of fact, we have handled this concept ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nof the war in Iraq on the same basis as Bosnia, Kosovo, et cetera--with ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\none exception. The President came to us and asked for a supplemental ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfor Iraq, and we passed it. The money is there. He asked for the money; ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwe gave it to him. I don't understand this demand, now, for another ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsupplemental. We do not need any more money right now. We are ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncontinuing to spend the money Congress provided, over $60 billion.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I have a little sense of politics in this. I don't quite understand. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nPolitics are never raised on the floor of the Senate, obviously. But ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nclearly the political implication is, somehow or other, the deaths are ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nrelated to the fact that the President has not asked for any money. We ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhave plenty of money right now to run this war. The costs of the war ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nare coming down. As I pointed out previously here this afternoon, all ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nof the costs of the manpower for fighting in Iraq are in this bill. The ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncosts that are not in this bill, that are being paid from the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsupplemental, are the incremental costs of moving forces to Iraq, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmoving materiel to Iraq, moving people back from Iraq, taking care of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nour global expenses, and conducting the war in Iraq.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The President came in and asked for a $10 billion contingency fund. I ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\njoined in saying no, you can't have a contingency fund. We gave him the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmoney he requested, the money whose use they detailed. But we didn't ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nput up $10 billion as a contingency fund because we didn't think it was ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nnecessary, and I still don't think it is necessary. But we do ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nunderstand if the cost of the war in Iraq will somehow exceed what we ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhave already provided, the President will come for a supplemental in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntime. He has done that.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  We are funding the war in Iraq on an incremental basis from a ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsupplemental fund we gave the President. Again, we gave him so much ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmoney, we rescinded $3 billion in this bill. Three billion dollars of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe previous supplemental have been rescinded and spread around in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nother areas of the Department of Defense.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I think we ought to get back into some historical context here. We ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhave had a series of peacekeeping operations, so-called peacekeeping ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\noperations. There were people killed in Bosnia. There was a war in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nBosnia. There is a war in Kosovo. There is a war in Afghanistan. This ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nadministration has asked for the money, and we have given it to them. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nThe money we gave them, by the way, the $60 billion-plus, was for the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwhole area that was commanded by General Franks. It was the war zone. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nThat included Afghanistan as well as Iraq.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  We have had, unfortunately, in the past--and I also mentioned this ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntoday--we had in connection with Bosnia and Kosovo a policy of the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nadministration, the previous administration, to not ask for money at ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nall. They took the money from the O accounts of the Departments, the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nvarious forces--Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines--and spent it. They ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nnever told us where they were spending it. When they came up and asked ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfor a supplemental to replace it, they asked us for the money to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nreplace the accounts. We never really got detailed descriptions of how ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmuch money was spent per day in Bosnia or Kosovo. I don't know where ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthis is coming from.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  As a matter of fact, Senator Inouye and I have been involved in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmanaging this bill, now, since 1981. We can tell the Senate the way we ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nare handling the bill now is the way we should handle a bill for ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndefense. We pay the money for the regular costs, and the Department ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nasks us for the extraordinary costs. The last administration had the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmoney for the personnel and regular costs in the bill, but they took ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsome of that money and fought the war in Bosnia and fought the war in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nKosovo and then came up for a supplemental. This administration came ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfor the supplemental first.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  They have the money. It is in the bank. They are spending it. And ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsomehow they are being criticized for not asking for a supplemental.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I oppose this amendment. I intend to oppose it. I intend, as a matter ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nof fact, to make a motion to table it in the future.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  There is an agreement for debate. We are in a situation where, as far ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nas I am concerned, we should not ask the Department to come and ask for ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmoneys on a contingency basis. That is really what the Senator is ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsuggesting--ask for money, what you might spend in the future, beyond ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwhat we have already given you. There is a bank over there. They have ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe money.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  To ask for a budget amendment for the fiscal year 2004, to be ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsubmitted this year, I don't understand at all. It wasn't required by ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe congressional budget resolution, by the way. If this was so ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nimportant, why didn't someone raise it in connection with the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncongressional budget resolution that passed after we went to war? And ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwe are at war.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I really believe it is time we understand what is going on. I do not ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwant to see us get another supplemental request this year. We have 13 ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nappropriations bills to pass. They have plenty of money. Why tie us up ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nin another supplemental? Everyone knows a supplemental this time of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nyear would become a Christmas tree. Everyone is going to offer ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\namendments to do things they didn't get in the other bills, and every ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\none would be a demand for an emergency.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  As long as I am chairman, we are going to try to have some discipline ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwith regard to dealing with money. The discipline is, we follow the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbudget. I have committed to follow the budget. We are following the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncongressional budget. In order to do so, we had to ask the President's ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npermission. Chairman Young, chairman of the House Appropriations ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nCommittee, and I asked forental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n[[Page S9395]]ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npermission to take $3 billion off the President's request that is in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthis bill for defense. We admit we took $3.1 billion from what the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nPresident asked for in his budget request and put it in other ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsubcommittees. Because of the fact the congressional budget resolution ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwas $2.6 billion below the President's budget, we needed to find money ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto fund operations of those other departments that would not fit within ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthat bill.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  We are proceeding on a basis that I think makes sense. I hope we will ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhave bipartisan support for it. But one thing we don't need is another ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsupplemental at this time dealing with Defense when Defense has money ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto continue to operate in Iraq. When they run out of money or come ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nclose to it, I assume they will come and ask for more. I presume the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncost per week is going to go down. It has been fairly high. The ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nincremental cost was over $34 billion last month, as I understand it. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nUnder the circumstances, if it continues to wind down, I believe the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmonthly cost will decline and the Department will be able to get ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthrough this fiscal year with the money they have. If they need more ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmoney in the calendar year 2004, they can come in and ask for it. But I ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npredict--I hope I am right--they are not going to need any more money ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nin calendar year 2003 for either fiscal year 2003 or the first quarter ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nof 2004. If they do, and that could happen--God forbid this thing could ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nblow up over there and we would have to send more forces back in. I ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndon't know. No one can predict what happens in a situation like we have ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nnow. We want to as rapidly as possible cease being an occupation force.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  This reminds me of some of harassment that took place during World ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nWar II when we had operating forces in areas where part of the enemy ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwas not subdued and there were sniper attacks. There were bombing ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nattacks. It was a disaster for people in uniform, who suffered even ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nafter the war was over. There were some deaths in World War II. I think ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthis is a sad thing.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I hear a call to bring the troops home. One of the reasons the troops ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nare there is to protect one another and protect the people we just ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfreed. I thought the price of freedom was in fact doing what our people ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nare doing; that is, following the commands of the Commander in Chief.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  It is a very tough thing to say, but once we undertake action such as ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthis, our national image would be absolutely tarred if we brought these ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npeople home before there was security for the people who have been ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nliberated from that regime, the Baath party of Saddam Hussein. We can't ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nleave them exposed, nor can we leave exposed our people who are trying ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto bring about reconstruction. I think we have to use common sense.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  To say the President shall submit a budget amendment--by the way, I ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndon't know of any requirement anywhere in the law that the President ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhas to submit a budget resolution before. I don't know that Congress ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhas ever said the President shall present a budget amendment for a ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nspecific amendment of money or a specific item. I have been here 35 ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nyears. I can't remember such a requirement before in my life. For no ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nother reason, I would oppose that because he is the President. The ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nConstitution gives him some powers. It gives us powers. One of the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npowers is to exercise the power of the purse. But we are not the ones ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwho can command the President to ask for the money. He is the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nPresident. If he wants the money, he should ask for it. If he doesn't ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nneed it, we should not compel him to ask for it. I am sure if he needs ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nit, he will be the first one to ask for it.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  As a matter of fact, I have heard comments about our President on ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthis floor lately that are sort of derogatory. I think he is a fine ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nman. He is a great President. He is doing a good job. He is honest. He ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nis forthcoming. He admits if he makes mistakes, and then he gets highly ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncriticized for having made the mistakes. Everybody makes mistakes from ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntime to time. It takes a real man to say he has made one.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  That is why I came to the floor yesterday and congratulated George ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nTenet for having taken the step of admitting he bore the responsibility ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfor the error in handling the reference in the President's State of the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nUnion message.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  But this President is doing a good job. This Secretary of Defense is ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndoing a good job. I think the American people should be proud of them. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nIn my home State, they are certainly proud of them. And they are proud ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nof the young men and women in uniform representing our country over ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthere.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I think the very thought that somehow something is going wrong here ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nand because something is going wrong here people are dying in Iraq is ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\njust a terrible thing. People are dying in Iraq, unfortunately, because ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthere are snipers. There are terrorists loose in Iraq. I thought we ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwere conducting a global war against terrorism. What is going on in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nIraq is terrorism. There has been a regime change. There are people ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nopposed to that change, and they are trying to kill our people over ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthere. They are trying to protect their own brothers and sisters in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntheir own country.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I hope the Senate settles down a little bit. In the past, we have ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhandled this bill very expeditiously because of our respect for men and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwomen in uniform. This is the money to pay those people who represent ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nour country throughout the world. They are deployed in many countries. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nThey read about what goes on here. They listen to it. They have it on ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nC-SPAN.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  By the way, it is a very interesting thing for this generation to go ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\noverseas compared to my time overseas. I never got a phone call after I ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nleft my home until I got back. These young people have phone calls ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nevery day. They have e-mail. They use the Web. They conduct their ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nclasses when they are deployed overseas and continue their studies. It ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nis a different world. They know what is going on here.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I hope they understand what we are trying to do is get this bill ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npassed and make sure they get their pay raise; make sure everything is ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nin place in time so when September 30 comes, this bill will have passed ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nand become law and be there for the protection of our men and women in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nuniform.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I regret deeply that we have to handle an amendment like this. We ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nknow the amounts required for the fiscal year 2004 military operations ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nin Iraq and Afghanistan. We already put the money up. They are ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nreporting monthly on what they spend.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Now we want to predict how much they are going to spend. I really do ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nnot see the relevancy of this amendment. Tomorrow, I hope to end the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndebate by moving to table. I hope the Senate will support that motion.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfor the quorum call be rescinded.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). Without objection, it is so ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nordered.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n             Joint Air to Surface Stand-off Missile (JASSM)ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I am reminded that both the distinguished ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nchairman and the ranking member have been strong proponents of the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nJASSM program in the past.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The JASSM program is less than 30 days from completing operational ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntest and is scheduled for a full rate production decision in November ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nof this year. Both DOD and the Air Force have sufficient confidence in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nJASSM that they have proposed to use fiscal year 2003 Iraqi freedom ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfunds to procure additional missiles. In addition, I would note that ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe Navy is scheduled to join the Air Force in future JASSM ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nprocurements and this production ramp is critical to meeting both the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nNavy and Air Force inventory requirements.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I hope that we can work in conference to find a path that will ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nprotect the existing contract while at the same time provide the Air ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nForce these vitally needed ``go-to-war'' assets.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator for bringing this matter to my ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nattention. He has my assurance that we will consider this matter in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nconference.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. I agree with the chairman and will join him in reviewing ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthis matter for conference.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n             digitization of department of defense manualsental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, beginning in fiscal year 2003 and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncontinuing this year, the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee has ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nincluded funds for the digitization of Department of Defense, DoD, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmanuals and has directed that the work be performed by information ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntechnology firms owned and operated by Native Americans located inental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n[[Page S9396]]ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nimpoverished Native communities. These Native firms came together and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nformed a corporation, the Intertribal Information Technology ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nCorporation, that could serve as the prime contractor in an effort to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfacilitate the contracting relationship with the Department of Defense.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  This consortium of firms has been working with mentoring information ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntechnology companies who already have existing contracts with the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nDepartment of Defense. I have had two briefings on the progress that is ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbeing made by the Native firms and their mentoring companies on ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nexisting DoD contract work, and have been advised that the performance ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nof the Native firms is both exemplary and highly efficient. A few ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmonths ago, I had the opportunity to attend the dedication of the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nNative Hawaiian information technology firm that is part of this ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nconsortium, and was further impressed with the capacity of these Native ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfirms to carry out the digitization work.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I agree. The war in Iraq demonstrated the important of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhaving the highly-mobile maintenance capability that the digitization ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nof DoD manuals enabled our forces to employ. For many years, the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nSenator and I have shared a concern about the high unemployment rates ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nin Native communities. This program serves as one effective means of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\naddressing those high unemployment rates while also providing the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nDefense Department with new sources of supply for digitization ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nservices.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. As the Senator knows, the ten Native-owned firms that ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncame together to establish a new Small Business Act 8(a) firm is ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncomposed of American Indian, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ninformation technology companies. To my knowledge, this is the first ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbusiness enterprise to be jointly owned by the three indigenous ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npopulations of the United States.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  This new jointly-owned firm was established so that DoD would only ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhave to award a single contract rather than having to award ten ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nseparate contracts to each of the ten participating firms. In ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nestablishing the jointly-owned firm, it was well understood that the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\njointly-owned firm would subcontract the digitization work to the ten ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nparticipating Native-owned firms, and that the jointly-owned firm would ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nassume administrative responsibilities and provide technical support to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe ten Native Firms to ensure the highest quality production.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  This innovative approach reflects the intent of the Congress that the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndigitization work be performed by Native firms that can not only ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nproduce quality products for the Government, but that in the process of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndoing so, can also generate jobs in the economically-disadvantaged ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncommunities that they serve.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is my understanding that the contract with the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\njointly-owned firm was to have been awarded on June 2 of this year, but ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthat DoD officials are now expressing some reluctance to allow the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\njointly-owned firm to pass the digitization work through to the Native ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfirms because the customary practice is to have the prime contractor ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nperform the majority of the work. I am also told, however, that there ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nis an exception to this practice provided for in regulation, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nparticularly when the Government had directed or identified a specific ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsource for the provision of services, as we did in the fiscal year 2003 ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nDepartment of Defense Appropriations Act.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Yes, that is my understanding as well. I am advised that ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe exception can be applied while still assuring full compliance with ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nall procurement requirements. So I would ask, is it the intent and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndirective of the Appropriations Committee that the Department of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nDefense employ all legal measures available under the law to accomplish ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe intent of the Congress in having the digitization work performed by ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe ten participating Native-owned firms through a single DoD contract ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwith the jointly-owned firms?ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. This is the intent. This new program is already proving ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto be a highly-efficient means of addressing the Department's needs for ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe digitization of DoD manuals, and we would expect the Defense ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nDepartment to employ every legal authority at its disposal to implement ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe program as Congress intended it to be implementedental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n             air force advanced power transformation officeental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe mission of the U.S. Air Force, USAF, Advanced Power Transformation ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nOffice, APTO, at Robins Air Force Base in Georgia. This transformation ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\noffice was established to advise and assist military installations all ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nover the world in their development of alternative fueled vehicles.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. If the Senator from Georgia would yield for a question, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nI have learned that the Energy Policy Act authorizes the APTO to enter ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ninto public-private collaborative agreements to encourage the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndevelopment and deployment of alternative fuel vehicles and alternative ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhydrogen fueling infrastructures. Does the Senator know whether the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntransformation office in Georgia has taken advantage of this ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nopportunity?ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. As my colleague from Alaska has suggested, the APTO ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhas entered a public-private collaborative project with the Southern ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nHydrogen Fuel Cell Research Partnership, which has then entered into a ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfurther agreement with the Georgia Tech Research Institute. This ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nGeorgia-based collaborative advances the national interest in the study ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nof hydrogen-powered vehicles and fueling system designs. The APTO also ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhopes to accelerate the development of hydrogen power technology to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndetermine whether it is feasible for both military and commercial use. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nBecause of the importance of this project, I urge the Air Force to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncontinue to support this important initiative.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. The committee also notes the importance and value of the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nefforts of the Advanced Power Transformation Office and encourages the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nAir Force to continue funding and support for this important ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ninitiative.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I thank the distinguished Senator from Alaska, and I ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nyield the floor.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n                 SAC Position on Objective Force Cannonental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1382, the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill for fiscal year 2004, as ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nreported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations. I take a moment to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntalk about the urgent need for the non-line of sight cannon and to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncommend the actions the Senate Appropriations Committee has taken to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmeet this key need.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  We have heard testimony from the most senior members of the Army ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nuniformed and civilian leadership that organic Army indirect fire is ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\none of the most urgent needs in today's military environment.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  When Congress agreed to allow the Department of Defense to terminate ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe Crusader program last year, it did so with the explicit ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nunderstanding the Crusader technology would be used to form the basis ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nof a new lighter, more easily deployable non-line of sight cannon, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwhich would be ready no later than 2008.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Indeed, during the last session we enacted law to that effect, and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nalso stipulated that development of the non-line of sight cannon would ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbe undertaken as part of the Army's Artillery Systems Demonstration and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nValidation program element, which is the only place within the budget ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthat cannon artillery research and development is funded.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The designation of the non-line of sight cannon as a congressional ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nspecial interest by the Senate Appropriations Committee goes even ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfurther than last year's legislation to ensure that this need is met. I ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nask the chairman to comment on the need for this further step.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. In an effort to ensure full compliance with Congress's ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nintent to fully fund the non-line of sight cannon program, the Senate ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nAppropriations Committee has designated the program as a congressional ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nspecial interest and appropriated funding in a separate program element ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndevoted to the advanced development of artillery systems.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. With limited resources available for the competing needs ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nof modernization and force sustainment, it is imperative that crucial ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nprograms like non-line of sight cannon receive the requisite ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncongressional oversight to ensure their timely development and fielding ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nin accordance with the priority they enjoy.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I thank the Senator, and my other colleagues on the Appropriations ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nCommittee for their efforts to ensure that this vital program receives ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe funding it needs.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n[[Page S9397]]ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n                     supplies of meals ready to eatental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Would the chairman yield for an inquiry on the subject of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nMRE supplies?ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would yield to the Senator from Indiana for a ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nquestion.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, during Operation Iraqi Freedom, our military ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nrelied upon MREs to an extent never before seen in the history of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmodern combat. Due to concerns about the safety of the local food ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsupply, Operation Iraqi Freedom and the subsequent mission has relief ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nalmost entirely on MREs to feed our soldiers. It is my understanding at ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe height of the operation, the Department of Defense was consuming ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nroughly 300,000 cases of MREs per week. Is the chairman aware of this ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nunprecedented use of MREs?ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I was aware of the reliance on MREs, yes.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. BAYH. I would further point out at the height of the operation, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsome estimate that DOD was down to a worldwide reserve of some 400,000 ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncases. To summarize, DOD was within a week of running out of food for ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nour soldiers in the field. Thanks to a surge in production by MRE ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nproducers on very little notice, DOD managed to stave off a logistical ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nand potential military disaster. Is the chairman aware of how close we ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncame to literally running out of food?ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I was not. But I certainly believe the committee should ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nlook into it.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Surprisingly, the Defense Logistics Agency, DLA, has still ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nnot chosen to replenish an adequate was reserve of MREs. In additions, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nDLA has cut MRE production despite the fact that our troops in Iraq are ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nstill consuming MREs at an unprecedented rate. Would the chairman ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nconsider this matter in conference and have the managers address it if ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe committee finds the problem to be as grave as it would appear?ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. We would be willing to look at that possibility.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Would the chairman yield for me to add further to the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndiscussion at hand?ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield to the Senator from Mississippi.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Part of any military exercise or experience is an ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nafteraction review to learn what went right and wrong and how to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nimprove on things in future situations. It would seem that the MRE ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsupply issue is just such an issue. Obviously DLA did not have reserve ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nstocks of food on hand going into this operation. Obviously no one ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nanticipated the consumption rate we have experienced in the past few ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmonths. But it seems apparent that the reliance upon MREs isn't going ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto change in the foreseeable future.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I can think of a number of things that could go wrong during a ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmilitary operation, but running out of food has to be one of the worst. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nSo I can't imagine why DLA is cutting production when we haven't even ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nstarted to replenish our reserves. It would seem simple enough that if ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nanything DLA should be increasing production and increasing reserves so ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthat we never face this potential disaster again.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I am informed that an adequate reserve based upon the new realities ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwe have discovered in the past few months would ultimately be 10.5 ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmillion cases. Well, we are about 10 million cases away from that goal ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nso we better get started on meeting that target. I too would certainly ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwelcome anything the chairman could do to address this problem in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nconference and compel DLA to up the reserve stocks of MREs to an ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nadequate level. I yield back of the chairman.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. We are going to take a close look at this problem and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsee what is or isn't being done to address it and take corrective ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\naction if necessary.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n                cost-sharing of defense medical researchental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to take this chance to thank ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nChairman Stevens for his leadership in funding the Army Peer-Reviewed ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nBreast Cancer Research Program at $150 million in this bill. I would ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nalso like to take a moment to enter into a colloquy with the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndistinguished chair of the Appropriations Committee about the report ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nlanguage in the committee report on cost-sharing in such medical ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nresearch. Mr. Chairman, when I read this report language, it seems ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nclear that the intent of the language is to determine if there is some ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nway to contain medical research costs within the defense budget.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  We all know that the Army Peer-Reviewed Breast Cancer Research ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nProgram, BCRP, has proven to be efficient and highly effective, and the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncommittee has supported its efforts strongly. The flexibility of this ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nprogram allows the Army to administer it in such a way as to maximize ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nits limited resources. The BCRP is able to quickly respond to current ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nscientific advances, and is able to fill gaps by focusing on research ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthat is traditionally underfunded. It is also responsive, not just to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe scientific community, but also to the public.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, the Senator from Vermont is correct. The committee ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nis seeking to determine alternative ways to fund increases in these ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nkinds of projects, but not undermine the effectiveness of ongoing ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nprograms. The committee has received numerous requests to start up new ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmedical research programs. In many cases these requests cannot be met ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwhen trying to meet other valid military requirements with limited ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nresources. The language is certainly not specifically designed to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nundermine the integrity of the existing DOD BCRP, and the committee ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nrecognizes it as innovative, extremely accountable and transparent in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nits approach to medical research.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the chairman. I would also like to clarify the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nlanguage in this provision about the agencies to perform the study. Am ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nI right in reading the word ``consultation,'' in reference to the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\noffices, institutes, and bureaus performing the study, to mean a ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncontinual process of discussion and collaboration? Consultation almost ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nalways involves more than simple briefings, but a consistent, mutual ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nback-and-forth designed to ensure the objectivity, soundness, and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfairness of a research process.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I personally hope that the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nAffairs will go even beyond that notion and rely heavily on the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nexpertise of the Institute of Medicine, which has reviewed programs ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nlike the Army Peer-Reviewed Breast Cancer Research Programs on several ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\noccasions.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, that is right. The language clearly foresees that ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs will work closely ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwith the service Surgeons General and the Institute of Medicine to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndevelop and conduct a sensible, objective, and fair analysis of cost-ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsharing options for future medical research programs.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank my good friend from Alaska for his support of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nprograms like the Army Peer-Reviewed Breast Cancer Research Program. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nRecently one of the staunch advocates of this program in my home State ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nof Vermont, Patt Barr, passed away.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an important ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmatter with my friend, the distinguished committee chairman.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I have been a long-time supporter of laser peening technology. Laser ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npeening is a revolutionary materials processing technology that has ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nproven very effective in solving many of the fatigue problems currently ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nplaguing military engines, such as the F101 engine in the B-1 bomber. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nLaser peening has been scientifically and battlefield proven to extend ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfatigue life and fatigue strength of metal parts.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  In recognition of the benefits of laser peening, the Army has ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ninitiated an effort to establish a technology insertion program that ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwould employ laser peening in support of major Army helicopter ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nprograms. Congress provided $1 million to begin this effort in fiscal ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nyear 2002.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Laser peening technology is being evaluated to extend the life of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nflight critical components on Army helicopters--including the CH-47 ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nChinook, AH-64 Apache, and UH-60 Black Hawk. These components are ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsubject to fretting fatigue, wear that results when two metal ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncomponents rub against each other. Without laser peening, fretting ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nproduces cracks that penetrateental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n[[Page S9398]]ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndeep into the component surface, causing fracture, failure, and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nultimately requiring part replacement. Laser peening will be applied to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfamilies of components such as integrally bladed rotors, gears, and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbearing raceways to significantly increase service life and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nreliability. These components are used in all of the Army's helicopters ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nand ground vehicles with turbine engines, including the Comanche, Black ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nHawk, and Apache helicopters and the M2 Abrams tank.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Stated simply, laser peening will improve the performance, extend the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nservice life and reduce the cost of these critical systems. Without ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncontinued support for laser peening technology, this program will halt ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nand these savings and improvements will never be realized.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  In recognition of the tremendous potential for laser peening for the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nArmy, I would ask the chairman's assistance in allowing the funds ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\navailable for Research, Development, Test and Evaluation for the Army ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto be used for laser peening for Army aircraft and ground equipment.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator for his interest in this issue. I ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nrecognize the importance of laser peening technology, and I promise the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nSenator that I will be certain to give his request careful ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nconsideration as we proceed with action on the Department of Defense ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nAppropriations bill for fiscal year 2004.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President I rise today to discuss the defense ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nappropriations bill before us this week and the excellent work the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, and the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nranking member of the Defense Subcommittee, Senator Inouye, have done ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto bring a very good bill before the Senate under a tight budget. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nAdditionally, we are engaged in operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwhich make it critical that we approve a bill that gives the men and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwomen in the field the tools they need. Senator Stevens and Senator ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nInouye have crafted a bill to benefit our armed forces in a time of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwar. Additionally, the bill is forward looking and meets our ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntransformational goals to modernize the U.S. military.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  On Saturday, LPD-17, USS San Antonio, will be christened at Avondale ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nShipyard in Louisiana. The San Antonio will move from dry-dock into the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nMississippi River, where she will undergo final preparations before she ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncan be delivered to the United States Navy and the Marines. It will be ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\na day to celebrate. There can be no doubt about America's need for the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nLPD class of ships. The LPD is designed to bring the fight to our ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nenemy.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  But the LPD program has suffered bumps and bruises along the way. She ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhas experienced delays and cost-overruns. Some tough love was needed to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbring efficiency to the program. Today, however, the LPD program is ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nback on track. It is on time and on budget. It is a fitting coincidence ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthat we will christen the San Antonio at a time when the LPD program is ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhealthy.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The LPD program could not have been brought back to even keel without ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe guidance and support of Senators Stevens and Inouye. They have been ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nlong-time advocates of the LPD program. I cannot thank them enough for ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nkeeping faith in a program that is absolutely vital to our Marines.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  In this bill, Senators Stevens and Inouye helped the LPD overcome yet ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nanother hurdle. When the President's budget for shipbuilding came out ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nin February, the President recommended the construction of LPD-23 to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbegin in fiscal year 2006, not fiscal year 2005 as originally planned. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nThe Department of Defense sought to push back the production rate of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe LPD program, which, if enacted, will only cause the LPD program to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nexperience price increases, once again. Moreover, if the recommendation ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nholds, over 2,000 lay-offs of highly skilled workers could occur at ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nAvondale and Ingalls in Mississippi. Fortunately, the chair and ranking ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmember support keeping LPD-23 on schedule for fiscal year 2005. I am ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nappreciative, and I know the Marine Corps and people of Louisiana are ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nappreciative.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  During the debate on the budget resolution, I offered a resolution to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nincrease spending for the National Guard and Reserve forces by $1.1 ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbillion to meet unfunded equipment requirements. Our Guard and Reserve ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nforces make up over 40 percent of our armed forces personnel, yet for ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nyears they barely received 8 percent of the funds in the defense ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbudgets. Our Armed Forces could not have performed as brilliantly as ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthey did in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwithout our reliance on our National Guard and Reserve. Over 320,000 ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nguardsmen and reservists have been activated since September 11, 2001. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nMany have been called up two and three times, which places tremendous ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nstresses on the lives of our troops and their loved ones. Our citizen ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsoldiers are being asked to perform the same tasks as our active ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nforces, and they are doing so with expertise. But, they often have ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhand-me-down equipment. There are people near and dear to me stationed ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nright now in Iraq in the Reserves. When their lives are on the line, I ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndo not want them wondering if their Vietnam era equipment will work.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Again, I am pleased Senators Stevens and Inouye have made a strong ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncommitment to bolstering our National Guard and Reserve. They funded ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe National Guard and Reserve equipment account at $750 million. This ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwill allow our Guard and Reserve forces to purchase key equipment for ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmodernization, such as laser targeting pods. The Senate also commits ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nkey funds to the modernization and long-term sustainment of the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nNational Guard: $175 million for upgrades to National Guard Bradley ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfighting vehicles; $50 million and pledge for full funding for a ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nStryker Brigade for the National Guard, $70 million for Black Hawk ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhelicopters, and $17 million to stand up 12 additional weapons of mass ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndestruction civil support teams. This money will be well invested, and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nI know the men in women in our National Guard and Reserve will put this ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nequipment to good use.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I also wish to thank Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye for their ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncontinued support of the National D-Day Museum in New Orleans, LA. Last ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nyear, we were saddened by the death of one of America's greatest ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhistorians, Dr. Stephen Ambrose. His works have chronicled, for ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nperpetuity, the lives of Lewis and Clark, Dwight Eisenhower, and the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmillions of brave Americans who took up a call to arms in World War II ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nin order to protect the United States and liberate the world.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  In 1991, Dr. Ambrose embarked on a mission to create a museum to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhonor America's war heroes. He wanted to place the Museum in New ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nOrleans because Andrew Jackson Higgins was a New Orleanian. Most people ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nin the U.S. do not know who Andrew Jackson Higgins is, but we owe a ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ngreat debt to Mr. Higgins. He created the landing crafts, or Higgins ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nboats, used to carry U.S. G.I.s to the shores of northern France for ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe D-day invasion of 1944. In Dr. Ambrose's interviews with President ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nEisenhower, President Eisenhower stated that Andrew Jackson Higgins' ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nboats were the reason America won World War II.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  In June of 2000, on the 56th anniversary of D-day, the National D-Day ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nMuseum opened its doors and fulfilled the realization of Dr. Ambrose's ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndream. The museum has been a run-away success. When you walk through ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nits exhibits, you cannot keep from being immersed in the history. To ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsee a veteran explaining to his grand-children what life was like in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nWorld War II is truly remarkable.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Just last week, on July 7, the 1 millionth visitor walked through the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndoors of the D-Day Museum. It is an extraordinary accomplishment for a ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmuseum to welcome 1 million visitors in 37 months. Visitors to the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nMuseum are saying they traveled to New Orleans just to tour the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nNational D-Day Museum. Usually, people say they visit New Orleans for ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe food or the music. It is a true testament to the D-Day Museum that ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npeople are now thinking of the D-Day Museum before they think of creole ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfood and jazz as reasons to vacation in New Orleans. Again, we might ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nnot be celebrating the millionth visitor if it were not for the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncommitments of Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye to help Dr. Ambrose ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmake his dream a reality. The people of Louisiana and all one million ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nvisitors are grateful.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  In closing, I look forward to approving the Defense appropriations ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbill and hope we can move to conference quickly so that we can best ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nprovide for our troops. I would be remiss if I did not commend the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee staff members theirental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n[[Page S9399]]ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndiligence, too.

Mr. President, I am very pleased we were able to maintain ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncontinued strong funding for the Army Peer-Reviewed Breast Cancer ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nResearch Program, BCRP, and for a number of other medical research ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nprograms in this bill. The BCRP has made a real difference in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsupporting innovative, effective research to help the many women and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmen who get breast cancer in this country. Because of its success, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nother medical research programs have been added, and there is always ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ninterest in adding more. The chairman has expressed concern about the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npotential effect of these new requests on the Defense budget, and the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncommittee report includes language requesting the Department to look at ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npossible additional sources of funding.

Mr. President, last week I joined Massport CEO Craig ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nCoy, Logan Airport's Federal Security Director George Naccara, and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nCongressman Stephen F. Lynch to mark a significant milestone in our ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nefforts to better protect the Nation's passenger aviation system. The ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\noccasion was the announcement that the Transportation Security ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nAdministration and Massport had reached an agreement concerning Federal ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nreimbursements for Massport's installation of a comprehensive explosive ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndetection baggage screening system.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  That the announcement was made at Logan Airport was fitting because ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsince 9/11 Massport has been a leader among airport operators in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nstrengthening aviation security. In fact, Logan was the only major ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nairport in the country to have met the deadline mandated by Congress in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe Aviation and Transportation Security Act by having its permanent ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbaggage screening system up and running by December 31, 2002.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  In order to accomplish this feat, Massport had to invest nearly $146 ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmillion of its own money before it was clear that the Federal ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nGovernment would reimburse any of these costs. Additionally, meeting ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthis deadline required the around-the-clock efforts of over 700 ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nlaborers who completed 2 years of construction in less than 6 months. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nFinally, this effort required Massport to work in close collaboration ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwith the Transportation Security Administration, an agency headed by ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndedicated and talented professionals, but also one that, having just ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbeen created, was still working to define its mission and scope in the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n9/11 environment.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  While there are still many security enhancements to be completed at ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nLogan--as there are at every major airport in the country--solid and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nconsistent progress is being made under Massport's new CEO, Craig Coy, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nand his management team. Just as they have done with regard to the new ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbaggage screening system, Massport's leadership, security officials, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nand professional staff continue to work to define complex security ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nchallenges and to meet those challenges. And I believe they are setting ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\na very strong example for those public agencies across the country ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncharged with the complicated and costly responsibilities of protecting ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nkey pieces of our Nation's transportation, energy transmission, and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npublic health infrastructure.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The manner in which Massport is approaching these new challenges is ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\noutlined succinctly in an April 1 Boston Business Journal editorial by ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nJohn A. Quelch, a Harvard Business School professor and the current ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nchairman of the board of the Massachusetts Port Authority. The ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nperformance model Quelch describes is, I think, instructive for other ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npublic agencies--and some corporate boards--that are struggling to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nadopt a governance structure that encourages performance and works to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\neliminate obstacles to achievement.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the text of Chairman Quelch's ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\narticle in the Record.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe Record, as follows:ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n            [From the Boston Business Journal, Apr. 1, 2003]ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n                 Better Governance In Public Agencies?ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n                          (By John A. Quelch)ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n       Corporate executives say they're concerned that new and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     improved governance requirements will prove onerous and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     irrelevant, dissuade talented people from serving as non-ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     executive directors, and eat up valuable board time that ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     could be spent better on discussing the health of the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     business.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n       To ease their minds, these executives need look no further ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     than well-run public agencies, where tough governance ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     practices enhance professionalism and can be a source of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     competitive advantage.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n       Take, for instance, the Massachusetts Port Authority. With ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     $350 million in annual revenues, Massport runs Logan Airport ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     and the Port of Boston. Massport is governed by a politically ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     balanced board of six members plus a chairman, appointed for ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     staggered seven-year terms of the Massachusetts Governor. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     Following the tragedy of 9/11, an independent commission ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     called for reduced political patronage in Massport ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     appointments. A professional CEO with corporate experience ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     was appointed following a nationwide search. A new, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     politically independent, chairman was also appointed.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n       Massport has since become a model of public agency ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     governance. Consider these practices from which many ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     corporations could learn a thing or two:ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n       Frequent Oversight. The Board meets ten times a year, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     typically for four hours. Meeting agendas follow a systematic ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     pattern, varying with the annual planning and budgeting ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     cycle. Five committees, each chaired by a board member and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     with its own charter, meet at least twice a year and report ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     back to the Board. These committees cover audit, human ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     resources and compensation, security, community affairs, and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     facilities and real estate.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n       Zero Compensation. Board members are not compensated. Yet, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     despite the workload, attendance is consistent and commitment ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     is high. Members are attracted by a shared interest in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     transportation and economic development challenges, and by ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     the opportunity to apply their professional expertise in the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     public interest.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n       Voting Transparency. The state public meeting law requires ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     all Massport board and board committee meetings open to the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     public. Discussions of security issues, litigation and real ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     estate and collective bargaining negotiations can be held in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     executive session if agreed to by a public roll call vote of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     board members. Any member can request a roll call vote if ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     (s)he wishes to put each board member on the record.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n       Patronage Control. A sunshine policy adopted by Massport ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     requires that requests for patronage appointments be reported ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     to legal counsel. All job openings have to be posted ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     internally and externally and requests for charitable ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     contributions are all channeled through an employee committee ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     which disburses an annual budget and reports to the board.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n       Conflicts of Interest. Each board member maintains a ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     Register of Interests, recording his or her outside ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     employment, directorships in public companies and any ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     governmental appointments. State law requires disclosure and/ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     or recusal where conflicts arise.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n       Audit Independence. Massport's auditors provide no other ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     consulting services to the agency and the audit partner must ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     be rotated every five years. An internal audit function ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     reports directly to and is evaluated by the board.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n       Shared Leadership. The roles of the chairman and chief ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     executive are, by board resolution, separated, as is common ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     practice in European companies but not the USA. The CEO is ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     selected and evaluated by the board. All decision-making ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     authority of the CEO is delegated from the board.

Mr. President, I rise today to tell you of two of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmy constituents from Merced, CA. I recently met with both of them and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nlearned how the availability of home hospice and home health care in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntheir homes improved their lives.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I had the opportunity to visit Carmel Flinders, a 93-year-old retired ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nteacher with an engaging personality and a voracious appetite for ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nreading books who lives at her home in Merced. On Christmas Eve, she ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwas preparing for a large family gathering and unfortunately broke her ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhip and had to be rushed to Sacramento for surgery. Thanks to home ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhealth care paid for by Medicare, Carmel was able to return home and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nresume her life, supported by home health care workers and family ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmembers. She had the help of Rigo Mayoral, a caring physical therapist, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwho works for California Home Care and Hospice. She also benefitted ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfrom the assistance of Kim Holmes, a gifted nurse recently named Home ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nHealth Nurse of the year. It was inspiring to meet Carmel Flinders and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe health care workers who have contributed to her strong recovery.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Americo Martignoni, and his wife, Eleanor, lived in the lovely home ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthat they built more than 40 years ago. Americo was a retired farmer ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nand veteran who was able to live at home with hospice care for the last ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n11 months. He was visited every week by Kerry Cheek, a licensed ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nvocational nurse, and also assisted by Kaye Moyer, a certified home ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhealth aide. A lung cancer patient, with an indomitable spirit, Americo ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nloved Eleanor's polenta and her legendary biscotti. These special ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npeople have a wonderful and supportive family of which they are so ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nproud. Home hospice care, paid through Medicare, improved their lives ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwhile saving dollars. Mr. Martignoni died on July 7th at his home.

Mr. President, the Senate will soon consider ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nimplementing legislation for the Chile and Singapore Free Trade ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nAgreements. These FTAs are comprehensive in nature and will serve well ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe interests of the United States and these two very important trading ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npartners.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  However, I am increasingly concerned with the notion that the Chile ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nand Singapore FTAs should serve as models or templates for future trade ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nnegotiations. I feel strongly that future negotiations must reflect the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nparticular concerns and uniqueness of each trading partner. This seems ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nobvious, but those who follow trade negotiations have warned that the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nBush administration may claim that the standards of the Chile and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nSingapore agreements are universally applicable. I hope those warnings ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nare wrong because provisions that are acceptable given the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncircumstances in Chile and Singapore may not be acceptable in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nagreements with countries in very different situations.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  International trade enhances economic opportunity and can serve to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nimprove workers' rights. As such, future trade agreements must build ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nupon the progress made to date by including comprehensive worker ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nprotections and strong enforcement provisions.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Over the past decade, the treatment of labor and environmental issues ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nin trade agreements has evolved both in emphasis and enforcement. NAFTA ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nrepresents an early stage in this evolution, addressing labor and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nenvironmental issues in the context of the agreement, albeit in side ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\naccords. The United States-Jordan Free Trade Agreement was the first ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nFTA to include labor provisions in the actual text of the agreement and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto subject those provisions to the same dispute settlement procedure as ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nall other elements of the agreement.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Although the Chile and Singapore agreements should be the next step ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nforward in this evolution towards strong and effectively enforced labor ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nand environmental standards, they are in fact a step back. Unlike the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nUnited States-Jordan FTA, the only labor provision subject to dispute ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsettlement is the requirement that each trading partner enforce its ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nexisting labor laws. Furthermore, there is no enforcement mechanism to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nensure that Chile and Singapore will strive to uphold basic ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ninternational labor rights.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  As we pursue future trade agreements, we must encourage policies that ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\navoid a downward spiral in working or environmental conditions. Trade ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nagreements must be a catalyst to improve these standards. To achieve ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthis end, American trade policy must be flexible: we must maintain a ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbroad adherence to basic principles and at the same time address the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nunique characteristics of each trading partner.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Maintaining this flexibility is of utmost importance in our ongoing ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntrade negotiations with six Central American countries. These countries ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nprovide an entirely different set of political and economic conditions ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthan Chile, Singapore, and our other FTA partners. The administration ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmust not ignore the fact that critical differences exist between the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nCAFTA countries and Chile and Singapore in labor and environmental ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nareas.

I have recently written to Ambassador Zoellick on this topic, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nalong with Senators Baucus, Bingaman, and Jeffords. We expressed ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nconcern that the labor rights situation in a number of the Central ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nAmerican countries presents concerns of a significant degree different ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfrom those underlying the negotiations of the United States-Singapore ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nand United States-Chile FTAs and urged that the CAFTA negotiations ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nought not be tied to previously negotiated agreements.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I will monitor progress of future trade negotiations closely and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfully expect to see substantial progress in several areas. In ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nparticular, the inclusion of basic worker protections, as well as ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nstrong monitoring and enforcement provisions, are necessary to meet the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nchallenges of an inclusive and progressive trade policy. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n                          ____________________ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/15/senate-section/article/S9401-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n                 COMMENDING CHARLES E. ``CHUCK'' FRANKental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. Frank's stance on environmental issues deserves ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nparticular commendation because in addition to being an active ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsupporter of the environment, he is in the business of selling cars and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntrucks at one of the Chicago area's largest car dealerships, which was ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfounded by his legendary father, ``Z'' Frank.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. Frank's love for the outdoors started in the early years of his ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nlife when he spent hours camping, fishing, and pursuing other ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nactivities immersed in nature. His love and respect for the environment ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndid not stop with childhood. Mr. Frank has made a personal and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nprofessional commitment to protect the environment that he so loved to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nensure that future generations will be able to experience the same ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nnatural wonders that he was able to. This commitment led Mr. Frank to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\njoin the Sierra Club in 1975, and now he is a lifetime member and Vice ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nPresident of the Sierra Club Foundation.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. Frank has demonstrated his commitment to the environment he loves ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nby working with the Sierra Club to secure a significant increase in the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nCorporate Average Fuel Economy standards. Offering a unique perspective ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfrom inside the automobile industry, he believes the current CAFE ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nstandards of 27.5 miles per gallon for cars and 20.7 miles per gallon ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfor trucks are standards the fail to meet consumers' demands both for ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmore cost-effective vehicles and solutions to the worsening problems of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nair pollution and global warming. He believes the technology in his ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nindustry can surpass the current standards, and believes that an ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nincrease to 40 miles per gallon for cars and 27.5 miles per gallon for ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntrucks is entirely possible. Mr. Frank strongly advocates increasing ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe CAFE standards to these proposed levels to ensure stronger customer ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsatisfaction and improved environmental conditions.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. Frank has termed his business, ``The Country's #1 Conscientious ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nChevy Dealer,'' In Mr. Frank's case, this slogan goes beyond simple ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nrhetoric and is absolutely true of his approach to his business. Mr. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nFrank believes so strongly in the need for an increase in the CAFE that ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhe has pledged part of his business profits to the Sierra Club Clean ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nAir Campaign. He is currently running advertisements in the Chicago ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\narea that detail the need for a raise in the CAFE standards and offer ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nconsumers an opportunity to have Mr. Frank's car dealership donate $200 ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto the Sierra Club for each car or truck sold. I commend Mr. Frank for ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndemonstrating that issues that affect our Nation's public health and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nenvironment are just as important as the bottom line.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The tireless work that Chuck Frank has done as a champion of the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nenvironment and as a manager in the automobile industry should be an ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ninspiration for us all to enact legislation to raise the CAFE ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nstandards. Mr. Frank's unique position demonstrates that business and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nenvironmental issues can go hand-in-hand.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my support ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfor S. 253, the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act. This ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ngroundbreaking legislation will enable law enforcement officers to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nprotect themselves and our communities, wherever they are, whenever ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthey are needed. This legislation authorizes off-duty and qualified ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nretired officers to carry a firearm anywhere in the Nation to help ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nensure the safety and well-being of law abiding citizens. While I ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nstrongly support this goal, I hope that amendments on the Senator floor ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwill add additional common sense restrictions to the bill.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Today, the authority of off-duty police officer to carry concealed ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nweapons varies widely from State to State. This complex patchwork of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nFederal, State and local laws places an undue and unnecessary ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nlimitation on professionals sworn to defend the public interest. The ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nLaw Enforcement Officers Safety Act would allow active law enforcement ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nofficers to carry their weapons while traveling outside their own ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\njurisdiction, anywhere in the country. However, the bill also preserves ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nState laws that restrict the carrying of concealed weapons on private ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nor government property.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Although we need to supplement the nationwide effort to increase ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsecurity, it is critical that enactment of such legislation be limited ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto current licensed professionals. This new authority to carry ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nconcealed firearms should complement existing duty of police officers ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto protect their communities however, it must also provide clear ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nchannels of accountability.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I hope that the Senate will consider including the following common ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsense restrictions to improve this legislation for our officers and our ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncitizens. First, we should limit this new authority to currently ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nemployed law enforcement officers. This will allow for reliable ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\noversight by State and local authorities. We should also restrict the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\noff-duty officer's firearm selection to handguns. This will reduce the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npotential for abuse and the unnecessary violence that high powered ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nweapons may induce. We should also prevent off-duty officers from ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncarrying weapons in places where alcohol is served.

andental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n       Whereas, the Republic of China on Taiwan shares these ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     values with the United States and has struggled throughout ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     the past 50 years to create what is today an open and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     thriving democracy; andental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n       Whereas, the United States must continue to support the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     growth of democracy and ongoing market opening in Taiwan if ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     this relationship is to evolve and reflect the changing ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     nature of the global system in the 21st Century;

The project promises to provide travelers with a ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     clean, quiet, safe, reliable mode of transportation. The ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     intent of the project is to create the world's first ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     switchable maglev rail network that will provide interurban/ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     intercity pedestrian, automobile, and light freight transit ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     services.

andental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n       Whereas, The ability of the State of Nevada and other ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     western states to fund public education is also limited by ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     the fact that the Federal Government shares with states only ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     a portion of the royalty revenues that the Federal Government ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     receives from the natural resources on land in the state held ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     by the Federal Government; andental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n       Whereas, The amount of such royalties received by states ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     for public education is further reduced because land held by ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     the Federal Government is less likely to be developed and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     federal laws often place stipulations on the use of royalty ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     payments made to states;

It is a ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntragedy, but it doesn't have to be. If we work together, we can prevent ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthese unintended pregnancies, and abortions.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  One of the most important steps we can take to prevent unintended ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npregnancies, and to reduce abortions, is to make sure American women ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhave access to affordable, effective contraception.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  There are a number of safe and effective contraceptives available by ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nprescription. Used properly, they greatly reduce the rate of unintended ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npregnancies.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  However, many women simply can't afford these prescriptions, and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntheir insurance doesn't pay for them, even though it covers other ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nprescriptions.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  That is not fair. We know women on average earn less than men, yet ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthey must pay far more than men for health-related expenses.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  According to the Women's Research and Education Institute, women of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nreproductive age pay 68 percent more in out-of-pocket medical expenses ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthan men, largely due to their reproductive health-care needs.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Because many women can't afford the prescription contraceptives they ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwould like to use, many do without them--and the result, all too often, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nis unintended pregnancy and abortion.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  This isn't an isolated problem. The fact is, a majority of women in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthis country are covered by health insurance plans that do not provide ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncoverage for prescription contraceptives.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  This is unfair to women . . . and it's bad policy that causes ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nadditional unintended pregnancies, and adversely affects women's ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhealth.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Senator Snowe and I first introduced our legislation in 1997. Since ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthen, the Viagra pill went on the market, and one month later it was ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncovered by most insurance policies.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Birth control pills have been on the market since 1960, and today, 43 ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nyears later, they are covered by only one-third of health insurance ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npolicies.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  So, most insurance policies pay for Viagra. But most of them don't ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npay for prescription contraceptives that prevent unintentional ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npregnancies and abortions.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  This isn't fair, and it isn't even cost-effective, because most ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ninsurance policies do cover sterilization and abortion procedures. In ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nother words, they won't pay for the pills that could prevent an ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nabortion . . . but they will pay for the procedure itself, which is ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmuch more costly.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, which has provided ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncontraceptive coverage for several years, shows that adding such ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncoverage does not make the plan more expensive.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  In December 2000, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nEEOC, ruled that an employer's failure to include insurance coverage ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfor prescription contraceptives, when other prescription drugs and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndevices are covered, constitutes unlawful sex discrimination under ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  On June 12, 2001, a Federal district court in Seattle made the same ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfinding in the case of Erickson vs. Bartell Drug Company.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  These decisions confirm that we have know all along; contraceptive ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncoverage is a matter of equity and fairness for women.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  We are not asking for special treatment of contraceptives--only ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nequitable treatment within the context of an existing prescription drug ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbenefit.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  This legislation is right because it's fair to women.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  It's right because it will prevent unintended pregnancies, a goal we ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nall share.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  And it's right because it is more cost-effective than other ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nservices--including abortions, sterilizations and tubal ligations--that ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmost insurance companies routinely cover.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  This is common sense, cost-effective legislation . . . and it is long ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\noverdue.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n                          ____________________ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/15/senate-section/article/S9416-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9416-S9427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONSental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Stevens):ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  S. 1404. A bill to amend the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nAct; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today, I am joined by Senator Stevens in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nintroducing the United States Olympic Committee Reform Act of 2003. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nThis legislation is designed to reform the governance structure of the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nUnited States Olympic Committee, USOC, in response to a series of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nembarrassing events that has beset the USOC and threatened the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\norganization's credibility in the eyes of our athletes, the American ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npeople, and the international sports community.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  While the current mission of the USOC is to ``preserve and promote ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe Olympic ideal as an effective, positive role model that inspires ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nall Americans,'' turmoil within the organization over the past decade ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhas seriously compromised that mission and has amplified significant ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nproblems that exist within its governance structure and culture. By ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfailing to place the organization ahead betrayed the Olympic ideals ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthat they pledged to preserve.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The bill that we are introducing today is the product of three ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhearings held this year by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nand Transportation in response to several USOC scandals and in an ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\neffort to help begin reforming the organization. It also is informed by ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe report of an independent commission requested by the Commerce ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nCommittee to review the USOC, and a review by an internal USOC task ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nforce, both of which were released last month.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The bill would make significant improvements to the governance ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nstructure of the USOC by reducing the size of the current board of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndirectors fromental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n[[Page S9417]]ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n124 to nine members and by creating an assembly of USOC stakeholders. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nUnlike the current duopolistic leadership structure of the USOC, the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nboard would be the primary governing body of the USOC, and it would ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nappoint a chief executive officer to carry out its policies and run its ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nday-to-day operations. As such, the USOC will become a more efficient ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nand effective organization, as well as one with a more logical and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntransparent structure.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  In addition, the bill would maintain the authority of athletes and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nnational governing bodies in the operation of the USOC, require ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nincreased financial transparency, and provide whistle-blower protection ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfor USOC employees. Most importantly, however, this bill would ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nstreamline the organization to allow a larger percentage of USOC ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nrevenues to be dedicated to support amateur athletes. Instead of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsupporting a large and wasteful corporate structure, the reformed USOC ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwill be able to dedicate fewer resources to a small and more effective ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ngoverning body.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  We must be mindful that the Olympic movement is not about people who ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nattach themselves to the USOC for their own benefit. It is a movement ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthat is driven by athletes who dedicate their bodies and souls to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nimproving their God-given talent with the hope of someday realizing ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntheir Olympic dreams. The USOC is an entity entrusted by the American ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npeople with the privilege of being the custodian of these dreams. We ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmust act quickly to ensure that the self-serving agendas of individual ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nUSOC constituencies are no longer paramount to the common objectives of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe organization.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The problems that plague the USOC compromise the organization's ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nability to operate effectively and efficiently and undermine the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncredibility of the organization. I believe this bill would provide ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nrealistic remedial measures to these problems, and I urge my colleagues ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto support its expeditious enactment.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nRecord.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nRecord, as follows:ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n                                S. 1404ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nRodenticide Act to permit the Administrator of the Environmental ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nProtection Agency to register a Canadian pesticide; to the Committee on ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a bipartisan bill ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto remedy a long-standing inequity in pesticide pricing between ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nagricultural chemicals sold in Canada and similar use chemicals sold in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe United States. This pesticide price disparity has caused an undue ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncost burden on our American farmers putting them at a distinct ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndisadvantage when competing in the world grain market.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Currently, American and Canadian farmers use the same chemicals on ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntheir fields; but they are marketed under different labels and sold at ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmuch lower cost north of the border. This bill simply eliminates that ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ninequity by setting up a process that would allow American farmers to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\naccess these lower-priced--but substantively identical--pesticides.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  This legislation would direct the Environmental Protection Agency, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nEPA, upon the request of anyone who can comply with the pesticide ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nregistration requirements of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nRodenticide Act, FIFRA, to register a Canadian pesticide for use in the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nUnited States. This registration would take effect if, after analysis ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nby the EPA, the pesticides are of similar use and composition in both ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncountries. The bill also has provisions to allow EPA to delegate ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nportions of the registration process to individual states with EPA ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhaving the final authority over the process. This is to conserve the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nresources of the EPA and at the same time utilize the expertise of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nState agriculture departments around the country.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The new labels for the chemicals would still be under the strict ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nscrutiny of the Environmental Protection Agency as would their use. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nThis would continue to insure safety in the food supply. Food safety is ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\na top priority for all of us. Chemical safety is a top priority for all ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nof us. This bill keeps those priorities intact.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I have come before the Senate time and again to talk about the hidden ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ninequities of trade. Trade must be fair, and the pricing inequities of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nCanadian and United States similar use pesticides have been a glaring ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nweakness of the free trade initiative. For far too long, American ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfarmers have watched their neighbors to the north apply pesticides that ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nare used in both countries, used on the same crops, and yet Canadian ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nproducers get a price cut.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Our farmers are also concerned that similar use pesticides are being ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nutilized by farmers in Canada to produce wheat, barley, and other ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nagricultural commodities which are subsequently imported and consumed ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nin the United States. They rightfully believe it to be unfair to import ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncommodities produced with agricultural pesticides that are not ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\navailable to U.S. producers. If commodities grown with the use of these ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nCanadian pesticides are deemed safe enough for import and consumption ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nin the United States, why would we make American producers pay 117 ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npercent to 193 percent more in chemical costs to produce the same ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncrops? The current scenario doesn't make sense.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  This bill is not an ending, but a beginning. Hidden trade barriers ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nand schemes riddle the fabric of our trade agreements. We cannot ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncontinue to accept trade practices that on the one hand hamstring ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nAmericans, and on the other hand, unduly promote our competitors. We ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncannot allow our competitors to sell us commodities treated with lower ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npriced chemicals that are used both in Canada and the United States, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntell our consumers that the chemicals used on those commodities are ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nperfectly safe, and yet not give our producers access to those same ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nchemicals at a lower price. This is a classic example of free trade ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ngone bad.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  We ought not accept second best all of the time, and this bill is a ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nstep in bringing American producers back to a level playing field.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nRecord.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nRecord, as follows:ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n                                S. 1406ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide funding for infrastructure investment to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nrestore the United States economy and to enhance the security of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntransportation and environmental facilities throughout the United ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nStates; to the Committee on Financeental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ``Rebuild ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nAmerica Act of 2003,'' a bill to improve our national transportation ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nand water infrastructure and to stimulate economic growth.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  This bill promises to do what the latest tax cut will not: provide an ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nimmediate economic stimulus without increasing the Federal budget ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndeficit. Whereas the President's economic advisors have said that the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nlatest tax cut will create 1.4 million jobs by the end of 2004, at a ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncost of $350 billion, this bill will create as many as 2 million jobs ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nat a tenth the cost.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  These jobs could be created in as little as three months, as the bill ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nis specifically designed to fund transportation and water ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ninfrastructure projects which are ready to go within 90 days.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Not only would those jobs bring some of the 9 million Americans who ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nare unemployed and seeking jobs back into the workforce, it would ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ngenerate long-term economic benefits from the increased productivity of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nour transportation infrastructure.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  This bill will do more to stimulate the economy at less cost than the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntax cut because it is directed squarely at our most urgent needs. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nUnlike the recent tax cut, which largely benefits high income taxpayers ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwho are likely to save any windfall they receive, infrastructure ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nspending is necessarily injected into the economy.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  According to the Department of Transportation, each $1 billion in new ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ninfrastructure investment creates 47,500 new jobs: 26,500 direct jobs ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfor construction workers, engineers, contractors, and other on-site ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nemployees, and 21,000 indirect jobs resulting from the spending ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nassociated with the investment.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  These are jobs our economy desperately needs, particularly in the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntransportation and nonresidential construction sectors, which have been ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhit hard by the recent downturn. While new home construction has ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsustained the homebuilding trades, there are now 715,000 unemployed ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nprivate construction workers, most of whom were laid off due to a ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndownturn in nonresidential building. That represents an 80 percent ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nincrease from three years ago.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  As anyone who has taken a hard look at our transportation needs can ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nattest, federal funding for highways, transit, aviation, high-speed ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nrail, and ports, among other areas, remains inadequate.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Without those funds, we are on the verge of falling behind the rest ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nof the developed world in the quality of our infrastructure. I recently ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nvisited the port of Hong Kong and was amazed by the automated ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntechnology used to process thousands of containers each day with fewer ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nemployees than would be required to move an equivalent amount of cargo ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nat even our most advanced ports.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  And while many countries around the world, including France, China, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nGermany, and Japan, now have operating MAGLEV train systems, the United ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nStates does not have a single demonstration MAGLEV line operating ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nanywhere in the country.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Increasingly, global industry demands a level of efficiency and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nreliability which requires substantial upgrades to existing ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ninfrastructure. In California, where computer and electronic products ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\naccount for 51 percent of the State's manufacturing exports, the trend ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nis toward lighter, higher value shipments. Nationwide, shipments of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbelow 1,000 lbs accounted for 18 percent of total value in 1977, and 32 ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npercent of value in 1997, a dramatic increase.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Those changes put a premium on speed and reliability, without which ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n``just-in-time'' manufacturing and lean inventory controls are ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nimpossible. A company such as Hewlett Packard, which uses Intel ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nprocessors made in California in servers which it assembles in Texas, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmust be able to ship processors without risk of even a 24-hour delay.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  This bill takes a big step toward ensuring that level of speed and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nreliability by dedicating $50 billion to infrastructure upgrades. And I ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmust stress the huge incremental value of that spending in the context ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nof reauthorization of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nCentury, TEA-21, which is expected this year.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Reauthorization of TEA-21 will dedicate more than $250 billion toward ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntransportation projects over the next six years, but even that level of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfunding will only allow us to tread water. Maintenance of existing ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ninfrastructure will consume much of that spending.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  To take one example, the Department of Transportation estimates that ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n$20.6 billion is needed annually to maintain and improve performance of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npublic transit systems alone.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The $50 billion provided by the ``Rebuild America Act'' will go ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbeyond current maintenance and actually improve overall productivity by ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nallowing substantial upgrades to go forward. Specifically, the bill ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nprovides:ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n       $5 billion in additional authority for Federal-aid highway ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     capital investments, drawn from the $19 billion surplus in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     the Highway Trust Fund.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n       $3 billion in transit capital and operating grants, drawn ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     from the surplus in the Highway Trust Fund.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n       $3 billion in airport development projects, including $2 ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     billion in airport improvement program grants to enhance ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     airport safety, efficiency, and capacity.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n       $14 billion of tax-credit high-speed rail bonds for ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     infrastructure construction and the acquisition of rolling ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     stock.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n       $7.5 billion for capital investment in passenger and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     freight rail, including $2.5 billion for Amtrak.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n       $2.5 billion for port security grants to ports and marine ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     facility operators.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n       $11.5 billion for wastewater and drinking water ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     infrastructure, to be administeredental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n[[Page S9422]]ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     through the existing Clean Water State Revolving Fund and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Fund.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n       $1.5 billion to fund investment in currently authorized ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     water resources infrastructure projects.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n       $1.5 billion in grants to economically distressed ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     communities for economic development.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n       $500 million for the repair and alteration of Federal ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n     buildings.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  In my home State of California, the infrastructure needs that could ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbe addressed by this bill are particularly great. Although the just-ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncompleted BART link to San Francisco International Airport is a major ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nachievement, we still remain a long way off from the long-term goal of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nringing the Bay Area with BART stations.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  And despite the recent economic downturn, California's economy ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nremains the engine of much of the country's economic growth, and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nCalifornia's population continues to grow. That puts tremendous demands ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\non our roads, airports, and transit systems, and is one reason why Los ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nAngeles and the San Francisco Bay Area are consistently ranked as the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntop two urban areas in the U.S. with the longest annual delays per ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nrush-hour driver.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  This bill will provide a total of $1.8 billion in new funds for ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nCalifornia transportation and safe drinking water infrastructure, and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmore than $1.5 billion more for high speed and passenger and freight ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nrail. All told, the bill will create well over 100,000 new jobs in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nCalifornia.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  That could bring us farther toward fulfilling one of California's ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmost urgent needs, a high speed rail link from the Bay Area all the way ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsouth to San Diego. Without high speed rail there is little hope of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntaking some of the pressure off of California's over-burdened highways ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nand airports.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  In addition to the transportation improvements contemplated by the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbill, I would like to say a few words about the need for additional ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfunds for port security and clean drinking water.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Since the attacks of September 11 it has become clear that our ports ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nshould be one of the first lines of defense against attempts to bring ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nweapons of mass destruction into this country. And yet the funds we ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhave dedicated to securing our ports have been woefully inadequate.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Last year I introduced comprehensive legislation to improve security ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nat our ports, and to inspect more of the 16 million containers which ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncome through those ports each year. Currently, only one to two percent ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nof those containers are inspected, and the possibility of a dirty bomb ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nor nuclear device being shipped in via container remains alarmingly ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nreal.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  This bill provides an additional $2.5 billion for port security, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwhich would go some of the way toward meeting the $6 billion in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nexpenses the Coast Guard anticipates over the next 10 years for ports ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto comply with security standards imposed under the Maritime ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nTransportation Security Act.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  With respect to clean drinking water, a very different, but equally ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nimportant, priority, this bill provides $11.5 billion for wastewater ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nand drinking water infrastructure investment. That funding is important ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbecause the Administration continues to insist on funding cuts for the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nClean Water and Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Funds.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Even level funding will not allow us to upgrade existing water ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntreatment facilities, many of which were built in the 1970s, when the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfederal government first began to take a major role in the construction ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nof drinking water infrastructure. Many of those facilities will require ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsubstantial improvements and overhauls over the next two decades as ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npipes and equipment fall into disrepair.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  In the West, the magnitude of water supply contamination by ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nperchlorate, a chemical used in rocket fuel, has only recently become ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\napparent. The costs of cleaning up perchlorate in California alone will ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nlikely stretch into the billions of dollars, and some of those funds ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmust come from the Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, which ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwould receive $1.5 billion under this bill.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  With the Federal budget deficit certain to top $400 billion this ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nyear, and with the gross federal debt projected to increase by over $5 ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntrillion by 2013, there is a real question as to where these funds will ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncome from.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I am glad to say, therefore, that this bill is fully offset and would ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nnot add at all to our deficit. The bill uses three offsets to recoup ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe $34 billion cost of the bill, two of which are designed to limit ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncorporate fraud, and the last of which extends customs user fees.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The bulk of the funds used to offset the bill are generated by ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nlimiting the ability of large corporations to shelter income from ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntaxation. A recent report by the Joint Economic Committee on corporate ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfraud at the Enron Corporation speaks to the magnitude of this problem.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  For several years Enron reported huge profits to its shareholders, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwhile reporting little or no taxable income to the IRS. We now know ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthat Enron executives treated their tax division as a for-profit entity ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwithin the company and set annual revenue targets for the division.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Between 1996 and 1999, Enron reported aggregate profits of $2.1 ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbillion on its income statement, while claiming aggregate losses, for ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntax purposes, of $3 billion. Some of that gap can be explained by the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmassive tax deductions Enron took for employee stock deductions, and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe rest stemmed from the closely guarded tax-shelter transactions ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndesigned for the company by banks, accountants, and legal firms.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  This bill closes those Enron-specific loopholes, but also strengthens ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\na very simple provision which will have a big impact on shutting down ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfuture loopholes.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The so-called ``Economic Substance Doctrine'' imposed by the bill ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nstates that any transaction which has no material economic impact on ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe business of the company, but which is purely designed for the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npurpose of tax avoidance, shall be disallowed for tax purposes.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  That will allow enhance the ability of tax courts to crack down on ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncompanies that engage in off balance sheet transactions, artificial ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nincome shifting, uneconomic financing transactions, and other tax ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\navoidance schemes which are not designed to provide any profit to the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncompany beyond a tax savings.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  In the same vein, the bill puts an end to the practice of setting up ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncorporate headquarters offshore in order to avoid corporate taxes at ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhome. This practice is not only blatantly unpatriotic, but also creates ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nan imbalanced playing field for companies that abide by the spirit of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe law but are forced to compete with firms that don't.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  This bill will require such corporate expatriates to continue to pay ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nU.S. taxes even if they move abroad. All told, these provisions fully ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\noffset the cost of the infrastructure improvements included in the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbill.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Just about any American you talk to will tell you that our economy is ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nnot in good shape. A quick look at the front page of newspapers shows ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthat our stock markets remain well below their 2000 high, that more ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npeople face long-term unemployment than at any time in the past two ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndecades, and that businesses are not making new investments.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The tax cut which was recently signed into law is the wrong medicine ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfor our economy, and will do little to reverse our current course. In ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfact, it may well increase uncertainty and act as a long-term drag on ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe economy by increasing the federal debt and putting pressure on ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nlong-term interest rates.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill as a much better means of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nstimulating economic growth, and one which will pay long-term dividends ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nin terms of improved roads, railways, and water treatment facilities.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Rather than simply hand down a burden of debt to our children and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ngrand-children, this bill would create a lasting legacy of modern ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ninfrastructure for their benefit.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n                                 ______ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Grassley, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n        and Mr. Daschle):ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  S. 1410.

For some of these patients, non-conventional ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntreatments could offer much needed relief. Thousands of other Americans ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nlive with potentially fatal diseases that are unresponsive to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntraditional medical treatments. Increasing the options for treatment by ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nutilizing unconventional therapy could provide newfound hope for ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nlifesaving results.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  AMTA addresses limits placed on unconventional medical care and would ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nallow Americans access to many promising, even proven, treatments that ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nare currently restricted. For example, the bill would lift some ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nrestrictions on treatments that have been approved and used in other ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncountries. The bill would also allow access for many additional ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npatients to drugs or therapies otherwise available through the Food and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nDrug Administration, FDA, human clinical trials.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  This legislation establishes parameters for the use of such non-ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nconventional therapies. A health care practitioner may provide the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmedical treatment requested by a patient under certain guidelines. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nFirst, the health care practitioner must personally examine the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npatient, the treatment must be within the practitioner's appropriate ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nrange of practice, it must not violate any existing licensing laws, and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe treatment must comply with the Controlled Substances Act. Next, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthere must be no reason for the practitioner to conclude that the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntreatment will cause danger to the patient. The patient must be ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ninformed, in writing, of the contents and methods of treatment, its ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npossible side effects, anticipated benefits, results of prior use of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntreatment on other patients, and any other information necessary to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfully meet the requirements for informed consent of human subjects in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nFDA regulations.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I believe we have some of the best medicine, technology, and health ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncare providers in the United States. However, there are vast amounts of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ninformation yet to be learned on disease and treatment. We must not ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nallow ourselves to be exclusively, perhaps, myopically, focused on ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntraditional forms of treatment when some Americans find no relief from ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthem. Those with debilitating pain and disease should have access to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nnew options for relief, especially when conventional treatments fail.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  We owe it to the American people to engage in this crucial discussion ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\non access to non-conventional forms of medical treatments. There are ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmany questions that need to be addressed. We must begin to address them ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nby exploring the new and innovative forms of therapy that exist, and by ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nengaging in an educated dialogue on this issue.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n                                 ______ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Chafee):ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  S. 1411. A bill to establish a National Housing Trust Fund in the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nTreasury of the United States to provide for the development of decent, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsafe, and affordable housing for low-income families, and for other ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, our Nation is facing an affordable housing ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncrisis. Recent changes in the housing market have limited the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\navailability of affordable rental housing across the country and have ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndramatically increased the cost of those that remain. More families are ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nforced to pay more than 50 percent of their income for housing at a ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntime when Federal spending on housing programs are under attack. That ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nis why, along with Senator Chafee, I am again proposing to address the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsevere shortage of affordable housing by introducing legislation that ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwill establish a National Affordable Housing Trust Fund and begin a ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nrental housing production program.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The Affordable Housing Trust Fund that is established in this ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nlegislation would create a production program that will ensure 1.5 ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmillion new rental units are built over the next 10 years for extremely ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nlow-income families and working families. The goal is to create long-ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nterm affordable, mixed-income developments in areas with the greatest ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nopportunities for low-income families. Seventy-five percent of Trust ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nFund assistance will be awarded, based on need, through matching grants ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto States and local jurisdictions. The States and local jurisdictions ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwill allocate funds on a competitive basis to projects that meet ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nFederal requirements, such as mixed-income projects and long-term ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\naffordability, and that address local needs. The remainder of the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfunding will be competitively awarded by the Department of Housing and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nUrban Development, HUD, to intermediaries, such as the Enterprise ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nFoundation, which will be required to leverage private funds. A portion ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nof the Trust Fund will be used to promote home ownership activities for ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nlow-income Americans.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The Trust Fund would be paid for out of surplus revenue generated by ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe Federal Housing Administration and Government National Mortgage ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nAdministration after ensuring their fiscal safety and soundness. These ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nFederal housing programs generate billions of dollars in excess income, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwhich currently goes to the general Treasury for use on other Federal ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npriorities. It is time to stop taking housing money out of housing ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nprograms. These excess funds should be used to help alleviate the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncurrent housing crisis. According to current projections, approximately ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n$28 billion will be available for the Trust Fund between now and 2008.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The need for affordable housing is severe. Many working families have ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbeen unable to keep up with the increase in housing costs. Today, for ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmany low-income families and their children, the cost of privately ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nowned rental housing is simply out of reach. According to the National ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nHousing Conference, more than 14 million families spent over half of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntheir income on housing in 2001. Today, working families in this ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncountry increasingly find themselves unable to afford housing. A person ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntrying to live in Boston would have to make more than $35,000 annually, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\njust to afford a two-bedroom apartment. This means teachers, janitors, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsocial workers, police officers and other full-time workers may have ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntrouble affording even a modest two-bedroom apartment.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The cost of rental housing keeps going up. According to the Consumer ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nPrice Index, CPI, contract rents began to rise above the rate of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ninflation in 1997 and have continued every year since. Rental costs ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhave outpaced renter income gains for households across the board. Low ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwage workers have been hardest hit by the increase in cost of rental ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhousing.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Because of the lack of affordable housing, too many families are ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nforced to live in substandard living conditions putting their children ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nat risk. Children living in substandard housing are more likely to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nexperience violence, hunger, lead poisoning and to suffer from ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ninfectious diseases such as asthma. They are more likely to have ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndifficulties learning and more likely to fall behind in school. Our ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nNation's children depend upon access to affordable rental housing.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  At the same time the cost of rental housing has been increasing, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthere has been a significant decrease in affordable rental housing ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nunits. More than 1.8 million affordable housing units have been ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndemolished over the past decade. Making matters worse, many current ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\naffordable housing providers are deciding to opt-out of their Section 8 ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncontracts or are prepaying their HUD-insured mortgages. These decisions ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhave further limited the availability of affordable housing across the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncountry. Many more providers will be able to opt-out of their Section 8 ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncontracts in the next few years, further limiting the availability of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\naffordable housing in our nation. The current decline has already ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nforced many working families eligible for Section 8 vouchers in Boston ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto live outside the city because there are no available rental housing ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nunits which accept vouchers.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The loss of affordable housing has exacerbated the housing crisis in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthis country, and the Federal Government must take action. We have the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nresources, yet we are not devoting these resources to fix the problem. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nDespite the fact that more families are unable to afford housing and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthere are fewer affordable rental housing units, we have decreased ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nFederal spending on critical housing programs. Between 1978 and 1995, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe number of households receiving Federal housing assistance was ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nincreased by almost 3 million. From 1978 through 1984, an additional ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n230,000 families received Federal housing assistance each year. This ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nnumber dropped significantly to 126,000 additional households each year ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfrom 1985 through 1995.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n[[Page S9424]]ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  In 1996, this nation's housing policy went all the way back to square ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\none-- not only was there no increase in families receiving housing ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nassistance, but the number of assisted units actually decreased. From ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n1996 to 1998, the number of HUD assisted households dropped by 51,000.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  During this time of rising rents, increased housing costs, and the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nloss of affordable housing units, it is incomprehensible that we are ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nnot doing more to increase the amount of housing assistance available ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto working families. Yet in the face of these critical housing problems ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nand the effect it has on our children, the Bush Administration is ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nworking to dismantle many federal programs that help Americans find ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\naffordable housing. The Bush Administration has proposed to block grant ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe Section 8 Voucher program, which I believe will reduce the number ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nof families with children eligible for Federal housing assistance and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nincrease housing costs for those families who remain. A recent Center ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\non Budget and Policy Priorities study that shows President Bush's ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfiscal year 2004 budget request is inadequate to fund all Section 8 ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhousing vouchers needed in fiscal year 2004. Specifically, the lack of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfunding in the voucher program request means that approximately 184,000 ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nvouchers now in use serving low-income families will not be funded. In ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nMassachusetts, this would mean a reduction of more than 6,000 vouchers ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nor nearly ten percent of the vouchers projected to be in use in October ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n2003. If the President's request is enacted into law, the Center on ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nBudget and Policy Priorities believes that it is likely that some ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfamilies that now rely on vouchers to help pay their rent will lose ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nassistance, placing these families at high risk of eviction and, in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsome cases, homelessness. President Bush's fiscal year 2004 budget ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nrequest also proposes cutting an additional $2.45 billion from existing ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhousing programs and eliminating the HOPE VI program, which has helped ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nrevitalize neighborhoods around the country. These cuts come on top of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nan earlier Bush Administration action to abolish the Public Housing ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nDrug Elimination Grant program.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The Bush Administration changes in Federal housing programs mean that ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe Commonwealth of Massachusetts and many other States will likely ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nreceive a reduction in Federal housing funds in fiscal year 2004. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nAlmost every State is facing serious budget deficits and are forced to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndramatically increase spending on homeland security. Additional funds ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nare not available to make up the decline in Federal spending. The ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfuture is even bleaker. These reductions at HUD follow the enactment of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntwo separate tax cuts, which primarily benefit the wealthiest in our ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsociety, that will make it almost impossible for any significant ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nincreases in the HUD's budget over the next decade. We need to bring ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhousing resources back to where they belong. The National Affordable ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nHousing Trust Fund will provide desperately needed funds to begin ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nproduction of affordable housing in the United States. Enacting the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nHousing Trust Fund legislation is an important step in the right ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndirection to add resources to housing and to help begin producing ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhousing again.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  We can no longer ignore the shortage of affordable housing in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nAmerica, and the impact it is having on families and children around ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe country. It is still unclear to me why this lack of housing has not ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncaused more uproar. How many families are to be pushed out of their ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhomes and into the streets, before action is taken. I believe it is ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntime for our nation to take a new path--one that ensures that all ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nAmericans, especially our children, has the opportunity to live in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndecent, affordable and safe housing. Everyone knows that decent ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhousing, along with neighborhood and living environment, play enormous ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nroles in shaping young lives. Federal housing assistance, has assisted ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmillions of low-income children across the nation and has helped ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndevelop stable home environments. However, too many children still live ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nin families that have substandard housing or are homeless. These ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nchildren are less likely to do well in school and less likely to be ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nproductive citizens. Because of the positive effect that this ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nlegislation would have on America's children, the Trust Fund was ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nincluded in the Act to Leave No Child Behind, a comprehensive proposal ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nby the Children's Defense Fund to assist in the development of our ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nnation's children.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I urge you to support this legislation to restore our commitment to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nprovide affordable housing for all families.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nalong with Mr. Levin, that would stop the implementation of a new ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nMetropolitan Statistical Area, MSA, in the Michigan counties of Kent, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nOttawa, Muskegon, and Allegan, KOMA.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  On June 6, 2003, the Office of Management and Budget issued its ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nBulletin No. 03-04 on Revised Definition of Metropolitan Statistical ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nAreas, New Definitions of Micropolitan Statistical Areas, and Combined ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nStatistical Areas, and Guidance on the Use of the Statistical ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nDefinitions in These Areas.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  This bulletin finalizes a process that began with the last census. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nStatistical areas, as explained by the OMB, are designed solely for ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nstatistical purposes. As stated in the bulletin, they are designed to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n``provide nationally consistent definitions in collecting, tabulating, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nand publishing Federal statistics for a set of geographic areas.'' The ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nproblem is that the are used for much more than that. They are ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nprincipal tool for allocating Federal dollars. And, although OMB ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nrecognizes this, it will ``not take into account or attempt to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nanticipate any nonstatistical uses that may be made of the MSAs.''ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  This is a serious problem. On one hand, we are implementing new MSAs ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto serve basic statistical purposes. On the other hand, these new MSAs ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nare critical for the allocation of Federal money and OMB does not ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nconsider, in the least bit, how these new MSAs may negatively or ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npositively affect communities. It is easy for OMB staff to say that ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntheir hands are tied by rules and strict methodologies, but this is not ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nabout number-crunching. This is about real dollars for Michigan.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I have heard from numerous constituents in West Michigan who are ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nconcerned about how these new statistical, designations will affect ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nMedicaid and Medicare payments, Housing and Urban Development grants, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nCommunity Development Block Grants, and other important programs in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nMichigan. I share these concerns and want to make sure that we do not ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nallow a new system of Federal dollar allocations to come into effect ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthat would hurt West Michigan. We need time to study the impact of the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nnew MSAs. That is why I am offering legislation to stay the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nimplementation of the new West Michigan MSAs until October 1, 2004, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nleaving the current Kent-Ottawa-Muskegon-Allegan, KOMA, MSA in place.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The KOMA region has developed a common identity over the last decade. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nIt shares regional challenges such as tourism, transportation networks, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nenvironmental protection, and community health. Business leaders have ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nworked hard to market the region as a common community with much to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\noffer potential new businesses and families looking to relocate. I do ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nnot want these leaders to lose this marketing tool. By the OMB setting ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nup a new MSA with no consideration of the economic and social ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nintegration of the existing MSA, we could see the undermining of a ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ngreat deal of progress for this part of Michigan.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  We, in Congress, should eventually look at this issue of MSAs ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncomprehensively. We should ensure that communities do not have to fact ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthis uncertainty every decade with a new census. We should either ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nensure that the OMB takes into account economic and other community ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nconcerns when creating MSAs or we should make sure that Federal funding ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nallocations are not made through MSAs. Regardless, in the short run, it ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nis essential that the hospitals, the community development ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\norganizations, the business leaders, and the social service providers ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nof West Michigan who are raising these concerns with me have time to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nstudy the problem and understand the impact of OMB's decision.

Mr. President, today I am introducing the California ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nAffordable Quantity and Quality Water Act of 2003, CAL-AQQWA.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Nowhere is the need for a comprehensive water policy that includes ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ninnovative recycling and reuse principles more urgently felt than in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nCalifornia. Water agencies and elected officials throughout the State ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nare constantly planning, and struggling, to balance California's ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nagricultural, municipal, industrial and environmental water needs.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  This challenge becomes all the more acute in the face of the State's ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndeclining Colorado River surplus allocation and growing population. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nCalifornia is facing an annual loss of about 800,000 acre feet from the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nColorado River. And population forecasts project an additional 15 ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmillion residents in California over the next 20 years.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Unfortunately, funding to pursue and implement much-needed, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nenvironmentally beneficial water infrastructure projects is not readily ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\navailable, and many good water management ideas are left languishing on ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe shelf. CAL-AQQWA can help move many of these ideas forward and into ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nproduction.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  There are two sections in this bill. The first section authorizes ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nexpedited feasibility studies for 22 water projects in California. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nFunding priority would be given to projects that would provide ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nenvironmental and other benefits. Costs for these studies would be ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nshared between the local sponsors and the Federal Government.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Studies in this bill explore a variety of innovative water supply ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nstrategies, including groundwater recharge; recycled water distribution ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfor landscaping, wetlands restoration, agricultural use, industrial ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nuse, and general irrigation; surface water storage alternatives; ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ngroundwater storage; desalination; conservation; and groundwater ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndemineralization. If fully implemented, these water projects may ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nprovide up to 630,000 acre feet of water per year in California. These ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nadditional acre feet would allow local authorities to decrease their ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ndependence on imported water sources.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The second section of this bill increases funding for the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency's Conservation Grant programs, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nincluding $2 billion in fiscal year 2004 for the drinking water state ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nrevolving loan program. EPA conservation grants provide funding for ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmeasures that include: urban conservation, low-flow toilets, water ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmeter installation or retrofit, desalination projects, wastewater ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ntreatment system upgrades for compliance with Clean Water Act ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nrequirements, and groundwater recharge facilities projects.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Water agencies and local officials throughout California are ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nconstantly struggling to meet all of our state's water needs. My hope ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nis that this legislation will bring us closer to meeting the challenges ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfacing our growing population by studying and expanding the proven ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbenefits of water conservation and recycling.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Let me conclude by noting that seven of the studies in the bill would ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbe conducted by the Army Corps of Engineers. I support moving forward ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwith additional Corps studies. But I also recognize we need to reform ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe Corps. As part of any reform effort for the Corps, I would like to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsee that costly or controversial Corps projects be subject to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nindependent review; that any environmental harm caused by Corps ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nprojects be fully mitigated in a timely manner; that the public will ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhave access to the information necessary to fully participate in the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nCorps' planning process; that the Corps' procedures for determining ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nproject costs and benefits will be modernized; and that Corps projects ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwill be designed and operated in a manner that protects our precious ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nnatural resources.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I encourage my colleagues to take a close look at this bill, and I ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nask for their support.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n                                 ______ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Miller, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Craig, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n        Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n        Burns, Mr. Sununu, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Allen, Mr. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n        Stevens, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Graham of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n        South Carolina, and Mr. Crapo):ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  S. 1414.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the District of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nColumbia Personal Protection Act. This is an extremely important piece ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nof legislation. Most importantly, this bill goes a long way toward ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nrestoring the constitutionally guaranteed right of Americans who reside ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nin the District of Columbia to possess firearms.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  It is no secret that the District of Columbia, our great Nation's ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nCapital, suffers from the most startling violent crime rates in the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncountry. It has the highest, the absolute highest, murder rate per ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncapita in the country. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nand despite the most stringent gun control laws in the country, in 8 ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nout of the 9 years between 1994 and 2002, Washington DC had the highest ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmurder rate in the country. In fact, the results are in for 2002, and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nunfortunately they continue to paint a grim picture. The District of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nColumbia has again reclaimed its rather unenviable title as the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n``Murder Capital of the United States''.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  It is time, to restore the rights of law-abiding citizens to protect ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthemselves and to defend their families against murderous predators. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nAll to often, we read in the paper about yet another vicious murder ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncarried out against an innocent District of Columbia resident. Try to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nimagine the horror that the victim felt when he faced a gun-toting ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncriminal and could not legally reach for a firearm to protect himself. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nWe must act now to stop the carnage and put law-abiding citizens in a ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nposition to exercise their right to self defense. It is time to tell ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe citizens of the District of Columbia that the Second Amendment of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe Constitution applies to them, and not only to their fellow ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nAmericans in the rest of the country. The District of Columbia Personal ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nProtection Act would do exactly that.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Let me take a moment to highlight what this legislation would do. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nThis bill would: 1. permit law-abiding citizens to possess handguns and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nrifles in their homes and businesses; 2. repeal the registration ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nrequirements for firearms and ammunition; 3. eliminate criminal ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npenalties for possession and carrying of firearms in their homes and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbusinesses; and 4. correct an erroneous provision which wrongly treats ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsome firearms as if they were machineguns.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Over the years, I have heard over and over again from some of my ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfriends on the other side of the aisle that the way you reduce violent, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ngun-related crime is by prohibiting the possession of firearms. Even if ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nlaw-abiding citizens are prohibited from possessing firearms, my ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nliberal friends argue, it is a small price to pay for safety and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsecurity.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Well, I want to take this opportunity to dispel these unfounded ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmyths. These myths, I might add, are exposed as such by situations like ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwe have today in the District of Columbia. I have said it before, but I ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwill say it again, excessive regulation and the systematic erosion of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe rights guaranteed by the Second Amendment do not deter violent, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ngun-toting criminals. Enacting and vigorously enforcing stiff penalties ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfor those that commit crimes with guns deters violent crime. Not only ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nis this the proven and effective approach to reducing gun violence, it ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nalso preserves the constitutionally guaranteed rights of law-abiding ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmen and women to own and possess firearms.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  In fact, I recently held a hearing that examined the Administration's ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ngun crime reduction initiative, Project Safe Neighborhoods. This ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ninitiative has been incredibly successful. It takes the precise ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\napproach that I have advocated--strict and vigorous enforcement of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncrimes committed with guns. It says to criminals, ``If you use a gun ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nduring the commission of a crime, you will do very serious and very ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhard time.'' And it does so, without trampling on theental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n[[Page S9426]]ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nrights of law-abiding American men and women.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Today, unfortunately but not surprisingly, the state of affairs in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe District of Columbia has highlighted exactly what those of us who ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncare deeply about the Second Amendment of the Constitution have always ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfeared: murderous criminals possess firearms and are free to prey upon ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nlaw-abiding citizens; and law-abiding citizens--precisely because they ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nare law-abiding citizens--may not possess a firearm in their homes to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nprotect themselves and their families.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The prohibition of firearms in the District of Columbia is as ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nineffective and deplorable as it is unconstitutional; it is high-time ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwe rectify this wrong.

It is long past time, and the very least that we can do to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npay tribute to her in this small but lasting way.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Barbara's life of public service came as no surprise to those of us ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwho knew her and her family--the first family of Connecticut politics, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nI might add. Her father, John M. Bailey, was one of the all time great ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npolitical legends of our State--a powerful political leader, confidante ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nof John F. Kennedy, and Democratic Party chairman under Presidents ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nKennedy and Johnson. I devoted the better half of my senior year at ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nYale to the study of Bailey and wrote my senior thesis, later turned ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ninto a book, on his brilliant and sophisticated use of political power. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nBarbara's mother was active in Democratic politics long after the death ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nof her husband in 1975, her brother Jack served as the chief state ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nattorney in Connecticut, and her late husband Jim was a Speaker of the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nConnecticut House. Politics has been in Barbara's bones practically ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfrom the time she was born.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  She once told a newspaper that politics didn't ``come naturally, but ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncertainly it's a lot easier when you see members of your family doing ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nit. Obviously I was watching my father all the time and learning ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthrough osmosis.''ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  She had good instructors and she learned well. After serving on the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nHartford City Council and as Connecticut's Secretary of State, Barbara ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwas elected to Congress in 1982 and served with distinction until 1999, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwhen she answered her party's call to run for governor.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Like her father, she was a hard-driving and skilled tactician in the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nHouse, working the back corridors of politics and shunning the bright ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nlights of the modern media ever in search of a nine-second sound bite.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  She was an insider, a loyal Member of the House leadership, and a ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ngolf partner to the likes of Danny Rostenkowski. She rose in through ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe party ranks making few enemies, seeking consensus, playing fair, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nand gathering strength one vote at a time.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Through the 1980s and 1990s, she was one of the more powerful women ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nin the Congress--part feminist hero, part backroom pol. She had a knack ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfor getting along with the good old boys even as she pushed the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nboundaries for women's rights.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  In 1984, she was thrilled to be chosen to nominate Geraldine Ferraro ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nas the first woman Vice Presidential candidate on a Democratic ticket. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nYearsental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n[[Page S9427]]ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nafterward, Barbara said that moment was one of the high points of her ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncareer. But there would be many others. In her second term, House ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nSpeaker Tip O'Neill recognized her ability and appointed her to serve ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\non the prestigious tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, a committee ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmost members wait years to join. She also became the first woman member ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nof the House Intelligence Committee. And in 1991, she became the first ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwoman to join the House leadership as a chief deputy whip.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  We miss her strong presence and her wise counsel here in Congress but ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nare grateful for her continuing work on behalf of seniors as the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nPresident of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nMedicare.

We authored the Bulletproof Vest Grant Partnership Act of ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n1998 in response to the tragic Carl Drega shootout in 1997 on the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nVermont-New Hampshire border, in which two State troopers who did not ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nhave bulletproof vests were killed. The Federal officers who responded ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto the scenes of the shooting spree were equipped with lifesaving body ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\narmor, but the State and local law enforcement officers lacked ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nprotective vests because of the cost.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Two years later, we successfully passed the Bulletproof Vest ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nPartnership Grant Act of 2000, and I hope we will go three-for-three ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthis time around. Senator Campbell brings to our effort invaluable ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nexperience in this area and during his time in the Senate he has been a ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nleader in the area of law enforcement.

Since its inception in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n1999, this highly successful Department of Justice program has provided ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nlaw enforcement officers in 16,000 jurisdictions nationwide with nearly ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n350,000 new bulletproof vests. In Vermont, 148 municipalities have been ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nfortunate to receive funding for the purchase of almost 1200 vests. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nWithout the federal funding given by this program, I daresay that there ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwould be close to that number of police officers without vests in ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nVermont today.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2003 will further the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsuccess of the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program by re-ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nauthorizing the program through fiscal year 2007. Our legislation would ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\ncontinue the Federal-State partnership by authorizing up to $50 million ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nper year for matching grants to State and local law enforcement ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nagencies and Indian tribes at the Department of Justice to buy body ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\narmor.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Not only should we reauthorize this program, but also we should work ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nto see that it is fully funded. While the Bulletproof Vest Partnership ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nProgram funding has been consistently authorized at $50 million per ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nyear, that amount gets whacked in half during the appropriations ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nprocess. Law enforcement agencies, however, clearly need our help to ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npurchase vests--for the current fiscal year, the Bulletproof Vest ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nPartnership office received funding requests from small jurisdictions, ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nwith populations under 100,000, totaling $59 million--more than double ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe funds appropriated. The authorizing legislation requires that ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nsmaller jurisdictions receive priority funding through this program. ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nThose requests consumed the entire amount of funds available and for ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthe first time ever awards could only be made to small jurisdictions.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  We know that body armor saves lives, but the cost has put these vests ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nout of the reach of many of the officers who need them. This program ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nmakes it more affordable for police departments of all sizes. Few ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthings mean more to me than when I meet Vermont police officers and ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nthey tell me that the protective vests they wear were made possible ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbecause of this program. This is the least we should do for the ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nofficers on the front lines who put themselves in danger for us every ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nday. I want to make sure that every police officer who needs a ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nbulletproof vest gets one.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  I look forward to Senate passage today of the bipartisan Bulletproof ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nVest Partnership Grant Act, and I hope the House and the President will ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\npromptly act on this lifesaving legislation to help better to protect ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\nour law enforcement officers.ental holdings1Total= 000>\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.
